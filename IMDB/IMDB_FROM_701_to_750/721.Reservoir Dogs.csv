0,MartinHafer,Warning: This film is NOT for everyone...even though it is brilliant.,9,28 March 2010,"It's hard to imagine that anyone has NOT heard that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an ultra-violent film, but just in case you haven't, please understand that this is a super-duper ultra-violent film--and a film that many, many out there will find too difficult to watch or will traumatize you. I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.Now, despite this intense warning, I greatly respect the film--especially since it was made for next to nothing and without the big studio money. Despite its violence, the film is very smartly written, directed and acted. Quentin Tarantino was able to assemble a rather amazing cast of bad-boy actors--and in many, many ways is a modern version of film noir. And, to give the film that cache, he managed to get a great noir character actor, Lawrence Tierney (in real life a total nut) to give the film an air of menace and class.Because so much on IMDb has already been written about this film and because it's in the IMDb Top 250, there just isn't a great need to discuss the film at length. Suffice to say that it is bloody, full of obscenities and extreme violence (though, to his credit, Tarantino did on many occasions make the actual violence occur off-camera). And, it's brilliant--with a great ending (full of vagueness and a noir-like downbeat ending) and is sure to please the right audience.",Reservoir Dogs
1,TheLittleSongbird,A must see,10,9 December 2010,"Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Reservoir Dogs
2,Leofwine_draca,The epitome of style and coolness,9,30 October 2016,"Quentin Tarantino's powerfully compelling heist movie is one that is both shockingly violence and compulsively funny. Suddenly appearing out of nowhere, this low-budget masterpiece caused an uproar in Britain with the moral guardians who were determined that the bloodshed should not be seen by weak-willed individuals living in this country. Thankfully they failed, which is why this video is now available in the UK in an uncut, uncensored film.Tarantino elicits funny, likable performances from his seasoned and fresh-faced actors. By setting the movie in one location for the entire film and playing the thing in real time, he ups the tension and suspense in the same way TWELVE ANGRY MEN utilised the idea. Harvey Keitel lends his weighty presence to the film as a tough, loyal gangster who believes in ""honour among thieves"". Keitel evokes sympathy and remains likable, even when he needlessly blasts two cops to death. The turnaround at the climax where he realises he has been betrayed is wonderful, Keitel sobbing and moaning uncontrollably as cops surround him and he realises he's finished. Tim Roth makes it to the mainstream with his wounded gangster who lies bleeding to death on a ramp for the entire film, a funny yet depressing performance.However, these two aren't alone; new actors Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi are the guys who would perhaps make the biggest impressions. Madsen's coldly sadistic psychopath is not totally irredeemable, making his character a difficult one to get a grasp on. He's definitely frightening during a hard-to-watch torture sequence where he cuts off a cop's ear, yet he makes this scene funny too. Madsen never repeated the brilliance he showed here, instead wasting his talent in schlock like SPECIES and EXECUTIVE TARGET. Steve Buscemi plays a whinging creep which would later become his stock trade (check out FARGO, for instance). Buscemi is probably the most likable character of them all, and his off screen death is hilarious.The violence level is high but not as high as you might imagine, from the hype. Aside from the aforementioned torture, we just get lots of people being shot up a lot and bleeding a lot too. Tarantino throws in some choice '70s music and lots of black comedy. This was a film which inspired many similar heist movies but which was never beaten. Definitely the director's best so far, and perhaps one of the slyest, wittiest low-budget films ever made. The epitome of style and coolness.",Reservoir Dogs
3,SnoopyStyle,Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie,8,3 January 2016,A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.,Reservoir Dogs
4,Hitchcoc,Pardon Me While I Bleed!,9,28 January 2010,"I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is ""the scene."" I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, ""neatly"" isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end. Despite the huge amount of violence, I can see why people gravitate toward this film.",Reservoir Dogs
5,nogodnomasters,STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU,10,29 May 2019,"This is a violent bloody film about a diamond robbery gone bad. They suspect a rat in the group, but who? Having missed the film when it came out, I had to watch it since so many other films have imitated scenes from it. From that point of view, this is a must see, just so one can appreciate other modern films.The ten year two disc special includes 3 deleted scenes which I felt should have been added as it aided with the character of Mr. Orange, and his knowledge of Mr. White. This helps explain their relationship. It also included 2 alternative ear removal scenes, the second one being graphic, except the ear looked like rubber which is why it was omitted.The film made great use of 70's music, my favorite part of the film. Thank you Mr. Wright.Most of the film consists of dialog spoken inside a warehouse with fake blood being the main special effect. It costs nothing to make a 5 star film if you have the right people and script.Tarantino film: Violent, bloody, F-bombs, and flashbacks.",Reservoir Dogs
6,classicsoncall,"""Alright ramblers, let's get ramblin'.""",9,3 March 2007,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a blast and a half. Quentin Tarantino's non linear method of telling a story keeps one viscerally engaged, almost as if you were really there like a fly on the wall with a direct view of the proceedings. It's a style that works without being confusing, even if you have some misgivings about following the story; and even if you do, a second viewing clears that up completely. Nor is Tarantino concerned about disposing of characters off screen, as he did with Brown (Tarantino himself) and Blue (Eddie Bunker). The technique tends to put even more focus on the surviving characters attempting to come to grips with their situation. As far as that goes, don't even concern yourself with following the Colors, it doesn't make much difference who's Brown, Blue, or Blonde, the players are so fully convincing you'll get wrapped up in their narratives as each contributes to the total package. Then as the pot simmers and comes to a boil, the result is a new kind of gangster film that Bogart and Cagney couldn't even imagine.I wasn't aware of how much a comic book fan Tarantino must be, he helped guest direct 2005's ""Sin City"" of course, but here he peppers his film with Marvel Comic references to the Fantastic Four and The Thing, and a Silver Surfer poster pops up from time to time. It's interesting to see how a pop culture fan integrates his favorites back into the genre, completing a cycle of sorts. As a fan of both mediums, the combination adds another layer of enjoyment to the experience.With a film like this, I can understand that there's really very little ground in the middle for viewers, you're probably either going to love it or hate it. For someone like me who's actually rather conservative, I find that anything Tarantino is involved with to be a unique and action packed joy ride. For a directorial first effort, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an amazing piece of work, lulling you into a comfort zone with the opening diner scene, and then hammering away at your senses until that last fateful gunshot. No need to fill in any blanks here.",Reservoir Dogs
7,gavin6942,Tarantino's Masterpiece,9,2 August 2007,"A group of criminals are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but something goes wrong and all heck breaks loose. To top it off, the ones who escape must face the facts: someone in the team was a rat. But who was it? And what do they do with the cop in the trunk?I think many people consider ""Pulp Fiction"" Tarantino's best film, and I would agree that it's a fine film. But ""Reservoir Dogs"" uses the same formula even earlier, with a tighter script and solid actors (without relying on heavyweights like Bruce Willis). And, I think it's safe to say, this one has created more of a cult following and generates more homages (the walking in unison scene, the cop torture scene, etc.).We definitely get Michael Madsen's best performance here, and a strong Steve Buscemi. Was Madsen good in ""Free Willy""? Sure, but this is his defining role that kept him popular for the next decade. Buscemi always shines, but again he stands out here like he's not allowed to do anywhere else (with the possible exception of ""Ghost World""). Chris Penn (science bless him) and Tim Roth also are wonderful.Tarantino knows how to incorporate music into his movies -- you have to give him that. Taking lost or forgotten songs and making them sound fresh and new. Stealers Wheel was already known for ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" long before Tarantino put it in his movie, but how many of us can now never hear it the same way again? Radio play of the song likely increased, and we're all picturing the same thing...We also see his strong dialog writing skills. This is Tarantino's best skill: dialog. Sometimes this hinders him (some think it dragged down the pace of ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", almost all agree that ""Death Proof"" was too dialog-heavy). But other times it's the driving force. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is largely memorable for it's conversations, such as the Madonna conversation and the tipping conversation. Madsen and Buscemi are very quotable (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?""). ""Pulp Fiction"" steps this up a notch (the watch story, Royale with Cheese, Big Kahuna burger), but the foundation really rests on this movie.If you haven't seen this one, see it. As of this review, it is sitting at the 65th best movie of all time according to Internet Movie Database. I have no reason to deny it that ranking. It might be better, it might be worse -- but it's clearly a strong movie.",Reservoir Dogs
8,lee_eisenberg,You wanna squirm?,7,21 July 2005,"""Pulp Fiction"" had the shot in the car, and the ""Kill Bill"" movies had, well, various death scenes. But ""Reservoir Dogs""...ah, now this one will make your skin crawl. It focuses on a heist gone wrong. That's the most minimal description of the plot. Most of the movie has the various characters trying to figure out who did what. And then, there's the...well, let's just call it the ear scene. You will very likely squirm during that scene.If nothing else, we can say that Quentin Tarantino gave us a preview of his later films. Maybe his later films don't make your skin crawl, but but they all deal with lowlife culture. And you'd better believe that the characters in this movie are lowlifes. If absolutely nothing else, ""Reservoir Dogs"" shows us that violent, gross movies can be masterpieces.",Reservoir Dogs
9,jboothmillard,Reservoir Dogs,10,17 March 2005,"This debut from cult director Quentin Tarantino was very well received, and he was even nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic. The story may be mixed up with the continuing warehouse scene, and flashbacks of each individual group member, but you can give it a chronological order. Basically crime boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) hires six criminals, strangers to each other, gives them false names so they don't get attached to each other and concentrate on job the diamond robbery. They are sure it will go without a hitch, but the police show up and the group members panic, shooting them and some civilians. The police did manage to kill two of them, the others are all getting together, slowly, in the rendezvous point (the warehouse), and begin to suspect that the one member shot, slowly dying, is an undercover cop. Starring Harvey Keitel as Mr. White/Larry Dimmick, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange/Freddy Newandyke, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde/Vic Vega, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Edward Bunker as Mr. Blue and Tarantino as Mr. Brown. The film only had a $1.5m budget, and it took only five weeks to shoot, and it grossed millions worldwide, cool! It was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, for the infamous ear cutting scene with the song ""Stuck In The Middle"" playing (juxtaposition). The other great song of the film is ""Little Green Bag"" when introducing the actors and opening credits. Harvey Keitel was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!",Reservoir Dogs
10,rmax304823,A True Original,7,30 October 2003,"SPOILERS.There's no doubt about Quentin Tarentino's inventiveness. This was a real shocker when I first saw it several years ago. There had been violence before, but never so inexplicable. And gore before, but never gore quite so galore before. And that odd, quirky dialog -- alternately clumsy and adroit. It was obviously done on a small budget but did everything it was supposed to do and more.A second viewing, along with some knowledge of Tarrentino's later work, deprives us of the shock but gives us a better perspective on the movie. A couple of things stand out.One is that Tarrentino is like Howard Hawks in depriving his characters of any background. (That's about all he and Hawks have in common.) There have rarely been such rootless people wandering around on the screen. In this instance, there is a father/son pair, but nobody else has any family, few real friendships except those developed in the course of the narrative. There is no ethnic solidarity. Nobody has a home or a dog. Nobody has a job. Nobody has a girlfriend. These characters are like the ones Shakespeare warned us about, coming out of ""air, thin air.""Another thing is the catholic derivativeness of the story and the scenes. Tarrentino may have made an art movie here but he's gobbled up bits and pieces of every kind of film imaginable, from superior stuff to schlock. The claustrophobic feeling of being cooped up in a warehouse with people you don't know and can't trust, he claims, was borrowed from Carpenter's junk version of ""The Thing."" The moment when everyone is pointing guns at everyone else, waiting for someone to fire first, seems to be from the climactic scene of ""The Wild Bunch."" The exclusive use of pop rock in the score has been done by Scorcese and others. But it's hard to be sure that these are borrowings because, to the extent they are, such borrowings have never seen in such multitudes and so nicely fitted together.The big shootout, of the sort we saw in such detail in ""Heat,"" is mostly off screen here, which saves money and doesn't cost the narrative much since it deals mainly with character and motivation and blood. The violence and the blood that follows can be a problem. The focus isn't on suffering, just pain and fear. People bleed enough to fill a bath tub. And that scene in which the bound cop is mutilated by Michael Madsen is a bit too-well set up and executed -- for me, anyway. And this is despite the fact that we don't know the cop, or any of the other characters really. These scenes are just shivers looking for spines to run up. Grown sadists and kids who don't know anxiety may enjoy it more. Interesting anecdote. In an interview, Tarrentino describes how poor Lawrence Tierney was giving his big speech assigning the names of colors to the robbers -- ""Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink"", and so on. (Borrowed from ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three."") Tierney kept forgetting his lines or blowing them and asking to start again from the top. The other actors were required to sit off screen without moving or changing expression. It took two hours for a satisfactory take. All of the other performers who had been sitting like stone idols all that time went suddenly into spasms of twitching, yawning, scratching, and moaning with relief.",Reservoir Dogs
11,Tweekums,Tarantino's bloody introduction,9,29 September 2016,"Set in the aftermath of a heist that went horribly wrong the surviving gangsters head to the meet-up point in a warehouse. The first two to arrive are 'Mr White' and the seriously injured 'Mr Orange'. Shortly afterwards they are joined by 'Mr Pink' who is convinced that everything went wrong because somebody must have informed the police in advance. He is also far from impressed by 'Mr Blonde's' behaviour during the robbery as he shot several people. Mr Blonde is the next to arrive; along with a policeman he has taken hostage. As we wait for Joe Cabot, the man behind the heist, to arrive the tension rises as they try to find out who told the police. Inevitably they start to turn on each other and eventually guns are drawn.While all this is going on we get a series of flashbacks giving us details of how things got to how they are now. This includes seeing the aftermath of the robbery as they have a shootout with the police and Mr Orange gets shot. We also learn why they have colour coded names.This film certainly won't be for everybody; the violence is brutal and bloody rather than stylised. One scene, where the police officer has his ear cut off, has gone down as one of cinema's most violent moments even though the actual event happens off camera. There is also a lot of swearing and characters use racist epitaphs. If all that doesn't but you off this is a great film; it is tense from start to finish and contains some great dialogue. Before this it was rare for anybody in films to talk about anything unrelated to the plot but here we see the characters having irrelevant conversations that make the characters more real. Tarantino gives the film a great look by having the gangsters dress identically in black suits and ties while a seventies soundtrack plays in the background; this music is cleverly justified by having the local radio station having a 'Sounds of the Seventies' week. The cast are all on top form; Michael Madsen is particularly memorable as the sadistic 'Mr Blonde'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoys heist movies just don't expect a jolly caper.",Reservoir Dogs
12,BA_Harrison,"Sharp direction, sharp dialogue and sharp suits.",9,15 March 2014,"There are two ways one can view a film like Reservoir Dogs (and, indeed, much of Quentin Tarantino's work): a) as an uninspired hodge-podge of ideas blatantly lifted from countless other movies (in this case, a large helping of '80s Hong Kong action thriller City On Fire with countless 'nods' to other crime classics along the way), or b) as an exciting, stylish and highly entertaining exercise in revisionist film-making that sees a bold director mining the work of others to forge a classic of his own.Even though I find description a) applicable to a fair number of QT's films, I cannot help but fall in the latter camp with his debut offering, finding it to be a testament to his deep understanding and appreciation of his medium and his remarkable acuity as both writer and director (he acts in the film too, but two out of three ain't bad, I suppose). In the hands of a lesser film-maker, such an 'homage' would simply be deemed a lazy and unethical exercise in plagiarism, but with Quentin at the helm, infusing proceedings with his unique sense of cool, the whole affair becomes a mesmerising melange of movie-making techniques, a patchwork of pulp excellence that bristles with pithy dialogue and contains many a memorable moment.I can't say the same about Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol.2, Death Proof or even Django Unchained.",Reservoir Dogs
13,Quinoa1984,"Practically tailor-made for a film buff (as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally), 'Dogs' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy",10,23 July 2003,"Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, ""too violent"" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.  Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.  For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.  So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of ""Stuck in the Middle With You"", or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+",Reservoir Dogs

15,sunwarrior13,Reservoir Dogs Makes Tarantino The Most Influential New Filmmaker In The 1990's,10,3 March 2012,"Reservoir Dogs is a crime film marking debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It depicts the events before and after a botched diamond heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast: Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profuse profanity, and a nonlinear storyline.The film has become a classic of independent film and a cult hit.The story looks at what happens before and after but not during a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot. Mr. White is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana. Reservoir Dogs transformed Quentin Tarantino practically overnight from an obscure screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s for he has made a nihilist comedy about how human nature will always undercut the best-laid plans.Also,this undeniably impressive picture grabs the viewer by the lapels and shakes hard, but it also is about nothing other than a bunch of macho guys and how big their guns are.Aside from that,it has remained undoubtedly one of the best films of the 1990s, and probably one of the best directorial debuts of all time, Reservoir Dogs announced the arrival of one of contemporary cinema's hottest talents -- and he came out shooting.",Reservoir Dogs

17,hitchcockthelegend,For all I know you are the rat; and this might be the best heist homage movie ever?,9,26 August 2010,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10",Reservoir Dogs
18,Theo Robertson,Don't Believe The Hype - It's Not That Good,6,14 August 2004,"RESERVOIR DOGS exploded onto cinema screens in 1992 and I can still remember the shock waves it caused due to the excessive violence . If memory serves me right Glasgow Council came very close to banning it from cinema chains in the city and they weren't alone in trying to do this either as newspaper headlines and word of mouth screamed how violent the movie was as Quentin Tarantino became the most infamous and influential movie director of the mid 1990s . RESERVOIR DOGS was finally allowed a British network TV transmission in the Summer of 1997 on channel 4 . I was rubbing my hands in anticipation at seeing this movie . After seeing the movie I felt disgusted . Not because it was a movie whose violent content had sickened me but because I'd fallen for the hype like a total shmuck . This must be the most overrated movie of the 1990s!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! First of all the characters meet in a diner . If you're carrying out a heist is it a good idea to gather in a public place where potential witnesses can identify you ? And would a bunch of robbers be interested in discussing the lyrics of Madonna or the films of John Holmes ? It might be cool and trendy to discuss pop culture but in the context of this movie it's illogical . Soon the narrative switches to a warehouse where the robbers have arrived after their disastrous heist and we're treated to some very obvious exposition : "" F***in' sick f*** . Why'd he do that ? Did you see what he did to that girl ? How old was she ? Nineteen ? F***in' sick motherf***er "" After the movie finished this is what bothered me - I had expected the movie to end by showing us the massacre at the bank BUT THIS NEVER HAPPENS ! and I can't describe how cheated I felt . Okay we're shown the various robbers making their getaways but not once are we shown the much referred to robbery itself which made me feel very disappointed , not because I wanted to see teenage girls get murdered but because it instinctively felt like it should have been the centrepiece scene / climax scene of the movieAs for the rest of the movie's reputation for violence it's ill deserved . There's buckets of blood but many , many movies also feature buckets of blood and gore and don't receive half as much attention as RESERVOIR DOGS . Remember the much criticised scene of the cop getting his ear cut off ? Didn't anyone notice that this actually happens off camera ? Ironically enough the only murder that did disturb me - "" What this cop ? "" BANG - is chilling because it's committed so coldly not because it's graphic in any way . Is there anything I like about RESERVOIR DOGS ? Harvey Keitel is the type of actor I'd watch even if it involved him reading out his shopping list , and the scene where it's revealed who the undercover cop is memorable along with the compelling "" How's he going to explain that to the bad guys when they return ? "" storyline . But at the end of the day I can't help thinking RESERVOIR DOGS is ruined by its much hyped reputation . WHITE HEAT is a very similar movie and a much better one RESERVOIR DOGS gets six bones out of a possible ten",Reservoir Dogs
19,Hey_Sweden,It took me too long to revisit this modern crime classic.,8,11 May 2012,"Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's feature debut is a viscerally entertaining, powerful, witty, and well acted piece of work that at once showcased his way with dialogue and tendency to leap back and forth in time. A group of lowlife criminals with clashing personalities get together for a diamond robbery that goes horribly wrong. (Now, we never see the actual robbery, but the vivid descriptions supplied by the characters still tell us what we need to know, and truth be told, it works just as well in ones' imagination.) Now the survivors have holed up in a warehouse where, in between their verbal attacks on one another, they work at figuring out what went wrong, and realize that one of their own has to have been a rat. You know you're going to be in for an interesting time when a group of grown men are debating the message in the lyrics to Madonna songs; this is just one example of the way Tarantino really cares about character and dialogue. Here, of course, he was already dropping pop culture references (Marvel Comics characters, the TV series 'Get Christie Love') and quoting the movies that influenced him, in his approach to telling this story. It's often effectively gory, and many people are quite familiar with the show stopping torture sequence, even though in actuality we don't see the worst of it. The whole thing is grimly compelling; this odd assemblage of characters reveal little details about themselves throughout and often just get on each others' nerves. No matter how ugly this may get, it's the kind of thing one just keeps watching. A top notch cast excels, including Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, ex-con turned author & screenwriter Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and legendary movie business tough guy / wild man Lawrence Tierney in one of his best over roles. The eclectic soundtrack is a treat to listen to, with Stealers Wheel rightfully earning, at the time, newfound appreciation for their old song ""Stuck in the Middle with You"". Solidly entertaining all the way through, ""Reservoir Dogs"" served as a fine announcement to the world that a fresh talent had arrived, and holds up extremely well. It's gripping stuff that could work just as well on the stage, always striking and never boring. Eight out of 10.",Reservoir Dogs
20,Doylenf,Graphic crime film from Tarantino...,7,18 February 2007,"It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor. And I might as well admit, I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either, although I love a good crime film. This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime, where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police.""Did you kill anybody?"" ""Three cops. No real people, just cops."" The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me. But the story, about the cop inserting himself into the mob, is well handled throughout, building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order.Standout performances from the entire cast: HARVEY KEITEL, TIM ROTH, MICHAEL MADSEN, CHRIS PENN, QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY (almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of ""Dillinger"" and other '40s crime films).Warning: As usual with Tarantino, the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking, stabbing, blood gushing moments--and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty.But all in all, a powerful film of its kind with a ""crime doesn't pay"" morality tacked onto the brutal ending. If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse--but then, he wouldn't be Tarantino, would he?Warning: Not for children. Too intense, too graphic.Seen now, it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word.",Reservoir Dogs
21,LeonLouisRicci,Tarantino Takes Off,7,4 July 2013,"Splashes of brilliance and reinvention highlight this debut from Director QT. It is a candy-shop of self indulgence and the Movie languishes at times with over written Scenes that are full of themselves, not quite sharpened, and need some restraint.Character studies to the extreme, most participants are back-grounded with detail but not much depth. The appeal here is that this was made by an obvious lover of Pop Culture and its cribbing of other Movies is painfully evident. Overall it is quite an accomplished ""Film-School"" like abandonment of conventions and style. It is unabashedly and with a heavy hand proclaiming that things need a new direction and Tarantino is at the (Stealers) Wheel. This one was impossible to ignore arriving with trumpets blaring announcing a New Kid in Town. With its unfiltered bravery and a keen eye, this Movie was a make it or break it effort. The result has since been solidified. As a bonus, for the Fans of the Writer/Director and Movie Lovers in general, everything that came after this was a more rich and rewarding improvement.",Reservoir Dogs
22,poolandrews,A solid crime thriller but overrated in my opinion & not one of the best 250 films ever made.,6,24 July 2010,"Reservoir Dogs is set in Los Angeles as seven hardened criminals have been hired by big time mobster Joe Cabot (producer Lawrence Tierney) & his son Nice Guy Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn) to carry out an armed robbery at a diamond store, the seven men are given an alias to do with colours & told never to reveal their real names to each other. The robbery goes horribly wrong, Mr. White (co-producer Hervey Keitel) helps a badly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) to the arranged rendezvous point, an old abandoned warehouse where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) turns up shortly after. The arguments & accusations fly over what happened & whether someone set them all up, then gun happy psycho Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) show's up with kidnapped cop officer Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) in the trunk of his car. Tensions rise & emotions run high, no-one know's who to trust as they each become convinced one of the other's is an undercover cop...Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino who also has a small role in the film as Mr. Brown of the lesser seen thieves this has to be a brilliant film since, at the time I write this comment, it sits proudly at number 64 in the IMDb's user voted Top 250 films of all time. Right? Well no, not in my opinion anyway & I am positive there other's out there on planet Earth who consider Reservoir Dogs a fine film in it's own right but also feel it's a somewhat overrated film. I suppose it was quite a fresh take on filmmaking in general at time, Tarantino's now famous & often copied style of lazy, laid back dialogue between character's that verges on being about nothing in particular that we as an ordinary person in the audience can relate to like the early scene set in the diner where the informal discussion ranges from Madonna to th ethics of whether to leave a tip for a waitress to attention grabbing dialogue we can't relate to but would like to. Well written, catchy & full of profanity it appears people either love Tarantino's ear for dialogue or hate it & whether you consider Reservoir Dogs the classic so many think it is will depend on your opinion of it. At 100 minutes long this is a heist film where you never actually see the heist, just little flashes of the aftermath & the consequences of it. There's one big twist as to who the undercover cop is but I didn't find it much of a surprise to be honest. There are one or moments that didn't sit well with me either, if the cops knew what was going on all along why did they wait so long at the end to raid the warehouse & let their own man bleed to death? Why did Mr. White say he was close to killing Mr. Blone in the store yet when Mr. Blonde show's up Mr. White says Mr. Pink was close to killing him? Why did Joe go to the warehouse if he thought Mr. Orange was a cop?Almost entirely dialogue driven with very little on screen action or violence I will give Tarantino credit for making a film where not much happens yet still manages to hook the audience & have an impact. The notorious ear slicing scene is very tame in reality, literally nothing of the cutting is seen & while there's some bloody gunshot wounds not much else. There are no female speaking parts in Reservoir Dogs at all which is unusual for a film. Mr. Blue is never seen beyond the opening sequence & his fate was meant to have been filmed but the budget didn't stretch that far & it was never shot in the end.With a low budget of about $1,500,000 it's said most of the actor's wore their own clothes, well shot with some nice cinematography the production values are good. Tarantino wanted James Woods to play a role, Christopher Walken turned down the part of Mr. Blonde while David Duchovny, George Clooney & Samuel L. Jackson apparently auditioned for roles. The acting is very good from a good cast anyway though.Reservoir Dogs is a very good film for sure but it's not one of the best 250 ever, in fact i can name 100 right now of the top of my head that better including the Tarantino directed Pulp Fiction (1994) & Kill Bill (2003). A good film I am sure most will enjoy but somewhat overrated in my opinion.",Reservoir Dogs
23,lastliberal,Hardened criminals on parade,8,7 April 2007,"Mr. Pink: You kill anybody? Mr. White: A few cops. Mr. Pink: No real people? Mr. White: Just cops. This is probably the most succinct characterization of this movie. We are talking hardened criminals here that have no regard for cops. Killing them is a sport. This movie shows the criminal mind better than any other I have seen. It is raw and hard and bloody and violent. It is not full of shootout and special effects. It is pure and clean and focused on conversation that gives some insight into what a criminal goes through. The anxiety after a botched job becomes paranoia and suspicion. Yes, it is justified, but here you see it to the extreme.Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi were a joy to watch even though I would have shot Mr. Pink at the first opportunity just to shut him up!",Reservoir Dogs
24,zardoz-13,Taratino's First Crime Thriller is Far-Out!!!,10,13 May 2010,"Writer & director Quentin Tarantino's freshman effort as a helmer concerns a ruthless criminal gang and a jewelry store robbery gone awry. Indeed, this is the movie that introduced audiences to Tarantino as a director. Ostensibly, without the participation of Harvey Keitel, this movie might never have attracted the critical and popular attention that it eventually garnered. Moreover, ""Reservoir Dogs"" would have qualified as little more than routine heist caper were it not for the distinctive Tarantino treatment. Compared with his later film ""Pulp Fiction,"" which reinvented the crime thriller, ""Reservoir Dogs"" qualifies as a relatively modest effort. Basically, an undercover Los Angeles cop infiltrates a gang of professional thieves and discovers that getting shot in the stomach is all in a day's work. No, this is not the kind of movie that prompt anybody to resort to a life of crime because everybody here faces the consequences of their actions. Squeamish people who abhor the sight of blood and gore might find Tarantino's film highly objectionable. When individuals are shot, they bleed profusely. One character spends more than half of the movie wallowing in a pool of his own blood. The most notorious scene involves a psychopath who tortures a tied-up Los Angeles policeman for information. During the interrogation, the hood carves off the cop's ear without a qualm. Those who prefer happy endings should definitely avoid this tragic thriller.Violent, profane, ribald, ironic and sometimes sickeningly sadistic, ""Reservoir Dogs"" consists largely of provocative conversations with an occasional bloodbath of a shoot-out thrown in to punctuate all this loquacity. Tarantino thumbs his nose at conventional storytelling methods and orchestrates the gritty events in this laconic 99-minute melodrama so that they occur out of chronological order. Indeed, Tarantino's decision to tell his story with no apparent order with regard to the progression of events enhances ""Reservoir Dogs"" and adds to its substance. Mind you, in some instances, juggling the chronology of a story may impair suspense, but that doesn't happen here. Furthermore, Tarantino delivers his brand of flavorful dialogue with some 272 uses of the F-word, and the stories that the thugs swap foreshadow the kinds of narratives that ""Pulp Fiction"" would contain. No Tarantino movie would be complete without numerous references to older movies and one conversation compares a character to the short-lived African-American television series ""Get Christy Love."" Despite its micro-budget, this 1992 crime drama boasts a fabulous cast, including Harvey Keitel, Christopher Penn, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and legendary screen veteran Lawrence Tierney. Comedian Steven Wright contributes a deadpan but soulful voice-over performance as a radio disc jockey, and musical supervisors Kathy Nelson and Karyn Rachtman provide several golden oldies from the 1970s that haven't been run into the ground in previous films. Harvey Keitel and the entire cast are nothing short of superb.",Reservoir Dogs
25,grantss,Superb - one of the greatest movies ever made,10,19 April 2014,"A crime boss assembles a team of six experienced criminals to pull off a large jewellery heist. However, it goes badly and the team are ambushed by police. The survivors regroup at an abandoned warehouse where it becomes obvious to them that someone in the team is an undercover cop. But which one?Brilliant crime-drama. With a meagre budget, Quentin Tarantino made a masterpiece. Have watched Reservoir Dogs five or six times now and it never gets old or loses its impact, despite knowing how it's going to turn out. If anything, it gets better with each watching, as I spot little things I didn't see the previous times.All the Tarantino trademarks are there: the witty dialogue, gritty characters, graphic violence, elaborate and detailed - yet watertight - plot, the character development, the backwards-and-forwards-in-time effects, the excellent, well selected soundtrack.Tarantino's work behind the camera is the sort of magic that gets examined in film schools. The low budget probably helped - when you don't have special effects and all other expensive means at your disposal, you need to maximize the effect of what you have. Certainly the greatest ever directorial debut (if it is regarded as Tarantino's debut).Casting was spot on, and every actor plays out of his skin. Nothing seems forced, and the characters gel perfectly - you wouldn't even know anyone was acting.Considering the perfection of this movie, it is quite amazing that Tarantino managed to surpass it with his next movie, making the greatest movie of all time: Pulp Fiction.",Reservoir Dogs
26,Boba_Fett1138,A piece of movie history.,10,26 August 2003,"By owning this movie you own a little piece of movie history.The absolute most fantastic thing about ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the brilliant dialog. The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool ""Super sounds of the 70's"" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie ""Little Green Bag"" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end. But between all those scene's there are lot's of other moments which you will never forget.Brilliant movie. An absolute must see! 10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Reservoir Dogs
27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.,8,31 May 2006,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10",Reservoir Dogs
28,view_and_review,All dogs don't go to heaven,4,26 March 2018,"Reservoir Dogs was OK but unfortunately I don't have the desire to write much about the movie because I was distracted by something else. I was distracted by Quentin Tarantino's infatuation with the N-word. I've now seen Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, The Hateful 8 and Reservoir Dogs and there was abundant usage of the N-word in all of these movies. I guess you could give Django Unchained and The Hateful 8 a pass because they were period pieces. Tarantino can claim he was going for authenticity in those two. That leaves Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. In Pulp Fiction--however unnecessary--Jimmy was referring directly to a black man right there in the flesh (with the ""dead n***** storage"" line). In Reservoir Dogs, however, there was copious usage when there wasn't a black person around, nor were they even referencing a specific black person--it seemed wholly unnecessary and just a means to throw the word in there.I have no clue what Tarantino's deal is. Does he hate black people? Does he love black people and this is some peculiar artistic way of showing it? Or maybe his perception of white people is that they use the N-word whenever they have the opportunity to get away with it? I don't know, but because this was at least the fourth Tarantino movie with a superfluous usage of the N-word I couldn't ignore it.As I said about the actual movie; it was OK. It seemed more like a school project. The cinematography wasn't the best and the script was a bit too basic. Even if Tarantino didn't go HAM with the N-word I would've given this movie a 5/10 rating.",Reservoir Dogs
29,AlsExGal,You might need to watch it twice...,8,18 January 2021,"... because the first time around I was somewhat disappointed. This was actually a commercial hit for Tarantino , and that usually means something that is appreciated on the first view.It is great nonlinear storytelling. You first meet these guys in a diner having breakfast. And you learn lots about their characters just from this very mundane setting and some arguing about the philosophy of tipping. And you wonder why they are wearing suits and thin lapels with white shirts and skinny ties, like they borrowed the Beatles' 1964 wardrobe. It is never explained. And there is all of this 70s music, again, never explained.Storywise it has been done a hundred times, maybe more. A heist gone wrong. But the gimmick is, you never SEE the heist. Most of the time I like for movie makers to show me not tell me, but this works brilliantly. You see this gang of people who do not know each other talk about the heist beforehand. You see the aftermath of the heist. You see the descriptions of the heist between this band of criminals not exactly matching up. And all of the scenes are mixed up chronologically. Where it shines is the crazy dialogue that happens between these hooligans. Their banter is ludicrous, villainous, and totally engaging. It's like Diner meets Dillinger.And speaking of Dillinger, a really great touch is having Lawrence Tierney in a supporting role as Joe, mastermind of the heist. Tierney was an actual star of film noirs in the 1940s, and he lost that career because in real life he was somebody who would probably have been quite at home with the characters in this film. He got into lots of bar fights and altercations with the police to the point that no studio wanted to deal with him anymore.I'd highly recommend this one, but you must pay attention to get the most out of it.",Reservoir Dogs
30,morrison-dylan-fan,Dog City.,10,31 January 2013,"Checking my local cinema times for the showings of Tom Hooper's take on Victor Hugo's Les Miserables,I was shocked to discover that the cinema was planning to hold a one off special screening of Writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino's debut:Reservoir Dogs.With still having bright memories from seeing Tarantino's wonderful Spaghetti Western Django Unchained,and also being a fan of Pulp Fiction since watching it on DVD in 2003,I decided that it would be the perfect time to take a look at Tarantino's debut,with the added bonus of getting to see the dogs ""go to work"" on the big screen.The plot:Pulling fellow gangster Mr.Orange out of his car and dragging him to the gangs hideaway location at a disused warehouse,Mr.White (who had earlier revealed to Mr ""Freddy"" Orange that his real name was Larry) puts the shot in the stomach Mr.Orange on the ground as he begins to try and gather up his senses.As Larry starts to think of how he can get Freddy to a doctor without them getting caught out,he also begins to wonder how such a simple jewellery store heist could have gone so horribly wrong.With the heist ending up with two out of the eight gangsters being shot by police who oddly seemed prepared for their arrival.Interputing the sole sounds of Mr.Orange's agonising screams,fellow surviving gangster Mr.Pink arrives bursting through the doors.Giving Freddy and Larry the news that he does not have a clue where the other surviving members of the gang are,Pink tells them the only good news that has come out of this disaster, which is that he was just about able to keep hold of the stolen diamonds.Furious about how the police shot their simple heist to pieces,Mr. Orange,White and Pink start to become increasingly uneasy around each other,when Pink tells Orange and White that the only way the cops could have been so well prepared for their arrival,was if one of the loyal ""gang"" was in fact,an undercover cop.View on the film:Smartly having the gangs pop-culture riffing dialogue in the flashback scenes of the film as a way to allow audience members to build a connection to the fun,easy going gang,and to also show the loyalty and trust that each gangster has with each other.The screenplay by writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino (with Roger Avary being credited with writing the catchy ""radio"" dialogue) uses the warehouse setting to shut all of the breezy,carefree times that the gang had been having ""outside"",to instead be replaced by a strong Neo- Noir feel.With the claustrophobic setting of the warehouse leading to all of the loyalties crumbling,as each gang member starts to suspect the other of being a hidden rat amongst the thrives.Along with bravely deciding to not show the heist itself,but to instead focus on the after effects of it,Tarantino superbly uses long, stylish gliding shots for the pre-warehouse scenes to initially show the tight ""round table"" bond that all of the gangsters have with each other,to slowly increasing the speed of the long shots,to create an intense,gritty atmosphere,as each gang member finds the union to have disintegrated,and only being left with the option to shoot their way out of a corner and into survival.Keeping with the theme of giving the viewer just enough information so as to come to their own conclusions,Tarantino uses cold,long distance isolated shots in the warehouse to show with an unflinching eye the doubt and pent-up anger which is starting to build within each of the former loyal ""gang"".Contrasting the isolated infighting shots,Tarantino uses short,sharp,shots to hit the audience with pummelling shots of violence,as he perfectly choose the right moment to flinch the violence away from the camera,so that the viewer is allowed to make their own mind up about what the most aggressive attack,and bitter ending fully look like.Being one of the main people credited with helping to get the film on the big screen,Harvey Keitel gives a brilliant,heartfelt performance Mr ""Larry"" White.Despite seeing all the lies right in front of him,Keitel shows that Larry is unable to accept that ""the old ways"" are now long gone,until it is far to late.Joining with Keitel,Michael Madsen gives a career defining performance as the sadistic Mr.Blonde,whilst Steve Buscemi hits everyone of Tarantino's sarcastic swipes with expert delivery,whilst Tim Roth shows the laying on the floor Mr. ""Freddy"" Orange to be developing an increasing sense of fear as he witnesses the gang tear itself apart,and begin to relies that every dog has its day.",Reservoir Dogs

A small group of mobsters are labelled by colour, and then they attempt to pull off a crime for which viewers are given the aftermath and flashbacks. A shootout leaves a few of them dead and others struggling to survive. Interesting developments but very violent. This is a great setup for promising director Quentin Tarantino who exposes the clichés through characters that are believable. Tim Roth is frantic because he is a wounded undercover officer who must rely on those he fooled and survive against the ones who suspect him. Michael Madsen is menacing torturing a cop in a disturbing scene where he severs an ear, but his confidence is overrun to a sudden halt. Harvey Keitel believes Roth's story going so far as to get him undercover after he is fatally wounded, but his friendship is tested in an extreme standoff. Steve Buscemi is given the best lines particularly a scene at a restaurant involving tipping. Buscemi is comic relief but also quite lucky in terms of his survival rate. Lawrence Tierney makes one of his last appearances as the criminal head. A great start for a director whose future is bright. It presents criminal lifestyles as a dead end paved in blood.

The main thieves are played by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn while Lawrence Tierney appears as the old salt mastermind.This was Tarantino's first feature film, costing only $1,200,000, and it has quirky glimmerings of future greatness, as seen in ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004), ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) and ""Django Unchained"" (2012), but ""Reservoir"" didn't work for me. It's hampered by a low-budget vibe, which I can handle, but not the uninteresting lowlife characters, their self-made conundrum, their interminably dull dialogue and the one-dimensional setting where about 80% of the story takes place in an old warehouse, not to mention no females in the main cast.Still, it's interesting to observe Tarantino's first serious stab at filmmaking and it has its moments of genuine entertainment.

I don't know about you but if I saw that group of men, I would call the cops right away. Since we don't get to see what happened in the jewelry store, it was mayhem and carnage. We don't really know what happened during the jewelry heist. Although I can only imagine the horror of it all, they return to the warehouse where the men under aliases are wondering who the cop is in the group. The audience learns before the end. I don't get the film's appeal though. I have seen it twice. Except for the conversation at the restaurant, we don't see any other female roles in the cast. It's largely a male cast overall.",Reservoir Dogs
34,Mr-Fusion,"Brutal, but well made",6,6 October 2015,"""Reservoir Dogs"" doesn't have the entertainment value of other Tarantino movies (I don't come to this for 100 minutes of escapism). But what it does have is serious cheek. Scratch that, what I really mean is cojones. This movie does a terrific job amping the tension in spartan dialogue scenes, and an even better job commanding your attention with a snap of its figurative fingers. When it's not a bunch of gangsters jawing about pop culture over coffee, it's one of them bleeding out in the backseat of a car, or another taking to a cop with a switchblade (effective ruining ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" for me). It's that kind of visceral punch to the face and methodical enjoyment of sadism that this movie prides itself on. And the camera work (a simple pull back to reveal a looming sense of dread, roving camera during a tense warehouse standoff) is the mark of a director who knows how to captivate his audience. The hard-edge-to-fun balance is off for me, which is why I don't make this regular Tarantino viewing, but no question he was on his game here.6/10",Reservoir Dogs
35,christopher-underwood,Great to discover it is still a great watch,10,4 September 2017,"Watching this film again after a gap of many years it is surprising just how very good it is. My memory of it was that it was violent but rather stagey being set in a warehouse and that there was a decent soundtrack. Clearly Tarantino's debut film is much more than that and if we think we have seen some of it in other films it is probably that those other films have come along afterwards. The innovation, audacity and sheer bloodyminded determination to present the world on film differently is most impressive. It really is a bravura opening with the chat in the cafe and cutting to the aftermath in all its bloody detail. Pretty visceral throughout, I recall the fuss upon the film's original release and although there have been other violent films things have probably quietened down in more recent cinema - certainly in the mainstream. But then maybe this never was a mainstream film despite awards and accolades. Great to discover it is still a great watch. Excellent.",Reservoir Dogs

I've seen too many mob movies, so in some way it got a little boring. But I did enjoy this movie. The acting was fantastic and the plot was also very cool. The torture scene with the cop was very disturbing. Not to sound sick, but I do like these kind of movies. I loved how all the actors portrayed their roles. It just got too predictable for me.

39,MovieAddict2016,Poetic Justice,10,2 June 2003,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the rare films that lives up to its hype. Much like ""Goodfellas,"" this film did not let me down, but I actually enjoyed it much more than I ever dreamed.The film plays backwards, a bit like ""Memento."" It opens at the end, and recounts the last few days in the lives of crooks pulling a jewelry heist. But as we learn immediately in the beginning that the heist went wrong. Someone ratted to the cops; the cops showed up during the heist and all heck broke loose. But I may be getting ahead of myself.In the beginning of the film, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) in a car. Mr. Orange has been shot. We don't know how, he just has. Mr. White brings Mr. Orange to a warehouse, and the two men enter. Eventually Mr. Pink (the wonderful Steve Buscemi) shows up, followed by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a crazy madman who opened fire on civilians at the jewelry heist. For the duration of the film, we are left to wonder who the cop is/was, and how everything happened.Things open up bit-by-bit. We are shown every Mr.'s life in the last few days before the heist, and what all happened. Of course, the men aren't really Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange and Mr. Blonde. These are their fake names for the sake of the heist. But we learn their real names and the parts they play in he robbery as the film moves on. And the last twenty minutes of this film is one of the most absorbing twenty minutes in film history. Things appear all of a sudden. For example, how Mr. Orange got shot. Once you realize who shot him and why, things start to make more sense. Because knowing who Mr. Orange is makes you wonder why he got shot. But who is Mr. Orange? Is he the cop? Or is he someone else? See the movie for yourself and figure it all out.""Reservoir Dogs"" ain't no ""Goodfellas,"" but on the level of film it is a masterpiece. The opening scene is one of the most mimicked scenes in film history. And the performances are extraordinary. Harvey Keitel fills in the shoes of Mr. White, who some said Robert De Niro would have been better for. In all respect, I do like De Niro better, and admit that the character carries many traits that De Niro's characters usually do. Cool under pressure. Smart. Always thinking. You can see his brain working like a clock. But I must also admit that Harvey Keitel did a very, very good job of bringing his character to life. You can almost see the chemistry between the actors boiling up. I like films where there aren't many characters, because you will almost always find the actors on screen giving some of the best performances of their lives. They are locked with these other actors, and their performance just gets stronger with every line they speak. Take, for instance, the tension between Mr. White and Mr. Blonde. Keitel and Madsen really go at each other, and it's great. And Buscemi, my personal favorite of the group, is not only funny, but fun to watch on screen. His performance is as great as his humor.""Reservoir Dogs"" isn't for everyone. It's rough, tough, gruff and at times sickening (see the police torture scene). But if you can handle some very strong violence and language, then this film is for you. It's got some amazing talents, some fairly unknown at the time, bringing together one well-written, well-directed film. Quentin Tarantino has said to be losing his charm for making a good film lately, but no one can forget this film.

40,Red-Barracuda,Brilliant debut film from Tarantino,10,15 February 2015,"Reservoir Dogs is of course the film that made Quentin Tarantino overnight. It was something of a sensation back in the day and with good reason. Despite having a plot-line that was seemingly very derivative of an earlier Hong Kong crime flick, it was nevertheless an extremely fresh approach that Tarantino brought to the movies. He impressively went one better with his next feature Pulp Fiction but irrespective of that, Reservoir Dogs will always be regarded as one of the great debut features. Its influence was huge and many crime flicks followed its lead and featured wise-cracking bad guys and pop cultural references. The story focuses on a group of colour-coded thieves before and after a disastrous heist. They meet up at a prearranged rendezvous point at a warehouse and accusations begin to fly. Some are convinced it was a set-up, while the waters are muddied further by one of the team acting psychotically on the job. One spends the entire film bleeding to death and whose background story forms a key part of the plot.The manner in which the film is constructed is one of its greatest strengths. The drama flashes backwards and forwards and in doing so layers are added and gradually truths emerge. In taking this approach Tarantino masterfully controls and heightens the tension. The very fact he has devised a heist movie which features everything but the heist itself, shows serious confidence. The cast is quite brilliant with Lawrence Tierney as a very convincing crime boss, Harvey Keitel as a career criminal, Tim Roth as the rookie he has to train and possibly the most central character in the film (he is good although his American accent is sometimes a bit ropey), Steve Buscemi puts in a star-making turn as a cynical but clear-headed wise-guy, Michael Madsen is authentically scary as the psychopathic member of the group, real-life ex-con Eddie Bunker has a small role but looks the part , Chris Penn is extremely naturalistic as the crime bosses son Nice Guy Eddie and Tarantino himself is actually pretty good (for once) as the unfortunate Mr Brown.But it's as a writer and director that Tarantino is best and Reservoir Dogs shows himself clearly at the top of his game. Characters often pause to discuss all manner of tangential, trivial everyday things. He uses many very long takes which in the wrong hands will slow down the pace of a movie but here only heighten the tension and bring out the drama more. His gift for dialogue is pretty self-evident, with fantastically authentic sounding words coming out of these gangster's mouths. The writing really is fabulous and extremely funny a lot of the time. I also remember when it was released it attracted a lot of media attention for how extremely violent it was. While it certainly is to an extent it also can be compared to the Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) where you swear you have seen a lot more than you actually have. Again, this is testament to the skill in which Tarantino tackles his material. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is rightfully regarded as one of the classics of its genre and, in my opinion, after Pulp Fiction, the best thing Tarantino has ever did.",Reservoir Dogs

42,KineticSeoul,"Stylish, slick and cool cult classic",9,21 July 2016,"When I first saw this movie during when I was still a teen. I was blown away by it, from the dialogues, the build up and the twist. I was intrigued from beginning to end. Despite the whole story revolving around a heist, it doesn't actually show the heist. It doesn't even really show the planning of the heist. But despite it lacking when it comes to scheming and planning things out while showing the whole process like ""Ocean's Eleven"". I was still intrigued and entertained throughout the whole running time. I just recently saw this film again, although I am still confused about the title of why it's called ""Reservoir Dogs. It's a magnetic film that drew me in and kept me focused. I still think this film is a bit overrated, I mean it's not one of the best films I have ever seen or anything like that. But I still think it's one heck of an accomplishment. I mean it's a crime film that revolves around a heist while not even showing the heist and yet it can entertain and entice the audiences is a accomplishment. It shows what happened before and after the heist but not the actual heist itself. What makes this movie stand out is not just the cool dialogues, but it's the stylishly cool and suave style of it all. Plus it does have some iconic scenes some people try to do a parody of, especially the introduction scene where the character walk to their cars. This is a cool, slick and compelling movie that did a lot with the resources they had. Even the acting is top notch, a bit over the top at times but for a film like this it works.9/10",Reservoir Dogs
43,thesar-2,Somewhat Irrelevant,5,6 January 2010,"Well, it was a good start.Actually, let's begin before the start. Way back in the day, I wrote for The College Voice at Glendale Community College. I even had a column named ""Reeves Reviews"" and had long hair in my mug shot. (A little after the mug shot was taken, I had cut that mullet I had, but the boys in the newsroom loved it, make that mocked it, so much, they made sure it stayed in my column.) One enormously unpopular review I wrote was for Reservoir Dogs. It probably would've been criticized elsewhere, but namely it was trashed on a ""college"" campus. I gave it 1/5 stars and named it ""irrelevant."" (Reprinted article follows this review.) Since this was not only Quentin Tarantino's debut film, neither me, nor the movie watching audience had any scope of what Tarantino was capable of. After watching his future directed projects, such as his enormously improved second outing, Pulp Fiction, I strongly say again: this was a good start.Reservoir Dogs starts off well, with a soon-to-be signature rotating camera view of a cast of off-beats discussing highly irrelevant topics, in this case: Madonna songs and an awesome anti-tipping monologue. But after the strong and fun opening, the movie moves on to the real story. These men, cleverly named (mostly) after colors (Pink, Brown, White, Orange, Blonde, Blue, Nice Guy and, uh, Joe) attempt a heist which, of course, gets botched and one of them is no longer a color but a rodent, or rat, to the police.The film, in (again) soon-to-be classic Tarantino fashion, is told in multiple flashbacks and decisively never actually shows the jewelry robbery, which I liked. In fact, the majority, if not 99% of the film plays out like a theatre production and gives the movie time to breath with great dialogue.Granted, the movie is hard to watch, and I am not just referring to those so lost when a movie's not shown in chronological order. It's hard due to the excessive violence, blood, torture, language and being almost completely void of any characters to root for. These men are bad, very bad and I am guessing this is the message Tarantino wants to get across: this is a movie about bad, very bad guys. It's not a nice cop/western show where the good guys wear white and you applaud them on.Recently, I began re-watching all of Tarantino's directorial flicks, mostly in reverse order, of which, I finished here, with Reservoir Dogs. If you happen to watch them that way, it's easy to see how great and definitively quickly he grew to what I strongly believe to be one of the best directors to live. But, therein lies the problem I had with Reservoir Dogs and this has nothing to do with the original review I had with this movie. (By the way, I did upgrade my rating - slightly, but it did take a few additional movies of him for me to, well, ""get him"" – my bad, and it did take more than one viewing of this film, as well.) This film had a lot of what Tarantino wanted to say, to do, with rich dialogue, interesting characters with absolute depth, and film, comic, music and pop references, but it really didn't allow Tarantino to really take it to the next level, or what Pulp Fiction did.So, don't do what I did, unless you have seen his entire directorial collection. Watch them in order, starting with this one and ending with (so far) Inglourious Basterds. Sure, you might still like/love this one, but, you'll soon love to explore the depths he takes his talent, both on screen, behind the camera and in the scripts. And here is my original review written in late 1992 for The College Voice. By the way, I've since lighted a lot of the subject of homophobic lines and characters in movies. Unless it's blatantly against and rallies people to burn gays, I rarely even bring it up. In addition, I remember specifically those guys in the newsroom, the same ones who thought it was fun to make light of my mullet, were ready to kill me for my opinion on this. I get that a lot.""Dark humor and violence dog irrelevant 'Reservoir'""A confused film usually can't tell if it wants to be a comedy, drama or a speak-out-against-society film.""Reservoir Dogs"" is a movie in that category, and it's more a black comedy than anything else.Somewhat funny at times, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is not an interesting film. It's too much of a confused and angry movie, lashing out against law enforcement, homosexuals and African-Americans.The film's weak plot begins in a diner with six or seven gentlemen, and an array of obnoxious, annoying criminals who sit and talk about today's lighted topics, including Madonna.After the diner scene, which is the best part of the entire film, they switch to the events that take place after the crime, which they were hired to commit.Violent, gory scenes follow as ""Orange,"" (Tim Roth) a criminal, has been shot and is quickly dying due to loss of blood. ""White,"" (Harvey Keitel) his partner in crime, takes him to their ""hide-out,"" an empty warehouse, in fear the police will find out who they are.The story line suggests a strong hatred for police officers. It even shows one of the men bringing in a police officer to question why the police showed up so quickly after the robbery.Later, this officer is brutally tortured. It is obvious to see debut-director Quentin Tarantino's respect for law enforcement.The profanity and violence in the film makes it realistic, but at most times, it's irrelevant. ""Reservoir Dogs"" receives one out of five stars on my film rating scale. This film should be avoided.",Reservoir Dogs

45,Robert_duder,How wrong I was about Tarantino and how brilliant this film is,9,3 September 2007,"I think I've started every Tarantino review I've done so far with this same statement. Somehow I got this pre-conceived notion in my head that I hated Tarantino and all his films. I thought he tried too hard to be original and different and used gratuitous nudity, violence, language just for the sake of doing it and then I accidentally got sucked in by Kill Bill and I have been more of a convert every day. So finally I sat down to watch the classic that is Reservoir Dogs which I think might be one of the smartest and most stylish films in Hollywood. The entire film is based on a huge heist that you never see, with some characters you hardly get to know, with a deep history that you never really get the full background of, and a setting that is 98% in an empty warehouse room and yet is incredibly brilliant. The script is so sharp and intelligent and although CHOCK full of horrendous four letter words but you get in the jive with who these guys are and what's happening and who is who and it just sucks you in. So much of the film relies so heavily on the dialog and it's just riveting in the way it is presented. The actors in this film are kind of a who's who of brilliant character actors who have done piles of films and this is kind of their piece de resistance because they give their all and should have received academy award nominations. Some of them give their best performances I have ever seen.Academy Award nominee Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White, the down to earth, analytical and almost concerned thief who arrives at the warehouse first. Keitel is amazing and easily one of the strongest performers in the film. He has a really interesting character and even though he is bad, and an all around villainous character he might be the one you feel the most empathy for. Tim Roth spends most of the film bleeding to death on the floor and yet has a really interesting back story and a major part in the entire film. His performance is perhaps a little more subtle but equally as brilliant. Steve Buscemi, who I have always thought has been a very versatile and brilliant actor, gives literally the performance of his lifetime as Mr. Pink. He's almost the middle man, the neutral guy between everyone and is trying to play it safe so that he doesn't get burnt by the other mystery guys he's working with. Buscemi is wide eyed, and loud and just really puts some excitement into the entire story with a really over the top and incredible performance. Chris Penn has a smaller role but still adds to the cast as choreographer of the whole heist Eddie Cabot. While he doesn't get quite the screen time or dialog that any of the other characters do he still comes across as the biggest villain to the other 'color' characters (Pink, White, Blue etc.) I saved the best for last. I've seen Michael Madsen in SO many roles over the years and he's always decent but I have never seen him pull off anything the way he pulled off his role as Mr. Blonde. Blonde is just a psychotic killer and Madsen makes you down right petrified of him. He's smooth and quiet, and rough and then he lets loose this incredibly demented side and has one of the greatest moments in movie history as he tortures someone while dancing to seventies music. Madsen should have gotten an Academy Award instantly for this role!! He is a terrific character actor with well over 70 roles to his credit.Music and mood plays such a huge part in this film. I don't believe it takes place in any other time than modern day but Tarantino seems to go out of his way to make you feel like the film is in the seventies. The music and the montages and the way it plays such an important part to everything. The cars look retro, the clothing is ambiguous to any time period and even just the feel of the film. It's got this gangster/heist/mob feel to it like no other film I've ever seen. The blood flows freely and there is a lot of really sick scenes and it's certainly not for the squeamish or PG fans because Reservoir Dogs is the definition of 'R' rated but still for an adult film of it's kind it stands out. There is a lot of mystery surrounding it...both kind of plot hole, strangeness like how Chris Penn's character gets shot in a triangle of shooters and what happens to Mr. Pink after he flees but these questions will remain as part of the greatness that is the classic film Reservoir Dogs. 9.5/10",Reservoir Dogs
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A timeless classic,10,5 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A film telling the tale of the after-math of a botched bank raid by a gang of professional thieves. The rapid alert of the police and word-of-mouth has also drawn the conclusion of an undercover police officer in their midst.Upon it's initial release, this flick caused the biggest stir in movies since The Exorcist. A generally violent, foul-mouthed movie at the best of times featuring the notorious ear-cutting scene. Although having seen it, I can't really see what all the fuss was about. The camera veers away from that shot, whereas in Robocop you saw a man get blasted to bits by a gang of crooks with guns (as well as seeing him writhing in agony whilst they laugh at and taunt him!) and another scene where you see a man's testicles apparently get blown off after an attempted rape, yet to the best of my knowledge that was never banned, or even Candyman 2 where you actually see a man's hand being severed off with a rusty blade whilst similar taunting is going on which was never banned. I suppose the graphic, real shot of the man who's been shot in the stomach at the beginning might have played a big part too, though (in a way, it's certainly a lot more shocking than that scene.) But all that controversy aside, we are dealing with a truly legendary film here. A small, low-budget, art-house production that leaves you more fulfilled than any big-budget, Hollywood production ever could. There is a genuinely impressive, shining quality to the writing, dialogue and story-telling at play here that no doubt cemented Tarantino's ascension to his current glory. Moreover, you can see what are probably the earliest hatchings of the 'reverse-plotting' trend starting here that lead to such films as Memento getting made.All of the cast are excellent, and it can only be the work of the hands of fate that while some went on to really make names for themselves (Tarantino, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi) others (Michael Madsen, Chris Penn) just got delegated to either supporting roles or straight-to-video roles. I suppose if I had to pick particular favourites, they would be Buscemi as the edgy, mechanical brains of the group, and Madsen, who has a quiet, un-nerving edge to him that seems typical of a genuine psychopath.It is basically a film driven by dialogue and atmosphere, with a cracking soundtrack from artists as diverse as Steeler's Wheel to Dolly Parton. It's controversy may have given it a helping hand and the name 'Reservoir Dogs' is never actually explained, but for far better reasons than that, this is a film that deserves never to be forgotten. *****",Reservoir Dogs
47,ElMaruecan82,"These 'Dogs' bark a lot, but they bite, too ...",10,9 May 2011,"Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe ""Reservoir Dogs"" and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films, and would make each of his creation, the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film, I was 17, and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect, and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino, I just discovered him with his film, shortly after watching ""Pulp Fiction"", and for some reason, I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"" a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager, and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing, the directing, and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality, the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of ""Like a Virgin"" told by a fast-speaking Tarantino, himself as Mr. Brown, then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human, if not sympathetic. More generally, the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action, or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films, like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste, something juicy, creamy, and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity  I don't need to tell you the lines, if I start them, you know the rest : ""You shoot me in a dream "", ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?"" etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark, but they do bite a lot.Indeed, if the movie was all dialogs, it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson, and wanted to make something big, from the beginning. From the iconic slo-mo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits, you get the idea that this ""Little Green Bag"" song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of film-making, and instinctively, you know something special will happen after these credits, and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood, blood all over the car seat, and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene, it's like the real actor got one real bullet, and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange, and Mr. White, his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear, whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile: the chemistry is so believable, you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then, comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi, asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery, with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorable-action department, the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde: the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic ear-cutting scene with the ""Stuck In the Middle With You"" music, like a reminiscence of ""A Clockwork Orange"" rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background, the scene is disturbing, violent, bloody, but also  iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool, but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde, one of the most twisted gangster villains, is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch, and will make his relationship with White, even more complex. In one minute, the movie raises a new dimension, deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs, the creative editing, where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories, as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene : after the slo-mo opening, the ear-cutting, the Mexican stand-off, as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters (literally) and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great, but it would have been nothing without the tragedy  The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White, made of respect and honor, and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films, a moment of honesty and loyalty, incarnated by Orange's last confession, and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend  Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever.",Reservoir Dogs

49,bowmanblue,"Reservoir Dogs - Rugged, raw and riotous",10,5 August 2014,"Somewhere along the way, opinions on Quentin Tarantino have become divided - some still loving his work, others calling it bloated and unnecessarily inflated. However, those are two criticisms that cannot be levelled at his first (major) film, Reservoir Dogs. It's the very definition of 'minimalist,' focusing on the aftermath of a bank robbery gone wrong and it's shot (in some places) in 'real time.' The story is simple: a gang of bank robbers thinks that one of their number is a 'rat' and has tipped off the police. How do they deal with this? Watch the film and find out.It's hard to choose a 'stand-out' performance among so many great actors. Everyone from the stoic Harvey Keitel, to the psychotic Michael Madsen plays their roles to perfection (and let's not leave out Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi).Basically, if you like gangster or crime films then you probably should have already seen it. However, even if you're not a fan of the genre and simply enjoy cinema then this one is worth a watch because it is very arty in its approach and the performances alone should make up for the fact that some may consider it to be a little over the top on the violence (not to mention explicit language).Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction, may have been cleverer and more stylish, but Reservoir Dogs has all the raw appeal of a real cult classic that will definitely stand the test of time.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Reservoir Dogs
50,gbill-74877,Great debut,8,20 May 2020,"Great story-telling, great cast, great ending. I liked how lean it was and how it focused on events after the heist, which was a nice spin on the genre, and pretty impressive for Tarantino's debut film.My only complaint was the vile racism the characters spewed several times, which seemed unnecessary to tell the story. When added to the comments about women, jokes about prison sex, analysis of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin,' it all seemed to add up to something that reveled just a little bit too much in an unpleasant character type, the white/male/racist/sexist/heterosexual. I still enjoyed it though.So funny story about Harvey Keitel. Once upon a time I visited Oamaru in New Zealand, and happened across a bookbinder who used ancient techniques to handcraft blank books or restore old volumes, like family Bibles. After I told him I would buy works of fiction if he had any of those bound, he recounted the story of his meeting Harvey Keitel, ""the last American who asked me about that."" It was a story that would make for a fantastic short film - this luddite craftsman seemingly displaced in time by hundreds of years (even dressing the part), meeting a minor celebrity, who continually introduced himself as an ""Oscar nominated actor"" in an almost caricature of Hollywood egotism, as well as his assistant, one of his ""people"", who made unreasonable demands on the poor guy. The bookbinder had a policy where requests to skip over others in his work queue would be honored if he was given a bottle of Scotch. Keitel thought he was joking and that his celebrity alone would ensure higher priority, but the bookbinder was serious, leading to a miscommunication and some unpleasantness. When the work was eventually done, extracting payment out of the ""Oscar nominated actor"" was challenging, but eventually the bookbinder was in New York for other reasons and tracked him down. I couldn't help but think of that while watching this film.",Reservoir Dogs
51,g-bodyl,Pretty Good!,8,3 November 2010,"Reservoir Dogs is a pretty good film, the first one made by Quentin Taratino. I like most of Taratino works but this could be my least favorite. It's a masterful film in a way, but some scenes I found too boring. Some of these talking scenes stretched on forever. But the dialogue is most of these scenes are impressive.This is about a group of guys who find out there is a rat in their group and that rat told the cops all about their crime.The acting is pretty solid. Most of the cast are B-actors but Steve Buscemi always cheers me up with his witty dialogue in basically all the films he's in. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth are pretty good too.Overall, this is a pretty good crime film and a decent jumpstart to Taratino's career. Now I have to check out Pulp Fiction. I rate this film 8/10.",Reservoir Dogs
52,ericstevenson,Of course it holds up,9,16 April 2018,"This movie was Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and is considered to be one of the best directorial debuts ever. You could tell he was destined for greatness. It's also easy to say that this was Steve Buscemi's best role. Like his later film ""Pulp Fiction"", it's told in an nonlinear form of storytelling. The final scene is still the final scene unlike that movie. The best scene is probably at the beginning with the tipping argument.Mr. Blonde is a complete sadist, yet he thinks it's immoral to not tip waitresses. I had seen bits and pieces of this movie before. It's certainly great, but not uh, one of the best movies ever made? I always want to see films in the Top 250. This movie tells the story of a diamond heist gone wrong. One of the six men involved is believed to be a snitch, but I won't spoil the rest of it. ***1/2",Reservoir Dogs

55,atlasmb,Tarantino Makes His Mark,7,20 April 2017,"Quentin Tarantino's first film of consequence and the film that introduced him to the masses, ""Reservoir Dogs"" bears all the hallmarks of what we have come to expect in Tarantino films.Pop music plays a role, sometimes as background music, sometimes voiced by characters. Violence is a central theme, often gratuitous and gory, like a Peckinpah film. Vulgarity is common, though this can be attributed to accurate character writing. His characters like to tell stories, allowing Tarantino the writer to express his enjoyment of a well-told tale.But what makes this film a significant contribution to cinema canon is its style, particularly the way Tarantino frames scenes. It also includes interesting, quirky characters that engage the viewer and keep him guessing.That said, this film is not for everyone. Particularly those who abhor cinematic violence. The dialogue is also heavily sexist, racist and anti-gay (in accordance with the nature of the central characters).Viwers might ask themselves if Tarantino, as writer and director, is trying to deliver a message or a moral, or if he is merely including all of the film elements that he personally enjoys? Viewing his later films suggests that the latter is true.",Reservoir Dogs
56,The-Sarkologist,Tarrantino is a legend!,7,20 April 2013,"As the story goes, Tarrentino showed the script to Harvey Kietel and Kietel said that he liked the script so arranged the film to be made. This was Tarrentino's first film and it was the script that sold him more than anything else. The movie has reached almost cult status, as have most of his other movies. I personally think that it is quite good, but not worth all of the rave that is connected with it.Basically this movie is about a gang who go on a robbery and it is botched. They then all filter back to a warehouse where the tension as to who the informer is fills the screen. Characters file through this onc place, all trying to come to terms with what happened, and trying to sort out for themselves a solution. The movie has some shocking scenes, and it attaches importance to some characters only to turn everything around to show us that the character wasn't all that important after all.I will not go into details as there are a lot of subtle twists designed to shock us. This movie is violent but the violence isn't there for us to revel in but for us to be shocked by it and realise how nasty it is. In the scene immediately after the credits, we have one of the main characters in the back of the car screaming in agony as he tries to come to terms with a bullet wound in the gut. We are constantly being told that he is not going to die, but we soon learn that this is not the case, and that it is a slow and painful way to die.I think that there is talent behind this movie, and from seeing it from the point of one of Tarrentino's first movies, we can see a director that is not glorifying violence and taking a style that heads away from that of mainstream cinema. Even though Tarrentino seems to be more mainstream than other movies, and does seem to attract a mainstream crowd. Even then, he has become a cult icon, and some people watch his movies just because. Still, whatever people say about him, there is one undeniable fact - Tarrentino has been an immense influence on cinema of the 90's.",Reservoir Dogs
57,slightlymad22,A Great Directorial Debut,9,11 August 2019,"I just watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time in a while.This movie blew me away when I first watched it in the early 1990's and I still love it. I have always considered this Quentin Tarantino's best movie.The dialogue is amazing. After watching so much awful dialogue in movies lately, I appreciated this even more, this dialogue just pops!!We only see parts of the escape from bungled diamond heist in flashbacks, and we do not actually see the heist itself, instead we get the aftermath.As for the acting, everyone is superb. None more so than Michael Madsen, he has a menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve!! He is amazing. We're it not for Madsen, Harvey Kietel would have walked away with the movie. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as the frantic Mr Pink too. There is seriously not a weak link in the cast.Amazingly. this was filmed on a budget of $1.2 million.This is quite an achievement for a first time writer/director. A great movie.I was shocked to see it only grossed $2.8 million at the domestic box office. It grossed £6.3 million in the UK. True story it did not get a home video release until 1995.",Reservoir Dogs
58,sol-,Dogfight,7,15 November 2017,"Suspicion and paranoia overwhelm a band of criminals after a tightly plotted heist goes sour in this feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino. The film is built on an interesting dynamic with none of the robbers actually knowing one another since they were all hired by a third party, given code names and were told to not tell each other their true identity. How much can they really trust each other's word and could one of them be a police informant? Intriguing as all this might sound, one's mileage with the movie is almost certain to vary depending on one's tolerance of the dialogue-heavy script. While some of the violence is quite brutal, there is precious little of it as the film mostly consists of the characters bantering back and forth, which unfortunately has a tendency to feel repetitive. The imbalanced time spent on each criminal's background feels a little odd too with some of them far more developed than others. All that said and done, the revelation of the police informant's identity is very well done and the second half of the film has many intense moments. The final few scenes are especially memorable with an outcome that resonates in the mind long after the film is over.",Reservoir Dogs

Soon things escalate and they have to figure out the truth before it's too late for them.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very interesting plot with many plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Quentin Tarantino was for one more time simply amazing and he did an excellent job on how he presented his characters and their connection to the crime. The interpretations of Harvey Keitel who played as Mr. White / Larry, Tim Roth who played as Mr. Orange / Freddy and Michael Madsen who played as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a nice, interesting thriller movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because it is undoubtedly considered as one of the first masterpieces of Quentin Tarantino.",Reservoir Dogs
62,johnnyboyz,"Powerful; brilliantly written and consistently engaging, Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the greatest debuts if not overall films of all time.",10,11 July 2008,"Reservoir Dogs, at least for me, is one of those films that sneak up on you in terms of long term opinion. The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car  something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once: Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it.",Reservoir Dogs
63,filipemanuelneto,"Excellent, it tells a good story with minimal styling.",9,28 May 2020,"I will start this review by making a warning that I give whenever I dedicate myself to a film directed by Quentin Tarantino: I am not an admirer of this director. On the contrary. I'm even quite critical about his work. Not even Jesus Christ pleased everyone, did He? However, from this filmmaker's long list of works, this film is one of the ones I liked the most, I must confess.The film is based on the failed attempt to rob a jeweler, in order to steal a load of diamonds. The gang is highly professional and was hired by a boss who is superior to everyone. The degree of professionalism and commitment of the thieves reaches the point of not even knowing each other's names, using only nicknames created for the purpose. However, the failure revealed that one of the elements is actually a police informant. What remains is to find out which of the surviving elements is that informer.Some say that this film is very violent. I honestly don't agree. There are a lot of films out there that manage to be much harder to see than this, and I am thinking, for example of the long lists of horror gore (""Hostel"", ""Saw""). In any case, it is a movie for adults, in which Tarantino shows that he is very good when he does not sacrifice everything that makes a film work in favor of the look, style and technique. Superbly done and well written, it tells a story with logic and coherence.The cast is excellent, and combines several big names like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself. I would personally highlight the performances of Keitel, Buscemi, Roth and, above all, Tierney for their quality. Technically, it is a discreet film, which almost clashes if we look at Tarantino's stylized and very visual films. Perhaps this is due to the mere fact that this film was the first major work in the director's career. Cheap to produce, as befits a film made outside the big studios, everything takes place in a restricted group of scenarios and there are few exterior scenes or effects, being a film based on dialogues and the interpersonal relationships of the various characters. Even the blood looked fake, actually.This film is proof that it is not necessary to abuse stylization in cinema to make good films. Just having good actors, knowing how to direct them and telling a good story.",Reservoir Dogs
64,TheMovieDiorama,"Reservoir Dogs is loud, bloody and constantly in your face.",8,27 February 2018,"In terms of directorial debuts, this is a solid entry that assured Tarantino as one of the best directors working today. Now, as most of you know, I'm not a big fan of Tarantino. Just not my cup of tea so to speak. Yet this was a good crime thriller. After a heist goes terribly wrong, the group of professional robbers make haste and convene at a remote warehouse. During this time, they try to find out who snitched on them to the police. In glorious (see what I did there...) Tarantino fashion, there is a bucket full of blood and a script full of profanity that infuses rather well with the story. Fortunately the narrative is not linear, so we're flipping back and forth between character introductions and the aftermath of the heist, to keep the plot's pace rapid and fresh. The characters themselves may not be completely memorable, but their names are. Mr White, Mr Brown, Mr Blonde, Mr Orange, Mr Pink and so on. With one humorous scene involving a small argument about the particular choice of ""Mr Pink"" (who was played excellently by Steve Buscemi). It's a story that is dialogue driven, like most of his films, so the wit and dark humour is conveyed through sharp exaggerative banter between these characters. It works, stupendously well actually. Harvey Keitel was the most enjoyable to watch, and finally we have a film with Tim Roth that I actually like. Hooray! Quentin himself should not act in his films. Why? Because he is abysmal. Makes me cringe every time I see him. The torture scene is filled with gore and is probably the most engaging scene in the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a compelling script. But I find the execution extremely, how to put this, noisy. I like subtlety. Sometimes less is more which is why I'm not his biggest fan. Atleast it's not 3 hours long, my brain would've been numbed if that were the case. However in saying that, I find this to be one of his better films (behind Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained) with a punchy script filled with plenty of violence. A damn good directorial debut.",Reservoir Dogs

68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Unforgettable crime thriller with an intangible iconic quality,9,12 July 2011,"Anyone could make a film about a botched heist job, even tell it out of chronological order, but Quentin Tarantino provides his film ""Reservoir Dogs"" with certain intangibles that not just anyone can offer. His trademark anecdotal dialogue aside, Tarantino infuses ""Reservoir Dogs"" with a certain iconicity, a power that creates lasting film memories and inspires stylistically. Even the opening credits sequence, which simply features all the main characters in their black suits and skinny ties walking in slow motion through a parking lot, exudes a kind of swagger that has few rivals.For ""Reservoir Dogs,"" the iconology starts with the characters. All dressed the same but most definitely different, they're initially introduced to us by color code name: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino). They've been hired by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son ""Nice Guy Eddie"" (Chris Penn) to steal a shipment of expensive diamonds, a quick job, but one that requires a large team such as this one.The other key is that we don't see this story from the beginning. We get to see one completely anecdotal lunch scene in which all the guys give Mr. Pink crap because he doesn't tip at restaurants and then after the credit sequence we see part of the aftermath of the heist, which has gone most horribly wrong. Rather than concern ourselves with story, Tarantino creates character portraits through thick amounts of dialogue and lengthy scenes dripping with tension. He takes his time filling us in on the details, but we get them all eventually. This disguises a rather generic plot with a subplot (although it's a bit more than that) that the audience infers from the subtext of the characters. The source of the conflict comes mainly from misters White, Pink and Blonde. As a shot and bleeding-to-death Mr. Orange writhes in pain at a warehouse rendezvous point, White and Pink recall the events of the crime and begin to realize that someone must've informed the police. Enter the calm but ruthless Mr. Blonde, who makes tempers flare even more.If excessive dialogue or drawn-out scenes aren't bookended by major turning points, they're usually blanketed by some kind of tension, such as Mr. Orange lying there freaking out from his wound as Pink and White discuss what to do next. A few flashbacks pull the snowballing momentum out from under the film at times, but they add the necessary depth to actually make us care about these characters.To be clear, Tarantino hasn't executed a great crime thriller or heist film. Instead, he's made these genres into an experimental and violent ball of energy. He's written in scenes that burn images into your head and the swagger — his actors all get it. It's incredible what an ""it"" factor can do to a film and Tarantino and ""Reservoir Dogs"" have ""it"" in no small portions.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Reservoir Dogs

70,Anonymous_Maxine,"Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.",10,18 August 2000,"Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.
Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.",Reservoir Dogs
71,southdavid,Hounds Of Love,7,16 January 2020,"As if I've not started enough stupid internal lists to I've decided that we're going to run through Quentin Tarantino's career and reappraise how I feel about it. So naturally, we started at the beginning.When a jewellery heist goes violently out of hand, a group of career criminals return to base and try to determine what went wrong. Though they've taken precautions and are using codenames, the remaining members of the group begin to believe that one of them may be a police informant.So. This is an Iconic movie in my life. I had the poster on the wall of my University dorm room, and a framed picture of Tarantino at other points. We even, at my insistence, recreated the final third of the movie for one of my friend's art projects. The point is, I was really (embarrassingly) into this film a few decades ago. Now.... I feel it's got some undeniably iconic scenes but I'm a little underwhelmed by some of the other aspects of it.It's a lot more awkward than I remember. He's one of my favourite actors, but Steve Buscemi trips over his lines a lot. You could argue that is creating a realistic style but if that's the case, he's the only one doing it, as Harvey Keitel is all about the style of his lines. ""You shoot this man, you die next. I repeat. You shoot this man you die next"". A few of the aspects of the back stories aren't up to that much. Particularly the ten minutes devoted to Mr Orange's anecdote, which isn't particularly funny. The pop culture discussions though are excellent and were along with ""Clerks"" revolutionary at the time.Visually it's dynamic, with the camera chasing the crooks down the street, for example. But there's some odd choices, such as a combined focus two shot that has a distinct and obvious line down the middle of the screen.Generally I still feel like ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film, a great film even . . but perhaps not the all-time classic I used to think it was.",Reservoir Dogs
72,jzappa,Promising,10,6 November 2006,"Reservoir Dogs is was started it all. This is a fact. The Sundance Film Festival had in 1992 what was basically Arthur C. Clarke's 2010, the year they made contact. Tarantino broke new bounds in his debut with Reservoir Dogs, Rodriguez broke new bounds in his debut with El Mariachi, Allison Anders with Gas, Food, Lodging, Gregg Araki with The Living End, Jimenez and Steinberg with The Waterdance, Tom Kalin with Swoon, Anthony Drazan with Zebrahead. The one that stuck with everyone and lingered and served as the omen for what was to become a new wave of cinema for the past 14 years was Reservoir Dogs.As much as I get sick and tired of the truly excessive worship Tarantino receives, one can never ever say his movies are bad. He is one of the few great independent filmmakers that started with a low-budget debut that was actually a truly great film. Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, two directors whose films can hardly ever be rated below 9 or 10 on this IMDb rating scale, both started off with films that weren't terribly great, and not only that, they like everyone else started off with short films and student films. Tarantino's career just started with this color, star-studded, completely un-campy, blood-soaked drama and has never once gone downhill since. The cinematography gives it the perfect look and gives off intermittent volatility, the editing very subtle even if the keenest, sharpest movie obsessive can tell when a cutaway is a cutaway and an insert is an insert. Do I think he should be mentioned as someone you can never compare to whenever a director makes a crime film? Should every other movie be deemed average or a little above because by comparison Tarantino's genius is no match? No. And I get very frustrated whenever I see instances such as these, which happens to be all the time. Nevertheless, the man is an extraordinary filmmaker, a master from the beginning, which is something you can definitely say is rare.The cast, all having been in jail at some point in their off-screen lives, is generally excellent. This is one of Keitel's best performances by a long shot. Buscemi turns in an incredibly smart performance, letting us know that he is possibly the smartest one of the whole bunch. Roth is a chameleon, always shocking us with Mr. Orange's transience. Tierney, famously the main livewire during shooting of the film, radiates that unspoken, indirectly communicated grit and spunk in only a few, mostly fairly docile scenes. While the late Penn lingers between false and passable, Madsen is the most memorable and unique. The cold, unpredictable nature of Mr. Blonde appears with the utmost effect in his performance.This being what has to be a viewing that contributes to what has to be hundreds of times I've seen it, just like most people my age and my sex, I forgot how much the film itself is a film outside conventional storytelling. It begins, as you all know, with a bunch of guys in suits, tough and cool manly men, sitting around a table in a coffee shop theorizing on the song ""Like A Virgin"" and systematic tipping of waitresses. Then they leave. Then the opening credits start. Then one of them is bleeding to death in the back seat of a car being driven at a grueling pace by another of them. Our thoughts suddenly shift. The film continues in this manner. The plot unfolds in ways where our minds take hairpin turns from what we were immediately expecting and gives us something much better and much more riveting and unpredictable. Though his later films elaborate on his brilliance in writing, Reservoir Dogs remains a clear demonstration of Tarantino's shining gift for the power of the pen. He has what even most of the greatest screenwriters of all time don't have, which is a knack for never giving us what we expect and making us love it and want more no matter how extensive the running time. He also has what every great screenwriter has, and then some.",Reservoir Dogs
73,videorama-759-859391,A new dog in town that can show old dogs new tricks,8,13 March 2014,"This is Tarantino's baby, the film that started Tarantino mania. While this one was the sister, the widely more popular Pulp Fiction being the brother, here is a new trend in storytelling that works beautifully. Basically the plot has a diamond heist go wrong when one of the thief thugs is undercover. You'll find out later in the film, who is it. With the two holding out in a warehouse, a rendezvous, where one of them has been shot, and losing a massive amount of blood, the sight would make you faint, if you were in his place, it now becomes a waiting game, where more people start to show up. One being of course, the notorious Mr Blonde (Madsen) in a 'never live it down' role as a psycho thief, responsible for that infamous ear hacking cop scene, where he likes to throw torture and dance in together. Our anxious and p..sed off dogs retrace their steps, as to how the heist became a bungled mess, one of them, Mr Pink, (the wuzz of the group) convinced they have a rat among the group. Reservoir Dogs has a simple plot, but it's brilliance, lies in the way in how the stories told, in interesting use of flashbacks. I've never seen them work more beautifully in this film while being darn entertaining. We have nice little extras too. We hear a dirty side splitting tale, told by Penn, regarding an incident involving a p..is and wacko glue. We have another one in fictional flashback tale, as told by Roth in the Men's, which is occupied by four deputies. How the film starts off, is admirably great, in that pancake house where the suited up guys, all of dangerous ilk, are chinwagging and disputing the story behind Madonnas's hit 'Like a Virgin'. Minutes later when it comes to tip time, Mr Pink who eventually backs down (wuzz) argues over the point of tipping these waitresses, where through some of the dialogue here, sex is inferred. But also Mr Pink, argues about his low quota of coffee's he's been served. Then we hear more on the subject of tipping from Keitel's character here, who does the film solid. There's great moments of conflict and some frank and brutally bloody moments, like Roth bleeding all over the backseat, and in perpetual moments in the warehouse. Too is another cool scene, involving two cops massacred in their car, as Mr Keitel (Mr White) unloads. RD is a colourful crime thriller, and a great starting point for Tarantino. It's always the one fans are gonna look back on, as what evolved was a cult following from this uniquely talented young director who honestly can't be outdone. You couldn't ask for a finer cast or kickarse dialogue and script in a beautifully executed telling of story.",Reservoir Dogs

A 1.2 million dollar budget is stretched to the limit with a tremendous ensemble cast including Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blondel(his most sadistic role), and Tarantino as Mr. Brown. The structure is very unconventional, relying on flashbacks and running backwards at times. The script is dazzling, funny and viciously sarcastic; the usual Tarantino trademarks, as used in the much more well known ""Pulp Fiction."" This is darker and more twisted than P.F.The crime is a simple diamond heist by the Multicolor named cast. The high point is Mr. Blondel(Madsen) in a torture scene involving a knife and Stealers Wheels song ""Stuck in The Middle with You."" You will never hear the tune the same way again.

It is sure to rank among his very best. The script and it's dramatic storyline throughout the entire movie is a visual compendium of 'Waiting for Godot' meets 'Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.' Anyone seeing it for the first time is in for a real treat. The story is of an experienced gangster who attempts to create the perfect crime. Its simple enough, collect seven of the most professional and trustworthy men in the business, assign them code names, tell them just enough about the crime to do their part, snatch the haul, then rendezvous in a warehouse after the job and split the take. The men selected are top of the line actors like Lawrence Tierney as the Boss Joe Cabot, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Like the best laid plans, the unexpected was not included and therefor becomes the focus of a violent shouting match with guns. Between themselves, the heist should have worked, why it didn't has much to do with the body in the trunk (Kirk Baltz) and will have them at each other's throats trying to fathom the reason. The final segment of the film makes it the most exciting climax since the shootout of the Wild Bunch. With dramatic flair and an excellent, but violent dialog, this incredible film will become a Classic. ****",Reservoir Dogs

78,freemantle_uk,Tarantino's brilliant debut,10,17 October 2009,"Reservoir Dogs is the film that made Tarantino reputation, and shows why he is one of the coolest directors around. Its crime film that is more then a crime film, and shows Tarantino's talent.Reservoir Dogs is about a heist gone wrong, with one member of the gang dead, and another, Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) dying. He and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) race to the gang's meeting place, a warehouse, with Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) already waiting. They quickly discovery that a informant must have been in their ranks and they need to find out who he is, and get out alive. The story is relieved in flashbacks, relieving who the characters are how they got involved and what when wrong, without showing the heist itself. It is a trademark of Tarantino that served him well, and a homage to the Kubrick film 'The Killing'.What makes Tarantino such a good writer/director is he is a masterful storyteller, creating an interesting plot, but also he does not stick to conventions. He does not tell story in a linger fashion, and does not show what really happens. They is a large amount of violence which is well done, showing how one of the characters, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), was a sadist. They is full character development, and he make characters you can be interested in. They is a great cast, Tim Roth, Harvey Kietel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. All are talented actors and for most of them, Reservior Dogs shows them at their best. Another strength of Tarantino's is writing dialogue, with the famous beginning involving a conversation about Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' and Mr. Pink's views on tipping. It is both natural, and clever at the same time. Tarantino has an understanding of pop-culture and the English language.As well as the essential aspect film making, they is also an excellent soundtrack, another feature of Tarantino.An essential film.",Reservoir Dogs

80,alindsay-al,A fantastic crime film,9,29 October 2015,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the most iconic directors of all time and with the hateful eight coming up I thought I would watch his first film reservoir dogs. The premise of this film sees six strangers come together to pull off a heist. When it goes wrong the crew suspect that one of them is a police informant. Harvey Keitel plays Mr white and he is great in this film. He plays the wise leader of the group and he is the character you care about the most because he had the most humanity about him. Tom Roth plays Mr orange and his relationship with white is one of the big stories of the film and I really liked the teacher/student dynamic. His character was interesting and you learn allot about him and the others in this film. Michael Madsen plays Mr blonde and he was really good as the crazy member of the group that is willing to do anything to get the job done. Steve buscemi plays Mr pink and he was a different character because he really plays a slimeball and it really worked within the dynamic of the group. The story though is a bit of a mixed bag, I love the dynamic in the group and the first scene in the film really gives you all the information about the characters that you need. However, I do feel like the film spent a bit too much time on the flashbacks and the reveal of this film was actually pretty predictable. The script was fantastic, with the dialogue between the characters feeling real and very witty with allot of drama involved in the film. The style of the film has been criticised for being over violent which I think is ridiculous. All the violence is used in a very good way and the torture scene is probably the best ever. Overall this is one of tarantinos best and should definitely be seen.",Reservoir Dogs
81,MaxBorg89,A modern master's flawless debut,10,23 October 2005,"Pulp Fiction made him a worldwide phenomenon, but it was the very first screening of Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut, at Sundance in 1992, that proved Quentin Tarantino, a former video store clerk with no formal training behind the camera (except for a failed experiment called My Best Friend's Birthday), was a force to be reckoned with: mixing Sergio Leone, the French New Wave and Asain thrillers in the same package (and adding a lot more on the way), his first feature doesn't boast that much originality, but it has energy, passion, violence and wit.Ostensibly a classic heist flick, Dogs is about a bunch of criminals who are brought together by the edgy Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to perform an apparently flawless robbery. These people have no real names, at least not when they're together: job-wise, they will just be known as Mr. White (Harvey Keitel, one of the driving forces behind this film's making), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker), Mr. Brown (QT himself) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). With some minor help from Joe's son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie (Chris Penn), things should go smoothly.Obviously, they don't: by the time the opening credits are over, we know the job went wrong, as the surviving ""dogs"" (including a seriously injured Orange) gather in a warehouse and try to figure out what happened. Through a clever use of non-linear narrative, we learn how they were approached by Joe, the aftermath of the heist (the robbery itself is never depicted on-screen) and their suspicions regarding a potential undercover cop in the group.The storytelling technique is obviously borrowed from Jean-Luc Godard, who famously said: ""A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order"" (coincidentally, QT's production company, A Band Apart, is also named after one of Godard's movies). The plot, however, is the smallest of Tarantino's concerns. What really matters here is the execution, the style. And what a style: the seamless merger of images and music (see the opening credits), with the additional brilliant idea of having virtually all the songs (no original tunes here) come from an internal source, namely a radio program, the Scorsese-inspired long takes, the innovative use of violence (excessive but often amusing, rather than revolting, as in the famous torture scene).And then, of course, there's the dialogue, the primary reason to watch any of Tarantino's films. The audience at Sundance was memorably shocked by the opening sequence, which explains nothing about the story but gives precious insight regarding the characters: Mr. White has a short temper, Mr. Pink doesn't believe in tipping and Mr. Brown is firmly convinced Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" has a pretty crude significance (in true QT style, the language is not something the easily offended will embrace). That's just one of many quotable sound-bites, which also showcase the talent of Tarantino's ensemble cast: the standouts are Keitel, Roth and the psychotic Madsen, but everyone, even Bunker, whose role is - on the surface - less prominent, gets a well deserved moment of screen immortality.The cast (Keitel most notably) is also further proof of how Reservoir Dogs doesn't ""look"" like a traditional '90s first feature. Unlike Clerks, which was deliberately constructed like a home-made extravaganza, Dogs never flaunts its small scale or limited locations (the bulk of the movie takes place in the warehouse). It's a little movie that thinks big, and the Weinstein brothers were clever enough to see it in 1992, when they bought the film and gave Tarantino free reins to do whatever the hell he wanted after that. The rest, as they say, is recent motion picture history.",Reservoir Dogs
82,jimbo-53-186511,WARNING; These dogs MAY bite,7,17 February 2021,"Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) is the mastermind behind a jewellery heist and recruits 6 men to carry out said heist. However, the heist doesn't quite go to plan and when the men learn that the police were very 'quick' to arrive after the alarm had been raised they smell a rat and suspect someone amongst their group is a police informant...Reservoir Dogs (amongst other Tarantino films) has developed something of a cult following over the years and whilst his films have been a bit hit-and-miss in the intervening years since Reservoir Dogs was made I can still understand why many hold this film in such high regard, even though, to me it is slightly flawed in some areas...The opening scene is something that Tarantino almost prided himself on; rapid-fire pop-cultured filled almost inane dialogue. Sometimes it works and sometimes it feels silly and unnecessary - the opening scene for me fell more in the latter category although I have to admit that it does grab your attention.Away from this scene we move on to the aftermath of the heist; Reservoir Dogs tells the story of the build-up to said heist in a non-linear narrative manner (it's pretty much told back to front, but in its first half the focus is on trying to flush out who ratted on the gang). This works very well at the start of the film as it naturally creates a tense atmosphere and inner conflicts start to surface as a sense of mistrust begins to build amongst the parties. A lot of this is helped by rock-solid performances from Keitel, Buscemi and Madsen; the latter does very well seemingly cool, calm and collected on the surface, but with an underlying kind of psychosis. Madsen is responsible for the film's most memorable and iconic scene - I won't give away what happens, but let's put it this way you'll never think of the song 'Stuck In The Middle With You' in quite the same way after watching this film.Reservoir Dogs cuts back from real-time on occasions and shows how some of the gang are recruited and whilst there's nothing particularly wrong with this approach I didn't really see what it added to the film? The only backstory that was really of any interest was Tim Roth's police informant character - I did want to see how he ingratiated himself with the gang and the way that he prepared himself for going undercover was pretty funny. This is all a matter of opinion, but I personally feel that Roth revealing himself as a police officer came a little too early in the film and robbed the film of some of its intrigue and mystery. Thankfully, Tarantino injects the film with enough pace and pzazz for this not to be a major problem, but I have to admit that for me it did become a little less compelling once this has been revealed.To me, Reservoir Dogs is no masterpiece and would need to be tweaked here and there for it to be considered as one, but I have to admit that it is fast-paced, cool and does contain some truly iconic moments and some very good performances from the majority of the cast. Therefore it is definitely worth watching, but due to the film featuring some quite violent scenes it's definitely not a film that will be suitable for all tastes.",Reservoir Dogs

My love has grown more now for the smart & intriguing storytelling & characters of his underrated Jackie Brown but his low-budget Cracking Crime Thriller RESERVOIR DOGS will always be my favourite Tarantino movie & one of my favourite movies ever!!!! His little Heist Flick is a memorable, iconic & extraordinary piece of filmmaking & one that i hold close to my movie loving heart.
I absolutely love his ""90s Trilogy"" as i call it as each film was outstanding, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown, what a set of films by probably the greatest director of all time!!!Anyway back to the dogs,
I love the ""set in one place"" situation such as the meeting place warehouse where all the intense drama happens after the robbery has gone wrong.TARANTINO shows how great he is from the beginning scene in the Cafe with the crew of criminals chatting & having Coffee together, here the witty & fun dialogue shines right through, it's funny & smart & so different from any other movie as this is a Tarantino movie & it's already unique.I grew up in the 90's & Tarantino was the Coolest Director out there, his films were all hit instant CLASSIC's such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown plus From Dusk Till Dawn that he didn't direct but was a main star in it as well as producing it & he had written it, so Tarantino was huge.
Reservoir dogs remains a tight, intense & powerful Crime Thriller before Tarantino got longer & more talkative with his films, this remains a simple story that's not too long but is filled with Cool characters & excellent performances!!!
Reservoir dogs is a blood soaked masterpiece of Neo noir Crime & great story telling.This is probably still my favourite Tarantino film, I'm huge fan of his work as he is truly a genius but hey each film he crafts is excellent!!!I could watch this movie over & over again it's that great & smart, Reservoir dogs is such a Nostalgic 90's CLASSIC & for a debut film it's pretty much a MASTERPIECE.
I feel a connection with the genius Tarantino as i love movies like he does, i understand that obsession & I'm a movie geek too & i feel much safer in my movie world than i do in the horrible real world, the film world makes sense to me but not reality!!!
The 90's were the best for Tarantino though in my opinion as i have big Nostalgia for his first 3 films. A funny & compelling little low-key Genre film that is basically a cheap B-movie but crafted like a ""big"" movie thanks to the genius of Tarantino.",Reservoir Dogs

It starts out great (I liked those early diner discussions about tipping and the point behind Madonna's ""Like A Virgin""), and the torture sequence featuring Michael Madsen is disturbing and very effective. But there isn't much of a plot to all of the goings on, and the bulk of this picture consists of a lot of aimless cursing and yelling. I tend to think of the excellent PULP FICTION when discussing Quentin's other movies, as that was the first of his films I'd seen, and I fell in love with it...a real work of art, that movie. So after going back and discovering DOGS, it becomes apparent that Tarantino rehashed some of this for FICTION. Maybe ""fine tuned"" a few things. This is evident with moments like the aforementioned discussion and philosophies in the diner. And Tarantino's obviously fond of working with the same actors again and again.RESERVOIR DOGS is an occasionally interesting yet pointless start for the video clerk geek turned director, but he was to really improve and hone his craft with future movies like PULP FICTION and KILL BILL. **1/2 out of ****",Reservoir Dogs

Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel all give first rate performances as the three criminals who arrive first at the predetermined meeting point and immediately begin the investigation to uncover the rat that blew their cover. Strong support is supplied by Michael Madsen, Christopher Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Randy Brooks and Quentin himself.Tarantino employs the blackest of humour, but this movie is especially twisted and bent, far more so the ""Pulp Fiction"". Look out for the scene in which ""Mr. Blonde"" (Madsen) interrogates a cop to the tune of Stealers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle With You"". A warning to the squeamish to close their eyes for that one.""Reservoir Dogs"" is self-indulgent, and too much so. Several scenes have a marked impact and really stand out, while others are far too drawn out and self interested, rather than being the brief, meaningful encounters they should have been. The idea of telling the events non-chronologically works brilliantly however, as it did in ""Pulp"". This method ensures the narrative is full of surprises, and Tarantino astounds us with some wildly unexpected turns in his plot.There's a groovy 70's soundtrack, some stunning cinematography and some reasonable editing to top off this amazing story.Saturday, February 18, 1995 - Video",Reservoir Dogs

The film's biggest issue in the end is its slow nature, or more specifically it's somewhat often slow pacing. However, if you can be patient with the film, it can be incredibly enjoyable. The film is spectacularly acted, with all actors truly giving it their all, most notably Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen. The film is very well written, with some very realistic and often humorous dialogue. The cinematography is often incredible, and its soundtrack is often very impressive. Tarantino's directing style may be very fresh out of the barrel with audiences first experiencing him from this film, but his directing style is no doubt extremely impressive, and thanks to him every small inch of the film seems perfectly tied together. In the end, Reservoir Dogs may not be the most entertaining film from Tarantino, but there is more than enough notable qualities to the film to make for a very enjoyable and well made piece of cinema unlike any other.

94,Steffi_P,"""Are you gonna bark all day or are you gonna bite?""",7,14 December 2011,"If you go on a screen writing course or read a filmmakers manual, it's likely that the one of the first things you will be told is to minimize dialogue to the bare essentials; that film is a primarily visual medium; that the images should be allowed to speak without unnecessary talking. And yet that notion is consistently challenged by one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed directors of the last two decades – Quentin Tarantino. In this, his debut, the dialogue is a constant accompaniment. The only time there is more than ten seconds without a spoken word is the credits.The gangster movie has long had a strong relationship with dialogue. That's one of the reasons there were so many of them in the early talkie era. The wisecracks are part of what makes the genre, and Reservoir Dogs contains some choice lines, like ""You shoot me in a dream you'd better wake up and apologise"". Tarantino – quite deliberately I'm sure – builds the story around numerous gangster clichés. Mr White, the hood with too much humanity. Mr Blond, the sociopathic killer. Mr Orange, the ""rat"". The dialogue is often used, not just to throw in some tough guy banter, but to add layers to these gangland relationships. Mr Orange tells the rest of the gang the ""commode story"" in order to convince them he's a real criminal. The story itself is about a narrow escape with some drugs under the noses of a bunch of cops. Meanwhile the cops in this fictional episode are talking about ""a civilian who came this close to getting blown away"". The anecdote-within-an-anecdote gives a tense commentary upon Orange's tenuous position.Another advantage of this dialogue-based approach is that there is a lot of information for the actors to play upon and a lot of time to get into their roles. Harvey Keitel is very impressive, personifying the honourable mobster. Lawrence Tierney, who was playing lead men of dubious morality four decades earlier, clearly knows just what his character is about, and portrays the formidable crime boss with laid-back ease. Michael Madsen is simply perfect as the creepy, quiet type (although quiet type in this context only means he pauses for breath between lines), giving off an intense presence while barely making a move. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth both overact a little, although admittedly in Buscemi's case it is to good effect in depicting the weasely character, and even when Roth is waxing lyrical he makes you realise how poetic some of this dialogue is. Maybe it needs a bit of theatricality.Despite of his writing so much wordage for his own movie, Tarantino is still very much a visual director, whose camera seems to be finding angles on the action other than those which focus directly on the actors as they're talking. You have for example the wheeling camera in the opening scene, Tarantino's voice disembodied, a long-shot down the corridor as Keitel and Buscemi discuss their predicament, and the lengthy close-up on Keitel as Buscemi rants offscreen. Actually, these are techniques you see an awful lot in very early sound movies around 1930, when sound itself was seen as more of a gimmick than something fully integrated. It's as if the dialogue has its own entity, gliding over images like that radio show soundtrack.And indeed, a lot of the dialogue is simply there for effect. The essential exposition lines are all there as they should be, but unlike a more typically sparse screenplay, they are buried amongst reams of chitchat that serves only to amuse the audience and add realism and depth to the world in which the story takes place. Tarantino's opening spiel about Madonna's Big Dick is a prime example – completely irrelevant to plot or themes, uttered by a character who does barely anything else of significance in the whole rest of the movie. It seems it is just a funny little observation that Tarantino wanted to say (and, appropriately enough, it is literally him saying it). What we are witnessing with Reservoir Dogs is the beginning of dialogue for dialogue's sake.",Reservoir Dogs
95,ShootingShark,You Don't Believe In Tipping ?,7,18 August 2011,"When a diamond heist goes badly wrong, the gang meet back at a warehouse and try to figure out what happened. Is there a traitor in their midst ?Reservoir Dogs is one of those truly great debut movies, like Citizen Kane or A Bout De Soufflé or The Evil Dead. Tarantino was just twenty-eight when he made it and his talent shines out, not just in his razor-sharp script and stylish touches, but also in his production smarts. He uses suspense and shocks expertly to keep us riveted despite the fact that the whole movie pretty much plays in one room. He cleverly alludes to events that we don't see, thereby keeping costs and down and retaining the creative control so crucial to his vision. What I love most about the movie though is its originality. It may pay homage to earlier heist flicks (notably The Killing and The Taking Of Pelham 123) but it's like no other crime film before or since. Characters argue about whether or not Pam Grier was on a TV show. The time line shoots all over the shop but we never feel wrong-footed. A droll DJ (the noted comic Steven Wright) plays catchy music by bands you've never heard of with names like George Baker Selection, Stealers Wheel and Blue Swede. There's more blood than a Herschell Gordon Lewis film. Everyone wears suits, except for the late great Chris Penn (his best performance in an amazing career), who wears a blue tracksuit that must be seen to be believed. The finale is about the most ambiguous in all cinema. It's great. Everybody is terrific in it, as is the delineation of the characters. Mr White is the straight-ahead tough guy, Mr Pink is the only one with any brains, Mr Blonde is the psycho and Mr Orange is the fink. Tierney - the star of 1945's Dillinger - has a wonderful turn as Joe the kingpin. Tarantino winds them up and then lets them go, slicing into each other with fizzing little soliloquies that are still buzzing in our heads when we're onto the next one. It's also highly funny in spite of the grim nature of the story; in a weird way it reminds of the Black Knight sequence in Monty Python And The Holy Grail - characters arguing with each other about details whilst they bleed to death. It's hard to believe this movie is now twenty years old, since it still seems as fresh and gripping as the day it was made. It's a modern crime classic, a bravura piece of ensemble macho man acting, and a stunningly brilliant first film from a director in full command of cinematic form.",Reservoir Dogs
96,adamjohns-42575,Typical Tino,4,25 June 2020,"In contrast to the film I watched last night this film did not make me wonder why it had been so long since I'd last seen it or feel bad that I'd left it so long, however that film being Amelie, is of a very different genre and to be honest way more to my street.
I am not a fan of many of Quentin's works with the exceptions of Kill Bill and From Dusk Till Dawn and he really does have a face you want to slap, which fortunately you don't see much in this film, but I wanted to watch it again to see if I had been doing it an injustice all these years as I haven't watched it since about 1994?I have to say I'm still not in to the fast talking, shouting and screaming blue murder at each other type film (I actually had to put the subtitles on to understand anything Mr Pink said). Nor am I a fan of gun fighting, blood and gore violence, so I will admit that this film is not aimed at people like me. If you are of the same mind, don't bother with it.
However with that said, I can see why it is so well reputed. I liked the styling of the film and the fact that although it is all about a diamond heist, you only get to see the results of how it all turns out and a bit of the prep.
The cast all play their parts well and I like the fact that it is not linear, which I never normally say, but it was actually done with care in this one, showing you what you needed to see when it was relevant not just as it happens.I do have to say that it didn't really feel like there was a lot of point to it until they started to investigate Mr Orange's character in his own slot and I was prepared to mark it down for lack of story, but it really picked up after that point.It doesn't score highly for me, as it's not my type of film, so please don't be put off if you like a shoot 'em up full of blood and the f word!",Reservoir Dogs
97,truemythmedia,Stuck in the middle with you...,9,25 July 2019,"Overall Reservoir is a fine, nay, excellent piece of film for any cinephile and casual movie watcher alike. It's a different take on the gangster genre, one that shows the human behaviors of the criminals rather than following the cops. It's filled with humor, drama and great deal of blood, showcasing the early stages of a this masterful writer/director. It's hard to believe this is a debut film, from the expertly crafted dialogue, to the fairly minimal storytelling, one that comes forward in the character revelations, which are abundant. With only a few missteps, mainly some overacting this is a truly great gangster film and one that started the impressive career of Quentin Tarantino.

98,a_chinn,Taratino's debut still holds up as a classic crime film,10,15 October 2017,"I remember walking out of the theater after seeing this film the first time and telling my friend, ""If I ever make a movie, I'd want it to be something like this!"" Quentin Tarantino's movie obsessed personality completely clicks for me, with a fondness for exploitation and genre cinema, but balanced with a respect and understanding of classic and foreign cinema. ""Reservoir Dogs"" offers a perfect cocktail mix of pulp and art, equal parts Don Siegel and Joseph H. Lewis, but also equal parts Jean-Pierre Melville and David Mamet. The story is a straightforward heist film, but what Tarantino does differently is how he structures his story. Fro one, he never shows the actual heist and a majority of the film is the events following the failed heist, with flashbacks to events prior to said heist. Flackbacks have become a trademark of Tarantino's, but he uses them in a way that serves the story, providing necessary information for the audience at a specific time. Another major departure from standard heist films is Tarantino's dialogue, which is amazingly sharp and fun to listen to. No one write like he does, though he has plenty of imitators who've attempted to mimic his voice, it's a kind of artificial movie-speak that will either delight or annoy filmgoers. When you top all that off with an amazing cast, that includes Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, and classic film heavy Lawrence Tierney, it's hard to imaging this film going far wrong. Of special note, Madsen especially gives good in a can't-take-your-eyes-off-of-him performance as the psychotic Mr. Blond. Much like Anthony Perkins' performance in ""Psycho,"" this role for Madsen pretty much typecast him as a smiling villain for much of his career. Tarantino has been called out for copying much of the plot of Ringo Lam's Hong Kong action film ""City on Fire."" Without revealing any spoilers, the story is undeniably similar, right down to some very specific scenes. However, as good a film as ""City on Fire"" is, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is soooo much better. Tarantino clearly lifted many story elements from that film, but he used them to make a much stronger film. Re-watching this film now, another fun element is you get to watch Tarantino's cinematic universe begins to take shape, with character being potentially related to or appearing to other Tarantino stories, with the names Alabama (""True Romance""), Vega (""Pulp Fiction""), Skagnetti (""Natural Born Killers""), Marvin Nash (""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Pulp Fiction"") all getting mentioned at one point or another. But as I wrote at the top of this review, Tarantino completely has my number and his sensibilities seem perfectly in sync with my own, which is probably why I see ""Reservoir Dogs"" as a true cinematic classic.",Reservoir Dogs
99,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid First Film from a Great Filmmaker,8,1 October 2021,"I first saw this movie in high school. I knew it was good but it didn't have an impact. I'm assuming we talked through it. Coming in this time, I'm not sure I've seen this all the way through paying attention. It did start coming back as I'm watching.What this has though is great acting. Harvey Keitel plays so well off Steve Buscemi. What I like is being in on the truth and looking back at conversations between characters. This is really a no honor amongst thieves tale.There is also good cinematography and effects. You can see the makings of a filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino.",Reservoir Dogs
100,Samiam3,"Gritty, realistic, very good",8,21 July 2009,"Reservoir Dogs is a very misanthropic picture, but very strong and convincing. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, I do not believe for a moment that Tarantino took pleasure in the violence he was orchestrating for this picture, although I'm sure many would disagree. There is no wit, no jokes, no heroism or mannerism, What Tarantino gives us is very primal and visceral but remarkably real.The story follows the aftermath of a jewelry heist gone wrong. Five out of eight robbers (one who is badly wounded) hide out in a vacant warehouse and try to figure out what went wrong. They begin to suspect that one of them is a rat. Each character gets a flashback told from his point of view, showing how he became part of the operation. One has to respect Tarantino for the risks he is taking. Considering it is his first film as a director, one might think he would want to do something that attracts an audience rather than repulses them. Tarantino turns so many things on end, making Reservoir Dogs a very difficult film to watch, but it should not be dismissed as bad. It is an impressive movie, but not one for the light hearted. View only if you think you are ready.",Reservoir Dogs
101,davidmvining,A good first film,7,25 November 2019,"The thing that makes this movie work at all is its structure. I can imagine this same movie arranged chronologically and it would be a slog. It doesn't help that it was obviously written with this structure in mind, but even taking that into account, the second half would be just too much.It really starts with the opening scene. In a ""normal"" movie, this scene would be much shorter and much more perfunctory. It's the scene right before a heist begins, the final moments before the gang gets into the car and heads to the robbery. Here, we don't really know what they're gathered for. Instead, it's just eight guys sitting around a table talking. We start with something so off the wall (a discussion of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"") that it really feels like a bunch of guys just talking over breakfast. The scene overall does two things, though, it introduces us to the characters (with a focus on a handful instead of everyone) and it is filled with foreshadowing.The most famous example is Mr. Orange immediately calling out Mr. Pink for not contributing to the tip (meaning Mr. Orange is the undercover cop), but the more interesting bit is Mr. Pink's insistence on not tipping. It's a wonderful moment of character and foreshadowing at once. On first viewing, it seems extraneous and paints Mr. Pink in a terrible light. However, what it does is shows that Mr. Pink is willing to question everything about a situation. Why do we tip waitresses but not workers at McDonald's? he asks. Whatever the actual answer is to that specific question, it shows that he's willing to step back and question things, so when the survivors of the botched robbery gather at the abandoned warehouse, he's the one asking the right questions. It's a wonderful set up for Mr. Pink.Anyway, the structure does more than that one scene, obviously. The majority of the film takes place in one location, the abandoned warehouse. If the movie were to take place chronologically, the last 60% or so of the film would be in one place, only going outside for brief moments here and there. It would monotonize the visual look of the film as well as the tone. It's high strung yelling, pleading, and threatening from the moment Mr. White bursts into the place with Mr. Orange bleeding out over his arm. Roughly 55 minutes of that would become almost intolerable, but because that is told in order (limiting confusion about the events in the warehouse) and we cut from there to moments in the past for three characters (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Orange) that are significantly lighter in tone.Those flashbacks (and one flashback within the flashback for Mr. Orange) provide more than just a lighter tone, though, they further provide character information that helps flesh out most of the gang. Mr. White gives bits of his backstory and we understand his relationship to Joe and Eddie, the two running the operation. We see how Mr. Blonde kept his mouth shut in prison and how Joe and Eddie are grateful for it. We also see how Mr. Orange learned his part and ingratiated himself with the crew enough to become part of the job.The only real problems I have are the fact that Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown are largely afterthoughts and the lack of emotional connection with the rest of the characters. Mr. Blue seems to be a red herring for who could the rat be (since we don't find out Mr. Orange is the rat until more than halfway through the film), but he barely makes an impression when he's on screen and he's barely talked about when he's off screen. Mr. Brown seems to be little more than cannon fodder (and an excuse for Quentin Tarantino to say ""dicks"" a whole lot on screen). The rest of the characters, though, while they do get time to differentiate and grow themselves, don't create strong attachments with the audience (at least this audience), so when they all die in the end, it doesn't hit that hard.Shot selection is carefully arranged with intelligent use of a combination of wide, medium, and close shots at the appropriate times. Entire scenes play out in wide shots except for the heightened emotional moments that go in close. Performances are good, though because so much of the film happens at the same tenor, it's hard to tell how good they are. Still, it's a striking debut from an obviously talented filmmaker.",Reservoir Dogs

He seems to take a lot of great ideas from fantastic, exploitation films and turn them in some type of video geek fantasy. When 'Reservoir Dogs' blasted onto the scene, he was totally fresh, sharp and with such an original, dynamic script. With a fine collection of actors such as Harvey Keitel and the brilliant Buscemi, this remains one of the most important films of the 90's.

105,Movie-ManDan,Tarantino Starts Strong.,9,11 December 2014,"What is a Reservoir Dog? Michael Madsen is one of them. Steve Buscemi is another. What does a reservoir dog mean? I don't know. Tarantino has said during interviews how he got the name but never exactly said the meaning. I don't care what it means, because that's an awesome sounding name! And the Dogs themselves have an awesome image. So the viewer will be suckered into seeing an independent masterpiece. Tarantino knows how to advertise well. All he did was use a bunch of recycled stories and mesh them together to create this. Tarantino had been a movie buff his whole life with no formal or professional training or education in the business. He would just make movies with his friends and gain experience that way. While Reservoir Dogs is probably his easiest film, it is not his worst.Reservoir Dogs has a very simple concept: six criminals (Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Madsen, Bunker, Tarantino) are gathered by a gangster and his son (Tierney, Penn) to pull off a major jewel heist. Everything that could go wrong, does as they discover a rat is among them. These kinds of movies have been done, good and bad ones. Even the bad ones hold some suspense as the viewer is curious to see who the bad guy is. Tarantino, being the genius that he is, gives away who the rat is about midway through, but is able to hold the same amount of suspense by showing the movie out of order and the Dogs in huge trouble. Tarantino loved showing his movies out of order. It made them much better than they actually were. If this was in order, it would have been just another brutally fun dark-comedy. Tarantino putting the movie out of order is like adding great background music to simple scenes, making them ten-times better than they actually are.Tarantino also introduced his knack for dialogue and characterization. If I'm not mistaken, Reservoir Dogs held a record for most f-words in a feature film at approximately 272. That record was broken by Casino in 1995 and again by Wolf of Wall Street in 2013. When I first saw this, I was shocked to hear the f-word be used that many times. When I watched Casino and Wolf of Wall Street, I wasn't really shocked by the foul language like I was in this. I have seen Reservoir Dogs many times since then and the swearing has gotten less shocking for me. Aside from the abundance of swearing, the general dialogue in which these words are placed in are funny and clever. In the opening scene, they talk about the Madonna song, Like A Virgin. A group of thugs would be talking about something weird like an 80's song in a very derogatory manner. The dialogue paves the way for some cool characters. Most may be stereotypes, but the dialogue makes them rise above traditional stereotypes we all know about.Reservoir Dogs is perhaps best known for its look and style. The Dogs are dressed up in black and white suites with black shades carrying hand-guns. Their hide-out just looks like its the place for a gang-beat to go down. That portion is very iconic and has since it has been mimicked in various games and shows that follow. The rawness and brutality this movie has to offer is what was poked at the most and what I'm poked it. Lots of blood and gore, but very little violence. I have seen this at many video places in the their ""action"" sections. I felt cheated out. A brutal movie with no violence is a weird combo. Lots of people liked it, but I found this to be a case of ""you can't have one without the other.""Anyway, I highly recommend Reservoir Dogs.4/4",Reservoir Dogs
106,RainDogJr,Tarantino's best???? well it's a really hard question,10,15 May 2007,"I saw Death Proof last month and the first person that i want to comment about the film was my cousin, because he is a horror films fan and like me , he loves films and love Quentin Tarantino. The first thing that he told was: Tarantino is in decadence? I say, that Death Proof was a good film but he told that wasn't a Grindhouse film. Well we talk about Tarantino and i think that is difficult for a director to stay in the top for almost 15 years i well, i think that the masterpieces of Tarantino came very early for a regular director. Almost all the greatest directors in all the planet have like a good beginning but later, like 4 films later, it comes their masterpiece, like Scorsese with Taxi Driver, Coppola with The Godfather or Chaplin with City Lights.In my opinion a young director will grow up like 3 or 4 films later but i doesn't means that their first works aren't good like Mean Steets of Scorsese, that is a great film but is not his best.With Tarantino is was all different: his first film is a classic right now and his second film (i mean Pulp Fiction) is his masterpiece and also a classic.Then Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1 and 2 and now Death Proof are all really great films but for me this 4 films can't be compared whit his first 2 films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.The conclusion of this question that says me my cousin is that: Tarantino makes his best work in his first 3 years like a director with is two masterpieces Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but i don't think that Tarantino is in decadence for a simple reason: His latest works aren't so good like the firsts ones but still are really good films.Sorry and well now about the film Reservoir Dogs: This film contains an excellent cast that includes one of my favorites actors: Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. Also Michael Madsen, Chris Pen and Tarantino are very good but like a surprise the cast isn't the best part of the film, the best part are the dialogs.The dialogs of the song of Madonna or the dialog with Mr Pink about the tips are excellent and really funny.The films is short and you never bored with Tarantino. Excellent performances, excellent debut and is this Tarantino's best?? this is a hard question but i think that the best is Pulp Fiction but Reservoir Dogs is very close.Reservoir Dogs: 10",Reservoir Dogs
107,lemon_magic,Any serious fan of film should see Reservoir Dogs at least once,7,2 September 2006,"Pro: First use of Tarentino's trademark non-linear narrative, which works so seamlessly you aren't even aware of how well he handled it until the story is over.Pro: Terse, snappy, epigrammatic dialog, seemingly more written for a stage play than a movie, filled with hard-boiled cynicism and gallows humor, but still utterly revealing of character and motivation. David Mamet only wishes he could integrate speeches this snappy into his movie screenplays.Pro: Picture perfect performances by Keitel, Buscemi and Tierney;an intermittently great job by Roth; an utterly weird but memorable performance by Madsen, who managed to deliver some utterly over-the-top lines in a believable affectless manner. (The one exception: the keynote line, ""Are you gonna bark, little dog, or are you gonna bite?"" This is perhaps the most famous line in the movie, but really, it's also the worst line in the movie. Steve McQueen couldn't have made that line work, and Madsen can't make it work either.) Pro: Atmospheric and evocative soundtrack, especially the opening Ventures-like rockabilly song from the famous opening ""walking scene"". I don't even like most of these songs from the 70's (or 70's pop music in general), but they all work here.Con: It drags in a few spots, notably the scene with Penn, Madsen and Tierney as they welcome Madsen's character back from prison, and the heist planning scene with all the back-and-forth about assigned aliases. And as much as I admire what they were trying to do with Roth's extended 'anecdote', the story just didn't ring true. Roth reads it well, but the sequence simply goes on too long with too little grit or impact or telling detail. Since the whole point of the anecdote is to deliver the 'telling detail' so it rings true, the whole thing collapses on itself. It's so obviously a 'movie thing', when the same effect could have been achieved with a shorter, punchier aside from the character about how he smacked some cop around and made him cry, etc.Con: Chris Penn's performance is the weakest in the film, partially because the character he plays is something of an idiot and a thick- mouthed goomba. Penn is still a pro level actor, but he just isn't as sharp as the rest of the cast. And this was just about the point in his career when he started expanding like a balloon; it's hard to look at him now when you remember the wiry, vital,young Chris Penn and also know how how he ended up. (Rest In Peace, Chris). Con: Similarly, Tarantino insists on doing cameos to no good purpose in his own films, but he's not charismatic enough to merit the screen time - he's just odd and goofy looking, and he always comes across as an irritating geek. This may well be on purpose, and may be a self-deprecating in-joke on his part, but I can think of a dozen character actors who would have done his role much better - including the older, weathered-looking actor who played ""Mr. Blue"", who had twice Tarentino's class as a screen actor, and should have been given twice as much to do. Con: And lets face it, the whole film is an exercise in hard-boiled outlaw machismo, and Steve McQueen (and Glen Ford and James Cagney and Jack Palance) did it better and did it first...which would have been readily apparent except for the clever story structure and the layered flashbacks.But still, I liked it a lot, and I feel it holds up well more than 10 years after its release. The film itself isn't all that much, but it was the right film for the time, and it made a lot of noise, and Tarantino has spring-boarded to other slicker projects that are a lot of good, irresponsible fun. This is definitely a must for the student and fan of Western pop culture. I would actually rate this something like a ""7.49"", but the rating system doesn't do half stars.",Reservoir Dogs
108,PredragReviews,"""I'm the only one acting like a professional!""",7,15 April 2016,"Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be. It's pretty simple. Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up. With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house. But which one is it? That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.The writing is off the hook. Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue. Why? Because the characters talk like real people. In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme. In this movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing. His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.The cast is terrific. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice. Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role. Buscemi is hilarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen. But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie. But that doesn't change the fact that this is an astoundingly imaginative and well-done movie. It does boast some very difficult- to-watch scenes, but the stark, non-gloss quality of Tarantino's violence is what makes it so remarkable. I think that the fact that the violence in Tarantino's movies *does* inspire reaction from the viewer, and that certain sequences *do* make the viewer uncomfortable, are to the filmmaker's credit. Violence *should* be a bit difficult to watch, instead of being dramatized and glorified by slow-motion and balletic choreography (not that I'm totally opposed to such techniques, if done well, and in the right context.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Reservoir Dogs

I have only seen a handful of QTs films but have been starting to watch the classics like Pulp Fiction since seeing his newest works, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood was his newest film & while not as gory as The Hateful Eight, still delivers a pretty good film.So back to this one, Reservoir Dogs is about a Diamond heist gone wrong. 6 men who don't know eachothers identities find themselves in betrayal siruation, who ratted them out?I found the film to be pretty good. I like the style in both editing & story telling that QTs Films have. The music in the film was good. That razor scene was classic. Only thing I didn't like was the lack of gore the film had. However, the film was still very voilent all the way.Overall, a classic 90s QT Film. 8/10",Reservoir Dogs
111,moviewizguy,Very Overrated,7,3 February 2007,"A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.After reading this plot, you know this is not your average crime film. In fact, I thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film. It has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. This is just my opinion but I should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying.",Reservoir Dogs

Six of them use aliases: Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, and Mr. White. The others are mob boss Joe Cabot, the organizer of the heist, and his son and underboss, ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabot.After the heist, White drives Orange to the rendezvous, an empty warehouse. Orange is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. Pink arrives, agitated; he believes the job was a setup and that the police had the diamond store staked out. White tells Pink that Brown was killed while escaping and that Blue is presumed dead. They discuss Blonde, who murdered several civilians during the heist; White is angry that Joe, an old friend, employed such a ""psychopath"". Pink reveals that he escaped with the diamonds and hid them in a secure location. They argue over whether to take the unconscious Orange to a hospital.Blonde arrives and tells them to wait for Eddie. He reveals he has taken a police officer, Marvin Nash, hostage in his trunk; they beat Nash in an attempt to discover the informant. Eddie arrives and orders Pink and White to help him retrieve the diamonds and dispose of the hijacked vehicles, while Blonde stays with Nash and Orange. Alone with Blonde, Nash denies knowledge of a setup. Blonde is uninterested and tortures Nash for his own amusement, severing his ear with a straight razor.

114,DeeNine-2,The delineation of violence,7,13 July 2001,"Future historians may well look back at the cinema of the nineties in the United States and wonder why it spawned so many movies that seemed to celebrate gratuitous violence while catering to an audience fascinated with gore. (I have some ideas on this, but I'll skip them here.) Some may say this is nothing new, that there has always been gore in the movies, that the horror flick is a standard genre, and that, at any rate, human beings are quite naturally interested in violence because even if it is rare in their suburban experience, when it does occur it is of overriding significance.When historians do look back they will surely take a gander at this film, director Quentin Tarantino's celebrated breakout cult classic. Anyone reading this has already seen the movie or certainly knows about its content. It contains one of the most unredeeming scenes of sadistic violence ever to strike the silver screen. It depicts a world in which men stick their guns out at each other the way little boys play.... It is a world in which women exist only on the periphery (like an old war movie there are virtually no women in the film), a world in which men are constantly preoccupied with macho notions and the phenomena of male bonding to the exclusion of anything else. The behavior of the men while superficially realistic is actually stylized in the extreme. Anything and everything may set a man off. His ego is under continual fire, his manhood is constantly being tested. Life is short, brutal and bestial.Question: where did this vision come from, and why did it resonate so strongly with an audience, and what is that audience? It can be said that Reservoir Dogs appeals primarily to young men and teenaged boys, who are preoccupied with coming to grips with violence because it represents an important part of their lives, and how they might relate to violence is an essential part of their self discovery. This is true, but it is not the whole story. After all, as I write this, Reservoir Dogs is the 58th most popular movie of all time according to votes tabulated at the International Movie Database web site, IMDb.com. Even given that there is still a male bias on the web, this is an extraordinarily high rating for the first film of any director and for such a low budget enterprise.Part of the explanation for the near reverence shown this film lies not in the blood-letting and the macho posturing, but in a story well told, well-plotted and of characters well-drawn and especially the indelible acting performances from most of the cast. Harvey Kietel as a hardened criminal with a soft heart, and Steve Buscemi as the amoral Mr. Pink, and Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde and Chris Penn as the slightly soft and slightly spoiled son of a criminal father and Tim Roth as the high wire acting Mr. Orange, really rivet us to the screen. The professional cadre of criminals depicted here, the cheap thugs and psychopathic killers, are well realized and their life styles and preoccupations well delineated. Tarantino begins with a scene in which the boys around some tables in a cafe ""analyze"" Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" in manner that might be described as Oxford don crude. They continually espouse the racist, sexist macho values of the criminal underclass, in which loyalty to the band and bravery under fire are the highest values, while cowardice and ""turning rat"" are the lowest. Furthermore the script is punctuated with sick little jokes (e.g., about the imagined nature of black women), and wryly obscene juxtapositions, notably the macabre dance of Mr. Blonde to the radio playing ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" as he tortures the cop. Finally there is the structure of the film itself in which time is splintered and events are recalled and presented not chronologically, but according to the logic of the film itself. This technique allows Tarantino great freedom of expression and emphasis.Okay, so why am I only giving this three stars? Mainly because, while the treatment was striking and original, the story and the milieu presented were not. And some of this was unrealistic to the point of annoyance. That Mr. Orange did not bleed to death or at least go into shock and faint dead away with a gaping hole in his stomach is beyond me. And the ""neat"" karmic ending was more than a little far fetched. And all those stylized speeches!You'd think part of this was written for the Shakespearean stage. Indeed, although Tarantino may not realize it, he owes something to the Bard. Didn't Hamlet end much the same way with dead bodies all over the stage? Additionally, while Tarantino's vision appeals strongly to his targeted audience (and his own psyche), it does not relate well with a larger audience. The last thing a man of my age is concerned about is how macho he might be. Such concerns seem childish. And the nature and phenomenon of human violence is very far from a mystery to me; furthermore I know very well exactly how I feel about violence and how I might react in the face of it. I think if I had seen this movie when I was seventeen, I might have been stunned and thrilled with its power. Seeing it in my middle years leaves me a little cold.Incidentally I agree with those who say that this is a greater artistic achievement than the ""Hollywoodized"" Pulp Fiction (1995), also directed by Tarantino.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Reservoir Dogs
115,sme_no_densetsu,Hot Dog,8,24 September 2009,"Quentin Tarantino's debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"" has earned the status of modern classic since its release seventeen years ago. Along with ""Pulp Fiction"" it inspired countless imitators that have faded into obscurity while the originators remain as fresh as ever.The story is pretty simple. A jewellery heist goes horribly wrong and the surviving thieves suspect that one of their group is an undercover cop. The question is: Which one?The cast is pretty solid for an independent film. In my mind, Harvey Keitel leads the way while Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn & Lawrence Tierney lend quality support. Tim Roth I can take or leave and the rest of the performances are nothing special.Tarantino's direction is skillful here though it doesn't show quite the same polish as his later efforts. His biggest contribution to the film is in his script, which not only presents a compelling story but does so with that trademark Tarantino knack for dialogue. And who can forget soundtrack selections like ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" by Stealers Wheel and ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection?In the end, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a top-notch heist flick that is arguably Tarantino's best film next to ""Pulp Fiction"". I recommend it without reservation.",Reservoir Dogs
116,Howlin Wolf,Takes numerous influences and moulds them into something superb...,10,17 February 2002,"With ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino created a heist film of spectacular impact.  The audience is thrown straight into the action and through clever dialogue quickly becomes attached in some way (even if it be hate) to the characters.  We learn much of what we are shown before we are shown it, but our interest is not diluted because of Tarantino's proficiency at his craft. Credit must also go to the fantastic ensemble of actors who breathe life so vividly into their characters.   This effort supercedes all that Tarantino has done up until the time of writing.  Its curious and seemingly contradictory blend of amateur style shooting (No doubt caused by the seediness of the warehouse as the main locale) and yet ultimately professional final production make this a more INTENSE watch than ""Pulp Fiction"" et al.  It's less about trying to be 'cool', and more about trying for naturalism, with 'cool' nevertheless still being the inevitable result.   A film that's impossible to ignore if you have any love for cinema as a medium.  You may hate it, but it would be foolish to deny that it deserves its place in film history as being a monumental surprise when it was released.   In my opinion, this is classic film-making from the modern era.",Reservoir Dogs

118,Screen_Blitz,"Quentin Tarantino's mobster flick is very violent and bloody, but superbly entertaining",9,7 March 2015,"Quentin Tarantino has scaled the ladder of Hollywood filmmakers since his directorial debut in 1992. With his unique style of filmmaking and writing, Tarantino has established himself as a masterful Hollywood mogul. Although his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction' placed the director in the front ranks of Hollywood filmmakers, it was this brutal crime- drama that place Tarantino in the cinematic radar. Blossoming with a cutthroat script, audacious humor, and a masterfully artistic representation of violence, this mobster drama showcases the fine director's snappy filmmaking talent in arguably one of his most polishes forms yet. It is violent, it is brutal, and it is darkly funny in shocking ways. Most importantly, it is a raw gangster flick that pays a fair amount of homages to the classic film-noir genre of the 50s and 60s, and that is only half of what makes this movie subversively entertaining. This film stars Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, a mob boss who hires a group of gangsters under the names Mr. White (played by Harvey Keital), Mr. Blonde (played by Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (played by Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (played by Quentin Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (played by Edward Bunker) to rob a jewelry store in attempt to their hands on some precious diamonds. When the robbery goes terribly wrong and Mr. Orange is severely wounded, the criminals grows suspicious each other, believing one of them is backstabbing traitor. From there on, tension rise to violent consequences.Tarantino supplies an incredible surplus of substance and flair in this violent ""whodunit"" caper story. This film opens with a scene of our characters gathered up a diner where we are treated with a bold, yet darkly humorous introduction of the characters before they embark on their dangerous heist. When the heist turns to chaos and Tim Roth's character takes a bullet to the chest, that is when the plot kicks into gear. The driving force behind the plot is the visceral tension that grows between the characters as they each suspect that one of them is a mole. This soon accounts to a series of verbal spars supplemented with audacious dialogue and tension that leads to unpredictable bloodbaths. One scene in particularly involves a tied-up police officer who is unfairly treated to one of the cruelest (and most graphic) methods of torture ever put to screen. With the most of the action taking place in an abandoned warehouse, the violent tension greatly builds up to the shocking climax which demonstrates the nihilistic nature of the characters. While things go escalate far into mean-spirited territory that can e uncomfortable for the weak stomach, Tarantino never attempts to dive into the realm of exploitation. Although the none of the characters are particularly likable for their obvious moral depravity and ruthless personalities, Tarantino does a fairly decent job at keeping the characters interesting. The cast of made of a roster of inspiring actors who exhibit incredible performances that make a good equation of the characters' memorability. Lawrence Tierney as the mob boss and Chris Penn as his son deliver strong performances for their limited time on screen. Acquiring the most screen time is Harvey Keitel who demonstrates plenty of grit and energy in his role. The same can be mentioned for Steve Buscemi who takes a stab at some bold humor, mostly during the opening scene in the diner. Tim Roth gives a solid performance for a role that restrains him to lying in a pool of blood after his suffers a bullet wound. He does a marvelous job at displaying a realistic sense of agony for someone who's met the wrong end of a firearm. Michael Madsen is steals the show with his sadistic role as the mean-spirited member of the group who takes a cringe-inducing joy in sadism, particularly in one scene. Then there is Edward Bunker and Quentin Tarantino himself -- both of whom share a very limited amount of screen time but nonetheless make good work of the small roles they are pitted with. It is hard to say whether any of these performances are Oscar-worthy, but for they these actors accomplish, they will keep your eyes glued to the screen.Reservoir Dogs is a raw, violent, and bloody crime thriller that is superbly entertaining from start to finish, and displays Quentin Tarantino operating at one of his finest forms yet. With no surprise, this film is highly unlikely to be a welcoming experience for those who can't stomach blood-spewing violence and gleeful profanity. For everyone else, this is an entertaining picture for the crime genre.",Reservoir Dogs
119,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,In typical Tarantino fashion: it's GREAT!,10,30 September 2016,"Reservoir Dogs could almost be adapted into a stage-play thanks to its minute scale yet very lively characters and script. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make non-linear stories flow well and never feel jarring with leaping from beat-to-beat.Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Harvey Keitel are phenomenal as Mr Orange, Mr Blonde and Mr White respectively. They're all so cynical and the passive subtexts in their dialogue aimed at each other shows how full of nuance the film is rich with.

120,oneguyrambling,Tarantino's spectacular debut.No-one makes flicks like this anymore - even Tarantino.,9,20 April 2012,"At some point in time Quentin Tarantino stopped being the director who could be the next great and started being the director who thought he was the current great.And he was right. But it wasn't good for him.It was at this point – shortly after Jackie Brown by my reckoning – that QT ceased simply reading his own press and started writing it.Since then Tarantino does more press for his own films in the years before they come out than any other director, always gushing about other B movies, exploitation 'classics' and obscure foreign films, before effortlessly segueing back to 'and that's the thing with my new film, I'm bringing back South Korean carwash slashers from the 70s, only I'm using the backdrop of chimpanzee trainers in love'.It suddenly became less about how good the film was and more about the sources of inspiration and which 'now' actor was in it alongside the inevitable face that QT dragged in from the past.This is all well and good – unless you want me to start on about Death Proof and how Inglourious Basterds is an over-rated piece of crap – but Reservoir Dogs was pretty damning good before people could pronounce Tarantino, and compared to his more recent output it only looks better. Mr Brown. Mr White. Mr Orange. Mr Blue. Mr Blonde. Mr Pink. Six guys in black suits, white shirts and black ties. They have breakfast with grizzled old guy Joe and track suit wearing Eddie, holding rambling conversations talking about a variety of subjects in dialogue peppered with obscenities and refreshingly non-script sounding lines. They exit the diner and head on down the street side by side, chuckling all the way.They are heading to rob a jewelers. A robbery that goes horribly wrong, leaving innocent bystanders, criminals and police alike scattered dead in the streets.The bulk of the film deals with the aftermath of the robbery.I will leave the names aside, needless to say that the cover shows Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen as headliners, they all play key roles. There are long intense scenes with heated dialogue while the survivors discuss the possibility of being set up, which is eminently possible given that none of the gents with 'colourful' names know each other, having all been teamed up for this one off job.This also means that none of the men spare any niceties or pull any punches in casting about their allegations and accusations, leading to fist fights and inevitably the drawing of handguns – we're in the US after all.The soundtrack music is exceptional and the sleepy drawl of fictional DJ K-Billy (Steven Wright) punctuates some quiet moments with amusing snippets usually preceding well chosen tracks.The camera work at the time was fresh and new – even if most of it was allegedly stolen from Asian filmmakers like John Woo – and the back and forth editing was a little disconcerting at first but undoubtedly exciting, far from the overdone device that it has since become, even by Mr Tarantino himself. (There is even a flashback within a flashback!) The acting is excellent, Roth, Buscemi and Madsen made instant names for themselves and Keitel did nothing to sully his all time great reputation, the minor roles were all well cast and equally well acted, which in a film light on for car chases and shootouts is quite important. Again it must be mentioned that this was before Tarantino started such indulgent sh*t like 'The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino', so everything is lean, mean and efficient, honed to a fine edge.The low budget nature of the film is rendered irrelevant by the plot which lends itself well to only a few sets and backdrops, and when the dialogue is as crackling as that on display here the lack of car chases and large explosions is hardly missed.I think it is fair – and obvious – of me to say that I think QT has more than just rested on his laurels since his early hungry days, but credit where credit is due, others have made Tarantino-esque stuff in the last 15 years, including QT himself, but no-one has managed to top Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction yet, and it's fine with me if they never do.Final Rating – 9 / 10. The older it gets the better it is. Reservoir Dogs is like an old song now, you know practically every line and there are no surprises, but when it is on the TV / radio you can't change the station.",Reservoir Dogs
121,Sirus_the_Virus,"It's not Tarantino's best, but it is still fantastic.",10,24 December 2009,"Quentin Tarantino's first film, Resovoir dogs is a film of trust. It's also a film of style, dialogue, and violence. Resovoir dogs has a great soundtrack. A great story. Though I don't think it's his best. My favorite of his are Jackie Brown and Pulp fiction. This film has a plot, and it's never boring. But it's not as good as Pulp fiction, Jackie Brown, and some of his other masterpieces. Resovoir dogs is a classic about a group of guys who go to rob a bank and it turns into a bloody ambush. There are six men who go in. Only four of them lived. So the ones that survive suspect that one of them is a cop. You find out who the cop is rather soon, but it goes back to the characters(whose code names are all colors)to show more about them.Surely this film has it's share of violence. Sure it has it's share of laughs and dialogue and action. But the thing that I loved about it is that Harvy Keitel's character Mr. White, who has been comforting Mr. Orange(played by Tim Roth). Even when Mr. Orange is accused of being the cop, he denies every word of it. I loved the film no doubt about it. I love all of Tarantino's films. This one is probably the most overrated. Jackie Brown being the most underrated. It doesn't matter though. Both films are fantastic, no doubting it. Resovoir dogs:****/****",Reservoir Dogs

We're supposed to bow down to the god of guts and gore because it's all so well pieced together and film noir-ey.I watched Reservoir Dogs 23 years ago, and my impression is still one of heartache. I felt as if I had wandered into a battlefield, and I hadn't been drafted, nor had I volunteered. This trash has no-- scratch that--negative redeeming social value, unless, of course, you enjoy watching an LAPD uniformed officer, captured by Michael Madsen, get his ear cut off.Good God, what makes people think Tarantino is anything other than a pornographer? I find almost everything he has ever done disgusting and a supreme waste of my valuable time.I know that makes me a provincial redneck, an illiterate buffoon, a, a conservative, but I like to think that, usually, implied violence is more effective than the lurid, the exposed, the defiled, and the exsanguinated.",Reservoir Dogs
123,bobsgrock,A very strong debut.,8,12 May 2008,"Quentin Tarantino never ceases to amaze and stun with his films, and this is never more true than in his debut as writer/director of this American crime classic about seven men attempting to pull off the perfect jewel caper, but something goes terribly wrong. They suspect there is a rat informer among them, but who? What makes Reservoir Dogs so memorable is that it is so unlike any other crime drama, yet it fits that genre so well. It is violent, but only in a few scenes and the most horrific occurs off-screen. This film is unique because it tells the story backwards and gives us a better picture of the seven men and their interactions rather than the event that is the holdup. AS expected, the dialogue is the best part of the film and some of the best you will ever hear. The acting is very good as well, especially Michael Madsen as the calm, quiet, psychopathic Mr. Blonde, and Lawrence Tiereny as the head man Joe Cabbot.

126,baumer,Tarantino is a lyrical genius,10,15 May 2000,"I consider myself to be a film buff, a lover of the cinema, maybe even an addict.  I will see a film because it is a film.  For example, I knew I was going to hate the Virgin Suicides and I saw it anyway.  I have heard nothing positive of Battlefield Earth and I am heading there after this review is completed.  And on this logic alone I rented Reservoir Dogs for the first time in 1993.  I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.  Because by the time Pulp Fiction came out Tarantino had penned the story for a brilliant True Romance and for Natural Born Killers and he had a few hysterical cameos in films like Sleep With Me where he attacked famous films like Top Gun and what they really meant.After I was swept away with Pulp Fiction, I went back and watched Reservoir Dogs again and this time I saw something that I didn't or couldn't see before.  I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it is that I didn't see it's brilliance before but I just didn't.  But Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best movies ever by a new comer.  Forget how it is directed because it's direction is fine, but what Reservoir Dogs has that is sheer brilliance is an ear for dialogue.  There is not one character in this film that doesn't have at least one insightful thing to say.  Even Tarantino gives himself some great dialogue with his take on Madonna's Like A Virgin, or his displeasure with his given name by Joe ( ""Mr. Brown sounds too much like Mr. Shit!).There are certain films that perhaps should be mandatory viewing at film school, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs should be two of them.  This is one of those films that if perhaps you didn't quite like or understand the first time around, you should see again.  It hits you like an epiphany the second time.  In Tarantino's world, people are never one dimensional.  They have things to say whether it is about tipping or the name of an actress, or the rants of Nice Guy Eddie talking about them having places all over of the place.  I would love to see Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino get together and write a film.  It would probably be the funniest yet most serious film that has ever been made and it would certainly be one of the most entertaining.Reservoir Dogs is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and you can always catch something that you never caught the last time.  This is truly one of the finest films ever made and if you haven't seen it in quite some time, do yourself a favour and rent it.  It is one of a kind.10 out of 10",Reservoir Dogs

129,hall895,"Good, but missing a certain something",7,29 August 2005,"Reservoir Dogs has a lot going for it. There's a fabulous cast, a smart and witty script and a circular time line which allows for fascinating twists and turns which would not have been possible were the story told in the traditional manner, from beginning to end. But the film lacks a certain energy pushing it forward. Too often it seems we're going in circles and not really getting anywhere. It's also an unusual film in that instead of seeing the key events we only see conversations in which the characters discuss the key events. It adds a certain air of mystery but the resulting effect is too much talking, not enough doing.The movie revolves around a spectacularly botched diamond heist. As the script bounces back and forth in time we see the planning leading up to the attempted robbery and the bloody aftermath. Bloody is a key word as this movie is drenched in seemingly gallons of blood throughout. Much of the focus of the film is in watching the gang of crooks try to piece together exactly what went wrong. The performances are all terrific. Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth all bring something unique in their respective performances as members of the gang. Lawrence Tierney, for whom the adjective ""crusty"" may have been invented, is quite a presence as Joe Cabot, the man responsible for putting the gang together. And Chris Penn does fine work as Nice Guy Eddie, Joe's son who tries to sort out the mess the robbery has become. It's a stellar collection of actors but unfortunately, other than the wonderfully deranged performance turned in by Madsen, they don't have much to do. They just stand around and talk. And talk, and talk, and talk some more. It's a compelling story, and the unique way in which it is told heightens the drama. But in the end, the payoff is not as great as might have been hoped. Reservoir Dogs is certainly a good film, but greatness eludes it.",Reservoir Dogs
130,one9eighty,"In his first feature-length film, Tarantino delivers a hefty punch to the gut!",8,3 February 2021,"This might not be Quentin Tarantino's first film, but it is certainly his breakthrough feature-length film that earned him plaudits and major recognition. This 1992 film is crime drama/ thriller is about a robbery gone wrong, and how the crooks deal with it in the aftermath. Establishing some of the traits that Tarantino would use in later films, expect to find a non-linear narrative, violent crime, pop culture references, and plenty of strong language.Eight criminals have gathered to do a heist. Led by Joe Cabot and Nice Guy Eddie, the other criminals are using aliases for protection and anonymity; Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr Orange (Tim Roth), Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr Blue (Edward Bunker), and Mr Brown (Quentin Tarantino). After eating their breakfast together, they head off to do perform their part in the seemingly well-orchestrated crime. It goes wrong! White flees with Orange who has been shot in the stomach, they are the first to hit the rendezvous point at one of Joe's warehouses. Pink arrives and tells them the heist must have been a set-up because he felt like the police were already waiting for them. White confirms that Brown is dead, Blue, and Blonde are missing, and that 'oh by the way' White is a ""psychopath"" because he murdered lots of innocent civilians trying to escape. Pink tells White that he has stashed the diamonds from the heist nearby, but they argue about getting medical attention for Orange. During the heat of their argument in steps Blonde, as cool as you like, and he is kidnapped a policeman that he intends to get information out of, and some revenge. Eddie eventually arrives and takes White and Pink to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway cars. With Blonde looking after the cop and Orange things get nasty. Blonde tortures the policeman further, cutting his ear off and the dousing him in petrol with the intention of burning him alive. Before he can do so, Orange regains consciousness and kills Blonde. He confesses to the Policeman that he is in fact an undercover policeman himself, a fact that is already known but not given up during torture. Eddie, Pink, and White eventually returns, whereupon Orange tells them that Blonde went crazy and panned to double-cross them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Not believing this to be true on account of his knowledge of White, Eddie kills the policeman and takes aim at Orange. Joe arrives to tell them that Blue is dead, he is about to kill Orange who he suspects is the traitor, but White steps in and defends him. With guns pointing at different people, a Mexican standoff ensues. Bullets fly - Joe and Eddie are killed, White and Orange are hit and injured. Pink seizes the moment and takes the diamonds and flees for his life. Orange confesses to White that he is in fact an undercover policeman. Heartbroken, White executes Orange, while in the distance Pink is heard fighting with the police who are storming the warehouse.So, how did this film come about. Well, it is no secret that Tarantino is a fan of old movies. He was working in a video store when he wrote this, and he took inspiration from other films he liked. Some critics have stated that he out-right plagiarised other films but stands firm that he paid a homage to other films rather than ripping them off. A lot of influence is taken from ""The Killing"" (1956), ""Kansas City Confidential"" (1952), ""The Big Combo"" (1955), ""Django"" (1966), ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" (1974), and ""City on Fire"" (1987). In his defence, and my view on it, media and art are always influenced by something else, inspiration can certainly create something brand new from time-to-time, but more times than not, and artist needs inspiration from something to be able to make their art. Anyway, Tarantino passed the script he had written to Lawrence Bender who played the policeman who chases Mr Pink, he gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. He liked it enough to sign up as co-producer which made an easier job finding funding. Instead of the $30,000 Tarantino was going to use, he now had $1.5 million. Keitel paid for casting sessions in New York, where Tarantino and Bender found Buscemi, Madsen, and Tim Roth.The decision to not show the heist is often joked at being a decision influenced by the small budget, but it reports I have read this was a conscious decision. Tarantino wanted the film to be ""about other things"", keeping the heist ambiguous meant it was up to the audience to make of it what they will. Something else Tarantino wanted to achieve was a real-time clock. The events in the warehouse happen in real-time, he uses flashbacks to fill in the story of how the robbers were assembled, but he only uses these flashbacks to fill in the space when nothing is really happening in real-time. A trait that Tarantino films would be recognised for in the future is their cool soundtracks, using music from past decades to good effect. For that reason, you have the likes of The George Baker Selection, Blue Swede, Harry Nilsson, and Sandy Rogers featured in the film and the soundtrack. He uses the music he chooses wisely too, famously in this film there is a fantastic juxtaposition of happy music playing (Stealers Wheel), while Mr Blonde brutally tortures his captive policeman.Recognised as a great film, and possibly one of the most influential films in independent filmmaking of the 1990's, there are a lot of fans of Tarantino's first feature-length film. It feels like a classic noir but updated with modern themes. It's a cops and robbers film, but with more blood and guts. I enjoyed this the first time I watched it in the 1990's, it blew me a way a little seeing so much happen, with so little going on. The dialogue helps with this, the characters are beautifully written. They might be not typically PC by today's standards, but 30 years ago (I am writing this in 2021), they were the right kind of seedy gangster types that were more prevalent than some of the mobsters you might expect to see in the likes of ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""Mean Streets"" (1973), or ""Goodfellas"" (1990). The twists and turns that feature in the film are a result of the dialogue - yes there is some action and certainly some shocking moments, but for me the real shocks came from the narrative. The first time I watched this and heard Mr Orange say that he was a policeman I was shocked, let down by him, and equally wanted to put my head in my hands with what it all meant. He played Mr White right to the end of the film, by which point I started to feel sorry for Mr White, and he was a crook.Tarantino's first feature-length film is one of my favourites in his collection. It marks a milestone in film making and really put him under the spotlight. If you have not watched this before it is worth a shot. It is brutal, violent, funny, and intense - I's beautifully written, extremely well-acted, and really delivers a punch to the gut.",Reservoir Dogs

132,aciessi,Defines Tarantino as a Filmmaker,10,21 February 2013,"Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's first motion picture. But even as early as his first try, you can see every element that defines Tarantino as the unmatched filmmaking legend that he is revered as. It just might be the greatest indie film of all time. No budget, no SFX, no big sets and no wide distribution. But the amount of emotion, humor, sadism and reality that this film conveys is more extraordinary than any big name blockbuster. The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience. In fact, the mysteriousness makes it even more entertaining. Also, Reservoir Dogs will always fall under the controversy of being too violent for mainstream audiences, as well as being highly unnecessary. Well, I disagree. Violence is the name of the game in the life of being a Dog. If that means chopping off an ear while dancing to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies, then why not? Reservoir Dogs doesn't exist to share a moral. Rather, it shows to us just how something so right can go so wrong. Even if the right was wrong in the first place. Reservoir Dogs is the precursor to the rest of Tarantino's career, and to get started watching the long journey of his success, make sure you pop in this amazing flick first.",Reservoir Dogs

Although it was never given much promotion upon release, the film was a modest success at the box-office.",Reservoir Dogs
136,jluis1984,A true classic on its own right...,9,8 September 2006,"It seems that it was only yesterday when in 1992 the then unknown director Quentin Tarantino screened his debut film, ""Reservoir Dogs"", at Sundance with great success suddenly becoming the new star of independent cinema and an the most promising director of that ""class of 1992"". Of course, later came ""Pulp Fiction"" and what started as a phenomenon within the indie scene became a worldwide success starting a trend of imitators and making Tarantino a powerful figure in Hollywood. But despite the rights and wrongs of Tarantino's career, the groundbreaking ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a fine example of excellent cinema and a classic of the 90s on its own right.The plot begins with two criminals, codenamed Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arriving to an abandoned mortuary. Orange is badly hurt, and soon we discover that they are members of a group of criminals hired to make a robbery, and that the crime went wrong when the police showed up ending in a shootout where the two of them barely escaped alive. After another survivor, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), arrives, the group realizes that they were set up by an infiltrated agent, but since only their boss knows the details about them (including the real names), anybody in the room could be the traitor. Finally, the arrival of another member, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), complicates the plot, as the other three are sure that he is the one who betrayed them.Without a doubt, ""Reservoir Dogs""' greatest strength is in the remarkably well-written script by Tarantino himself. The four main characters are fleshed out in a way that makes them very real, very human; each of them with a distinct series of personal traits that one can't help to feel that you know really them (something ironic, considering they are supposed not to know each other). The whole situation, built as a heist film where the heist is never seen (only told via flashbacks), makes these four personalities collide and actually the relationships between them become the point of the film itself. It's not about the crime itself, but about the criminals who committed it.Tarantino's skill as a director is nowhere near his skill as a writer, but still he creates a very stylish film letting all his influences flourish, particularly the french new wave and classic noir heist films. Although it's safe to say that here they don't become as blatant as in this later ""genre tribute"" movies ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill"". With very simple, but effective camera-work and a great use of incidental music as a soundtrack, Tarantino crafts a superb film despite its budgetary limitations shows a very promising talent with huge potential as a filmmaker.The four main characters are wonderfully played by a very effective cast of actors. Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) shows off his talent as the experienced Mr. White, who becomes some kind of paternal figure to the newbie Mr. Orange, in another of Tim Roth's excellent performances. Steve Buscemi gives his usual high quality work and the cast is completed by a Michael Madsen with tremendous presence and total control of the screen. Supporting characters are played by the very effective Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Convict-turned-author Eddie Bunker and Tarantino himself appear in small roles with mixed-up results (Tarantino is not really a good actor).The film is remarkably well-done for its budget, and despite being set almost entirely in a single room, it never feels tiresome or boring. Tarantino's violent crime drama has hold up well and personally, it rivals his follow-up, ""Pulp Fiction"", and at times it surpasses it. Some minor flaws include Tarantino's own lack of acting skills and an use of violence (not graphic, but somehow disturbing) that may be excessive to some people (although it fits perfectly within the movie's theme and atmosphere). Almost a flawless film.Wheter one loves or hates Tarantino becomes meaningless at judging this film, its qualities makes it speak for itself as one of the best movies about crime ever made. It's hard to dismiss its raw power and creative craftsmanship. Maybe not a perfect film, but definitely the closest Tarantino has been to make one. 9/10",Reservoir Dogs
137,stamper,The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 2 - His debut: Reservoir Dogs,8,8 January 2004,"This film draws ones attention
Reservoir Dogs is astonishing in so many ways, it is hard to find a beginning, which in this case are the actors. Every film, no matter how good the story, the directing or the effects rises and falls with the quality of actors and the degree to which they are believable. In this film, it is apparent, that all of the actors deliver great performances. There is really nothing else to be said about the acting, for one cannot go and analyze character depth in this film, for the characters as they are presented, are quite shallow. There is some information on some of the characters, but their characteristics as I might describe them here, would have to be based mostly on their actions and doing that would really screw up your viewing experience.
Another really great thing about this film, is it's story, which really is not that special at all when you look at it in retrospective. The story, is basically the typical robbery gone bad, but in this case, the way in which it is told (with a lot flashbacks) increases the excitement and produces not only great tension within the characters, but also within the viewer. Apart from that, the flashbacks also enable Tarantino to give this very thrilling film a lighter and funnier touch. So the flashbacks are really multidimensional here. They increase the tension, they relieve the tension and they provide the film with a lighter touch.
All of the aspects above are brilliantly captured by Tarantino's ingenious though simple usage of the camera. In keeping the movements limited and rather simple, he manages to keep the viewer close to the story and the events. By doing that, he succeeds in producing maximum thrill with a minimum of effects.
Considering the relatively low budget, the rather simple story and the minimum of effects, I think Reservoir Dogs is a really amazing product and I am not the only one. A lot of people seemed (and still seem) to agree with me on that one. Not only did Tarantino receive a lot of hail for this work, but he also managed to get many more of his idea's realized on film. The climax of Tarantino's career (which is not over yet, mind you) would come in 1994 with Pulp Fiction, which he co-wrote, directed and starred in. After that Tarantino's work (as far as writing and directing is concerned) became of less quality. First he would make a segment for the film Four Rooms and after that he would star in and partially write the still good genre classic From Dusk till Dawn. Following those films, he made Curdled (writing only) and later Jackie Brown, which was his last directorial offering. That film became something of a disappointment, for it did not have the typical Tarantino style and I ask all of you: How could it have if Tarantino had neither written the original story nor starred in it?' One can conclude that, although on average Tarantino's work is of good quality, his films following Pulp Fiction have been of lesser quality than his work before that very same film and one can only hope, Tarantino will manage to shine again with his next project, called Kill Bill. I, for one, am very excited about that film, because the title is catchy, the actors have potential and it is written and directed by the master himself: Quentin Tarantino. I must add though, that I am excited DESPITE. I am excited about Kill Bill despite the fact that Quentin does not have an acting part the film and I am excited despite the fact that I thought the trailer did not look very promising.

140,ajs-10,I didn't rate it first time around How does it fair 20 years on?...,8,14 January 2012,"Lauded by many, despised by a few, it's been a long time since I saw 'Reservoir Dogs' and I have to come clean I didn't really rate it first time around. So I thought it was time I gave it another shot since it aired on TV (again) recently. How did it fair this time around? Well I'll tell you after this brief summary.A jewellery heist has gone wrong and the perpetrators make their way back to a pre-arranged rendezvous, a warehouse. The cops knew about the robbery and they have a traitor in their midst. To keep themselves anonymous, Joe, the organiser of the heist had given them all names of colours. Mr Brown and Mr Blue were both killed during the heist and Mr Orange is injured. He and Mr White are the first to arrive, soon followed by Mr Pink. Later Mr Blonde turns up with a surprise in the trunk of his car a cop. They start beating up on the cop trying to find out if he knows who betrayed them, but he knows nothing. Nice Guy Eddie, Joe's son, turns up next and tells them to move the cars; leaving the psychotic Mr Blonde with the injured Mr Orange and the cop. At this point I'll leave it or the Spoiler Police (Tarantino Division) will have me making films with scenes stolen from just about every film I've ever seen (again).I must admit I do like the rough style with which this film is made, there seems to be a lot of ad-libbing from the actors and, for the most part, it works pretty well. There are flashbacks telling us how some of the major players got involved in the job and these (to me) are more interesting than some of the stuff going on in the warehouse. As far as performances go, well Harvey Keitel as Mr. White - Larry Dimmick, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange - Freddy Newandyke, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde - Vic Vega and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink all did an excellent job. Honourable mentions also go to; Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot and Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot.As with many of Tarantino's works there is an awful lot of dialogue (just see my 'Favourite Quotes' section below for a taster). This, I find can be both confusing and distracting if not properly choreographed with what the audience is watching. Two talking heads in a room can get pretty uninteresting after a while and this is what you get in some scenes. There is no incidental music, the only music we here is from the radio that always plays hits from the '70's. For me second time around?... Well I can see some good things in there, but not enough for me to rave about it. I will deem it 'Recommended' but only for these good points (about three quarters of the way through the back-story of Mr. Orange definitely NOT the torture scene).My score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (based on 277,019 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 96/100 (based on 48 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

The gang of thieves sit around a table in a restaurant making conversation about tips and waitressing being the only place an uneducated woman can get work. Steve Buscemi says he never tips, but is told by the boss to pay his share, and he does. It's a brilliant opener scene.
The rest of the film takes place in a warehouse after the diamond heist has gone wrong. The dying man is Tim Roth, and his flashbacks tell his story. Harvey Keitel and Buscemi have minutes of dialogue on what went wrong and what should be done now.
Flashbacks show what went wrong. The pace is quick. There is a dancing crook with a razor. Gasoline. Gunshots. More gunshots.
The reveal. More gunshots.
The reason this works is the authenticity of the actors. Chris Penn is somewhat off but still works. My favorites are Buscemi, Keitel, and Roth.

142,itamarscomix,Violence as Poetry,10,24 May 2005,"First things first, I'm not going to call Reservoir Dogs 'Quentin Tarantino's best movie', because I love all of his movies dearly and I will not pick favorites. Nevertheless, as of the last time I saw the three of them (the other ones being, of course, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I'm not counting Four Rooms, because he only had one segment in it - even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.A brief overview: Lawrence Tierney is Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is his son 'Nice Guy' Eddie. Joe is a crime boss planning a diamond heist, and for the operation he hires six men, all of them acquainted with Cabot but none of which knows each other. To avoid having any details about one another they keep their identities secret and call each other by code names: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (the always wonderful Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (action star Michael Madsen in the part of a lifetime), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself, who gets killed at the very beginning of the movie). When the robbery becomes a bloodbath, the thieves escape to the rendezvous and try to figure out what went wrong and who's responsible.The movie is basically a very small scale theatrical production, as the main body of the story takes place in only one location, although there are several flashbacks that play a very important part in the film. The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities - especially since having also seen Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown we can now safely assume that its success wasn't a one time thing. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life-and-death issues and mindless chatter about the most minor trivialities of life makes his movies a treat to watch (Note the Madonna conversation in the beginning of Reservoir Dogs and the Delfonics chats in Jackie Brown. While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes). The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit 'Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.Tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise. Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him - ""You remember the Fantastic Four?... The Thing. He looks just like The Thing."") The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch. Tarantino is a picky director; he makes few movies, but the ones he makes really count. I'm waiting for his next release, 'Kill Bill', eagerly. If you missed out on any of his three masterpieces, don't.",Reservoir Dogs
143,TheNorthernMonkee,"Tarantino, Violence, Quality Scripting & Stylish Outfits",10,29 July 2003,"JUST FOR SAFETY SAKE, ASSUME THERE COULD BE SPOILERSIt's films like this that make life really worth living.I watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time a few years ago & to this day, it is still one of the most stylish & amazing films of all time. This film has it all. This film has immense style, it has cleverly planned violence by about six bucket-loads & it has a wonderful script. I don't know what it is about Quentin Tarantino that makes him such a genius, but with a history which includes this & Pulp Fiction, it's no wonder that Kill Bill (both parts!) looks like being one of the best films of the last few years.Only Tarantino could get some of the best actors of the time (Keitel, Roth & my all time favourite Buscemi to name just three) to dress in suits, have names like Mr. Pink & walk around shooting, kicking & swearing at each other.Ironically for a film boasting such stars, the best scene in my view is the opener in the café in which one of the most vocal people is Tarantino himself. Talking firstly about Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" & then tipping, this scene seems random, but it introduces the characters personalities so well and so early that it's blatant from the very start just how they all act. Some films spend practically the entire film trying to explain someones character, this film sums most up in the first five minutes. Brilliant.Finally, there's something else which makes this film truly magical. The soundtrack!Any film which features not only ""Little Green Bag"", but then Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" deserves credit.Actually, I know I'd previously said ""Finally"", but one thing worth mentioning is just how great it is to be able to watch a film which is only 95 minutes long. Over the last few days I've been going through a sort of film masterclass of sorts watching Fight Club, Apocalypse Now (now there's a long film!) & others, but it's so wonderful to watch a film that doesn't take up an entire night.So to summarise, a perfect length, perfect style, perfect soundtrack, perfect acting, perfect characterisation, perfect script, perfection in general.",Reservoir Dogs
144,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A fierce crime thriller,9,26 October 2005,"A group of crooks are assembled to pull of a jewelry heist and the stick-up quickly turns to a shootout and the seemingly perfect crime goes perfectly wrong. The alarm goes off, the police show up, innocents get shot, and the crooks split and barely make it out alive. Were they set up? Bad luck? Or what? What ""follows"" is the aftermath of it all as they reflect how they got there and what they are going to do now. I put the ""follows"" in quotes, because the robbery is the inciting incident to the main story, but interestingly this film has plenty of back story that develops as we see how each of the robbers wound up pulling the job and the whole film is very broken up chronologically. Interestingly Tarantino makes it work and each back-story or reflection is clever and the whole mass of all the flashbacks, some pertaining directly to the robbery some not, make for a big picture showing who these lowlifes really are.Now that's another thing: lowlifes. The protagonists are essentially that. Uneducated, career crooks, that can't hold a regular job or go straight. Basically people that no one is too interested in, but Tarantino treats them like fair human beings and it is admittedly strange to see people like this with a human or humorous side and to see how they justify to themselves what they do for a living. I have heard this film bashed (along with Pulp Fiction) for the pointlessness of its conversations, but if you think about it, life is full of conversations that you forget the next day. And what do you expect gun totting crooks to discuss? Something that a regular person would consider meaningful to their life? While I do agree many of the dialogs are tedious and don't really relate to my life or anyone else that I know, they paint a believable human image of people we'd like to do away with.This film is based on Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire,"" starring Chow Yun-Fat, but out of the two ""Reservoir Dogs"" is definitely better. It is much more focused on its characters and on the film's main situation, the robbery. Lam's film wandered too much, but it is also a recommended viewing as it inspired one of film-making fiercest debuts. 9/10Rated R: graphic violence, brutality, and strong profanity",Reservoir Dogs

So if you find that kind of thing sick-making (and many do), this is DEFINITELY not the movie for you. But if you have seen other of Quentin Tarantino's films and liked them, this is a must see. Although the acting is quite good -- I'd single out Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi -- this is Tarantino's movie. Nobody does controlled menace and uncontrolled violence the way he does. If it weren't a movie but something happening in front of our eyes, we'd trample one another to death in the rush to the exit. There haven't been many movies in my lifetime that inspire that sense of being in the middle of something absolutely dreadful. That goes especially for the scene in which one of the hoods carves up a young cop he's captured and prepares to burn him to a crisp before he is blown away himself. Definitely not for the squeamish. Some of the sci fi, horror and ""action"" movies may be equally violent. I wouldn't know because I don't go to those types of movies. But this is pretty damn strong stuff.",Reservoir Dogs

148,Pedro_H,Crash-bang-whalop from a director with something spanking new to offer.,8,8 February 2004,"A set of criminals gather in a garage to discuss a jewel heist that has gone tragically wrong.What a fantastic film to start a career with. Tarantino shows that while he has never been to film school he knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. This doesn't take cinema to a new level but shows how to make a simple story - that could have been a cheap TV movie in someone else's hands - in to something epic. Yes epic, not a word I use very often.If you want proof that stories are in the telling, the mood and the music just look here. The story is nothing, but the delivery and the acting make it what it is.There really is no substantial plot. It is just throw you off balance cinema. Roth plays a man bleeding to death on a floor through most of the movie: what a fantastic device and so original. Who would have thought of that? Who indeed would not only have thought of that, but used it so effectively?The criminals (known by colours - or is it colors?) are funny, dangerous and strangely real. Real people that squabble over names, food and even tips. People that go from killing to small talk to humour as if it as all the same thing, in the same way that Prince goes from talking about sex to god as if it is also part of the same thing. Is this real? Is this how real criminals talk and behave. Not in the main, no, but probably true of a minority. The only problem - beyond this movie - is whether he can capture other types of criminals. The question remains open.Criminals, cops and  bystanders are all out to earn a dollar and return home to watch TV. The criminal is caught by one policeman and takes it out on another, who knows nothing about the original crime. People are in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have outlaws, but they are 9-2-5 outlaws, they want to eat out and drive nice cars. They are career criminals for whom the real world is too much like hard work. They want to live off the fat of the land, like the idle rich. They may have had real jobs (indeed they say they have), but it is not for them. As I said earlier, the plot is nothing. It is a frame for mood and atmosphere (what Kubrick took twenty years to learn Tarantino knows day one) and how it all turns out doesn't really matter. It is a journey, not a destination.Is the film moral? Not really. It is a mixed bag, but he is more moral than some comedies where out-of-work middle aged couples ride of in to the sunset having robbed a bank. Movie morals are different, it is not that people are dead, but how they died that matters. If you believe that cinema should include all people from society then films such as this should exist.Sadly Tarantino loses control in the ""ear"" scene. I have nothing against the haunted house experience, but you can only spend so much time in it before emerging in to light. Making the audience nauseous is no achievement. Nor is shocking it. We can all do it. In life or on film.All movies have to have drama and to create all drama we must have conflict. We haven't much to play with here. It is a minimalist playbox, although we have the robbery (used sparingly and not at the beginning as most fly-by-nights would use it) and some gun play, but these are sidelines. This is a relationship play. People (criminals) that want both anarchy and order. They come together for greed, but the pecking order has to be established. It is not easy being leader of the anarchist, they are, by nature free thinkers that play and work for themselves.It doesn't let anyone believe that being a criminal is easy or a good career options. After all, as I hinted above, who are you working with? Other criminals who only want to look after themselves and would happily steal for you as much as the original target. This doesn't make it as clear as say Goodfellers, but the message is there all the same. When this film came out it maybe it wasn't as big a deal as is made out to be now. However the industry stood up and took notice as did most film buffs. This is something new and - as has been shown with the better Pulp Fiction - the product of  someone that has the seeds of magic in his fingers. Sadly QT started to believe his own hype, and worse started thinking that he only had to please himself to please his audience.
The problem is that QT is like the sexy girl your old school class. The problem isn't that she is sexy, the problem is that she knows it.",Reservoir Dogs

He goes on a bank robbery with them and gets shot. He struggles to stay alive and keep his secret that he is an undercover cop.This movie was awesome.

151,Geeky Randy,Unforgettable!!!,10,12 March 2001,"Quentin Tarantino is most famous for his film `Pulp Fiction'. `Pulp Fiction' won over twelve awards. One year before that was Tarantino's second film `True Romance', starring Patricia Arquette & Christian Slater. `True Romance', `Pulp Fiction', `Natural Born Killers', and many other projects written by Tarantino were a spin-off of his first film `Reservoir Dogs'. This film is about a man named Joes Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) who runs a crime business. Cabot is a rich man (thanks to theft) and is wanted by the police. Cobot is a very popular man, and is loved and respected by many of his thief-soldiers. Uncut diamonds are being imported to a store, and Cobot wants his hands on it. He hires six men to do a four-man job. Cobot has everything all planned out (like he always does). He gives his thieves names, so if there's a rat in the house, there will be a less of a chance of getting caught because they don't know your name. Mr. Brown (Tarantino), Mr. White (Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Madsen), Mr. Blue (Bunker), Mr. Orange (Roth), and Mr. Pink (Buscemi) and their given names. They are not to tell anything about themselves to each other, such as their real name, their wife's name, when/where they did time, where they're from, or a bank they robbed. The robbery is all planned out, very well. But something goes wrong! While robbing the store, they are suddenly surrounded by cops. Mr. Pink (Steven Buscemi) has a good feeling that they were set up. Some of the thieves got away, some got killed, and maybe some got caught. The survived thieves meet back at the rendezvous and finally come to the conclusion that; one of the six thieves, Joe Cobot, or his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn), is an undercover cop. Throughout the film they try to figure out who the cop is. There is no actual main character. There are three main characters in this film; Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth). Those three are the principle characters in this film. This is a very good film. The first five minutes might be slow for some of you, but it's there so you get to know the characters. Just remember the characters I told you about, and you'll enjoy this entertaining brilliant film.",Reservoir Dogs
152,RJBurke1942,"The League of Gentlemen (1960), this is not",6,19 November 2007,"There have been many caper movies that include a heist, probably too many for the crime genre. Among them is the one mentioned in my summation line, plus  for the modern set - Oceans 11, 12 and 13 (give me a break, puleese) and for those who remember where it all started: The Asphalt Jungle (1950); Rififi, the Jules Dassin classic from 1955; and, later, Pekinpah's ode to violence, The Getaway (1972), Steve McQueens's best role.The common theme, of course, is how some rat in the ranks makes everything turn sour for the others.There are two things that make this one different to the others: the violence exceeds all those mentioned (and probably all other heist movies) and the narrative is deliberately fractured by the writer/director (Tarantino) as a means of creating suspense for the viewer.As an experiment in using that plot device, it works: the story is terribly fractured, making it just a bit more difficult to get the picture first time round. The long list of FAQs for this one is mute evidence in support. When I saw the film in 1992, for the first time, I was intrigued but also disappointed. Seeing it again on DVD, I think Tarantino sacrificed clarity for the sake of speeding up the action  because, being such a talky film, he had to keep the action going to appease the audience. This, after all, was a diamond heist that went wrong, not a garage sale for diamonds...Some might argue that the violence is excessive. I disagree, mainly because Tarantino very explicitly laid out what types of men these were during the overly long talkfest at the lunch feast: misogynist, narrow-minded, callous, racist and psychotic  but, in an exchange completely at odds with those attitudes, showed them dipping in to help out the waitress with a big tip. The only reason for that must be to show just how different Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) is to the rest - which is important throughout this narrative.So, the violence that follows is quite in character for all of them, even for Mr Orange (Tim Roth) who shoots a woman who shoots him, as he and Mr White (Harvey Keitel) steal her car. I think Tarantino did a good job in showing just how violent these violent people can be, leaving the viewer with an implied lesson, of course: don't do crime, or crime will do you! It was great to Lawrence Tierney again - even though he was almost impossible to recognize (playing the Big Boss, Joe Cabot) as I'd seen him in many B movies in my youth.In the end, however, I'd didn't care two hoots for any of the characters, except for Officer Nash (Kirk Baltz), the only person with real courage and honour, as he refused to reveal who the rat was.This was the first Tarantino film I saw. It's not his best. If you want that, see Jackie Brown (1997), an Elmore Leonard novel that Tarantino puts to film very well.",Reservoir Dogs
153,DarthVoorhees,Tarantino's debut is still his masterpiece,10,13 August 2008,"I have all ways liked Quentin Tarantino's work but I have to put an empathizes on the word 'liked' not loved. He certainly has changed the way movies are made and perceived but I have to disagree with a lot of people who consider him to be one of the greatest director's of all time. I don't want to anger his fans because they are plentiful and are all ways very passionate about their hero but I think Reservoir Dogs is actually superior to the much more loved Pulp Fiction.Reservoir Dogs is simplicity it's self, it's a robbery and crime film where we don't see any robberies or crimes being committed. I actually kind of liked this, because it highlights Tarantino's terrific dialouge and the stellar performances by the cast. Since we don't get to see this diamond heist, the movie becomes more thrilling psychologically because the viewer is forced to imply much in his head. Don't get me wrong, the film is still gruesome but the thrills come from the aftershocks not the actions like in Tarantino's other flicks. In many ways this helps the character development because it is easy for a criminal to act tough but when they are at hell's door we see the people they really are. The emotions and real personalities under the tough guy attitude are what these characters are. In only one instance does the character not go through a massive change and that character is Mr.Blonde. Blonde is a psychopath down to the bone and this is demonstrated by the infamous ear scene(""You'll never be able to listen to the oldies station the same way again"").Much is made of the fact that the lead gangster,Joe Cabot, gives every member of his team an alias. Each man ceases to be a man and instead becomes a color. Cabot says that it will help if they are caught so no one can be double crossed, which is really a smart plan but it backfires when it becomes apparent that one of the men is a police informant who tipped off the LAPD before the robbery could be completed. There's a traitor in the mix and these men need some sort of unity if they are to make it out alive.Reservoir Dogs is one of the best told stories captured on film. Tarantino succeeds at taking something so familiar and turning it on its head until it becomes new and exciting again.",Reservoir Dogs
154,tomimt,A movie which gave us Tarantino,8,21 May 2005,"In 1992, when I was twelve and had no comprehension about good movies, came Reservoir Dogs, a film, which introduced Quentin Tarantion to the world as a director. Now, if I had seen RD before I had seen Pulp Fiction I would without any doubt claim RD to be Tarantinos best movie. But now, as I have seen Pulp Ficiton before RD I can say ""Well, Reservoir Dogs ain't his best film, but it was extremely good place to start."" Most first directions aren't even 10th as good as Reservoir Dogs.So, Reservoir Dogs is about band or thieves, who are unknown to each other. They are total strangers who are gather up to do a diamond shop heist. They use code names ala Mr. Pink or Mr. Orange. This all, of course, goes terribly wrong. Whole movie is describing the moments before and after the crime, when the dogs are trying to figure out what went wrong and who is to blame.Quentin Tarantinos style is very visible from the first scene to the last, everything is stylish to the last and everything has its own meaning. Nothing happens without a reason, no matter how ridiculous it might be.I don't want to give out any scenes or characters, so I won't dig in any further into the story.

155,skepticskeptical,A (very) bloody stage piece,7,16 December 2019,"Reservoir Dogs is shocking in its excess and (seeming) glorification of violence. What makes it interesting is how the violence is used by the director. In some ways, it is used as a stun gun, to discombobulate the viewer, and in that sense it is not, appearances notwithstanding, entirely gratuitous.When one reflects upon ¨the morals¨ of the story, Reservoir Dogs proves not to be a celebration of violence but a cautionary tale with a moral not unlike those of some of the great Greek and Shakespearean tragedies, which, we must acknowledge, are sometimes also extraordinarily gory (Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, Macbeth...). The big difference, of course, is that Tarantino protagonists are not greater-than-life heroes but loser, lowlife criminals born into less-than-noble contexts. Yet they still are kings of their own little castles and conduct themselves accordingly. Their foul language is their poetry.My impression is that the critical acclaim heaped upon Tarantino´s oeuvre, beginning with Reservoir Dogs, derives from the undeniable fact that every single facet of the works is open to higher-order interpretation and was thoughtfully chosen by the director. Think about the names of the protagonists, for example, they all can be said to have meaning--left to the viewer to figure out, of course. Critics like that sort of stuff.If not for the extreme messiness of blood, Reservoir Dogs could be staged in a theatre, given that it takes place almost exclusively in a single location. Tarantino´s subsequent works, while also theatrical and working from classical paradigms--following many classical rules while breaking others--exploit more of the potentials of the film medium, as distinct from theatre.",Reservoir Dogs

The movie stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, and Michael Madsen. The movie is a heist movie about a heist that goes wrong. The criminals try to find a way out as the police close in on them.The writing in Reservoir Dogs is top notch. Quentin Tarantino wrote all of the characters with sharp and focused dialogue that engages the audience consistently. The movie's dialogue is great to listen to and requires the audience to pay attention. There are many great scenes such as a discussion about tips that make the audience laugh and become interested in its relevance. The movie is absolutely filled with dialogue such as these. The movie uses this dialogue to give more detail to the characters and have an authentic moment. The direction by Quentin Tarantino is also praise worthy.The direction is well done for the relatively low budget of the movie. All of the scenes in this movie felt intense. The characters had a distinct style in every scene. I always felt that every scene had its intention clearly carried out onto the screen. It may not always be glamorous but the direction conveys everything well.The characters and acting are the best components in the movie. After the failed heist, it becomes clear that the jewelry store was a setup. One of the characters, Mr. Orange, is shot and critically wounded. The interaction between him and the rest of the characters is great to watch untold. If was awesome watching these characters act realistically.I would recommend 'Reservoir Dogs.' This movie is solid in both its concept and execution. At a 99 minute running time the movie is tight and focused.Grade: B",Reservoir Dogs
158,gigan-92,My Favorite Tarantino Production???,10,31 January 2011,"There are so many perspectives on which to praise ""Reservoir Dogs"". First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the ""Kill Bill"" films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film ""Inglourious Basterds"". It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through (""Can you hear me now?"")is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime/thriller pieces ever written.The talent here is undeniable, and every performance is just awesome. The ones I really admired the most were that of Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, and definitely Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. And where as I believe every individual character stood out quite well, the two that stirred up the most in me was Tim Roth as the nefarious Mr. Orange, but over all Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. I will never forget Madsen as the soda sipping psychopath. Tarantino does well himself I must admit, and kudos to the often over-looked performance of Kirk Baltz as the unfortunate Officer Marvin Nash.With its tremendously talented cast breathing life into these characters we know so little about, coupled with its very involving story and well placed music, it all comes together as arguably Tarantino's most refined work.",Reservoir Dogs
159,Bogmeister,These Dogs Show Their True Colors,9,25 August 2005,"White, Pink, Orange, Brown... you'll be thinking of these colors in a different way after watching this ensemble of actors act their guts out in a twisting, vibrant re-interpretation of a crime drama. Tarantino nails it; the next one, ""Pulp Fiction"" was more ambitious and had more bucks, but this had the advantage of a fresh approach, a new way of presenting cinema as, dare we say it, art. The actors went along with him, all the way, to the smallest detail. Watch the end of the introductory breakfast scene, after Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explains his non-tipping philosophy. Joe (Tierney) returns to the table and commands Pink to pay up anyway and Pink finally complies. Eddie (Penn) sits very solemnly during this point, with his hands under his chin, as if in deep thought. What's he thinking about? Could it be he thinks I should've forced Pink to pay? Is it times like these when I'm still the kid and my dad's the man? This is just a 2-second shot.Examples like that may be why a film such as this gets better every time I see it. I don't remember much about what I thought of it when I first saw it back in '92; probably that it was interesting. I thought it was more interesting the 2nd time I saw it. By the 3rd time, I was thinking, this is fantastic. I've just seen it again, probably for the ninth time and it's better than ever. Returning to Penn's performance as Eddie: most fans of this film usually point out Buscemi as the comical, quick Pink, or the cool Keitel as Mr.White, or the unpredictably cool Madsen as Blonde (Blonde-what a color,eh?-you psycho!). Penn gives the performance of his career here. He switches from daddy's boy to Blonde-type menace in the space of a few frames. He's probably the most creative with Tarantino's lengthy dialog, juggling pressure from his boss/dad, supervising the cadre of crooks and trying to make phone conversations interesting. And Tierney, struggling in a B or C movie career all his long life, has the role of his lifetime here thanks to Tarantino; the entire scene of him giving out the color names to the boys couldn't have been played better.What is really thrilling, however, is how Madsen still manages to surprise and chill after all these years. I watch him now and questions start to percolate in my brain: was he on drugs when he 'acted' this role? Is he slightly insane in real life? He really is amazing here - so much so that the few years following this movie all his roles were overshadowed by this performance. I almost believe Madsen discovered a new method style of acting back then, which didn't take because no one else knew how to do it.So why not a full ten stars? I have a few problems with Roth; nothing too serious - he's dead on in some scenes, such as when he tells himself not to chicken out in the mirror; other times, he's trying hard to hide an accent or just trying too hard. Thing is, in most ways, he has the most difficult role; he has to act like a criminal being acted by someone else being acted by Roth. I'm also aware of accusations regarding the older film ""City on Fire"" which hints this work may be slightly imitative of at least one sequence unlike, say ""Pulp Fiction"" which, despite appearances, is wholly original. But these are quibbles in the end - if Reservoir Dogs isn't original, what is?",Reservoir Dogs
160,maccas-56367,Overrated,3,7 October 2019,"It's official. I don't like Tarantino movies. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a long time. Even the awesome soundtrack couldn't salvage some level of enjoyment from me.Steve Buscemi was great as he usually is. But beyond that, there just wasn't much I liked here. I love some violence and swearing as much as the next person. But here, I can't help thinking Tarantino used it in such way as to draw attention away from the fact there isn't much below the surface of this film.People love over-indulgent, long guitar solos in songs - and Tarantino movies often feel like the film-making version of that. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is no exception. This felt like some end-of-year final assessment in film school or drama class. I don't watch films for their technical aspects. My attention waned numerous times throughout overly long scenes and lengthy dialogue that had no purpose. ""12 Angry Men"" is an excellent example of how to do that in a way that is both artistic and entertaining. This is not.The use of flashbacks and change in timelines didn't do anything to keep me engaged either. The bare resemblance of a storyline just felt soulless and depressing, with it seemingly going nowhere. Unfortunately, far too often people consider yelling to be acting at its finest and most dramatic.

But it only shows the before and after of the jewel heist. The details of the heist are explained in the aftermath and also by using your imagination of what happened. The movie begins with the crew going to a diner for breakfast before pulling off the job and a bunch of small talk ensues. Then cut to after the credits to where they're all showing up at the meet up place after the heist goes wrong and not everyone makes it back alive. Accusations towards each other about why things went wrong ensue with each other turning on each other.This was the first directorial performance by Quentin Tarantino of what would go onto to be many really interesting movies with his signature touch on them.,Reservoir Dogs
162,WriterDave,Solid but far from greatness,7,18 March 2003,"There's really not much to this flick.  It's an ultra-slick, highly stylish, ultra-violent quasi-gangster flick about an undercover cop working a sting on a diamond heist.  If you like this kind of thing, then you will get a big kick out of this, but otherwise, avoid it at all costs.  Tarantino, in his debut directorial gig shows he has a panache for very interesting dialogue (that usually has nothing to do with the plot) and a very stylish director's hand.  This flick is far superior to his overly praised ""Pulp Fiction,"" (**) which in my mind was a sloppily put together episodic flick that had some decent movie moments but ultimately had nothing to say beyond its own shock value.  Tarantino's only other turn at direction was ""Jackie Brown,"" (***) which for me was his only real ""film"" whose only downfall was that it took its sweet time getting around to what it had to say about midlife crises. As it stands, ""Reservoir Dogs"" (**1/2) is a solid flick but nothing great. If you want all this clever crime caper/con-game stuff without all the ultra-violence but still have the great dialogue, I recommend the work of David Mamet (""The Spanish Prisoner"" or ""Heist"" should do the trick).",Reservoir Dogs
163,dr_foreman,I still don't get it,2,16 March 2004,"People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate ""Reservior Dogs"" to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" here, and there's also a dash of ""The Omen"" at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth.",Reservoir Dogs
164,LoneWolfAndCub,Quentin's First Stab At Directing........ BRILLIANT,9,27 August 2005,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie, and it's pretty bloody good. I was cautious of this one because I had read mixed reviews of this. But I eventually decided to rent this, it was a great choice.Reservoir Dogs is about a diamond heist gone wrong. They all meet up at a warehouse. This is where we enter a series of flashbacks and confrontations leading up to a huge finale.Sound familiar, OF COURSE. This is a typical Tarantino way of homaging movies he loved as a video store clerk. He really does a brilliant job with this movie. Even thought nothing will top Pulp Fiction this is his second best. This movie has a great cast. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Tarantino himself.This violent masterpiece has earned it's way into many fans and made Tarantino a legend in film-making.4½/5.",Reservoir Dogs
165,OriginalMovieBuff21,One of the greatest films ever made,10,30 July 2005,"Reservoir Dogs is probably one of the smartest crime films that I have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most brilliant minded directors in the history of film-making who came out of a video store to making one of most popular crime film. Reservoir Dogs is capable of having small time actors (with the exception of Harvey Keitel) and making them put up fantastic and mind-blowing performances. This is what a great script can do to actors. The dialogue is so amazing, the music is incredible especially the song, ""Little Green Bag"" in the beginning of the film, and of course the acting is sensational. Reservoir Dogs is breathtaking and trust me I have a lot of favorite films, but Reservoir Dogs falls in my top 10. It is a pure adrenaline rush and is one of the greatest films ever made. I highly recommend it!Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",Reservoir Dogs
166,EmperorNortonII,Tarantino's First Big Shot,7,1 April 2006,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is the movie that introduced the world to Quentin Tarantino's style of movie-making. Stories full of cool characters, non-linear events, music and pop culture, and of course, lots of violence. Tarantino directed the movie, and also appeared as Mr. Brown. The story in ""Reservoir Dogs"" involves a jewel heist, even though the crime is never seen. The men hired for the heist are all strangers to each other, and all given aliases, to prevent them all from learning anything about each other. But the heist soon goes awry, and it ends violently. Two scenes in particular stand out about this movie: one is the infamous scene in which Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off a cop's ear, a violent scene which is mostly implied. The other is the Mexican standoff scene near the end, a very tense moment. Tarantino has proved his power as a groundbreaking filmmaker with ""Reservoir Dogs.""",Reservoir Dogs
167,DogePelis2015,Of the best of Quentin Tarantino,9,3 May 2021,"It's a very stylish movie; the plot is good, the actors are excellent and the soundtrack is memorable; it is my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie and I highly recommend it.",Reservoir Dogs
168,SquigglyCrunch,"Rushed, Anti-Climatic Tarantino Movie",6,8 February 2016,"I went into this movie with some expectations. Having liked all of the Tarantino films that I've seen I was hoping for another great movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't really anything special.Reservoir Dogs is about a bunch of criminals hiding out after a robbery went horribly wrong and waiting for each other to arrive. While I like the idea of everyone waiting in one place and having trust issues, I've seen it before in Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'. I do realize that Reservoir Dogs came out over 20 years before, but The Hateful Eight felt more like an improvement off of this movie. Plus it just shows that Tarantino is reusing ideas at this point. While I did really like The Hateful Eight and not so much Reservoir Dogs, I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Considering Reservoir Dogs came out first, I'm giving it credit for having the idea first, but The Hateful Eight did it much, much better. Otherwise, the plot is generally well done. I liked the beginning the most. For the last twenty or so minutes it's just kind of lame. It's anti-climatic in the end, and very obvious when and how it will end. For a Tarantino movie this is quite disappointing. It's probably the most average way for a Tarantino movie to end, only without the awesome overdone violence and tension. The characters are alright, but relatively rushed. They all have their defining characteristics, but it never really goes deeper than that. Overall Reservoir Dogs isn't anything special. It just feels like the most average Tarantino movie ever, and while it was one of his first movies, it doesn't hold up as the classic that everyone makes it out to be. It just feels like a worse version of The Hateful Eight. In the end I probably wouldn't recommend this movie unless your really interested in it. I really didn't enjoy it that much, and I'm only giving it credit because it probably inspired the idea for my favorite Tarantino movie.",Reservoir Dogs
169,elicopperman,Small yet Dynamic Directorial Debut from Tarantino,7,8 February 2021,"Prior to becoming one of cinema's most respected modern filmmakers, Quentin Tarantino got his first chance at completing his very first feature length film (if you don't count his unfinished attempt My Best Friend's Birthday). That film was a small indie crime film called Reservoir Dogs, which is often regarded as one of the best independent films ever made, even if it was somewhat controversial for its graphic violence and heavy profanity. As for how it stands the test of time, while seemingly minor compared to Tarantino's later and bigger efforts, it's still a remarkable first time effort from someone who would later do wonders for motion pictures.The film centers around the events of coordinated diamond thieves before and after their jewelry store heist goes terribly wrong. Given that the film often swaps between how the gang met and the robbery aftermath, what makes the story engaging are the characters in general. While seemingly all the same at first, the individual criminals stick out from their distinctive personalities, like Mr. White being the smart albeit aggressive one, Mr. Pink being the sensible wise guy, Mr. Orange being not all that he really seems, and Mr. Blonde being the most questionably sociopathic of the group. All led by the crooked crime boss Joe Cabot and his smart alec son Nice Guy Eddie, their chemistry before and after the heist feels so authentic that you really feel like you can sense who each character is from such a relatable angle. Despite many of these guys being criminals, you end up either rooting against them or sympathizing with them depending on just how everything in the narrative goes down. Aided by a lot of witty dialogue exchanges, this cast would almost never show up again in any other movie.However, the absolute best part of the movie in addition to the cast is the acting, given the movie's all star cast like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen, former criminal Eddie Bunker and even Tarantino himself. As mentioned before, their chemistry bounces off well from just how tough yet paranoid a lot of them are, and the best ones at playing those up would be Keitel, Buscemi and Penn. Roth, in portraying Mr. Orange, does a fantastic job at pulling off the facade tough guy criminal, Tierney does the grouchy old grump Joe so well that one forgets just how dangerous he really is, and it's almost hard to believe that Madsen really isn't a psycho in real life, he's so good as Mr. Blonde. In addition to the fun Madonna analogies and references to pop culture, the soundtrack is phenomenal, given it consists of tunes from the 70s, which Tarantino added in to work within the film's graphic violence and homage to 1950s crime flicks. It also helps to have the monotone comedian Stephen Wright introduce them for sardonic humor.Now despite the film's best efforts, there are some notable production values and plot points that keep it from being great. For one thing, the film's biggest downfall is given the low budget Tarantino and the crew had to work with, it ends up leaving out more about the characters that we could've known more about. Without going into spoilers, let's just say that some of the gang members contribute less to the plot than expected. Similarly to what Roger Ebert said about the movie, what we see of the characters is great, and yet there's still this feeling that we should have had more, especially when some of them are a lot more layered than others. Also, even though this would become a standard trope for future Tarantino movies, let's just say the ending is a little too far-fetched for its own good. Lastly, while many of Tarantino's later films would be just as if not more violent, this film is not for the sensitive type, as this might be the most realistically brutal movie Tarantino has ever made, so depending on who you are, best to either skip ahead some scenes or skip out on the film as a whole.So despite some of its setbacks, Reservoir Dogs is still an impressive first time effort from a guy who would later become one of the most influential filmmakers of the 21st century. If you've never seen this film before or you're starting to get into Tarantino's work, this is a great first starter to see where he cut his teeth as a first time indie director. While many deem classics like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and The Hateful Eight to be the best accomplishments from Tarantino, this flick still marks the beginning of a career that would only lead to more fascinating cinematic gems that audiences would eat up.",Reservoir Dogs
170,ronakkotian,The birth of a legend,9,3 April 2020,"It's so impressive to see a film like Reservoir Dogs come along and change the entire crime genre. With a budget of around $1.5 million, it goes to show how you can do wonders regardless of how low your budget is.Reservoir Dogs follows a group of criminals that are trying to find out who amongst them is the rat after a heist goes wrong.This was Quentin Tarantino's debut film and what a debut it was! This movie is packed with a stellar cast including the likes of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Alongside that we were introduced to Tarantino's impeccible writing. This movie grips you with its tight dialogues right from the beginning with the infamous ""Tipping"" discussion and keeps you hooked throughout its short runtime due to the talent onscreen and fast pacing. The music choices were very fitting and suited the film's tone. Whilst the film does get really violent, none of it is unnecessary. I feel it reflects the personality of each character perfectly especially Madsen's character.The performances are all very strong. Harvey Keitel does an impressive job as well as Tim Roth. Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen are really fun to watch and make their characters really believable. Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn are also great in their roles and play them equally well.What I really loved about the film was the way it was structured. The fact that we don't see the heist from the beginning makes the film really unpredictabe as we're constantly doubting who the rat is. There are some really funny and memorable moments throughout that make you realise why this movie is such a classic. The only problem I had was the way some scenes were shot but it also shows how much Tarantino has grown as a director.Reservoir Dogs is really entertaining. None of the characters feel boring, the plot doesn't stray and the fantastic writing by Tarantino gave an amazing first impression of his undeniable talent.",Reservoir Dogs

172,garethcrook,"That this is his second best film, says everything you need to know about QT.",10,30 May 2020,"I used to have a lovely VHS Collectors Edition of this that I played to death, maybe too much. Anyway I've not watched Reservoir Dogs in years. When Pulp Fiction came out, it was fashionable to say yeah it's great, but not as great as Reservoir Dogs. The truth is though, I always preferred Pulp Fiction. It was easy on the eye, fast paced, exciting, quotable, full of cartoon characters, but dangerous ones. This is a little different, but Tarrantino's debut is notable for several things, the non-linear storytelling, that scene in all its shocking nature and... the dialogue. The beautifully mundane dialogue. Steve Buscemi's stance on not tipping, Tarantino pulling apart Madonna's Like a Virgin. It's, well it's just marvellous, perfectly setting the characters before the opening credits roll with Little Green Bag over those slow motion shots of them all in matching suits, like a giant neon sign 'This is gonna be cool', but prepare to have your brain worked over. Then wham!, before the music even finishes, Tim Roth is in the back of a car screaming his head off, covered in blood as Harvey Keitel tries to keep him calm while driving. As far as getting into the action fast, Dogs does not disappoint. Mr Pink (Buscemi) explodes into the safe house with conspiracies of a set up, after an apparent heist. We're not told what's happening, there's no hand holding, it's a simple story but you have to let it breathe. It's difficult to watch this now without the knowledge of what's happened or is going to happen, but the entire premise is to put you right there in the room, trying to figure out what the hell just happened like Pink and White (Keitel) are... whilst Orange (Roth) bleeds out on the floor. The little drip fed bits of info, Mr Blonde (Micheal Madsen) going nuts ""Shooting the place up"", it's tells you as much about events unseen at the heist, as character traits that lead to what's yet to happen. What I had forgetter about was the camera work, it's as important as the dialogue, leading you around the room and through the conversation. When it pulls back to Mr Blonde's shoulder as he watches White and Orange's stand off, guns drawn and simply says ""You kids shouldn't play so rough"" it adds another layer of danger and confusion. Some of the flashback stuff with the crew meeting the brains behind the diamond heist, Joe, does feel added on, extra, non-essential. Especially with Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) and Blonde. I'll forgive the commode story with Orange though, although it's superfluous, it's nice detail and a lot of fun the way it builds. It's lengthy too, taking us out of the warehouse where things are pretty intense. The lovely nugget all the way through is Orange on the floor, everyone else accounted for or right in the thick of it. Granted we're kept guessing a little about Blue, but we know Brown (Tarantino) ""Took one in the head"". Although that's not strictly true. What is undeniable is as Blonde takes his jacket off I'm already nervous. I could never watch this scene, it's beyond harrowing. The cop begging, the gasoline, the dancing toward his prey, the tension is thick and when the switchblade comes out and I'm wondering if I'll half watch through my fingers. Of course there's no need really, the camera drifts, the mind filling in the gaps, but it's still brutal, if only of the coldness of Blonde as he tells the cop what's about to happen. The music is iconic here, notable too by the lovely breaker as Blonde goes to the trunk of the car, leaving the tortured cop and the music inside. Setting up probably the best back from the dead scene in movie history, as Pink wakes up and unloads on Blonde who's about to torch the cop. I remember watching this for the first time and being as blown away as Blonde! What follows is glorious, a pieces falling into place finale and if Pink was the show stealer before (he's my fave), then Roth as Mr Orange is a bloody close second, as it's revealed exactly who is who and what. It's methodical, packed with style and charisma and still stands up as a remarkable piece of cinema. A wonderful precursor for his best film which was just around the corner.",Reservoir Dogs

174,Rickting,"A violent, viscerally thrilling and ferociously entertaining decade defining masterwork",10,6 December 2014,"Although I'm not a huge fan of Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's debut is one of the best independent films of all time. A heist goes horribly wrong and the remaining criminals try to work out who the police informant is. It's set mostly in one location, and as the tension builds in the gangster's hideout the film becomes so unbearably intense it threatens to explode through the screen. Less a film, more a mind blowing, pulse pounding powerhouse, Reservoir Dogs is certainly one of the defining films of the 90s. It's quite a disturbing film at times and those who are squeamish should stay away. The violence makes the movie even more powerful, but it does get nasty at times. The film could be seen as style over substance by some and it won't be everyone's cup of tea; however, you can't really find anything else like it. Aside from Quentin Tarantino's other films of course. The film unfolds in non linear storytelling but unlike with Pulp Fiction, which was non linear just to show off, this adds to the plot and makes it even tenser.Tarantino has a very dynamic and explosive visual style which enhances the brutal action, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for all 90 minutes. His dialogue is even better though, and he should have won an Oscar for his writing. The script is enthralling to listen to, and it has fine actors speaking the dialogue as well, with Tim Roth being the highlight. Reservoir Dogs is special because it refuses to be boxed in or respond to conventions. It doesn't show the heist properly, the characters are always talking about things irrelevant to the plot and the violence is unflinching and explosive. This kind of movie just isn't seen much... well, ever. It's consistently entertaining from beginning to end (for those who can stomach the violence) and bizarrely enthralling. An extremely energetic and well made film which has deservedly influenced pop culture massively. You may hate it, but you can't deny the power of the dialogue or its originality.10/10",Reservoir Dogs
175,PIST-OFF,Without a question the greatest film ever. And I mean EVER!!!,10,18 March 1999,"Reservoir Dogs is the coolest movie ever. Tarantino's directorial debut is perfect. His gift for writing great dialogue and not stereotyping his own characters is apparent from the get go. The cinematography and camera work are tributes to French film makers and their great technique. Harvey Keitel puts up his all time best performance as the very professional yet very gullible Mr White. Michael Madsen also puts out a career best as the psychotic but loyal Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth and Chris Penn also put out career high water marks. Quentin Tarantino throws in great stuff from old movie, inside jocks and ironic subliminal settings (the mortuary after a massacre) to make the movie great. Mr Blonde can be seen drinking from a Big Kahuna burger cup just like Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. A killer soundtrack of mostly 70's music. A classic infamous super cool scene of Mr Blonde cutting off a cop's ear to the tune of Steeler's Wheel's ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" while the camera pans away leaving the viewer tortured by their own imagination. Plus riffs on tipping, torture and Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" This is a must see movie. Told in cool flashbacks. Perfection.",Reservoir Dogs
176,MichaelMargetis,The Best Film I've Ever Seen!!!,10,16 April 2005,"#1 Best Film of 1992When most people are asked what their favorite movie or the best film of all time is they are quick to give general responses like 'The Godfather' or 'Schindler's List' or 'Apocalypse Now', but not me. Yep, my favorite film of all time didn't even get one single Academy Award Nomination. It did get a couple of Independent Spirit Award Nominations though, and received an award for Best Supporting Actor. This movie is 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino's absolutely amazing film debut that stayed with me for longer then any other film I've seen. I don't know how to explain how much I love this film, but I'll try.The film plays a lot like a play (it takes place mostly in one location - a warehouse.) The story follows six small-time crooks from different backgrounds, they are Mr. White (Harvey Keitel - Bad Lieutenant) a middle-aged old-school con with a mean streak but strong conscious, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - Kill Bill Vol. 2) a psychopathic hardened criminal with a sick sense of humor and a deep hatred for cops, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - Fargo) a nasty, cheap and down-to-the-point little guy who's very street smart and has some hysterical one-liners, Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino - the writer/director of the film) a wise-ass con with a grudge against Madonna, Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker - writer of Animal Factory) who we don't really know much about, and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth - Pulp Fiction) a young and ambitious guy who's really an undercover cop trying to frame the other cons. These six guys are put together by a gruff old timer criminal Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney - Dillinger) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - Rumble Fish). Their plan is to knock-off a jewelry store in downtown Los Angeles that's getting a shipment of polished diamonds from Israel. The robbery doesn't go as well as they planned and the cops show up. The crooks get the diamonds but two of the six get killed during the robbery. The film never actually shows the robbery, because pretty much the whole movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse (the con's rendezvous place after the robbery). The surviving criminals start showing up there and try to figure out who set them up as they talk about the heist in retrospect. This powerhouse of a film features one of the very best screenplays ever written filled to the brim with rich and engrossing dialogue that will intrigue, repulse and shock you all at the same time. The acting is absolutely incendiary, with award worthy performances from Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and especially Steve Buscemi in a role which won him the Best Supporting Male trophy at the Independent Spirit Awards in 1992. The characters are so carefully detailed and layered that it seems like you've known them for all your life, which is probably thanks to not only Quentin Tarantino but the group of immensely talented veteran actors who play the four main roles. The directing is very impressive for a first-time filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino, and the cinematography is definitely worth noticing. Another wonderful factor of this incredible crime-drama is the the collection of 70's rock music. This will probably stir up memories of viewers 45-55 years of age.'Reservoir Dogs' is a marvelous achievement in cinema, but it's not for everyone. If you are squeamish this isn't the best movie for you. 'Reservoir Dogs' is perhaps one of the most violent American movies in recent years featuring gut-shots, prolonged bleeding, ear slicing and an extremely violent and sadistic torture sequence that is both horrifying and darkly hysterical. In conclusion, 'Reservoir Dogs' has enough energy to power a 747 and then some. To quote another movie critic reviewing another movie, Reservoir Dogs is better than perfect, it's thrillingly alive. That description impeccably describes Quentin Tarantino's first masterpiece. Grade: A+MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #1",Reservoir Dogs

180,departed07,Quentin's first attempt at movie-making!,10,16 February 2008,"Reservoir Dogs was the first movie directed by Quentin Tarantino before moving on to big projects such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill where he uses violence, hard language and sharp dialog to keep this film on an edge.The film starts off with six gangsters with colored nicknames working for Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son (Chris Penn) where their mission is to rob a bank and make it back with the jewels. The only problem is that somebody knew about the operation in advance where the surviving members meet back at a hideout where questions must be answered and fast before they get busted.While Joe and his son run the operation, the leader of the nickname pack is Mr. White (Harvey Keital) a lowlife criminal who is confident that things will run smooth. The rest of the group is followed by Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) a motormouth who always has an opinion for everything he sees; Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the new criminal who befriends Mr. White; Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) is the old timer who doesn't have much to say; then there's Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) who makes references about Madonna and her wild oral sex along with her music videos; then there's Mr. Blonde A.K.A., Vic Vega (Michael Madsen) a tough gangster with a bit of an attitude.As the gangsters hide out in a local warehouse waiting for answers and help, the premise of the film shows flashbacks of the characters before the operation starts with some of them being friends along with others joining the group because of a reputation. Scenes cut back to the present time where time is running out and things get more violent with a few bit surprises along the way.This is a classic Tarantino movie where he wants to show audience members what it's like to watch his films from hardcore violence, hip soundtracks and movie references.He still remains a master filmmaker.",Reservoir Dogs

184,PyroSikTh,Impressively Amateur,8,14 September 2020,"Reservoir Dogs, for the uninitiated, follows a group of career criminals in the aftermath of a jewellery heist gone wrong. Almost the entirety of the movie takes place in the rendezvous point; an abandoned warehouse, as each character comes back one-by-one, hinting at what went down during the heist, and attempting to figure out who of them ratted them out to the cops. As we go we get flashbacks to establish backstories for each of them, and how they came to be involved in the heist. But Reservoir Dogs makes it abundantly clear that the heist is not the point. It is never shown, only ever alluded to, leaving audiences to piece it together as the movie goes on. It becomes a sort of whodunit instead, making it a fresh and interesting take on the gangster genre.Reservoir Dogs greatest strength is undoubtedly the writing. The story itself is far more intriguing and original than it has any right to be, especially considering this was one of Tarantino's first ever movies. The dialogue as well is so quick and sharp, full of quotable lines and teeming with character. The opening scene in the diner is often lumped up as one of the greatest movie openings with good reason, as it gives a unique insight into each character involved, and foreshadowing almost the entire movie when you know what to look out for. Its endlessly referential treatment of pop culture also marks one of Tarantino's most identifiable trademarks, and this is where it all began. It may not be the most original movie around, often accused of plagiarism of other similar movies, but nothing compares to the sheer writing talent on display; a talent that Tarantino has only honed from here on.It's also particularly impressive that this was all pulled off on a surprisingly small budget. They filmed in only a few select locations, repainting rooms to appear like completely different locations just to save money. The costume department was also almost non-existent, with many of the actors wearing their own suits. This smaller budget lends itself to some of the film's greatest quirks, like not showing the heist nor the actual torture of the infamous torture scene, but it also gives the film a rougher quality that can be hard to get behind at times. Its lack of polish is sure to be quaint for some viewers, but for others it can come across as amateurish (which is hardly surprising considering that's exactly what it was).Needless to say that it's still impressive the clout Tarantino managed to achieve even before this movie, just based on his screenplay alone, to get the talent that he did. While no-one in this movie was a household name, it's still a remarkably impressive cast for a first-time director. Tim Roth gives a fantastic performance as Mr. Orange, left writhing on the floor in pain for much of the movie's runtime. He also shares fantastic chemistry with Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, as the underlying bromance of the whole film. Michael Madsen is truly menacing as the psychopathic Mr. Blonde, Steve Buscemi is marvelous in a rare serious role. Even Chris Penn offers an engaging enough performance and insight into his character.There's no denying what Reservoir Dogs achieved at the time, and even today it would still be an impressive debut, but it certainly pales in comparison to Tarantino's later efforts, given bigger budgets, access to even better actors, and after a few years of experience of how to craft truly great movies. The fact a movie as budgetarily flawed as Reservoir Dogs still features on top movie lists is staggering impressive, and well-earned. I give it a solid 8/10, for the writing alone, because it doesn't have much to offer beyond that.",Reservoir Dogs
185,CinematicInceptions,"A little overrated, but still entertaining and interesting.",8,26 August 2015,"I found this movie to be slightly overrated. I'd heard about Tarantino as an over-the-top director that had some really famous material, and this was definitely a unique movie, but not quite as praiseworthy as I'd been led to believe. That might be because Tarantino's style just doesn't appeal to me, but on the other hand, I enjoyed Django Unchained. Still, I can see how this would have caused people to be excited for the release of Pulp Fiction a few years later.The way the story pans out is very different and unconventional. The actual diamond robbery is not actually shown, apart from a couple scenes of just before the heist and the escape from it. Gradually, the surviving crooks come back to their warehouse and try to figure out which of them is the cop that ratted the group out. Through their conversations, we can piece together the gist of what happened during the robbery. There are a few flashback scenes that show how the more important characters were recruited for the job by Joe Cabot. Fortunately, it's very easy to tell what is and isn't flashback, but they're timed so that it seems as though the character in question is wondering back to why they signed on to the job in the first place. It's not really an action movie, but can appeal to fans of that genre. The violence has a similar tone to a WW2 movie rather than something like the Matrix with cool and stylized fight scenes.The characters are very memorable, partly because they are named by colors, partly because of the tipping/Madonna conversation at the beginning that has nothing to do with anything, and partly because they are written and acted well enough to be distinct. Blue and Brown are hardly shown at all since they both die during the robbery and are mentioned a couple times as the survivors discuss the events of the failed robbery. Joe Cabot is the hulking mastermind behind the whole job, and you get the sense that he's an incredibly ruthless man. His idea to use six strangers was smart since none of them would be compelled to save each other as a group of friends might. Unfortunately for Joe, he doesn't count on Mr. White's protective feelings for the younger Mr. Orange, which remain unshaken to the bitter end. Mr. Orange is injured for the majority of the movie, and his back story is probably the most interesting of the bunch. Mr. Blonde is violent and trigger- happy, shown by his iconic torture scene. Mr. Pink could be construed as the coward or the peacemaker of the group, depending on how you view it. It's hard to say whether he gets what he deserves since we don't really know what happens to him. Last is Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, who doesn't have any part in the robbery to speak of. You get the sense that he's been a privileged kid that's used to getting his way and doesn't have a lot of field experience as a thief.The camera-work fits the aesthetic pretty well. The warehouse scenes have a lot of very long, wide shots that fit well with the long conversations they depict. This style might have gotten old, but the pacing really helped reduce that. The acting is good, but there isn't really opportunity for any hugely impressive performances. With the amount of dialogue involved, the script needed to be well crafted, and it was for the most part. I thought they could have restrained some of the swearing just because much of it felt out of realistic context.It's a very male film both in cast and genre. There's lot of blood at some parts if you like or dislike that, but it's not put in a context where it makes you sympathize with the character like in say 127 Hours. The Mr. Blonde torture scene is also something to be conscious of if you think you're considering watching it. You need to be willing to pay attention your first time around, but it can be more of a fun movie if your with a bunch of friends who have all seen it before. If you're disgusted by the opening scene, I would recommend that you give it another twenty minutes to decide whether you want to watch the rest. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.",Reservoir Dogs

I mean it really withstands the test of time.Watch it again today and it's like going back in a time machine, like nothing's changed since then. It is still one of my favorite films.

His debut may be the end result of learning every trick from Stanley Kubrick to Samuel Fuller (and ingesting every bungled heist movie from The Taking of Pelham 123 to Ringo Lam's City On Fire) but QT set about revitalising both Indiewood and crime cinema with a brash panache.The post-modern template was set down here: shrewd pop-culture references, a talky, 'realistic' script - and committed performances from the edgy likes of Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi.

189,chaswe-28402,Terminal bodycount,8,1 September 2018,"Exceedingly difficult flick to review. Very difficult to watch twice, knowing the plot, which is anyway rather obvious in a way. I've been reading the one-star reviews, but I don't agree with them. All drama is influenced by somebody else's earlier work. This is very well-written, witty and inventive. Could be acted on a stage. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde. It is also extremely well-acted by all concerned. The Tarantino trademark is the depiction of criminals as just like everybody else, with the same sort of conversation and preoccupations, outside the lawlessness and obscenity. What do they call hamburgers in France ? Interesting point. I wouldn't want to be called Mr Pink. I have to admit that the violence is off-putting, after it's been experienced once. Glad to have seen this film, but can't really positively recommend it, although I give it a fairly high mark. Don't understand the title. Reservoir ?",Reservoir Dogs

It deserves praise it gets, though I can't help to feel he even overdoes it with constant swearing. You feel like you are watching boys in the primary school argue because someone rattled them to the teacher for doing something bad. But I guess it's just his way of showing us how they are ""losing it"". Still, it is what it is... It's fun and interesting , characters aren't one-dimensional and it's a joy to watch.

193,moviemanMA,Two Guns Up!,10,27 August 2005,"A director's first feature length film can make or break their career. If the film is successful and looked at as a nice first piece, the director must keep it going and make an even better picture. But the real test is the first picture's appeal to audiences. It can't be dull, boring, and have a bad ending. It has to be great all the way through to the last frame. One director created a whole new type of movie...a Quentin Tarantino film...In Quentin Tarantino's film debut Reservoir Dogs, we follow a group of men who attempt to steal a shipment of diamonds. Joe (Lawrence Tierney), the organizer of the group, has hand selected each of the six men who will perform the robbery. Each is given an alias except for Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to hide identities in case of someone getting caught and to cover up tracks. There is Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and much to his dismay there is Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi).The job appears to be simple, get in, get out, and get paid. There are eight men total and not a single one of them could ever expected what would happen. After a nice opening in a small diner and what would become the ""Reservoir Dogs March"", we cut to Mr. White and Mr. Orange driving away really fast to the ware house where they would all meet. Mr. Orange has been ""tagged"" in the gut and is bleeding quite a bit. Mr. White has given him his real name, Larry, to comfort him. When Mr. Pink arrives shortly after them, he gives his side of the robbery gone wrong. They both agree that there is definitely a snitch in the group. During the heist, the police appeared out of nowhere almost anticipating what would play out. Mr. Blonde in a state of panic/craziness decided to start shooting innocent people, fearing someone triggered the alarm. When the dust settled, cops were dead, civilians were dead, Mr. Orange was shot, Mr. Brown was shot in the head and believed dead, Mr. Blue was MIA, Mr. Pink and Mr. White are trying to solve everything, and Mr. Blonde has a surprise for them...a cop in a trunk. The movie takes an interesting turn as Mr. Blonde's sanity is in question and the cop is ""interrogated"".Tarantino's unique style shines with his camera angles, music selections, and of course...his dialogue. Tarantino's writing is phenomenal and incredibly brilliant. As soon as the movie starts he thrusts us into the middle of the eight men having a conversation of breakfast. The conversation being Madonna's hit single ""Like a Virgin"". The meaning of the song and how it was derived is brought up. Not your average movie talk, but it's just like real life. The flow and the reactions from everyone make it very real. This is by far Tarantino's strong point. He takes a great story and writes an incredible screenplay. The cast is phenomenal fulfilling their roles as tough guys out to do another ""job"". Keitel is the tough talking, heart of gold bad-ass who will help you off the ground and shoot the guy in front of him at the same time. It's as if his conscience takes a break every now and then. Buscemi and Madsen earn respect for their deliveries as Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde. Roth does is impressive as the rookie and shows his strengths at acting. Even Penn and Tierney deserve credit for their roles as father and son. They might not act like family but put a gun in one of their faces, the other will be at your throat. All together this a magnificent ensemble.Reservoir Dogs will go down in movie history as the gateway to a new generation of film making. Tarantino brings us one of the most unforgettable movies of all time. Thankfully he didn't let this movie go to his head too much and made more great films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bill movies. This movie will quickly become one of your favorites. You will not be disappointed...",Reservoir Dogs
194,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Edgy, engrossing and still holds up well as a heist film over the years",8,13 September 2006,"""I feel like a director who has not yet directed, therefore I don't exist."" Said an idealist, enthusiastic Quentin Tarantino back when he was working at Video Archives in the early 1990s, eager to start climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. At this time he was just a screenplay-writer, penning early works such as Natural Born Killers (a baby of his he felt he stabbed in the heart when he gave up to Oliver Stone to rewrite), True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawnall initially fruitless fares that no one dared to green-light. Production companies were choosy, cliquish and wouldn't give an untested director like Tarantino a break. Not even for Reservoir Dogs.Growing increasingly frustrated at navigating the world of hard-to-please production corporations to OK his project and pass him the director's chair, Taratino approached producer Lawrence Benderarguably the best choice of his career (he's been working closely with him ever since). Bender loved the script of Reservoir Dogsand who wouldn't? It pours crime, gangsters and humour into an exquisite blender and sprinkles it with heavy doses of edgy style. Together the two of them set out to do this film, and soon caught the eye of Richard Gladstein at Live Entertainment in Van Nuys, who would later agree to finance the little project.It really was a ""little"" project, too, with a budget of a mere $1,200,000which meant that the '65 Yellow Cadillac that you see in the film is Michael Madsen's own. Yet breathless and excited at becoming a debut-director and finally getting to tend to his baby himself which this position now afforded him, Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender began the process and the mega cult hit that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). Harvey Keitel was first approached to star as Mr. White and with his name on-board, he himself convinced several star-actors to grace the cast list along with him. He told them they wouldn't get much money for it, but that the script alone was worth jumping on-board for. They agreed.That's some basic back-story for you on how this film came to be, and I feel it is important to keep in mind the fervent enthusiasm and gratitude with which Quentin Tarantino embarked on his debut-director journey. It translates in the eager, rapid-fire dialogue between the characters, the clever pacing of the story and the fresh edge of the narrative. This is a man with a deeply-rooted love for films and who wanted nothing more than to make his own--and now that privilege had been granted, and not a minute too soon. Upon the release of ""Dogs"", Tarantino was rightly vaulted into the great directors' fame and, I imagine, became even more enthusiastic about film-making.The end product is a very good film that sees five anonymous hit men team up for a big heist  an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse that will be central to the wide variety of eccentrically quirky characters who all lend their skills to the job. The heat of the police clings onto them during this task because there's talk of a rat in their group... but who is it? The film starts at the end of the robbery, zooming in on a chaotic bloody state and then backtracks in flashbacksnon-chronologically and a bit babbling, but it still worksin an attempt to answer this question. Does it? Yes, but perhaps not in the way you think.Although this fare is devoid of any profound message, morals or statement and there's no discernible kind of symbolism, it is extremely enjoyable on a basic level. In fact, maybe its straightforward approach to a storybut with criminal diversions, twists and plot-devicesis what makes it so great. This is a clever heist, just take it or leave it. The interactions and actions between the characters are at focus, placing environment in the backseat; this means that Reservoir Dogs can proudly boast of having one of the greatest dialogue-driven scenes in film, and it takes place at the beginning at the diner when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) explains to the other guys why he does not tip waitresses--the others are compassionate and argue that they are minimum-wage workers no rely on tip, but Mr. Pink is stern: ""Do you know what this is? Its the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses. ""The film is full of gems like these, full of great colourful gangster performances (in particular Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde--the most badass character in history) and full of clear-eyed and gory style. As far as heist films go, this is a grand accomplishment. If anything, it is a bit short (99 minutes). These characters are so interesting that we never feel as though we get to know them enough--it's a little rushed and a little dizzying at times. This is no surprise as Reservoir Dogs was originally written as a short film, barely stretching 20 minutes and with characters that weren't meant to be particularly developed or dimensional. They are more so in the final, long version, but it's still a little too rushed. Although I suppose is intentional on Tarantino's part to signify the hectic pace of the heist and the cops chasing them.Tarantino sported a modest wallet and a modest ego that had not yet swelled to a ""Cro-Magnon forehead""--as ex-friend and Natural Born Killers producer Don Murphy would describe it--when he wrote and directed this film. Indeed, this aspiring filmmaker loved films so much that he would make a lot of enemies and lose a lot of friends during the course of climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. No friends were harmed in the making of this film.8/10",Reservoir Dogs
195,rdoyle29,A dazzling blend of influences and originality,10,20 September 2000,"The script for ""Reservoir Dogs"" was written in just three weeks and is a blend of originality, enthusiasm, and homage.  Quentin Tarantino worked in a video store and turned himself into a sponge and encyclopedia of cult, often violent, marginal and sometimes classic cinema.  The film is dedicated to, among others, the cult figures Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Chow Yun Fat, and Roger Corman.  The taut screenplay is filled with references to Tarantino's favourite films:  ""The Killing"", ""White Heat"", ""Rififi"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Straight Time"" (based upon the book by Eddie Bunker, who plays Mr. Blue), among many others.  The concept of a gang of mutual strangers known only by colours appears in the New York subway heist film, ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"", one of Tarantino's favourites.  A key source was another Tarantino favourite, Ringo Lam's ""City On Fire"", which features Chow Yun Fat as an undercover cop infiltrating a jewel gang, scenes in a cafe, a sequence where the cool-looking gang walk in hip, bedraggled unity towards the camera, and concludes with an identically composed Mexican stand-off.  Another source was ""Odd Man Out"".  The film is fascinating for its complex borrowings, but most admirable for the profane poetry of the dialogue, the complexity of the narrative structure (similar to ""Rashomon""), and the stylishly camp soundtrack.  It is supremely cool, and gained an instantly devoted following.  Everything about it was taken from somewhere else, and yet it has a style all of its own that established the Tarantino signature - a look and sound all its own.",Reservoir Dogs
196,majikstl,Cruel intentions...,1,18 May 2004,"((((SPOILERS))))) I can think of nothing kind or good or positive to say about this truly repulsive motion picture. It is, quite simply, cruel. Quentin Tarantino's badly written script focuses on the events leading up to and the aftermath of a botched jewelry store heist. The heist itself is largely inconsequential to the story, as Tarantino's intent was apparently to create a character study of the participants. Yet, he has failed to give any of his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing. The cast does little to add depth to the characters beyond the routine tough guy gambit of shouting their obscenity-laden dialogue at the top of their lungs. As such, they never raise their one-note performances above the level of brain dead savagery. But good, bad or indifferent, the actors have little to work with in the first place. Tarantino's much deified dialogue is insultingly dull-witted -- banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity. The kindest thing to be said for Tarantino's ability to direct action is that it, at least, distracts from the emptiness of his written words. But, it is the violence that pushes the film into the realm of the utterly contemptible. There have been films with more violence and with more explicit violence, but few revel in its violence to the extent of RESERVOIR DOGS. The film doesn't use violence to show cause and effect, or to make a social statement, or to reflect reality, or even for cheap shock effect. It is violence for the sake of violence. The violence in DOGS is purely sadistic; a sleazy, pornographic celebration of inhuman cruelty.
Here and in his other violence-obsessed films, Tarantino embraces the infliction of pain as not just an act of power, but of an almost orgasmic display of gratification. Add to this the fact that the victims of the violence are usually bound, helpless, terrified, tortured, randomly selected and undeserving of such cruelty and the violence clearly becomes symbolic of rape. Worse, such savagery encourages the audience to identify with the perpetrator, not the victim, and Tarantino (all too effectively, I'm afraid) tries to make the viewer complicit in his sadism.  Okay, if Tarantino wants to indulge in his little S&M fantasies, that is his business. What is disheartening is the way people -- filmgoers and professional critics alike -- have been seduced into not just tolerating Tarantino's sadism, but to applaud it as well? DOGS centerpiece is the totally unnecessary and illogical kidnapping of a young policeman who is subsequently beaten, tortured and mutilated, for no apparent reason other than because it amuses one of the psychotic characters -- and, one can presume, Tarantino himself. The director stages the torture sequence like a comic musical number, complete with rock background music and choreography; casually topping it all off with the young officer's murder being the punchline of a joke. ""That's entertainment!"" seems to be Tarantino's pathetically cruel message. This killing should inspire anger or, at the very least, pity for the innocent man. Instead, it elicited raves by film viewers who see the scene as stylish, or worse, cool. What does it say about our society that not only do we condone the glorification of senseless violence as entertainment, but applaud it as art? Why have we become so obsessed with the matter of ""style"" that we can't see that beneath Tarantino's superficial technique there is sadism? RESERVOIR DOGS represents some sort of low point in the history of cinema. That it helped propel Tarantino to be considered one of the most influential directors of our time represents some sort of low point for society.",Reservoir Dogs

Tim Roth also gives what I believe is his best as the wounded Mr Orange. Lets not forget the cool, laid back, completely insane, shady Mr. Blonde, played by Michael Madsen. There's also the nervous Mr. Pink, who was well played by Steve Buscemi. Chris Penn is well cast as the loud-mouth, suspicious Nice Guy Eddie.

200,diac228,Quentin Tarantino's cult classic that raised eyebrows over a decade ago still stands as among the best indie films ever,10,7 October 2005,"Before The Bride had to kill Bill, before Marvin got shot in the face, before Mia and Vincent won a dance contest, and before dangerous gangsters start calling each other different kinds of fruits, someone had to get an ""earful."" If none of the references in the prior sentence are recognizable to you, then there is a problem. Reservoir Dogs is the film that put Quentin Tarantino on the map and captured the attention of critics and filmmakers everywhere. This low-budget instant cult classic remains a favorite amongst avid moviegoers and also influences a good portion of movies out today. Cleverly mixing dark humor with gruesome and yet realistic violence, witty dialogue, and also a fantastic cast of characters, Reservoir Dogs remains one of the greatest independent films of all time, over a decade since its release. What also makes this film truly shine is its unique storytelling and totally non-linear plot. This film is a true gem.Reservoir Dogs is the story about several men involved in a massive robbery that could result in many stolen diamonds and a lot of cash. After the robbery goes horribly wrong, it is then realized that one of the men involved in the heist actually told the cops about the plan. That is the plot, plain and simple, but what makes this specific plot different from the typical movie story is the way that it is presented. The plot is thrown at the audience like tossed salad, unexpectedly jumping from one event to the next in no particular order. What also allows this plot to shine is the heavy amount of dialogue amongst all the people in the film. The robbery itself is never actually shown, but all the grisly details of what happened as stated by the characters paints a perfect picture of what went on. This is one of the few films to ever come out that can be just as intriguing reading the script alone as opposed to seeing it unfold in the big screen.Casting was brilliant. The top performance in the film belongs to Michael Madsen, who portrays the rather psycho yet very calm Mr. Blonde. Madsen as Mr. Blonde has the standout scene in the film for sure as he flawlessly helps create one of the most humorous yet disturbing scenes ever captured on film. Everyone else did a superb job in adding a bit of realism and drama (and even some humor) into the film, including Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. This film looks like an action film, but contains very little of it, nonetheless remains entertaining because of the suspense and never losing its pacing. It will keep everyone on the edge of their seats up until the very end of the film.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors out there, but what helps his status as among the top filmmakers is the fact that he can weave some very good stories. Like all his films, Tarantino keeps his films raw, out of control, uncut, and totally unpredictable. This kind of film-making is rarely ever seen, it is usually him and Robert Rodriguez that are known for producing films that perfectly blend action, drama, and a bit of dark humor. Another thing that separates Tarantino and Rodriguez from everyone else in the business is the careful selection of music. Instead of having a musical score all the way through, Reservoir Dogs mainly consists of several forgotten retro classics, and at many other instances, no music at all. This lack of an orchestrated score is another reason why his films are totally unique, yet unbelievably effective.The movie is much deeper than just a film about a bunch of people pointing fingers, there is much more to it. Requires several viewings, but by the end you will see all the dramatic irony, all the wonderful details in the plot, and even see the foreshadowing here and there. The film is truly a storybook come to life, details and all. The ending was simply perfect, it was totally anticlimactic and that is why it perfectly works. While the film itself is brilliant, the way the movie ended guarantees that Tarantino is not overrated in terms of what he does.Bottom Line: A superb film that should be viewed by everybody. There is nothing wrong with this film, and there is good reason why it had such acclaim, despite the lack of box office success. Even though this is not Tarantino's best work (Pulp Fiction takes the cake) Reservoir Dogs is leaps and bounds above the typical movie in terms of quality and importance to the industry. The casting was great, the dialogue was perfect, the directing was top-notch; everybody that wants to make it big should take notes. Reservoir Dogs: a tour de force that is so much better than the average indie film; it is no-holds-barred and out of control, and this is the way films should be made.Score: 10/10",Reservoir Dogs
201,avik-basu1889,"A visceral, violent Situational Comedy",10,28 August 2015,"'Reservoir Dogs' was Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and immediately he showed what he was capable of. He made critics and audiences sit up and notice. The plot of the film follows a group of criminals as they try to identify the rat among them after a botched jewellery store heist.First of all, there may be many individuals who might accuse this film of being high on style and low on substance and I won't completely disagree with them, but when the style is so viscerally mesmerising, I am willing to forgive the slight lack of thematic depth. A huge chunk of the film takes place inside a warehouse sporadically interrupted by flash backs which give us a little background on some of the characters. These scenes in the warehouse considering the context of the plot are absolutely riveting and they pretty much make the film feel like a play at times. The palpable tension in these scenes reminded me a lot of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. The main theme of this film I think is identity. The characters in the film don't know anything about each other including the names. All they know is that they have to professionally carry out a job by trusting each other and working as a team. The audience is also put in a similar position. We don't get to know too much about any of the characters either. We are always kept at a distance intentionally. However we can get some glimpses of the nature and characteristics of certain characters through some of the dialogue and some of their behaviour, but even then it's only glimpses. Throughout the film we see roles being reversed. Genuine bad guys asking each other and trying to figure out who the 'bad guy' among them is, we see a bit of a role reversal in an interrogation scene leading to gory torture, we see good guys doing bad things along with bad guys to win their trust,etc. This film is also a quintessential 90s film. The flashback scenes outside of the warehouse ooze the gritty nature of 90s L.A. with the street graffiti, the crime and the rugged streets, etc. The story is in a way simple, but in the simplicity we see how the lives of criminals ultimately fall apart.I have always felt that Scorsese and Tarantino's directorial styles are somewhat similar. They both have no problems in using bloody violence, they employ deft ways to pay tribute to the films that inspired them in their films, they use music in their films in a very artistic and contextual way and they make films that can be deemed to be 'cool'. All this can be found in 'Reservoir Dogs'. The soundtrack of this film is absolutely fantastic. It brilliantly complements the 'cool'-ness of the visuals. Tarantino likes his set pieces and there are two absolutely brilliantly directed set pieces in this film that gave me goosebumps. The screenplay has to be admired a lot too as it is the screenplay that complements the direction and in a way lays down the scope for Tarantino to create and tension in the film.The acting is brilliant from all involved. There are some lengthy single takes which allow the actors to really go for it and I noticed a lot of method acting throughout especially from Keitel and Buscemi. Keitel, Buscemi and Roth are the ones that impressed me the most. 'Reservoir Dogs' might not be the most deep film that I have ever seen, but I still consider it to be a masterpiece. This is a film where a rookie director showed us his skills behind the camera and gave us an entry to a style of filmmaking that later became a standard to which films made by other directors with similar style came to be compared and being called 'Tarantino-esque'. Yes it is at times self- indulgent, but it still is a visceral experience and one of the best directorial debuts in film history that should never be missed by film lovers.",Reservoir Dogs
202,Bogey Man,A striking debut of Mr. Tarantino (or Brown),9,20 October 2002,"Quentin Tarantino's love affair with cinema is clearly visible with this debut film of his, RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a film which belongs to one of the most memorable and important American films of the 1990's. Tarantino wrote and directed this film and the result is great. This is the kind of film that doesn't require millions of dollars from some major studio and it's (of course) ten times better and noteworthy film than many of those which require.The story is taken from Hong Kong film maker Ringo Lam's masterpiece City on Fire (1986) which is one of Tarantino's favorite movies which I understand. A bunch of criminals unknown to each other and following a plan which was meant to be flawless and water proof rob a diamond store. Something went wrong and a violent gun battle and quest for life and freedom took place and it was obvious there was a ""rat"" among them who informed the force about the details of the robbery. The film is told as a flashback as some of the gangsters, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arrive to their meeting place in an abandoned storehouse waiting for the others, Mr. Orange very severely injured as a result of a gun shot wound. Other cast includes Tarantino himself, Eddie Bunker, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn and they're all as great and interesting as the story and its many sides.The film is a homage to masters like Martin Scorsese and several Hong Kong directors like John Woo and of course Ringo Lam. Their films usually depict honor and loyalty between men and criminals and how they are ready to risk their lives for a friend and the one they love. RESERVOIR DOGS has these same themes and they are as soulful and believable here as in GoodFellas or A Better Tomorrow, to name just a few films. Also the statement about tipping and the position of many ""uneducated females in America"" at the beginning is definitely an important one and despite the scene being pretty funny, it is also serious and important.The characters are great and speak much, but not in vain. They are interesting and real and the dialogue just secures this by forcing the viewer to go with the verbal flow inside the characters' soul. The dialogue is often very clever and also very funny and witty without being stupid. Tarantino is great screenwriter and story teller, too, and the flashback structure of RESERVOIR DOGS proved this for the first time. The soundtrack is again very nostalgic with many seventies classics which Tarantino grew up with so it is another homage this film maker wanted to make with this first film of his. The film is occasionally pretty violent but the violence is never glorified or made look good and entertaining. It is raw and painful and never without its results. Mr. Blonde (Madsen) is one of the most sadistic screen psychos of the nineties and he is definitely willing to use violence ""just for the fun of it"" but it doesn't pay in this film any more than in real life, either, and the gangsters learn it the hard way during the film and their fateful 2 minutes robbery.RESERVOIR DOGS is personal and intelligent film and began the film career its director had dreamt about during the years he worked at the video store, and this film once again proves what can be done when there are talented makers and ideas which don't require major studios and huge amount of money. It is great Harvey understood the talent of Tarantino and wanted to help him begin his life as a film maker.9/10",Reservoir Dogs
203,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,10 December 2004,"Some of the best performances of the decade, mixed with some of the best dialogue and most memorable scenes make Reservior Dogs Tarantino's first, and finest film. His direction is sure and every shot is played with utmost thought. The soundtrack is cool, the violence is strong, but not gratuitous, and the story is brilliantly told.A cop goes undercover with a gong of crooks to expose their ring, and takes part in a heist that goes terribly wrong, leaving several of the thieves dead, and a bullet in his own gut. As he can't reveal his identity as he bleeds, he waits with the other survivors to work out a plan. The other survivors are torn over what to do, they have the jewellery but jealousy and egos flare until the final shoot out. Every actor gives perhaps their best ever performance, every scene is full of tension as we wait for someone to blow. Professionalism is ironically sliced apart, and the flashback narrative hasn't been used so well since Rashomon. None of the characters are particularly likable, but we are with them for the duration. Several scenes are brutal, but filmed with the audience's morality in mind, and nothing is done just for the sake of it. Genius in every way.",Reservoir Dogs

I was waiting for all this awesomeness to come, but I didn't see much of it. Their names are maybe the coolest thing in the whole movie.It looks good considering the low budget and being Tarantino's debut, but mostly it's just OK. And that god damn ""Tarantino-dialogue"" that everyone can't stop yapping about, what is so great about it? I find it more annoying than anything else.Btw, just to make it clear: I love violence, I don't mind movies that lack plot, and I don't mind style over substance. What I do mind is boring movies.Maybe if I didn't know anything about this before I saw it, or didn't know what I was seeing, whatever, I would have enjoyed it more, but that wasn't the case.

207,bob_meg,Sheer brilliance...prepare to watch it over and over again,10,14 December 2009,"After Soderburgh's ""sex, lies, and videotape"" announced the arrival of independent cinema with a polite cough, it's younger brother ""Reservoir Dogs"" stumbled in the banquet hall and puked on the floor. But oh, what a glorious heave.There are two things right off that make RD so astounding. The first is that it both honored the genre of the crime drama and simultaneously took every one of its time-honored conventions and gleefully ripped them to pieces. The second is that this multi-faceted character-driven action picture, which is so tight and so seamless (while still managing to be jaw-droppingly original in its execution) could be the work of a (for all intents and purposes) a debut director.People accuse Tarantino of writing scripts full of sensationalized dialog (""it sounds cool but people would never really talk that way""). I don't agree. I think what primarily gives his films their appeal and power is that his characters talk PRECISELY about the things we would talk about...the insane minutiae that would normally bore the average person silly, but in a cool way. It's a lot like a Seinfeld crossed with a film-noir.And this easily relatable language allows us to care about and becomes involved with a variety of characters, not the least of which are a gang of hardened criminals running for cover after a botched jewelry heist.What's even more astounding about the film is that the plot is really just a sidebar to the character dissection at the film's center. We want to know what drives these guys, and after seeing the movie, we do. We may not like what we see, but we never look away whether in boredom or disbelief. These are not cardboard action figures.How Tarantino plays this rich cast of rogues against each other and the constant switches in narrative time-line is strategic and fascinating. Yes, it's been done before, in other films, but rarely to this great of effect.And that may be the most impressive thing about this movie: it does what all truly great indies do best...they economize toward the betterment of the picture. Every frame here adds something...even the blank frames where all you hear is Steven Wright's wonderfully adenoidal mumble as he exhorts you to attend the next Monster Truck Extravaganza. That undoubtedly lowbrow event fits the seamy world the picture revolves in perfectly.This film is just as unmissable, and once you see it, assure yourself it will be only for the first time.",Reservoir Dogs
208,theshadow908,Awesome crime movie.,8,9 July 2006,"Reservoir Dogs tells the story of 6 total strangers who are gathered by a crime boss and his son to pull off the perfect crime. They don't know any information about each other going in. However, tension and conflict arises when the robbery goes wrong and they decide there must be a snitch in the group. The group spends the film in a safe house, fighting and accusing each other, waiting to be picked up. Reservoir Dogs is a violent and in your face movie, and that's what makes it so great.Before Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino was a complete unknown. He was all set to make this film with $30,000 and a bunch of friends, but Harvey Keitel wanted to be involved, and the movie became professional. The movie showed right away the talent that Quentin Tarantino had for film making. His artistic camera angles, his intensely violent scenes, and best of all, his intelligent and witty dialogue. Reservoir Dogs is a small movie. It takes place all within a day, all within one place. We don't even get to see the robbery take place. However, this still ends up being a classic film.The acting is great. Harvey Keitel put everything he has into this movie, and Steve Buscemi is great as the neurotic Mr. Pink. This movie serves as Michael Madsen and Tim Roth's most memorable roles, and rightfully so.Overall, this is the great film that introduced Quentin Tarantino to the world, and I suggest anyone that liked Kill Bill but hasn't seen any other Tarantino movies, go back and watch this film.8/10",Reservoir Dogs

The characters, the story and the robbery gone wrong that one never gets to see - it adds up to one of the very best crime flicks of the past century.Tarantino has a way with characters, style and dialogue that few others have. The dialogues in particular has become a trademark of his (not to mention the blood and violence), and in ""Pulp Fiction"" he got to show off the best dialogue ever written. This is the fore-runner.

Why exactly? The acting of course, the dialogues of course and whether you like it or not, the admiration of brutal violence. What directors like de Palma or Scorsese were hiding is by Tarantino exposed till you puke... just watch how many dialogues are spoken by actors who are bleeding till death. Or the famous scene in where a cop looses an ear (all on the rhythm of Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck in the middle with you""...when an ear is cut the personages usually die after two seconds, by Tarantino they are living for 15 minutes or more while he isn't ashamed to make some close up's from the wounds... And the script, Jesus Maria...after some minutes you are so fascinated that you even forget you have to pee... Was Pulp Fiction better?

The dialogue is fast and furious, the action - despite how little action there is - is brilliantly filmed, and the acting is fabulous on all parts.The story, as many of you probably already know, follows four criminals taking refuge in a warehouse after a bloody diamond heist.  In the aftermath, Mr. Pink convinces them that one of them has to be an undercover cop, because the cops got to them way to fast.The four nameless criminals are Mr. White, a hot-tempered veteran (Harvey Keitel). Mr. Orange, a young guy, new into the business, who was shot after the heist and is severely injured (Tim Roth).  Mr. Blonde, a calmly psychotic 'crowd controller' who has recently been released from prison (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Pink,  a cowardly little weasel looking out for his own best interests (Steve Buscemi).The acting is definitely the prime jewel of this movie.  All roles are done perfectly and totally believably, namely by Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi.  Madsen delivers a terrifying performance as Mr. Blonde, especially in the infamous 'ear scene' in which Blonde dances to seventies tunes while hacking a cop's ear off!  Buscemi deserved his Independent Spirit Award as Mr. Pink, seeing all the lines he's memorized and the emotion he's put into his role.Terrific movie, they don't get better than this!  9.5/10!",Reservoir Dogs

And the ending was very predictable, including what I guess was supposed to be a plot twist.Mostly fantastic actors and acting though.
Tarantino's made alot of fun, more recent movies, but his chaotic, sometimes cringy style of trying really hard to be edgy still shines occasionally. It kind of works now that he has the budget to go big on props, sets, effects, etc. But going back to his old movies, I don't like any of them. But I see small glimpses of what probably made them fascinating back in the early 90's.By the way, I don't think a small wooden door of a warehouse that's right next to people's houses and evidently children's parks (judging by the ambient sounds used) is soundproof enough to block all the gunshots and screaming coming from the inside.",Reservoir Dogs

By Quentin Tarantino.,8,30 April 2017,"""Rent Dogs"" transpires style and charm, in his first film, Quentin Tarantino shows the public all his cinematographic resources, ranging from the script to the use of cameras, through cuts and soundtrack, even if many of the resources are abandoned later , Quentin arrives with his foot in the door bringing a gangster movie that closes almost an intersection between films of the genre of directors like Brian de Palm, Martin Scorsese and Coppola, because it brings the tone and photography would be alienated the irony, joke and humor black. With a Linear script that has several tours to the past, we have a movie about a theft to jewelry, where the robbery is not shown, and this is absolutely brilliant, as we see the consequences and discussions about what happened, imagine the scene, Tarantino Gives us the brushes and we paint the screen, it is worth noting how Tarantino completely develops his characters only through dialogues, although later in the film has scenes of pure developments that are played on the screen. We have a history of a group of 5 criminals who are hired by a mafia to steal a jewelry store, but their plans end up being very, very wrong to find out that one is an infiltrator. The film does not establish any type of morals, nor does it need to, this is not its function. We have a photograph that contrasts strong shades of gray with warm colors, although at times it seems careless, it is beautiful, filmed completely in roll, at times it seems that we are watching a film of the 70s, and that is a compliment, because it brings A giant charm the film, without original songs but orchestrated by pop music of the 70s, its track is completely irreverent and dictates the rhythm of certain scenes, besides making the viewer want to dance, its use in opposition to violence and crime is a Complete discord, we hate to love it. With a good sound mix and a completely fabulous editing, the publisher Sally Menke has many merits for leaving the film round and the famous expression ""Tarantinesca"" passes through her hands, and of course, we can not ignore the camera angles, the Tarantino's famous counter-plongée camera is used a lot here, not to mention its circulations on the bar table and its angle in the ""Mexican Impashes"" promoted by the director. All the actors are very well here, save a highlight for Steve Buscemi and especially Tim Roth who freaks out on the scene, even though there is a good part of the film on the bloody floor, obviously we can not fail to mention Harvey Keitel. Finally, the first Tarantino film has errors, such as the overdevelopment of certain characters and a rhythm problem; besides, Tarantino never marks his acts (which is a style, not exactly a defect) even though it is full of Charm, although very simple, it has a giant cinematic quality and certainly the few features contribute to the inherent beauty of ""Rent Dogs""",Reservoir Dogs

Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) is a small time mob boss and is assembling an elite squad of thieves to make a hit. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Blue are the robbers and are told to rob a Diamond warehouse.But something goes terribly wrong when the police arrive at the scene almost as soon as they've entered the place. Mr. Brown is killed and the rest are able to get out to the hide out. Now they've realized there is police informant among them, but who is it? Reservoir Dogs brings a new sense of brutality to crime movies. Instead of the occasional shot ringing out, Tarantino is able to bring a real sense of evil through Mr. Blonde, the ruthless killer and torturer. Each character is somewhat introduced over the course of the movie through flashback mode, some more than others. Standing as the lead characters are Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and Mr. White (Harvey Kietel) both of whom are tryi9ng to figure out how the crime went wrong. The robbery is never shown and I think it made the film that much better. Instead of a massive shoot-out with police and the robbers triumphantly winning, we see little clips and of them running. The movie is Taratino's first and, in my mind, his best. He is able to portray crime in the horrible, wicked act it is. He is able to develop and create characters better then anyone else I've seen, and is just able to tell a good story.

The film though it is 25 years old still is as captivating, enjoyable and relabel as today, dispute the fact that many of it references in pop culture are now dated and forgotten.What made me like this film is that from its opening to the end credits ,we see the preparation, recruitment and outcome of the heist, so we know the needed information about our characters from their goals to their character. However the heist itself we only learn about it from your crew and so we can picture what happen ,what went wrong and the reason why trust has been thrown out the widow.To the references I mention that are dated, true there are but they are placed in the dialogues as a starting point for a conversation. This is what makes the dialogues real and sell the fact that these persons live in the real world ,for a decent percent of a conversation start with the phrases ""Have you watched the {movie B or film A}?"" or ""Do you know this film/series?"". It feels natural because Tarantino had already understand that people remember what they have watched in a cinema or on TV (and today on-line) and it is a good measure to see if you can talk with someone or just sat up and wait until the group calls of today.Also the non-linear way the events are presented force the audience to picture themselves the causality of the story and so end on a conclusion by their own. That requires from the director to believe that his audience are willing to put their brains at work, which is so rear and often forgotten by many director/studios. Over all Reservoir Dogs is great and as first features films by a director go ,it is one of the best and as the opening shot for the Quentin Taratino Cinematic Universe is has a special place to the heart of any of Tarantino's work!",Reservoir Dogs
221,OttoVonB,Cinema Reborn,10,9 September 2002,"First films aren't meant it be like this, have no right to be anywhere near this good. They tend to have an academic respect for storytelling rules, to emphasize the visuals.Reservoir Dogs made Tarantino as a director. It was his first chance to truly take control of one of his zinger-laced screenplays and make it his own, and it was his first time working with actors. And with results that would kick-off one of the most revered filmmaking careers in the history of Hollywood, he faced his insecurities head-on: it's all in the performances.This film should not work because it is a heist-film where you never see the heist, where you find out more about a character's take on Madonna's lyrics than their deep-seated motivations for committing the off-screen crime. Most of it happens in a grim safe-house, and features many actors who barely registered on people's radars, led by Harvey Keitel who, immeasurably generous with his co-stars, championed this film into existence and let others keep its most memorable moments.Reservoir Dogs is an impeccably written, performed and crafted dark little gem. It kick-started a slew of new bad habits in filmmaking: self-aware dialogue, retro- soundtracks, and language that comes with its own hygienic disclaimer. Yet like all masterpieces of note, the more you see its influence applied, the more it shines for getting everything perfectly right. it's safe to say Tarantino, drowning in critical-adulation and his urge to fill every film with 70s B-movie homages, has not matched his work here since.

A Masterful Film Debut From Quentin Tarantino.",10,11 July 2013,"Reservoir Dogs is an excellent Crime Drama,A Cinema Classic and one of the best film debuts of all time. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing screenplay and a fantastic soundtrack,Reservoir Dogs is a great introduction from Quentin Tarantino and is filmmaking and Tarantino at their best.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of criminals who are brought together to rob a jewelry store and steal diamonds. But when the robbery goes wrong,the criminals think the jewelry heist was a set up and one of them could be an undercover cop and this leads to violence and distrust between thieves.Reservoir Dogs is an excellent,remarkable classic film and the fantastic debut that introduced audiences to one of the biggest and most famous directors in the history of cinema Quentin Tarantino. With Reservoir Dogs Tarantino has crafted one of the finest movie debuts of all time and one of the films that defined independent cinema in the 1990s and was a set up for his masterpiece Pulp Fiction or in other words if Pulp Fiction was dinner then Reservoir Dogs was the appetizer. Reservoir Dogs is an amazing film because what Tarantino has done is taken the influence of American heist film,Asian cinema of the 1980s and French Crime films of the 1960s and used them as an influence and applied it to this film and crafted a movie that right from the start is cool and powerful,stylish and fresh,violent and darkly funny and in many reinventing and recreating the Crime Drama genre and giving it a different style and feel. One of the great things about RD is that we as the viewer never see the jewelry heist actually happen but the events that happen before and after the robbery going back and forth with events and characters. Tarantino didn't want to make a film that went from A to B but a film that was told in unconventional style. The main characters in the film are great because while they are not likable the criminals have certain coolness and charm about them to make you like them and be interested in who they are. Another great thing about the characters is how they act before and after the robbery. Before the robbery the criminals are laughing and joking with each other having good times and talking about various things whether it's tipping waitresses,Madonna's Like A Virgin or planning the robbery but after the robbery there is fear.paranoia and distrust among the group and you don't know what's going to happen between them throughout the film. The screenplay by Tarantino is fantastic and just well-written with Tarantino giving each of the main characters great and memorable dialog that is dramatic,cool and darkly funny with iconic style. The dialog and style of Tarantino screenplay would set us up to what was about to come in Pulp Fiction and later Tarantino films. The violence and Action in the film is bloody and shocking and when the violence happens it is surprising and unexpected and when you watch RD you as the viewer feel like no one is safe from violence that's in the air. Although RD is not an Action film The film has great Action scenes and the Action in the film comes at an intense and rapid fire pace and when you see the Action in the film you will feel the impact of the Action scenes. The ending for RD is great and unforgettable and you will be blown away by it's power and intensity. The ending will stay in your mind and is one of the reasons Reservoir Dogs is a classic.The whole cast is wonderful. Harvey Keitel is excellent and intense as Mr. White-Larry with Keitel bringing depth and power to the role. Tim Roth is brilliant as Mr. Orange-Freddy and has great scenes with Keitel. Michael Madsen is wonderful and frightening as Mr. Blonde-Vic Vega,a psychotic criminal. Chris Penn is fantastic as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot,Joe's son. Steve Busemi is a great scene stealing delight as Mr. Pink,a fast talking criminal. Lawrence Tierney is wonderful and intense as Joe Cabot,the boss of the group of thieves. Eddie Bunker(Mr. Blue),Quentin Tarantino(Mr. Brown),Randy Brooks(Holdaway)and Kirk Baltz(Officer Nash)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for voice-over work by Comedian Steven Wright(K-Billy Radio DJ).The direction by Quentin Tarantino is brilliant with Tarantino always moving the camera with hand held photography and powerful intensity and slow movements and close ups. Great direction,Tarantino.The soundtrack is fantastic with songs from Harry Nilson(Coconut),George Baker Selection(Little Green Bag),Stealers Wheel(Stuck In The Middle With You),Joe Tex(I Gotcha),Sandy Rogers(Fool For Love),Bedlam(Magic Carpet Ride),Blue Swede(Hooked On A Feeling)and more. An amazing soundtrack.The special make-up effects by K.N.B FX are excellent,bloody and very realistic and add to the film. Great make-up effects from K.N.B.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Reservoir Dogs,an excellent and unforgettable classic from Quentin Tarantino that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Reservoir Dogs
226,zeekwunlau,A well-planned robbery with a complete failure,8,26 April 2020,"Several people, several rooms switch, several guns, but a thrilling robbery show is full of performance, the entire movie is also a model of a small-cost movie, no formal robbery scene appeared, the ups and downs of the plot is enough to make you admire The story is wonderful.The gang boss, Joe, called six people who didn't know each other to prepare a diamond settlement. His gameplay is very interesting. Six people can't talk about any personal privacy issues. Everyone uses a color for the name. The robbery After careful planning, but ambushed by the police, he was embarrassed and failed. Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown became the soy sauce directly. Mr. White rushed to the meeting place with the injured orange. Pink got the diamond and hid it in a place to come to the meeting. The gold kidnapped a policeman and brought him to question. They wanted Find out the truth and want to know who is the inner ghost?According to the linear narrative, this story is nothing more than an ordinary robbery, but the director chose the way of flashback and interlude to make the whole story look ingenious. The performances of several actors are very exciting. Mr. White, played by Harvey Kettle, is the most loyal brother of Jianghu. He thinks that Mr. Orange 's injury is related to himself, so he desperately maintains when the last pink is accused of being undercover. He, this is a bohemian-style character in a Hong Kong film, plays Tim Rose in orange. Everyone is more familiar with his ""Sea Pianist"", the 1900 he starred in, in this movie he Join the robbery gang by saying a line, complete the undercover mission, pretend to calm yourself, and brag about how calm and calm you carry drugs in the toilet in front of the four policemen and a police dog. Gold is a pervert, but he is very loyal to the old father and son. He listens to music and abuses the captured policeman. He never forgets to be cool. Mr. Pink is Steve Bussim, who I admire for his acting skills. After seeing his ""Sky Prison"", he can express the mental appearance of a perverted killer with one look. In this movie, he is the most chattering and the most. The role of the chicken thief only cares about his own interests. He lived to the end and swallowed the diamond alone.The name of the movie is ""Luo Shui Dog"", which is actually full of irony. When several people dressed in black suits and wearing ink mirror images of the characters in the Hong Kong gangster film came out of the wind, it seems that the big brother of the rivers and lakes has actually fallen to a water dog The ending is full of black humor. Life is so ridiculous, it seems to have made a fortune and become rich, and ran towards a better future. In fact, it is a busy one. No one can grasp their own destiny. People are imagining a river and lake, thinking that they can quickly avenge their enemies. In fact, in the end it is not at all like that, there is no romance, only cruelty.",Reservoir Dogs
227,x_manicure_x,Wordy but stylish,9,14 August 2021,"""Reservoir Dogs"" pays obvious homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"", but at the same time reinvents the film noir formula thanks to its director's referential yet highly personal style. First of all, it's a heist film without the heist: the camera only shows us the setting up and the aftermaths. It's closer to a theatrical play than it is to a movie, with a bunch of men exchanging dialogue in a warehouse where comedy, surreal and grotesque seem to coexist. It's a simple, low budget, one-setting film where the iconic characters do most of the job, thanks to the combination of an excellent cast with Tarantino's gripping, black humor-driven dialogues. It's a lot of lengthy conversations to deal with, but every single line is gold and tells so much about each character that there is no need for explanations or complicated backstories. The non-linear storytelling, which would later become one of Tarantino's style trademarks, helps to keep the tension high and sheds different lights on each character as the film unfolds. The story itself is really nothing new, but all twists still manage to kick in at the most unexpected time, sometimes with significant changes in mood or shocking consequences. ""Reservoir Dogs"" has been notoriously known for its unapologetic violence, but it's actually one of Tarantino's least graphic films. As with the heist, it's more about what's ""told"" than what is ""shown"": Mr. Blonde's infamous torture scene or the final set-off manage show really little but still manage to feel so cold and brutal. It's far from being Quentin Tarantino's most polished or ambitious work, but somehow still one of my favorites, if not my ultimate favorite of his.",Reservoir Dogs
228,troyputland,Stunning work for first time director Tarantino.,9,26 January 2016,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie. It's not clear that he had a low budget to play with, because what he's done with it is superb. A robbery gone wrong force a group of criminals, only known by different colours (Mr. White, Mr. Pink etc.) into an abandoned warehouse, to await help. In the mean time, they work out who the mole is. Tarantino fleshes out characters motives with a speech driven screenplay, music that defines memory and the ability to play on our imaginations. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel and Roth are astutely incomparable, their given names matching their sporadic personalities. Reservoir Dogs is a profound start to Tarantino's career; one that's hard to beat with an unbeatable style, fast paced dialogue and an unforgettable scene that, whenever Stuck in the Middle With You by Stealers Wheel comes on, springs to mind instantly.",Reservoir Dogs
229,Emerenciano,Quick and straight to the point,8,21 January 2004,"I've seen many of Tarantino's films, so I knew what was to come in this ""Reservoir Dogs"". Many people (I'm not included in this group) don't like his movies because of the violence, slangs and dirty words. In my opinion this is just a real display of what happens in many parts the world nowadays. Of course Tarantino and his intelligence exaggerate in some things, but this is just to mock these tragedies and give his works a taste of irony. There's always something funny in his pictures. In this ""Reservoir Dogs"" we laugh when the criminals discuss their nicknames, a few moments before starting a robbery.   Tarantino, in my opinion, belongs to the same group Woody Allen, Pedro Almodovar and a few others do: the geniuses of cinema. Many people don't easily understand what they do (are these directors worried about it?) but I just think these guys have a lot (of good things) to say and show us.",Reservoir Dogs

From Mr.Pink's ""no tipping policy"" to Mr.White and Mr.Blonde's hilarious dispute to Mr.Orange self-encouraging words in front of the mirror, all the way up to the last line of the movie.  What Tarantino has done is take this solid script,his best yet, fine some great actors suited to the roles and show the world what a great director he truly is. The result: A classic.

233,werefox08,Raw meat...for the audience,8,23 March 2012,"Reservoir Dogs was made on a very low budget. However, Quentin Tarantino makes a superior movie. Its a ""Heist Gone Wrong"" story which is always interesting----It is scattered with comedy (and Black Humour) ..and amusing dialog about the most meaningless subjects ----for example (the Music of Madonna !!). We never get to know much about any of the characters, but that never detracts from the entertainment. The flash back nature of the whole film...is done skillfully. There is a ""no holds barred"" honesty here, but some scenes may disturb those who don't like...........lots of blood.

235,Mr Parker,Hell of a debut film,9,9 August 2005,"I revisited this film a couple of days ago and a couple of things struck me about it. This is one hell of a film to have as a calling card. For one, the cast that this movie has is enough to inspire serious jealousy. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Laurence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Chris Penn... hot damn! You really see just why everyone wanted to make a film just like this one after it was released. It's funny but the film is so derivative of other crime films that it becomes an entirely new animal. Tarantino delivers a film that is completely sure of itself and what it wants to be. Yeah, some people complain that it's a ripoff of other films that preceded it, namely Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" but still, the film has so many memorable moments and gobs of instantly quotable dialogue that it is undoubtedly a classic of independent cinema. Tarantino's acting in this film is thankfully subdued. Violence comes in sudden jolts and reminds you of what kind of people it is you are dealing with within the film. The music selection is inspired and he does a great job of establishing these characters through their words and actions, which is why this film is so great. You have to love the characters, even in the case of Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) who gets much less screen time than anyone else in the film.I would like to at least give a nod of special attention to all of the actors in this film. Every single one is a crucial piece to this puzzle and are all very believable in their roles. If I had to pick one scene that was my favorite, it'd be very difficult. Whether it's an outburst of sudden violence or a conversation across a coffee table, this film delivers in almost all aspects.There really isn't much more that I can say about the film that hasn't already been said. The film is a bit rough around the edges technically speaking but hey, it was the guy's first film and it was filmed on a pretty shoestring budget. Regardless, this is simply the kind of film that one wishes they'd have as a debut film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",Reservoir Dogs
236,williampsamuel,Dogs is a Bloody Good Movie,8,11 January 2015,"Quinton Terantino's Reservoir Dogs is one of the most blood soaked, shockingly violent, and wildly entertaining movies I've ever seen. I honestly don't know if I've ever seen anything like it, and I'm certain nothing like this had been made before. It's brutal yet witty, with the tapings of a cheap exploitation film but the heart of a classic noir.What Terantino has done is to take the basic formula for a heist movie, crank up the violence by a factor of ten, and turn it on its head. Rather than taking us through the careful planning, the daring heist, and the inevitable final act in which everything unravels, Reservoir Dogs jumps straight ahead to the bloody aftermath. One guy's dead, another's missing, and another is bleeding out from a stomach wound. The only thing the robbers can be sure of is that someone set them up. Now they've gotta find out who- if they don't kill each other first.The amazing thing about this movie is that even though there are bullets aplenty and blood everywhere, it's not the action, but rather the characters and dialogue that drive it. Nearly half the movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse, where the main characters try to figure out what the hell went wrong and what they're gonna do about it. Much of this movie's success is due to the superb cast, Including Harvey Keitel as the veteran, professional Mr. White, Tim Roth as newcomer Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as the utterly psychotic Mr. Blond, and the priceless Steve Bulsami as the sniveling, slightly neurotic Mr. Pink.Another of the film's strengths is its dialogue; key when most scenes involve the characters standing around talking to- or screaming at- each other. Terentino has managed to give every conversation a comic edge, but without tipping over into the realm of farce. Highly instructive is the opening scene at the diner, where the wise guys discuss the meaning of Madonna's songs and the importance of tipping. None of this has anything to do with the plot, but it sets the tone and reveals much about the characters and their personalities, especially Mr. Pink.Or take the scene later on in which Mr. Blond sings and dances along to Joe Tex's I Gotcha- while dousing a tied up cop with gasoline! We've been hearing from the others that this guy is absolutely psycho; it would appear that they've seriously understated the case. It would also seem that Terantino must also be nuts to come up with material this demented.In scene after scene he manages to crank up the tension, paranoia, and bloodshed to a level that approaches self-parody. It's shocking, it's over the top, and it makes you want to laugh, then leaves you wondering if you're all there. It's almost, but not quite in the realm of satire. It's funny, gory, shocking, and absolutely unbelievable. In short, it's everything you'd expect from Quinton Terentino.",Reservoir Dogs

238,thenolanfan,Review - Reservoir Dogs,6,6 April 2020,"This first movie of Quentin Tarantino, is already from the opening scene everything you would expect from him, you have powerful and funny dialog, and obviously, a cameo by Tarantino himself.The movie is divided into sections some of them relate the story of the main characters while the main story arc is relating the end.You have all these stories that end up together.However, the flaw in this movie is the story, at my eyes, it seems that attention of details was put to have a very good and long ending, but the since the movie is only 99 minutes long, the sub-arc for each character is ""facilitated screenwriting"" which means that there is no strong link created between each character. In other words, these scenes would have been good if they did bring a new element to the story. However, in this case, they relate a part of the story that was already known by the viewer or that had no influence later on, Which means that at my eyes, these are anecdotal.To conclude, I believe that another useless part of the movie is to the minor characters. Characters like Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue don't have personality, I see them as extras. A good decision by QT was to kill them because he didn't want his story to be separated into too many parts which would have made it lost its coherence. But decided to include them in the movie. The question that I ask myself is ""Why did he decided to include them in the movie if they have no purpose and they gonna die in the first few minutes"".Anyway, that is all that I got the criticize this movie, I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it was average.",Reservoir Dogs
239,revival05,Perfect movie. One of the greatest.,7,19 April 2000,"Even though 'Pulp Fiction' is quite better, 'Reservoir Dogs' tops most movies. Although the acting is so chemical, under it you can see that the team really enjoys to working together. Their teamwork is the main attraction to the movie. But, good acting is not really a savior. The directing, debuting Tarantino, and script, also QT, is what people will refer to as 'the old fashion Tarantino-style'. The movie is soaked up with blood. It is horrible, as in explicit content, but still, in a way cool and quite funny (if you can look closer?).                              This is simply a gangster movie that is out of the ordernal. 'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't get predictable, from the fact that the story has been rollercoastered around and the scenes are all in a great mess. But that is also a main attraction. I love this movie, because it has got a hidden meaning deep under the very intensive pulse of this gangster-classic.                              Harvey Keitel and co starring Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Quentin Tarantino and Edward Bunker as the gangsters they would stick up on (nah, not really, but, kind of) are fantastic titles and brings this cult-movie up even higher, as I've said.                              The absolutely gross torture-scene (Michael Madsen, Kirk Baltz) should nobody miss. It's a classic.                              Rating: 9/10",Reservoir Dogs
240,Screen_O_Genic,Don't Trust Nobody,7,12 April 2019,"Typical Tarantino flick - loud, vulgar, lots of posturing over substance and quite compellingly viewable. Talky (and shouty), the film goes back and forth between time frames to depict a heist gone bad. A good cast and good acting override the B-grade tackiness and overall shallowness of the film, rendering this offbeat curiosity of blood and designer suits worth the view.

241,galileo3,"Tarantino's debut film, is cool and crisp, but ultimately average",9,2 January 2008,"RESERVOIR DOGS (1992)Quentin Tarantino, a director I have grown to admire over time has a lot of credit to his name. Pulp Fiction shook the foundations of modern cinema, Jackie Brown had Tarantino being smarter and even more complex and the eastern/western homage 'Kill Bill' saga, was a bloody, thrilling and beautifully served dish of revenge. Plus, he writes all his screenplays including other notable ones (True Romance).Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is a quick action/crime film set during a day in Los Angeles, after a bank robbery (flashbacks elaborate the story). The film begins in a diner, where the gang talk and discuss different matters. It is there, during that scene that you get the first dosage of Tarantinian script-writing; that fast, coarse, punchy, irrelevant lines that won him an Oscar in Pulp Fiction.The film itself gets a bit boring in my opinion. It's blunt, monotonous and quite uninteresting. There's not much to enjoy, as Tarantino jumps back and forth between the gangsters, who overview the situation of the robbery afterwards.I cannot understand why so many people have taken such a liking to this film, when it is quite empty and shallow.6/10",Reservoir Dogs

243,illbebackreviews,Reservoir Dogs is an exceptional 1990's classic and is the film that began the career of one of the greatest directors!,10,25 January 2013,"Now, I'm a big fan of all of Tarantino's big movies such as Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds having loved all and appreciated his brilliant style and entertaining dialogue. As a writer, I believe Tarantino is the best of all time and that Pulp Fiction is easily one of the best movies ever. Now, I've been excited to see this movie for a while as I adore Tarantino's work.Reservoir Dogs is a mob movie about a mob who begin to suspect each other to being an undercover police officer, and thus a traitor, after a jewellery robbery is tracked down by police. This film is so cleverly done, making this Tarantino's first movie in which the film is chronologically mixed up. Most of the flashback scenes are done well...to me, I did find the dialogue in the movie not as great as that in Pulp Fiction and the characters no where near as good as they were in his '94 masterpiece but still enjoyed them nevertheless.The problem I had with this movie, despite it being a Tarantino movie is the extended runtime in the movie. Despite being a 90 minute movie, I found myself thinking that a good 10 minutes could've been cut from this movie, especially since the dialogue wasn't as good as Tarantino's later work. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy them but they didn't strike me the same way that his other films did.The acting in this movie is very well in this movie even with a nice cameo role from Tarantino himself in his first movie. I really liked the style in which Tarantino approached his debut movie. He could so easily have made a basic movie but decided to try a new method to film making which takes real courage to do so.The film was very violent, funny and entertaining despite this being my least favorite Tarantino movie by a tiny bit. I thoroughly enjoyed it still for its acting, the story, the characters and the dialogue, despite it being his weakest.Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is an absolute must see for any lover of classic movies and it certainly deserves to be called one!",Reservoir Dogs
244,herbqedi,Intriguing low-budget caper film stalls midway through,5,5 July 2006,"Reservoir Dogs starts off intriguingly enough. It's a perfect crime caper that goes horribly awry. It's a joy to see Lawrence Tierney as the honcho putting it all together and the late Christopher Penn gave his best performance on film as his son. I must differ with other comments on Tim Roth. With his on-and-off British accent and giveaway expressions even when Harvey Keitel is trusting him, I thought his performance was the weakest in the film. Speaking of Harvey Keitel, he and Buscemi play the yin and yang of professional criminals with Masden somehow providing the perfect perpendicular middle ground to each. So far so good. The violence goes with today's exposition of the genre so it neither bothered me as it did others nor did it inspire genius-worship; it was just part of the accouterments of this movie as far as I was concerned. *** here's where the spoilers come in *** What did bother me was Masden, very bright otherwise, being stupid enough to let Roth get the drop on him and kill him. At this point, the movie delivers 15 minutes of monotony and a pointless flashback to how Roth insinuated himself into the caper. Finally, Tierney and Penn arrive. The climax is well executed and the ""moral"" is delicious.If you are a professional criminal, be professional. Do not let any human frailties, emotions, loyalties, or senses of right and wrong interfere with your execution. There is no place for humanity in the life of a professional criminal.So, overall, RD is an average low-budget caper film with moments of brilliance and a lot of flaws. It probably deserves a 6.5 from me rather than a 5, but seeing it with an 8.4 and listed as one of the top 100 movies of all time made me feel obligated to try to balance it out a bit.",Reservoir Dogs

The film starts off with the classic Tarantino side-talking routine, that he would later explore in Pulp Fiction. It slowly develops into a violent thriller in the vein of The Killing (1956). There is something compelling and original about all the violence and destruction in this film that separates it from other thrillers like it. It's hip and cool but it also has the same artistry that made The Killing such a successful film. Keitel is great and he has a good cast to give him back up.",Reservoir Dogs
246,mistoppi,A film made skilfully and with just the right amount of passion,10,15 January 2016,"A story about a heist gone wrong has been dealt with over and over again, but Reservoir Dogs definitely gives something new to that story as old as Hollywood at least. You never see the heist that went wrong. You see the characters before and after. Then you just hear what the characters saw. That's why the dialogue in this movie is so important, because without it, we wouldn't know anything about what happened. But if several people see one event, they all see different things. So are we sure exactly how it happened based on what the characters said? Do we need to be? The beginning of Reservoir Dogs is legendary with its sharp and witty dialogue. That opening dialogue could be from anyone's life, anyone could have the same conversation. But in this case it just happens to be between men who are about to rob a jewellery store, because why would they talk any differently compared to other people? The nonlinear narrative let's you know what you need to know precisely when that information is useful to you. If the story was completely linear, the excitement wouldn't be so great. If you knew right from the beginning who set them up then watching Reservoir Dogs would be a lot more boring.Many scenes lack the soundtrack, which just makes the tension in the warehouse grow. But whenever there is music, it is always well chosen. Stuck In The Middle With You is such a light-hearted little song, yet it feels like completely different song after this film. Tarantino knows how to use time. Not one part of Reservoir Dogs in unnecessary. And only the things we really don't need are left out. Usually people either try to force a movie to be 1,5 hours, or they try to make it slow so it feels longer. Both of these are wrong. Each film needs a certain amount of time, and there's no point trying to make it longer or shorter.Reservoir Dogs is an amazing movie. There's not a moment there that I don't enjoy watching, even if they include gallons of blood.",Reservoir Dogs

Tarantino's accolades from giving American cinema the resuscitation it needed mirrors what has happened, at least since the 70's, with Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets', both in terms of entertaining violence and usage of music in the scoring of films. I greatly thank Harvey Keitel for taking a chance on Tarantino back then--It paid off in spades.Minor notes: I also greatly enjoyed the six mini-interviews with people from the film on my DVD, 'Reservoir Dogs: Ten Years'.

Other than the acting, which was actually very good, everything else about the movie was mediocre. Quentin Tarantino thinks that you can simply use chaos to replace good storytelling and that's just not the case. This is a cult classic but like most of those, it's majorly overrated. Outside of the opening scene, nothing about the movie was entertaining in any way and really could've been told just as well in 20 minutes. Honestly, that's what Tarantino does. He takes a 15 minute story and fools the audience into thinking it's a halfway decent movie by using over an hour of fluff to fill out time between the constant back-and-forth of the plot. The acting and the opening scene earned the movie a 5/10. Anything more than that and people are just lying to themselves because they want to feel part of the cult following. Then again, I'm pretty sure we have a name for people like that nowadays and they're called hipsters. Isn't it ironic.",Reservoir Dogs

Reservoir Dogs is a wonderfully made film with some great performances, that was expected the thing that I still fail to see how happened is how Quentin Tarantinos script was so bad. The dialogue is still amazing as it is in all Tarantino films but the story is horrible, it is filled with clichés and hardly makes any sense. Tarantinos usual thing about not having the film in the order of how it happened like most films just makes this film more confusing and pointless. The saving points are that it does have several very good scenes. ""Spoilers"" 1. The naming. 2. When Mr. Orange is talking to his cop friend. 3. The ending.

I could care less about Pulp Fiction, that was a decent movie that did well commercially but this one is his crowning achievement.This movie is well arranged. The Dialogue IS the movie. You can sit and turn the picture off on this one and the audio itself tells the story. The Music is absolutely great and well chosen. The acting was not extremely great, but that itself was also a masterstroke. The budget was small, the sets almost non existent, yet Tarantino created a wonderful piece of film making art, and assembled a cast worth watching. There was plenty of dark comedy mixed with the signature violence and blood that always accompanies Tarantino. The Characters have no names and are introduced only as colors, and that is one of the best scenes of this movie. It is a perfect blend of comedy, violence, crime, character development, plot, all told in a unique and intriguing way.Tarantino will probably never make a movie as well as this one again. He now basks in his own cult following and his love of bad B horror of the 1970's, and seems content in giving us horrible movies, bringing back a genre that nobody ever wanted to see (except really crazy people that rarely get out of their own basements) and there was a reason Hollywood stopped making.I say celebrate this one outstanding movie and remember Quentin when he used to be a decent film maker.",Reservoir Dogs

253,Sonatine97,Tarantino's Best film - he really has an Ear for coolness!,8,9 July 2000,"His first, and I think his best movie to date. Thank God for Keitel backing the movie and the Sundance Festival for showing it to a disbelieving audience. Although it didn't hit the box office too hard either side of the Pond it has become something of icon for its legions of fans who can probably recite at least 10 lines of dialogue and own at least one of those cool RD film posters (me included).Tarantino brought a little glamour and style to the gangster film genre, which critics felt made it alright to go out and shoot people so long as they wore black suits & ties and a pair of Rabans.But for me Tarantino turns that argument on its head and shows us that criminals don't win in the end, but die a bloody death.I also liked his choice of actors, although I wish James Woods had known about the movie because he would have made an excellent Mr Orange, rather than the rather lack lustre Tim Roth.But this is balanced out by a truly riveting performance from Michael Madsen as the sinister & sadistic Mr Orange; and another strong performance from Keitel as usual.But my two favourites would have to be Chris Penn's Nice Guy Eddie and especially Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink - a man so highly strung you'd think he'd shoot his own reflection in a mirror if he didn't no better.
We don't get much feedback from Mr Blue (Ed Bunker) or Mr Brown (a cameo from Quentin himself), other than at the start of the movie in the diner, which is a bit of a shame.
**** SPOILER STARTS ****** A lot has been said about the infamous ""Ear"" scene. But what exactly did we ""see"". Nothing, is the answer! That's the magic of Tarantino, he sets up the scene with the torture of the policeman and Mr Blonde produces a cut throat razor. He approaches the cop and takes hold of his head and then the camera moves away and we don't see anything except what our imaginations want us to see.The only debatable point is the fact it's a cop that is being tortured, but the important thing is that there is nothing to see -no blood, no guts, nothing. So what's the big deal!**** SPOILER ENDS *****The only problem I had with the movie was how Mr Orange remained so alert during most of the movie even though he must have lost about 3 or 4 pints of blood judging by the state of the warehouse ramp he was lying on.Nevertheless, Dogs is an excellent film, somewhat superior to his latter films of Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown. And it sometimes makes you wonder how the man is ever going to keep the mommentum going.Anyway, Let's go to work!****/*****",Reservoir Dogs
254,brianberta,Tarantino proved to be a talented director with his debut film,8,9 October 2015,"Quentin Tarantino is definitely one of the most famous directors out there. While he is most famous for ""Pulp Fiction"" which is commonly called one of the greatest movies ever made, many of his other films usually get high praise too. What I really like about Tarantino is that while most of his movies are style over substance, it usually never bothers me because his movies often contain a certain aspect to them that is handled so masterfully, I don't mind nor care about the lack of character development or depth. This is his debut film which started his movie making career and this is where all of his talent originated from.After a jewelry heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant and tension rises between them as they slowly start to become more and more suspicious of each other.I mentioned that the majority of his movies being style over substance doesn't bother me because he often handles a particular aspect so well that I don't mind nor care about the lack of depth. What makes this film work so well is its non-linear plot. If it was linear then it wouldn't be as interesting. Its timeline being out of order, however, actually works in its favor. In fact, we actually never see the jewelry heist take place. This movies shows us the aftermath of it. The criminals describe what went wrong in the heist often in the film and they describe it by using such descriptive detail that we are able to imagine what went on in the heist in our heads.Despite all the praise this movie has gotten, some people accused Tarantino of being a plagiarist. There are definitely some similarities to movies such as ""The Killing"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", and ""City on Fire"". Tarantino was definitely influenced by those movies but the word ""stealing"" is a pretty heavy and strong accusation. Reservoir Dogs is great by itself and it still contains a lot of originality. Tarantino clearly has an extensive film knowledge and he likes to pay an homage to some of his favorite directors very often. In Tarantino's case, his technique helped him make 2 of the best films of the 90's: ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".The ensemble cast works very well together and it helps shapes the movie. Usually when I watch movies, I find that only a select few of the actors stand out among the rest. However, I felt that all of the actors stood out a lot. Many of the actors talk fast and, by doing so, it really makes the words jump out of the screen. Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the one that steals the show though. He has been through a lot and we can't help but feel sorry for his character and he is the one that most people root for. Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) plays the mob boss. He does a great job in his role and he is able to convince the audience that he's a character that you don't mess with. I wish that he was in the movie more. If he was in more scenes, he would have been a much more memorable character but he still is pretty memorable in the parts he does appear in.Without any doubt, this film is definitely a masterpiece. It may not be on the same level as ""Pulp Fiction"" is in terms of greatness and impact on cinema history but its quality is surprisingly not far from it. I really enjoyed its non-linear plot structure and I hope that Tarantino expands on this in future films because he creates outstanding works of cinema when he does that. Every time he does it, I always find myself in awe in certain scenes, especially the endings which are very well-executed and often catch me off guard and surprise me. Back in 1992, Tarantino showed us what he was truly capable of and he proved to the world that he was, in fact, a very talented film maker.",Reservoir Dogs
255,Mr_Censored,"""You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.""",9,22 March 2009,"Only the likes of Quentin Tarantino could make a gangster movie as unconventional and as fresh as ""Reservoir Dogs."" With it's chunky dialogue, unsettling violence, non-linear storyline and excellent performances from it's talented cast, it's everything you would expect from the director and something that more movies should aspire to be.During a daylight jewelry heist, six well-seasoned criminals find themselves at odds when things go terribly wrong. The alarm is tripped, the cops show up and a lot of blood is shed. Despite the fact that they don't know each other's names -- they are instead given color-coded aliases to go by -- they have formed a kinship with one another that is broken within two crucial minutes. Retreating to a nearby warehouse, they tend to one of their own who has been wounded in action while simultaneously trying to figure out which of them is the rat. When talking doesn't settle things, they resort to gun-play, while the true story unfolds behind them. What results is a tightly wound, slow-burning little crime-drama known as ""Reservoir Dogs.""Setting a precedent for crime-dramas, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is notable not only for it's unconventional story-telling, but also for the fact that the ""job"" is never shown on-screen. Instead, the movie focuses on its characters, played by the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Tarantino himself. Keitel and Buscemi, in particular, are truly natural in their roles and keep the movie feeling genuine and engaging. Madsen plays the unpredictable role of Mr. Blonde almost too realistically, constructing a character that nearly steals the show, and who certainly has one of the most memorable moments of the film. Tim Roth doesn't have much to do here besides gush blood, but in his back-story, shows both strength and vulnerability. Tarantino -- despite being somewhat of an amateur at the time -- finds his vision early on in the film, establishing a style that pays tribute to his influences, while simultaneously breaking new ground only to influence a wave of film-makers in his wake. Made for just under a million, Tarantino stretches an inch into a mile into this amazing little film. It's simple, yet effective. It's loaded with fresh dialogue and a cast that works so well together that you feel like you're in that warehouse with them. Even when you know how the story goes, and it you find yourself watching it over and over again, it never fails to entertain and stimulate the senses, making ""Reservoir Dogs"" a certifiable classic.",Reservoir Dogs

257,heisenberg12,"A Crazy, Good Movie",8,28 January 2019,"Finally, while catching up on some popular movies I've missed, I got around to Reservoir Dogs. Luckily, the run time was only 1 hour and 40 minutes so I knew I could manage even though it took a few days to find the time for it after renting.So much has probably been said about this since it came out so long ago, but in a nutshell, this is a very good, classic crime drama that probably has inspired many movies and shows of the same genre since it came out. Everything is well-put together from the acting performances to the directing and writing.It combines a kind of ""who-done-it"" with some vintage, gritty Tarantino dialogue as a group of thieves deal with the fallout of their heist getting busted by police while camping out in some vacant building. The big question looming as it is apparent there must have been someone who was an informant in their group and they are consequently all now in jeopardy of being caught is ""who is the rat""?The fast-moving, well-edited film combines flashbacks with the present moment to put together how it all went wrong, leading to a shocking final conclusion that makes you, as a viewer, feel like you got your money's worth.Yes, Reservoir Dogs is a classic.8.3/10",Reservoir Dogs

Probably the same things what makes other Tarantino's movies good: great soundtrack, good actors, stylish direction and of course - violence (actauly there was only one scene which I would call really violent). The plot is pretty simple but it's portrayed out of chronological order (just like in Pulp Fiction). Probably that is what makes this movie different. Also everything in a movie looked pretty realistic (like violence) and all characters acted very natural (there were many memorable dialogs, so you could know each character better). This movie is very original, stylish and worth your time.",Reservoir Dogs
259,robsta23,What a Debut,10,15 November 2015,"It's very rare that we see a director establish him- or herself as a true talent with their first theatrical release. Not only did Tarantino establish himself as a great storyteller with the release of Reservoir Dogs, he also gave us a glimpse of his distinct artistic voice that we would anticipate in the years to come. He specifically set a trend in the use of dialogue which reminds us of everyday conversations yet is simultaneously layered with subtext and analogies.The opening sequence establishes Tarantino's master of dialogue perfectly. While the conventional director might open a robbery film with a scene which highlights the plan for the robbery, Tarantino strays away from exposition. Instead, we get a lengthy conversation in which the robbers analyze a song, discuss the ethics of tipping waitresses, and make pop culture references. What does this do? It establishes the characters as human beings and gives them life instead of having the boss merely explain the plot to the robbers, who would substitute for the audience.This might have to do entirely with the fact that the film had a low budget, but Tarantino essentially uses one location for about two thirds of the film. He is still able to establish an intricate and very tense story revolving around the idea that one of the robbers suspects an undercover cop is amongst them. The set design is simple - an abandoned warehouse - so the visual creativity of the film is mostly in the cinematography, but even with that, the heavy use of the warehouse as a setting makes this come across as more of a play, which it should. The dialogue is the driving force of this film, and while the characters may discuss plot at points (I hate it when movies rely on explanations of the plot through dialogue, a la Inception) it is only done when it is necessary. The rest of the dialogue reveals much more about the characters than visuals could provide in this film, and hey, I'm okay with that.One problem I have with the film is the fact that while this film revolves around a group of robbers we never learn too much about two of the robbers since they are hardly in the movie. In fact, one of them only has a few lines in the opening conversation scene of the film. The absence of that character would hardly change the meaning of the film at all, which is why I wish we would have gotten to know him a bit more. I understand side characters, but in a film about a group of robbers, the entire group should have a significant part in the film as an ensemble cast.A great directorial debut for Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs shines as a surprising hit for a crime film with such a low budget and as a huge influence on the manner of dialogue used in crime films between its release and present day.4.0/4.0",Reservoir Dogs

261,mr_popcorn,Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs,10,20 October 2006,"First scene. We see a bunch of guys in tuxedos eating and talking in a restaurant. They talk about random stuff like how the song 'Like a Virgin' by Madonna is all about big dicks and some guy explains why he don't tip to waitresses. Then, we hear K-Billy's voice and we see these dudes walking down in slow-motion. We now know who they are. Harvey Keitel as 'Mr. White', Tim Roth as 'Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as 'Mr. Blonde', the late Chris Penn as 'Nice Guy Eddie', the late Lawrence Tierney as 'Joe Cabot', Steve Buscemi as 'Mr. Pink', the also late Eddie Bunker as 'Mr. Blue' and the director himself, Quentin Tarantino as 'Mr. Brown'.Cut to next scene, we see a bloodied Mr. Orange in a backseat of a car while Mr. White is driving. They then went to the rendezvous point as, what they say, planned. The rendezvous point is actually an abandoned warehouse. Upon reaching the place, Mr. White tries to calm an almost dying Mr. Orange who's shot in the belly by an unknown reason. Then, enters a hysterical Mr. Pink who tells Mr. White that the heist went awfully wrong because he thinks someone in their group is a rat. The both of them pin points every possible people they know that might be the rat. Then comes Mr. Blonde who abducted a cop to squeeze out information on who might the rat be. One flashback leads to another and we see the whole truth. Mr. Orange is the rat and ensnares the other into the heist. Mr. Brown dies, Mr. Blue is dead as Dillinger, Mr. Blonde was shot by Mr. Orange, Mr. White, Joe Cabot and Nice Guy Eddie are caught in a Mexican Stand-off and leads to their eventual demise. The only surviving human is Mr. Pink who takes the jewel but was later caught by cops (audible in the background). And, oh yeah, Mr. Orange dies too.The plot is very original. A group of people who doesn't know each others names robs a jewelry store but the plan backfired. Someone tipped the cops and Mr. Pink thinks the rat is one of them. Great directing by Quentin Tarantino and a great cast. Harvey Keitel was outstanding. And so are the others like Madsen as the madman Mr. Blonde, Buscemi as the professional Mr. Pink and Roth as the rat, Mr. Orange. Added to that is the occasional voice-over of Steven Wright, the DJ of K-Billy's Super Sound of the Seventies. Excellent. A perfect ten for a perfect flick.",Reservoir Dogs

263,thekyles99,Tarantino's Best ......#1,10,8 November 2012,"One thing this Tarantino classic is brilliant for is the script alone. Tarantino is by far the best in the business when it comes to on screen characters and written dialogue! Reservoir Dogs is excellent proof of that and is one of the best casted movies that i can remember in a long time. Chris Penn (rip) who i thought wasn't that great of an actor during his short lived career, however he was brilliant as well. If you have never seen any of Tarantino's work, then i definitely suggest starting here as it will only leave you either wanting more or not. You see you either love Quentin or you don't their doesn't seem to be any in between. I myself before seeing this for the first time (RD was my very first Tarantino film ) did not like to sit through films that were heavy in dialogue as i found them immensely boring. That changed and was only cemented after also viewing his Pulp Fiction (Another character/dialogue enriched film).For those who have yet to see this cinematic masterpiece let me fill you in a bit. 7 men all hired by crime thief expert Joe Cabot to perform a job on a jewelry store that has according to sources a load of diamonds that just came in from Brazil, after the job goes very badly the men who survived the aftermath shootout with the police were to show up at the rendezvous point. We get three of the men Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) pulling a badly injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who had taken a bullet to his belly who are at the rendezvous point first and let the dialogue roll... All of the men seem to believe that the heist was a setup but have to unfortunately stay put until the arrival of Joe Cabot to tell them further instructions.Kudos here to Michael Madsen who portrays, most excellently the psychotic Mr. Blonde aka Vic Vega who was definitely my favourite character in the film. This is a movie i can easily watch 1000 times over and over again as it remains as one of the best films i have ever seen!",Reservoir Dogs
264,datorsiers2,I am amazed by the high rating.,3,26 August 2015,"Looking at the high rating of 8,4 and knowing that this is considered one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies i thought i was about to see a great masterpiece. I was absolutely shocked about how terribly boring this movie was. There is no progression in the plot at all, they didn't even show a second of the robbery the movie was about. For the first 50 minutes of the movie the viewer just sits through completely irrelevant and boring scenes, experiences next to no action and just gets bored, since nobody is presented with who is who in the first half of the film. It is impossible to be compassionate for the characters, since you don't even know who they are and all you see is just a bunch of useless drawn-out conversations, using a lot of useless sentences just to add to the screen time, which is only 99 minutes, by the way. The movie uses a lot of excessively drawn-out conversations, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but here it didn't fit, since the screen time is so short, leading into a very boring plot and irrelevant actions. I don't get what people see in this movie, yea the acting is OK, but otherwise, it is just garbage. Is it only because it is Tarantino? Is that everything people need to hear to give a positive review? I get that many people see this movie as ''different'' just to show others they enjoyed it, it would be awesome if everybody wasn't afraid of expressing their opinion and sticking to it.Overall a terrible movie, don't see that as a classic for sure, would not watch again nor recommend it to anybody else.

267,ryan_kuhn,"Interesting Premise, Solid Outing",7,13 February 2005,"We should have known there was something about this guy from Tennesse named Quentin Tarantino when we saw his first solo effort, Reservoir Dogs. While not as total an effort as his later movies, Reservoir Dogs does have some revolutionary value to it. Written mostly by Taratino, Reservoir Dogs is a crime movie where the crime failed. A group of 6 anonymous men, each with a different code name, come together under crime boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to steal a diamond shipment from a Los Angeles diamond store. The first scene gives us a sense of who these men are and what makes them tick as they are finishing up their breakfast before the heist. The next thing we see is afterward, 2 of the men are dead and the other 4 are trying to figure out what happened. There is the usual Tarantino dialog, featuring lots of cursing, lots of pop-culture, but also unexpected humor, and also boasts Tarantino musical selections that fit the scenes well, most people think of Reservoir Dogs now when hearing the song ""Stuck In the Middle With You."" The film overall is good, Tarantion takes the crime caper movie and spins it around, what would it be like if a movie heist actually failed, but that is about as far as it goes. There is a lot of talking, I had wished a little more actually happened, and the ending is just that, an ending, nothing more. There's lots of blood and people shooting at each other, and is interesting. Tarantino would prove later that he is capable of completing what he started, just not quite with Reservoir Dogs.",Reservoir Dogs
268,PCT1970,Tarantino's Inception Of Storylines & Title Cards,8,10 May 2019,"Tarantino's debut film as a director is a virtuous crime / mystery drama. Now considered by many as a cult classic, little did fans know this was the beginning of a stellar and unparalleled career. This is the first time that we catch a glimpse of Tarantino's penchant for intertwining storylines and the usage of title cards. It proves to be a foreshadowing of the dazzling brilliance to follow. This film has outstanding direction, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack and acting. All of the actors involved which include the likes of Keitel, Buscemi and Penn deliver realistic and superb performances. In particular two stand out. Madsen with his portrayal of a homicidal maniac and Roth with his portrayal of a duplicit character. The plot revolves around six criminals known only as Mr. Brown, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue and Mr. White. They are hired by mob boss Joe Cabot and his son "" Nice Guy"" Eddie over a riotous and crisp diner scene. The six thieves are hired to pull off a bank heist, however before that they never worked together. They are amushed by police and a shooting ensues. At their rendezvous point the remaining survivors realize they were set up. Now they must flush out the rat in the group. The ending has one of the most brutal, bombastic and cathartic showdowns on film. The plot is clever, funny, bloody, inventive, dark, gritty, intense, violent and has a phenomenal duplicitous ending. There are so many memorable scenes. This viewer is still haunted by Madsen's scene where he psychologically and physically assaults a police officer being held captive.To this day you'll hear fans of this classic quote famous lines such as, ""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?"".

It was a simple robbery that went bad. However, the story is brilliantly told.Instead of starting out at the beginning and going chronologically, it meanders back and forth between time lines. The bulk of the movie takes place in about a two hour period immediately after the robbery. The acting was also brilliant. The direction sensational.I have to comment on Michael Madsen. He was truly evil - one of the more sadistic performances I have ever seen.SPOILER: Perhaps the most unique thing about the movie was that no one lived. Everyone of them died in the end - some of them at the hands of their own gang. This was a clever and exceptionally well-made film. If you like violence, you might give it a 10.

So watching it the first time felt a bit slow in comparison to pulp . What I am saying is if new to Tarantino watch this film first. Have seen it many times since with brilliant use of music becomes almost a character in the film. The tension the music creates never better than Mr blonde scene dancing when he walks out the door into the light and fresh air away from the music you can breathe again. 30 years later watching it still timeless still impossible to tell what year it set in .

274,sandnair87,Tarantino Lets His 'Dogs' Out in Testosterone-land!,9,23 April 2015,"Tarantino has an almost impenitent appetite for blood-spattered barbarism, we all know that. But in his gritty, brutal crime-caper Reservoir Dogs – a tantalizing debut feature that put the name Quentin Tarantino into the cinematic spotlight - his testosterone level is off every chart, as he happily wallows in his own adolescent love of criminals, violence, and vulgarity. So much so that, the movie appears to be set in a theme park called 'Testosterone-land', where nature isn't only red in tooth and claw, it's black as the heart of man and dank as any rag and bone shop of the human spirit.Tarantino gets things off to a spectacularly engrossing start, as Reservoir Dogs begins with the iconic sequence involving the coffee- shop banter of six morally ambiguous outlaws. Yes, they are meant to be an urban wild-bunch, but damn, if they aren't charming and charismatic! Decked out in matching black suits and thin black ties, they've been brought together by a mob kingpin specifically to pull off a heist, and they've been kept deliberately ignorant of one another's identities, knowing each other only by their color coded pseudonyms. The heist is to be a one-shot deal - one job and they scatter to the winds. Soon after masterful opening gabfest, when you start settling in with the idea that Tarantino has made a heist movie, he pulls a coup by skipping right over the robbery itself. Instead, it cuts straight to the aftermath, as we find our wolf-pack hole up in a warehouse after the heist goes belly up, each trying to figure out which one of them squawked to the police. Dissension and suspicion run high and soon, it becomes clear to the audience that at least one of these guys is a snitch, but which one?Tarantino's glitziest stroke in his heist drama is never to show the main event: the film's 'action' occurs after the heist. Tarantino expertly builds tension, interweaving scenes of the aftermath of the thieves' foiled heist with scenes depicting them getting ready for the heist, backtracking in time and point of view half a dozen times. Each flashback reveals just enough information to fill in a piece of the puzzle. His palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect. His trademarks of amplified violence and vulgar dialogue are in full force, as are the flurry of obscure to not-so-obscure pop culture references woven into the dialogue. Part of the appeal of Reservoir Dogs is the way it makes all of it feel terribly authentic, a veracity that is a tribute to the skill of its actors, particularly Michael Madsen who is awesome as the sadistic yet painfully cool Mr. Blonde and Steve Buscemi who is deadpan funny as the always-on-the- edge Mr. Pink.Reservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. It may seem hideously ugly on paper, but in the sure way it's made, it's inconveniently dazzling - driven, beautifully made and completely wacko at once. It's pure outlaw art!",Reservoir Dogs

277,dataconflossmoor,Anything For Attention!!!,10,9 November 2007,"When viewing information about different movies, and their respective reviews on this website, officials posted that this movie was likened to the film ""Diner"". At first, I found this to be a very peculiar comparison!! The minute I popped this movie into the DVD player, I realized the similarity to both movies, particularly with regards to the introductory dialog... I like this type of opening scene, the gist of it being whereby the incongruity of conversation effectively depicts the twisted character portrayals of the pivotal actors in the film !! The camera angles to the coffee shop pontifications, as illustrated in ""Diner"" and in ""Resevoir Dogs"", were extremely poignant!! As was the case with ""Diner"", ""Resevoir Dogs"" depicted an overtly energetic camaraderie with everyone conversing at the coffee shop table. The film, ""Diner"" provided a succinct illustration of kindred spirits which were precocious, with ""Resevoir Dogs"" the bonds were rather macabre!! Focusing now on ""Resevoir Dogs"", that guy who was adamant about not tipping the waitress struck an intensely sensitive nerve cord with me, as I used to be in the food and beverage industry. How did I feel about that guy? Put it this way, if he thinks his manner of killing someone is gruesome and sickening, once a bunch of bartenders get a hold of him, he ain't seen nothing yet... While I detest the term ""ain't"" as it is a colloquialism for the illiterate, it is seemingly appropriate in this case!! Speaking of colloquialisms, this movie was full of them. The F word was habitually used in the film ""Resevoir Dogs"", in fact it was the movie's favorite colloquialism!! The F word is basically an interjection, however, the usage of the F word demonstrates an amazing versatility which accommodates virtually every part of speech, it is very amenable when used a as a gerund as well!! Such an excessive use of this word in ""Resevoir Dogs"" bares a precarious resemblance to the movie ""The Departed""... My G-Rated euphemisms are not displayed here because I am so delicate, rather, it is because I am aware of IMDb's comment guidelines!! This film was about a bunch of reprobates who were amused by their irrational conclusions, and delving into a complacently convoluted logic became their favorite hobby!! Why were all of the characters in this movie so thwarted? Come on!! I have to be at another appointment in about a half an hour!! When someone talks about seriously engaging in a first class felony, they get attention, once they totter with the idea of murder, people are all ears, at least they should be!! Such lamentations evoke a very lethal excoriation against the ""establishment"". Quentin Tarrantino directs this film, and, he is without a doubt, an unprecedented cannon of creativity!! His overall motif of blood and violence is his notoriously successful trademark, ""Pulp Fiction"" being his prize piece!! While compared to the movie ""Diner"" I may be one of the few who likes ""Diner"" better, of course, I am civilized!! Nevertheless, ""Resevoir Dogs"" is a remarkably well made movie which tries to use the recreation of murder as the ultimate and prevailing diatribe of circumstantial justification!! It (""Resevoir Dogs"") has an innovative approach to larceny, and a criminal's code of ethics!! You watch ""Resevoir Dogs"", I will guarantee you that you will not be bored!! The acting, the directing, and the aggregate creation of this film, falls into the category of sensational entertainment... I give this film a perfect ten!! See it when you're angry!!",Reservoir Dogs
278,Barky44,A truly excellent film of this genre!,10,9 November 2005,"What a great movie.Yeah, it's horribly violent and profane, with lots of gore.But this really is a character study of a certain class of criminals.This represents not only the best of what independent films can be, but also how you can get tremendous bang for very little buck if you have a good script and good actors.Notice this film has very sparse sets, no chase sequences, very few stunts, and no special effects. Yeah, there's one dog but beyond that there are no tricks at all. Just great dialog well delivered.This is a classic. Quentin Tarantino at his near-best (in my opinion he parlayed this into Pulp Fiction, his best work).It's a shame that Tarantino hasn't been more prolific. But his handful of films truly revolutionized the whole indie genre.10 out of 10.Barky",Reservoir Dogs
279,chvylvr80,Tarantino's best so far,9,26 September 2003,Reservoir Dogs is that rare movie that can be watched over and over and over again and you never grow tired of it. Tarantino's gift for writing great dialogue is never more evident than it is in this film. The dialogue is what makes his movies so great. The characters talk like real people instead of sounding like they're reading from a book. Reservoir Dogs doesn't show you most of the action but prefers to involve you in the panicked recollections of the thieves as they try to suss out the rat amongst them. Great performances by all involved and a K-tel ready soundtrack help make Dogs a great movie to watch. This film is arguably the movie in Tarantino's bag that has the smallest scope. It doesn't take place in a lot of places like Jackie Brown and has a smaller cast of characters than either Brown or Pulp Fiction. We have to wait until the release of Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2 to see if he can top his first effort. Bottom Line: Brilliant moviemaking from the modern crime master. If you haven't seen this then you really need to step away from the computer and go get it. If you have seen it and you don't have the DVD special edition then you may be forgiven for your sloth at not picking it up yet. Go get it. Mr. Blonde version if you please.,Reservoir Dogs
280,minister_of_silly_walks,A love letter to heist movies,10,1 April 2019,"The debut of Tarantino gave us one of the best and most memorable heist movie ever. It is full of legendary scenes with legendary characters performed by an ensemble cast of Hollywood heavyweights, pair that with a rocking 70's soundtrack, incredible shoot composition and direction by Tarantino and you get yourself a hell of an entertaining movie channeling the great heist movies that preceded it and, in many cases, exceeding them.",Reservoir Dogs
281,film_riot,Reservoir Dogs,7,19 December 2007,"""Reservoir Dogs"" was the kick-off to Quentin Tarantino's so far fabulous career. It is a very energetic heist movie, that already uses the style of non-linear time structure. For example, a thing that I find very interesting about it is the scene where all the gangsters get to know each other and get their new name  this scene is set nearly at the end of the film. Really great here is also the dialogue, Tarantino's trademark. It starts with the discussion about ""Like a Virgin"" and, my personal favourite, the discussion about giving tip. Endless discussions, all written really sharp, follow about who is the traitor. In those moments where no one is talking, more than once it gets violent, as in that classic scene where Michael Madsen cuts ear to ""Stuck in the Middle with You"". And there we have another Tarantino trademark, the soundtrack, that fits perfectly, like always. My problem with some of Tarantino's films, including this one, is that they are too cool, there is too few room for real characters with real emotions.",Reservoir Dogs
282,cdjh-81125,Tarantinos Humble Beginnings,8,11 January 2017,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the last few decades, he seamlessly blends dialogue with brutal violence in his films which are always compelling and extremely entertaining, while is do not think this is his best film Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic opening to his filmography. The dialogue in this film is absolutely perfect, it makes the film feel genuine, characters talk about random things that don't always have relevance to the plot but it feels like what real people would do in this situation which makes this film feel real. Another thing that feels real in this film is the violence, this is an extremely bloody movie but not to an excessive level it helps to establish the dangers these characters are presented with and gives the film a grittier edge. This film always had me engaged, Tarantino perfectly built up this central mystery perfectly it keeps you guessing for the entire run time and your more than likely to change your mind at least once. All the performances in this film are fantastic with the standouts probably being Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel, Roths character is in pretty much excruciating pain for most of the film and he's never not convincing, your always convinced that he is in as much pain as he says he is and it was just brutal to watch. All the characters have amazing interaction in this Film they're all set up as very different people which makes them more interesting to watch together. This film is told in a non linear fashion and for the most part it worked, it helped to establish the mystery and the characters better but they didn't always work for me, a lot of them show how the characters came to be on this job but I felt that the film contradicted itself by doing this, it's established that all of them are mysterious figures with no backstory so telling us this was just an odd choice and honestly they just didn't add much to this film. I also don't feel the pull to re watch this film like Tarantinos other films but I think that's just me. I really did like this movie it's got amazing characters and performances, it's never anything less than engaging, the mystery is established perfectly and like most of a Tarantinos films, the characters were ultimately what made this film worth the watch.85%/A-",Reservoir Dogs

290,adrongardner,Nice but not that nice,7,7 December 2005,"Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the ""Comode"" soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant. The violence is effective, but not quite affecting. I wanted more cuts, more sets, more plot. Dogs could easily be transplanted to a stage and many times that's where it feels we are watching it, which to me isn't a good thing.On the whole its a great first film of course. If we only view films in the context of the time they were released, ET and Star Wars would never be surpassed in their brilliance, thankfully that is not the case. Dogs is good, but not as Brilliant as Empire magazine and other Dogs zealots would have you believe. My advice? Show the robbery in silence from a black and white security cam at the VERY end with the credits rolling and you have a better movie. I like it, I really do, but its not a Rashomon or Rio Bravo. Reservoir Dogs is a nice Point Blank. Nicely entertaining, convincingly executed and completely ineffectual.",Reservoir Dogs

293,troy-daniel-bush,"Awesome, but...",8,12 July 2021,"I've been watching through all of Tarantino's films and I have an unpopular opinion with regards to this one.As my rating and title implies, I love this movie! For a first movie it's really impressive. Most likely because Tarantino's a movie freak, it doesn't feel like it's written and directed by an amateur. After all, the first script he wrote, True Romance, doesn't feel like it's written by an amateur.As with all of his movies...
The characters are distinct and interesting.The dialogue is quotable.That scene that is meant to be disturbing is still disturbing.It's unpredictable.The humor is solid.The cinematography is superb.The soundtrack choices are very catchy.The acting is amazing.On top of all that...
The movie flies by.It doesn't feel low budget. You can thank Tarantino's deft hand.However, I consider this to be one of Tarantino's weaker movies. I know that's a hot take, but I think he's made better movies than this. This is my personal ranking of his films:Pulp Fiction 10/10
The Hateful Eight 10/10
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood 10/10
Kill Bill 10/10

294,FilmSnobby,Bold debut.,5,26 June 2005,"Halfway through this decade of the new millennium, it might not be a bad idea to go back in time to the Tarantino Decade and weigh in on his debut, *Reservoir Dogs*. A meaningless title, by the way, but it sounds cool -- which can suffice as a succinct summing-up of Tarantino's entire approach to film-making. On the one hand, a true cinephile can hardly despise *Reservoir Dogs*, as it pays fond homage to some pretty great films -- indeed, part of the fun of watching it is calling out your favorite film reference (the most meaty being the torture scene, cribbed -- with updated violence -- from Joseph L. Lewis' *The Big Combo* from 1955). On the other hand, a true cinephile can get pretty irritated with Tarantino for building an entire movie, and indeed an entire CAREER, out of a series of fond homages. Yes, it really is a case of the geek at your local video rental armed with $1.5 million and a camera or two actually making, like, a real movie and stuff. The precocious talent vies with the annoying mannerisms that once compelled you to beat him up after school back in the 4th grade.Tarantino's biggest claim to originality here (and in his next, more famous, movie) is his willingness to admit the pointlessness of the plot by spending inordinate amounts of time on non-sequitur dialog. The opening riff on the ""meaning"" of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" remains a startling, funny, and somewhat annoying gambit that attempts to establish character, though the director is far more successful with Mr. Pink's (classic Steve Buscemi) philosophical stance on tipping waitresses. The lackadaisical, wandering pop-culture commentary throughout the film certainly adds some precise verisimilitude, even as it obfuscates what is really a much-ado-about-nothing story involving a gangs of criminals knocking over a jewelry store. Tarantino seems to instinctively know that he doesn't have a great plot going on, so he tries to distract us further with a non-linear narrative pertaining to the undercover cop (an unconvincing Tim Roth) who has infiltrated the crew. Tarantino commits a huge plot gaffe by having his criminals eat in a diner dressed in the very conspicuous clothes -- black suits & ties with white shirts -- they'll later wear while robbing the jewelry store. (This is a case where an ""homage"" undercuts the legitimacy of the story.) There's also the lack of sureness about camera placement that you'd expect from a first-timer: the camera tends to wander off for no particular reason, or to sit about a million miles away from the action or a character without adding any necessary ancillary details.The best acting job in the film is delivered by a fellow named Kirk Baltz, who plays an LAPD beat cop who has been kidnapped by Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde during the bloody aftermath of the heist and is taken to the thieves' warehouse-hideout. Mr. Baltz adds some shocking humanity to the proceedings: when he tells the sadistic Mr. Blonde that he has a kid (an improvised piece of dialog, according to IMDb's trivia-sheet), the stakes are definitely raised. The rest of his performance is a disturbing delineation of a man being tortured. Meanwhile, Madsen's character tells Baltz, ""I don't really care what you tell me -- I've heard it all before. I'm not torturing you to get information; I'm torturing you because it amuses me to torture a cop."" These frightening moments, played over the pleasant nonsense of Stealers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"", make *Reservoir Dogs* seem strangely up-to-the-minute in ways Tarantino had never envisioned. This movie has suddenly become mandatory viewing for those who subscribe to the notion that our current ""enemies"" are having a gay old time down there in Gitmo.As for the rest it, Harvey Keitel and Lawrence Tiereny add much-needed heft and legitimacy to a movie that desperately needs it. I also liked all the blood in the film -- movie violence is too often sanitary; Tarantino makes it disturbingly and copiously wet. What WASN'T required, however, was the constant use of the ""N-word"" by the characters. Perhaps this can be argued as being realistic palaver, given the milieu, but I get the feeling Tarantino is merely trying to add a little extra shock-value, here. Or perhaps he feels that a lifelong obsession with Pam Greer gives him the credentials to use that word with impunity. Well, it doesn't.For the under-25's, I strongly recommend *Reservoir Dogs* -- see what the fuss was all about. For those of us who were there the first time, a solid 5 stars out of 10, modified by the sad knowledge that Quentin eventually grew up to make bad kung-fu movies.",Reservoir Dogs

Another thing this film has is a very unique structure. The events are kinda thrown around randomly, they they still feel natural to watch.What more can I say, I'm almost in denial that this was Quentin Tarantinos first film, todays professionals couldn't have made something as professional as this film. I must say, Tarantino never stops surprising me, and he never lets me down like many other directors do.

Have to say that Mr. Tarantino has grown into both the big picture (punt intended) and his role of a movie creator. Pulp Fiction were disappointing. Reservoir Dogs were a bigger one. All the dialogue and the dialogue and the dialogue and the dialogue... all the communication about small ordinary day details...come on! Yes, I think the work and the dialogue from let's say Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained is pure genius. So, Quentin Tarantino has really kicked it up several notches.Reservoir Dogs. Some good moments, several boring and the movie is just trying to get to the goal, only to miss it. Sure, the way of directing and trying new things with camera angles, the characters way and several innovative production works...that is fine. I really appreciate that.A thing I can appreciate in his movies is his sometimes sophisticated detailed social dialogues about something small...let 's say a fly on a dirty wall. ""Hey, have you seen that fly? The wall is dirty? Is it because of the fly? Why does flies love dirt... or do they? Was it a big fly? Maybe it was a wasp? How did you know that? You asking me?

It held the most exciting scenes and had the least amount of dialogue, which usually is a bad thing but this movie was straight dialogue. The lack of music, although quite eerie made me bored and tired. It gets good when the music does begin to play and the movie begins to feel more relaxed. The twist towards the end, while not anything too unique was exciting and interesting, I'm sure at the time of its release it wouldn't have been seen anywhere. The characters weren't anything special, which was the point, the audience isn't meant to feel sympathy for any of the ""reservoir dogs"" through personal information. This allows the smaller characters that were mixed up in the violence to be the ones we feel for. I liked Mr.Blonde a lot, he was the most interesting of the group and I thought to be the best acted. The beginning is, for me, where the movie falls flat, it was slow and added barely anything to the film as a whole. The scenes where far to long to not have music to fill up the empty space. I can see how this is a masterpiece of a movie, in 1992, not anymore...sorry fans of the movie. 6/10",Reservoir Dogs
298,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"A ranting, disorganized piece of celluloid",5,14 January 2003,"'Reservoir Dogs' is the debut of writer/ director Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill), and it shows. Tarantino's dialogue has a style of fast talking, criminal characters who get involved in violent and often humorous situations. 'Reservoir Dogs' starts off by a monologue from Tarantino himself, as Mr. Brown, commenting on the deeper meaning of the Madonna song ""Like a Virgin"". He talks extremely quickly and the camera pans around the table, showing different people listening to what he is saying. The monologue that Brown gives is almost a culmination of Tarantino's film-making style and of the film. Its ranting, disorganized, and obnoxious.After a stylish opening credits sequence, with ""Green Paper Bag"" playing the film cuts to Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) in a car, with Mr. White driving rapidly. Mr. Orange has been shot in the stomach and he is screaming in pain as White repeatedly tries to calm him, eventually yelling at him to say ""I'm OK!"". The scene is extremely gruesome and is used by Tarantino to get the viewer into this sudden change in pace, and be interested in what is going on. White and Orange eventually get to the rendezvous point in an abandoned warehouse when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) comes storming in, yelling about how the heist the men were planning went horribly wrong. Everything was going smoothly until the police arrived and one of the robbers, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) goes on a shooting rampage, killing several of the employees at the store. As the plot develops, flashbacks for each character's past before the job occur and it is eventually discovered who everyone is. There's Mr. White, a cool type who's done time already and is experienced in the craft. There's Mr. Pink, the ranting, sweaty character who starts of the notion that someone tipped off the police about the robbery and that someone inside the team is a rat. Mr. Blonde is the quiet but psychotic and violent man who in one scene, tortures a man by removing his ear with a blade. Also included is Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), a renowned criminal and the master planner of the heist. His son is ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabbot (Chris Penn) who helps in the planning of the heist, but eventually gets involved in the hunt for who ratted them out.With these characters, Tarantino delves into the action headfirst. The heist is never shown, but flashbacks are used to develop the situation before what happened, and dialogue is used to convey what exactly DID happen that went wrong. Its the dialogue of Tarantino's films that are distinct, but unfortunately in the case of 'Reservoir Dogs' - the dialogue isn't very good. While the characters definitely have a lot of style and appeal, the dialogue seems to be an excuse for clever pop culture talks and another excuse for Tarantino to use ""f*ck"" in every other sentence. There's nothing wrong with using vulgar language in a film, but at least it needs to be done to add to the plot rather then detract from it (see Taxi Driver and Glengarry Glen Ross). The whole setup of the plot seems intelligent but its rather murky. These characters are as simple as they seem, and nothing more. The performances work, but not on any exceptional level. They basically scream a lot at each other. And swear. While this may seem like a very simple deconstruction of the dialogue in the film, its true. This kind of slang, American language can sometimes be turned into something more effective or intelligent (see Barton Fink) but in 'Reservoir Dogs' its void of that notion. As a director, Tarantino doesn't exactly give a lot. The camera angles aren't anything unusual or stimulating, and while he is able to obtain solid performances from his cast, its not enough to hold up the film.I give some credit to Tarantino for making an entertaining movie, something he always is able to do. I also give him points for the solid performances and the amusing scenes he's able to compose, but overall 'Reservoir Dogs' turns out to be a disjointed and ranting film that doesn't quite go anywhere, and isn't quite as intelligent as it seems.5/10",Reservoir Dogs
299,Ziglet_mir,I don't tip.,9,24 January 2010,"Great cast. Great Acting. Great Dialog. Quentin Tarantino's directing debut is riveting. I was drawn into the movie watching the characters unfold through the dialog. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the spark; the whining newborn cry of a director's legendary career.A simple jewelry heist goes wrong and develops into the hard, opposing views and beliefs of the stumped robbers within the party. Mr. White and Mr. Pink discuss the possibilities... Mr. Blonde is a lunatic... and Mr. Orange is dying in a puddle of blood on the floor... Mr. Brown, dead... and Mr. Blue seemingly missing or killed during the robbery... The intensity of the robbery is great and we don't even see the actual thing.One of the men within the group is a cop... and these robbers hate the sight of any man with a badge who is out to take them to jail. The torture scenes with the cop truly got to me and were at first difficult to watch. Mostly the pure casualness of Mr. Blonde single-handedly made these scenes appear even more brutish. Through their botched up events, the surviving members of the group try to discuss how such a simple robbery could go so wrong.And underlying everything else there is a complexity of trust, loyalty, and friendship we see develop between Mr. White and Mr. Orange.I think Steve Buscemi wins as best actor in the ensemble but a case can be made for each actor. Reservoir Dogs has got memorable scenes, memorable quotes and a great story. Sure Tarantino has a bit of an ego but that doesn't mean his movies stink. My favorite from Tarantino, and probably one of the strongest debuts for any director.",Reservoir Dogs
300,ian_harris,"I don't mind the language, it's the beating I don't need",6,2 July 2003,"I know that this film is highly regarded and that my adverse view is a minority one, but I found Reservoir Dogs unsubtle and uninteresting. 
I don't really like violent movies, but I liked Pulp Fiction, which I found clever and compelling.  Reservoir Dogs shows some signs of similar flair, but only the odd flicker of it.  The strong language I was promised was not particularly ripe - I learned no new ways of saying ""f*** you"" having experienced the entire canon in Glengarry Glen Ross.  Indeed, Mamet does foul language better.  The introduction of the prefix ""mother"" in Pulp Fiction took the language genre much further.  Mostly this film is distinguished only by the gratuitousness of its violence, which is disturbing at times, especially Mr Blonde's frenzy.  What little plot there is (and boy, is there little) didn't quite stack up for me, nor did it bring out any real complexity in the characters.I enjoyed the opening scene in the diner, haggling over the morality of tipping, but it was downhill from there for me.Good performances by Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in particular.",Reservoir Dogs
301,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A Brilliant, violent, and powerful film",10,24 January 2005,"Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's first film, and it was an excellent way to get started. This movie has some great acting(you can't go wrong with Steve Buscemi). (possible Spoilers)Reservoir Dogs is about a diamond heist that seemed perfect, but went totally wrong and results in dead cops, criminals, and even civilians. The criminals who survived regroup in a warehouse and come to the conclusion that there was a police informant in their group, and they look back on the incidents to figure out who the informant was. The rest of the film is a gritty, action packed look back on what happened. The entire film isn't base on flash backs because certain other incidents happen in the warehouse that I won't spoil for you. Tarantino's films have plenty of action in them, but in my opinion the best part of his movies is the humorous and witty dialog, and Reservoir Dogs has plenty of that clever Tarantinoesque dialog. Definitely not a date movie, I don't know too many women who can tolerate the raw violence in Reservoir Dogs, otherwise you'll probably be glad you watched Reservoir Dogs.",Reservoir Dogs
302,blazesnakes9,Quentin Tarantino is here to stay,8,16 June 2014,"Before making his name well known in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino worked as a video store clerk before directing his first feature length movie. Reservoir Dogs was his first feature and boy, it was very good. In fact, I believe that when they pick out the best Tarantino movie of all time, my best guess is that they will have a field day with this film and his other works.The story centers around four professional criminals with false aliases. They are: Mr. White,(Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde, (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink, (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. Orange, (Tim Roth). All four men are involved in a robbery that went wrong. The bosses, Nice Guy Eddie, (Chris Penn), and his father, (Lawrence Tierney) got the message clear. But, what went wrong and who is the rat? Told through sharp dialogue and in flashbacks, the criminals try to figure what to do in this situation. The plot of this movie is dialogue driven and every piece of information is either spoken directly from the characters or told through flashbacks.Tarantino has a ear for words. In fact, this independent film was made on a low budget and doesn't consists of any big budget special effects or explosions. While I was watching Reservoir Dogs, I was reminded that the artistry of the movies is not about action, but dialogue. It seems that in this world of today, movie goers are somehow drawn to the loud and sometimes obnoxious world of action. But, this is more than just your average crime caper film. An example of just how sharp Tarantino writes dialogue is the opening scene where we see the gang having a conversation in a diner. With this, we, as the audience, feel like we are eavesdropping on their conversation. Even more to the point, these characters aren't really talking about the actual crime they are going to commit. Rather, they are talking more about Madonna ""Like a Virgin"" than the robbery. That kind of trademark is always essential in all of Tarantino's movies. The main characters talk about pop culture and especially make movie references in either a diner or a restaurant. The performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and others including Penn and Tierney are very good. Keitel, who was also in another daring performance in Bad Lieutenant that same year, gives a commanding performance as Mr. White. Out of all of the main characters in the movie, I happen to enjoy watching Keitel's character walk through this movie, trying both to figure what happened and also keep his loyalty and respect to his boss. Tim Roth, who played Mr. Orange, is wonderful and also very realistic. The reason why I mention realistic is that throughout the entire time, Mr. Orange can be seen bleeding out on the floor for a very long time. Also, the bonding between Mr. White and Mr. Orange resembles a symbol of camaraderie between two soldiers who have went through a harrowing and violent scenario. But, one character who is different from all of the other characters is Mr. Blonde, who is played by Michael Madsen. He is very twisted when it comes to violent. One famous sequence in the movie is when he tortured a cop by tying him up in a chair and cutting off his ear. Later on, he threatens to set him on fire. That kind of violence is not glorified, but a lot of people were stunned and disgusted by that scene. For me, Tarantino know how to cut away from the violence so that you don't see the razor slicing the cop's ear. Tarantino often writes movie references in his scripts and at certain times, bring influences to other genres as well. This is evident in Reservoir Dogs. The characters stated movie references from the 60's and mostly the 70's, creating a sense of pop culture. I know for a fact that for all of its intentions, this movie deserves to seen more once. It is twisted because of the story of a gang trying to recover the diamonds and also figure out what went wrong. It is screwy in the way that these characters talk and act toward each other. Unlike other crime movies, the characters who portrays criminals are more calm and more relaxed than other movie criminals. In other crime movies that I've seen, the criminals act rough toward each other and also to the women. Here, there is one minor female character, which is the waitress in the beginning of the movie. But, after that, no other female speaking parts.Reservoir Dogs works as a mystery film, as a violent and bloody gangster picture and also as a movie of its own. If there is one other thing that I would say is that Quentin Tarantino will be around for a very long time. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",Reservoir Dogs

One he had the courage to make something that was different from what everyone else was doing. Second...if you did not catch this movie on the big screen...you had time to see it and knew NOT to miss his next movie in the big screen.This movie had so many great things about it, too long to list. But safe to say I truly enjoyed the characters and the storyline. Looking back now this movie served as a jump-start or acceleration of actors careers, like Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and of course Harvey Keitel.The birth of the Tarantino-isms: 1. Bad guys talk with eloquence and intelligence about subject matter that would require recreational reading. 2. No story should ever be told in chronological order. 3. At every point possible inject pop culture and subtle homages to greats in the film history. 4. Curse words are a colorful part of the English language and should be utilized in a manner that elevates them from mere offenses. 5. If a character can be killed...well why not.I was lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen. A solid movie that is worth re-watching.

306,mbhgkmsgg,Almost perfect,8,13 November 2020,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I'm sure I would've liked it way more.As is though, the movie doesn't do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would've been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.This movie could've been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would've truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.With all that being said, it's still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you'd want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn't a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't as good as it could've been, but that's just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I've read many consider it to be as good as it could've ever been.",Reservoir Dogs

That's ""Reservoir Dogs"", the 1st deliver from the master Tarantino movie! As I mentioned before, ""Reservoir Dogs"" was the great presentation of Tarantino into cinema and the beginning of his lineage of insane dialogs, filled with black humor and violence drenched in blood and even more with unforgettable characters, none of that is missing here in ""Reservoir"".Everything starts with 8 guys hanging out in a restaurant to discussion about the meaning of the song ""Like a Virgin"" by Madonna and also about give tips to the waitresses, whether they are fair or not. Right there at in the beginning we see the philosophy of Tarantino with a simple, intelligent and humorous dialog between these eight characters that have a strange chemistry. But later found out that the group was planning an assault, we deduce that went terribly wrong when we see Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) bathed in blood with a shot in the belly and with the desperate Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) taking him into a warehouse, the supposed meeting point. Soon after enters the ""professional"" Mr. Pink claiming that someone has betrayed them, that there was a snitch among the group. According to the assault, the survivors arrive one by one: the sinister Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and the nervous Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) and the tension between the 8 men increases.But Tarantino already had his style of different perspectives of a story right at the beginning of his career, throughout the film the story not only focuses attention on the warehouse and increasing tension between the men, but most of the time does flashbacks of each the characters showing how they planned the robbery and what went wrong on it and who is the snitch of the group. All this followed by an excellent writing and direction from Tarantino, full of black humor and racist references and insane dialogs with various themes somehow connected to the story and with the delicious and terrifying violence. But Tarantino not only directs but it also acts as a member of the group, Mr. Brown, it was him that deduced the meaning of the song ""Like A Virgin"" at the beginning.The cast, as in any Tarantino film, shines with excellent performances and its unforgettable characters. Harvey Keitel as always superb; Michael Madsen terrifying, Steve Buscemi as always weird and excellent, Tim Roth simply FANTASTIC.""Reservoir"" was the big premiere of Tarantino in the 7th art with a fantastic writing and direction, with a superb cast and a insane at the same time fun story.

After I saw Pulp Fiction, and loved every minute of it, I found out about this.When I saw it for the first time, I got 1/3 of the way through it and turned it off.  I thought it was so boring.  The pace was slower than what I had expected from the man who made Pulp.  I angerly returned the tape to Blockbuster.My friend, a fellow Tarantino fan, insisted that I see the movie again, only watch the entire movie this time, so I went by the tape store and picked up a copy.  Man I'm so glad I did.I understand why I hated it at first.  It starts off really slow.  There is very little action in the movie let alone the first hour of it.  I had thought this was an action movie, it's not.  This is a character movie that is filled with great, well-written dialog.  This is also a bit of a disturbing movie.  Many of the torture scenes are a little repulsive, but there is always some great '70s song playing.  I love this type of filmmaking.

This story however is quite simple and indeed what gives this film personality are the characters. They are interesting and well characterised and the team they are a part of has a fun dynamic. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is far from the best works by Tarantino but I think it's natural because it was his first movie and then he has matured more and more as far as his artistic consciousness.

316,jcanettis,Tarantino's Only Interesting Movie,8,23 December 2004,"I really find Tarantino totally overrated: He tries to make an impact by overwhelming his audience with unbelievably gory scenes, while his films lack any substantial and interesting element; the ""Kill Bill"" series are a prime example of this lame strategy. However, there is one single exception to the above: ""Reservoir Dogs"".To start with, ""Reservoir Dogs"" still has the necessary Tarantinesque blood galore and shocking scenes, although these are more limited compared to his other films. Moreover, blood is not what makes ""RD"" stand out: Instead, the film has a very distinct style, as it depicts the characters of the movie in a very ordinary, ""next-door-guy"" style, while they commit not-so-ordinary crimes. The dialogs, the setting, the suspense, everything is very simple and yet very different in its way, as the film has a structure which is elementary yet intriguing. The plot is also quite simple (five strangers perform a bank robbery and then try to find a rat among them), yet it achieves to keep our interest in high levels until the very end. The performances are good, with Harvey Kaitel being first among equals.Pity that Tarantino did not make any other movies like this one. 8/10.",Reservoir Dogs
317,walsh-22,Not as good as Pulp Fiction,6,2 March 2008,"What appeals to me about Reservoir Dogs is it doesn't follow the conventional sequence of events that most Hollywood movies follows, this film is told out of order but it is still easy to follow the thread of the plot line.I enjoyed watching the scene at the start of the movie with the group, it was very funny with them interacting with one another and because of that I wanted more scenes with them but I realise it would have slowed down the story.Steve Buscemi's (Mr. Pink) performance stood out for me. He just makes me laugh with his tirade about not giving a tip to waitresses and he has some really good lines. Another stand out performance was Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde) who gives a very intense portrayal of a psychotic robber. He never plays it over the top or makes him look silly especially in the scene where he is dancing around just before he cuts a cop's ear off.Tarantino kept me interested because he doesn't show everything straight away, he gives little tidbits that kept me watching to see what happened next particularly in the robbery and how the robbery was set up and the type of people involved.Saying that, I just can't get into it like Pulp Fiction. To me, apart from the scene at the start and the scene where they are given the names and Steve Buscemi doesn't like his name and wants it changed, it is very heavy going for me and I found myself enjoying it less and less as time went on.",Reservoir Dogs

319,winstonsmith_84,A Fine Ending,10,5 April 2001,"This movie begins at the end.  Sort of.  It is Quentin Tarantino's major masterpiece, the film which gave him such instant fame.  The reason this film amazed me so much is that it only had a budget of 1 million dollars and a group of unknown (at the time, of course) actors.  These actors are all now well respected.  Harvy Keitel even made a comeback.The movie begins at the ending.  There are a series of flashbacks, and they all lead up to an excellent climactic standoff.  I mean, this whole film is a climax!  Somehow Quentin Tarantino put in a bunch of dialogue which makes one laugh and feel as if they know the characters personally.  Who knows what magic he was weaving when he was writing the script, but Reservoir Dogs has some of the best dialogue I know of.Reservoir surpasses Pulp Fiction in my opinion.  The movie was not meant to be a big hit really, while Pulp Ficiton knew it would make money.  Dogs is a hit.  A true hit.  See this movie, because it is a definite gem on the movie shelf, even if it sometimes goes unnoticed by the masses.",Reservoir Dogs
320,thewillt08,A Must See!,9,5 May 2013,"I said in my Pulp Fiction review that it was Tarintino at his best. I ever thought I would see him do better, but then I saw Reservoir Dogs. It's true that Res-Dogs came out before Pulp Fiction but I saw Res-Dogs after I saw Pulp Fiction. It was something I don't see in many movies, and that is that the storyline is very short and not much happens but the dialog is the force behind the story. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie and when I saw it the first time I almost watched it again, but it was 3am and I was tired. I actually started because I loved the first scene so much.As I said, the dialog was outstanding in this movie. Tarantino knows how to write a script. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Joe, and Nice Guy Eddie are sitting in a restaurant in the opening scene. These men are all of the main characters and they are what the movie is built around. In the opening scene we come in mid conversation and they are talking about the meaning behind the song Like a Virgin, and it was interesting. The fact that anybody can come in mid conversation to start a movie and be entertained is impressive and isn't seen that often. Then it gets even better. Mr. Pink refuses to tip the waitress and an argument about tipping and if it's the right thing to do is funny and it fit so well. It made me rethink the idea of tipping but I still do it anyway. Finally the opening scene is ended with all the Reservoir Dogs walking in slow motion the strangest song but again, it works. That shot where they introduce credits of the actors and the title screen comes up is a classic.My favorite character is easily Mr. Pink. Steve Buscemi blew me away with his performance. He is one of the most important characters and he is makes some of the greatest impacts. The basic story behind Res-Dogs is that Joe gets a group of people together to pull off the perfect robbery, but the plan fails when they find out a cop is undercover. Mr. Pink brings up the possibility of a rat and the ball starts rolling from there. Mr. Pink is the only character with a lot of mystery surrounding him. We don't get his origin story like we did with White, Blonde, and Orange and we don't know for sure what happens to him in the end. All of the characters get endings except for Mr. Pink and that makes me angry, but I love it at the same time. I wanted more of Mr. Pink but I also love how I don't know a lot about him.The only flaw I see with Res-Dogs is the lack of chemistry between Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The movie slows down and the conversation they have isn't that believable. What I mean is, you can tell they are acting and it took me out of the experience. They are talking about the possibility of a rat and even though the ending of the scene picked up I left it wanting a little more effort. Other than that the movie is incredibly predictable. I knew the basic premise of the movie was to find out who the rat was and when I saw who the actors were I knew who it was. After the opening scene in the restaurant and the opening credits I knew who it was. I predicted the big plot twist and surprise at the end and I knew who would live and who would die. I wasn't 100% accurate, but I basically nailed the movie before I saw it. Even though I predicted it I still wanted to see it happen and the fact that I still loved it says something. I like to talk about my favorite scene in my reviews and my favorite is when Mr. Blonde goes nuts and tortures the cop. Mr. Blonde is an interesting character and his actions are disturbing but at the same time funny. He tortures a cop just because he is a cop and he doesn't care about what the cop knows. That is disturbing. However, he tortures him while the catchiest song is playing on the radio. There is a radio station that plays 70s music all day and it's mentioned a lot by other characters. The music in Res-Dogs is unlike any other movie, most Tarantino movie are, but this is different. In this scene with Mr. Blonde, the radio is playing but he goes out to his car and the music stops. It is supposed to mean the radio is out of hearing range and when he comes back in the building we can hear it again. Little things like that make this movie what it is. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a Tarantino movie so that means it is something special. Let's go down the WillyT Checklist. Awesome character. Check. Awesome Music. Check. Interesting story. Check. Strong opening that got me hooked. Check. Res-Dogs is blueprint Tarantino and got his name out there. It didn't necessarily put him on the map but it got enough publicity and made enough of an impact to make Pulp Fiction. Tarantino does what he wants, when he wants, and thank god for his films. Reservoir Dogs proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I loved the movie, I think I liked it better than Pulp Fiction. I watched it again a week after I saw it the first time and it was just as good if not better. In fact, I might go and watch it again right now. So, for right now, WillyT OUT!",Reservoir Dogs

And I simply couldn't find a reason to do that. The pretty much only flaws I have been able to find are a few badly chosen camera angles (which simply haven't been to my subjective liking). And one scene where the music started in a too odd and confusing way (The Ugga Chacka song). I also didn't like the slow motion parts. All minor and subjective things that don't make the movie worse as a whole.Of course Tarentino movies are gory and vulgar. I am actually not sure if I like it - but it doesn't disturb me. Tarentino movies themselves are great movies. They are directed and written on a high level of perfection. Only a few other directors play in Tarentinos league. Yes, his skill as a director wasn't as full-grown as it is in later movies, still, it was very impressive, and very unusual. Actors and the characters they play are simply amazing. It's such incredible fun to watch all this characters go crazy. Actors had to go to their limits in this movie. The story is told in a totally unusual way that keeps you interested till the end, giving you one bite of information after another. That way you stay curious through the whole movie.",Reservoir Dogs
323,antoniokowatsch,"Funny, brutal, and intense",9,24 November 2017,"Reservoir dogs is a movie about organized crime. Well, it's really about a couple of hired guns who start to lose their cool when a diamond heist goes FUBAR. Everybody is fast to point fingers. ""Someone must be a rat!"", they proclaim as they try to make sense of what just happened. It's fast paced and has a lot of action to go along with. The cast was really strong and so were the performances. When you watch a movie with well-known actors and you start to forget or should I rather say disassociate their real identity with the characters that they're portraying that's when you know that something magical is happening. This movie has all of the above.Some might criticize the sporadic use of racial slurs in dialogues but truth be told; this is how mobsters back in the days used to talk. It adds an extra layer of realism to the movie.The opening scene of the movie is easily one of the most memorable movie scenes and sets the right mood for what's about to happen (in a a way). A bunch of guys sitting in a diner; jerking around and talking about ridiculous stuff. It gives you a good idea about the group dynamics.  Who gets along with who? What kind of people are they really?  Once the diamond heist fails we get to see each character from a different perspective; under extreme circumstances. That's when you realize that all of these guys are real criminals and things start to spiral out of control as suspicions arise as to who the rat is.While the movie is ultimately serious and sometimes brutal there are a lot of really funny scenes to contrast this reality with. Like e.g. the scene where all of them get code names assigned to them.  Let's just say that Mr. Pink didn't like his code name. I personally think that this scene was one of the funniest movie scenes I've ever seen. Took me totally by surprise because I wasn't expecting this type of witty and hilarious writing.Reservoir Dogs is still one of my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies of all time. As a matter of fact one might even argue that this is the movie that kick-started his career as we now know it. It has all the Tarantino signature elements.

This is a pretty cool movie! It's always a good thing when the debut of someone is good, because it says that they'll go and do great things, which Tarantino has obviously done. Of all the things that this movie went through, it's still great that it is here for us to see. Or at least, the few who enjoy excessive violence, which is what this movie is immersed in. See it with adults. Still, I wouldn't venture to say that this is my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still good regardless.

It establishes the main question right in the beggining (who betrayed them?), right after showing us the great relationship of 'friendship' the group has. It keeps you wondering until the third act and, in the mean time, conflicts between the group arise. Just as any Tarantino film, this is a blood fest, non-linear story. The characters feel authentic. They're scared, confused and angry at their situation. They're not clichés. My only concern was how the backstory was intertwined with the main plot. I feel the pace was slowed down every time there was an expositional backstory. Particularly in Mr. Blonde's case, I felt it wasn't necessary for it to be as long (around 8 full minutes to tell us how his relationship with Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. Aside from that, the movie keeps you wanting to know what happens next every second.",Reservoir Dogs
327,ALauff,Sterling Debut,8,26 April 2004,"Quentin Tarantino's crime thriller about an anonymous group of low-end hoods and how they deal with a diamond heist gone terribly awry still stands out as a coruscating debut, with its elliptical, jump-cutting narrative construction illuminating a vision of antisocial individuals unwittingly confined to a hell of their own making. The cavernous warehouse, a windowless, stifling structure, is where the characters eventually ""end up"" after a bungled heist and where the fulcrum of this tense, sweaty battle of wills plays out. The moral linchpin of the story is the relationship between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), an undercover cop whose unnerving, gut-wounded shrieks open the movie proper. A tough, grizzled veteran, White blasts through police cars filled with cops, while paradoxically nurturing the incognito Orange back to health, holding his head in his lap, assuring him in a sing-song voice: ""You're not gonn-aa dii-eee."" It's a wonderfully absurd dichotomy that suggests the dual natures of the other two primary hoods: Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a cool, unflappable silver-tongue on one hand and a ruthless, inhuman monster on the other, and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), an eloquent, irritated card—as in the opening restaurant conversation, which is about as finely crafted as expository intros get—who, like a Leone anti-hero, is also an oily, amoral pragmatist, playing all sides to fulfill his ends. Tarantino's dialogue, particularly in how it seeks and finds the characters' blue-collar-rooted colloquialisms—their endless discussions of pop culture tropes, Joe's rallying call of ""Let's go to work,"" their choices of music—seems uncannily effortless, despite an understandable temptation to devolve into oscillating theatrics. These characters live in a parallel universe, their dual social roles of criminal and laborer making their flash and bravado seem empty and innocuously self-contained. True pariahs, they lash out as a means of communicating, perhaps because they have no means of transcendence. Which, returning to the story's central relationship, all makes White's compassion and humanity nothing less than tragic.",Reservoir Dogs

329,matlefebvre20,Nostalgic pollution,10,25 April 2007,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is the baptism by fire for Quentin Tarantino, an obscure actor who is at his first experience as a director. And let's say that, for a first time, Tarantino knows how to draw the attention.Released about 15 years ago, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is looked up today as a classic, just like the other subsequent Tarantino movies would be, should I say it.""Reservoir Dogs"" tells the story of a group of gangsters recruited by an eccentric, but serious boss, in order to rob diamonds from a jewelry store. The film shows the before the operation and the after. But not the during. There are indeed some clues which allow to build a script in our mind, but that's precisely what Tarantino wants: that the viewer let his imagination working.What's more, there is no straight line. The before and the after are alternated in such a random way that it becomes almost impossible to get all the scenes back in the actual order. The only thing we can know for sure is whether we're watching the before or the after. Generally, we can have a certain idea. But it would take several days of viewing and checking the scenes one by one in order to determinate where they go in the story's actual chronology.This strategy is reminiscent of older movies like ""Citizen Kane"" where we could see a young Orson Welles, then an old, younger, older We almost get lost.Anyway, whether it's the before or the after, one thing predominates throughout this movie: the politically incorrect. Some would say that Tarantino's trademark is the extreme and aesthetic violence, while others would say that it's his characters' monologues. But one thing unites each of these elements: they're all politically incorrect. And this is precisely Tarantino's real trademark: the politically incorrect.Tarantino fills his movie with violence at one point we could believe that he's compressing several war movies at the same time, so they could get the same size as only one. There's as much blood in ""Reservoir Dogs"" as in a Red Cross collecting center. But Tarantino can't get satisfied by only showing violence. He shows it in several ways.He can show violence in its most simple expression, like in the pursuits between the police officers and the gangsters or he can elaborate it. The most striking way is by turning on the radio. In this way, we can see the sadistic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slice the ear of a police officer taken as an hostage while listening (and dancing) ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" from Stealer's Wheel. For baby-boomers, it's called nostalgic violence. It's horror and happiness. It's been rarely seen before.Another way, more expected, is black, even philosophical violence. Thus, we can see Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), completely beaten up, who still shoot on each other. Two gushing sponges who battle themselves till it's the end for both of them And the gun zigzag at the end. That's what we call a shooting line.From a philosophical point of view, we can add the monologues from the different characters as they chat about subjects like the real signification of the song ""Like a Virgin"" from Madonna (is it about dicks?) and why people should tip when they go to the restaurant.Each actor has his chance of having his own monologue or a long and endless scene where the importance of knowing his text by heart is primordial. If the actor bluffs, he has to shoot this endless scene all over again. But the director seems to trust his actors totally and he trusts their talents for such scenes.With its generous violence, its anti-heroes without honor, its numerous blasphemies, its macho and racist dialogs and its countless sexuality references, ""Reservoir Dogs"" truly is a pollution.But with its numerous references to old TV series and movies, music from the 70s and popular culture, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is also nostalgia.In the end, much like ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" can simply be summarized in two words: nostalgic pollution.",Reservoir Dogs
330,darkjosh,"Comical, Crackling Crime Yarn",8,18 October 2000,"Tarantino's violent crime tale and character study is a fast-paced, lurid, and wonderfully wicked film about a group of criminals who converge to pull off a diamond heist that ultimately goes awry and causes them all to question who gave their schemes away.While all of Tarantino's characters are dishonest, morally-corrupt, criminals, they all show very different methods of handling their work, and all the actors do a fantastic job of presenting an array of seemingly similar characters and fleshes them out as individual, thoughtful, and sometimes sickly logical.  Steve Buscemi here steals the film as the extremely talkative, motor mouth Mr. Pink who initiates the idea of a conspiracy.  Harvey Keitel is also a formidable force as the too-sympathetic and trusting Mr. White.  The soundtrack is also something to rave about. The 70's music fits the film perfectly.Tarantino's script is sprinkled with some very amusing and well written dialogue as well - he literally transforms excessive cursing and obscene stories into operatic and poetic filth.  Also, the few action scenes reinforce the tension that builds up to the brilliant ending.
Reservoir Dogs is a throughly entertaining crime movie that doesn't take itself gravely seriously and presents a thrilling tale in a comical way. Reservoir Dogs is well-acted, well-scripted, and has a gritty feel that separates it from the glossy crime movies that spew from Hollywood.  With a cast of almost virtual unknowns and a dynamite script, Tarantino goes for the audience's throat and packs Reservoir Dogs with thrills and tension to spare.8 out of 10",Reservoir Dogs
331,boondocksaint20,A good cult-film,8,8 December 2002,"This movie is the epitome of brutality.  It is one of those movies that really shocks you with its violence, and begs for multiple viewings.The plot revolves around a group of thieves who are employed by a crime overlord (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn).  The casting of the thieves is superb, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen both standing out immensely.  Basically, everything goes wrong, and we spend the entire movie figuring out what went wrong.  My question now is this, what happened to you Quentin?  I haven't seen his name on a movie since Jackie Brown came out like 5 years ago.  Oh well, I'm looking forward to Kill Bill whenever that comes out.A warning though...there is a Chow-Yun Fat movie called 'City on Fire', and I hate to say it, but the last 30 minutes of that movie are almost identical to those of Reservoir Dogs (what happens in those 30 minutes, not how it happens).  Yes, it includes a mexican standoff and the betrayal of one of the gang after a heist gone wrong b\c he is an undercover cop, and this movie came out I think at least 5 years before Dogs.  Check it out if you want, though, it does kind of lessen a person's respect for Tarantino as it did mine, I still think the guy is a great writer and a good director nonetheless.  I do know that John Woo and other Chinese filmmakers were influencial to him (check out the direction in both the scene where Tim Roth unloads on Mr. Blonde and when Mr. White does a double handgun routine on a pair of misfortunate cops.  Both of these scenes scream of John Woo inspiration).  Anyway, overall, this is a dark and gritty movie.  The violence is extreme along with the profanity, so this will not be everyone's favorite movie. This movie is more of a character study than anything else...there really isn't much plot and absolutely no messages in it at all, just good old fashioned entertainment.  Despite the rip-off I mentioned above, this is still one cool movie and will be here to stay for some time now as one of the leading cult films ever.  8/10 stars.   Recommended.",Reservoir Dogs

Before this film, I was just a casual film fan, a young teen that mainly watched the latest blockbusters, but after Reservoir dogs I had to see every possible film I could.
I've since seen everything Tarantino has done but nothing can eclipse the memory of my first viewing.

335,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""Now listen up... There's two ways we can do this job. My way or the highway!""",8,30 December 2015,"Knowing now that Quentin Tarantino can make movies, it's amazing how well crafted his film debut was.I give credit where credit is: right from the start, not only was Tarantino a great director, he was also a great screenwriter. In all of his films, he would set up his characters in any scene (from a diner, to an empty warehouse), and then put them through a stick-up that goes disastrously wrong. What would follow afterwards is a bloody aftermath. This movie has one of the best casts you could imagine, led by the legendary Lawrence Tierney, who plays Joe Cabot, an experienced criminal who has assembled a team of crooks for a big diamond heist. The key to his plan is that his associates don't know one another, and therefore can't squeal if they're caught. He names them off a color chart: Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and so on. Mr. Pink doesn't like his name. ""You're lucky you ain't Mr. Yellow,"" Tierney rasps (which is one of my favorite scenes in the movie).I feel this is where Tarantino is at his strongest: right from the opening scenes, everyone can tell they are in for a ride; these characters play off of each other so well. They can discuss anything from Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" to the difference from a black woman to a white woman, and it would not feel uncomfortable. We as an audience can relate to them and feel like we're in the conversation with them. So much so that we want to butt in and contribute.We see the bungled crime in flashbacks. Tarantino has a confident, kinetic way of shooting action: guys running down the street, gun battles, blood and screams. But the real drama is finding out who's the snitch in the operation. It's a good way for dramatic effect because we as audience don't know who the snitch is even more than the characters do. Tarantino's stamp is all over this film, and it's amazing that this was his film debut. Great writing, great characters, and a great set-up lead up to a film I can watch over and over again and see the details that I have missed.",Reservoir Dogs
336,~PL~,A very strong gangster film...,10,18 February 2001,"Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's best, in my opinion, even though I know many people will contest this affirmation...Pulp Fiction was pretentious, had a style that looked a little too ""wannabe"", and that didn't fit with that kind of story.  But Reservoir Dogs is different.  With all its awesome acting, especially from Harvey Keitel, its excellent twists and non conventional situations, it's the best film of its kind.  It's boosted with testosterone, but it also laughs at itself, just to show how badly some supposedly professionals can work.  No humor, no jokes in this film, it's just the troubling situations some characters confront that will make you laugh.  And that's perfect, because the humor in Pulp Fiction was there to seem cool. The scenario is pretty well written, even though the use of the F-word is excessive...that story reminds me some Shakespeare texts, without all the pathetic and sad perspective.  (Spoilers warning) There's also that scene, where Mr.Blue cuts off the cop's ear...this is a classic in violent cinema (is this a good or bad thing?!?!) because of its intensity, and of course, realism.  The whole thing is very violent, and I don't know how a man that got shot once in the torso can bleed over half of a garage's floor...the awesome ending is also one of the most brutal and weird ones you can see. The story is about a group of robbers who plan a robbery at a jewelry, and that fail it...but the problem is that the cops were already in front of the store even before the robbery...so the criminals suspect one of them for being a cop.  And the relationships between the several characters seperate them in two different groups, confronting each other in the end.  And when you realize that the whole film was about seeing these guys fail, and kill each other to arrive at the conclusion that everyone is dead, the only thing you can do is laugh out loud...because it is funny, in some way.  And the Coconut song won't help you stop laughing, because it brings an ironic and satiric aspect to it.  The tagline used for ""Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels"" which is ""A DISGRACE TO ALL CRIMINALS"" is more compatible with this one...and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a pretty good movie too. Overall, great acting, interesting and surprising story twists, fine directing, and a very good movie. 9/10",Reservoir Dogs
337,Stibbert,My way or the highway...,8,10 January 2006,"This is one of those movies you simply hate or simply love. It's a quite strange and slow movie. In my case I liked it, but on the wrong day I might not have.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a bunch of criminals who's going to rob a diamond warehouse. When things turn south they start to suspect someone is snitching. The question is who.Let's start by saying that there are a lot of talking in this movie. It's basically all just talk. It's also kind of slow and almost the whole movie takes place at only one location. It looks like it's one long scene. The story is not really original, but it's well written. It's not too deep witch is good cause if you needed to pay close attention to all the talking you would be tired after half an hour. This film is about the characters and even though you don't get to know anything about their background you get to know them. You kind of feel like one of them. They don't know each other neither and you learn to know them by the way they act and do on this particular job. The characters are well written and by the end of the movie you have a good idea of who they are.The acting is good. Many famous names are on the list, but if they don't go well together it can screw up the whole movie. This is not the case for Reservoir Dogs. On the contrary, they all work well together and everyone gives a good performance. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Madsens ice cold psycho-performance is great. Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel makes a pair of aces.The cinematography is good. Nothing really good about it nor nothing bad either. There's not any really cool shots, but there are some that sticks. The composition is really nice, but the lightning is nothing too special.One thing Tarantino really know is music. The use of non-original music is genius. It's risky as people may have a relationship to that song and so they may get the wrong impression, but Tarantino manage to succeed. It fits the scene, looks cool and sounds great. This part is really half the experience.To watch this movie you'll need to have an open mind. It's not a ""normal"" movie (but then again Tarantio's not quite normal either). You can turn out to like this movie or you can turn out to hate it. I liked it quite a lot and it's a technically good movie. My personal advise; watch it!",Reservoir Dogs
338,chiguy17,How is this a classic?,2,9 September 2019,"After not finding a reason to watch this the past few decades, I decided to watch it since it was on Showtime and there was nothing else to watch. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was.I didn't particularly care for Pulp Fiction, but at least it was original and somewhat creative. There just wasn't anything entertaining about Reservoir Dogs. The only thing I was surprised by was Tarantino's appearance in it (which would have not happened had he not written & directed it - I'm not sure how many people realize he's a failed actor).I'd heard enough about the film that I was prepared for the violence and gore, and while I didn't enjoy that aspect, it wasn't the reason I disliked the film so much. Although some of the language was a bit abrasive (the rampant use of the word in an early 90's film does seem... odd to say the least). It was just plain boring. The plot was thin and barely held together, and the ending was just completely unsatisfying.I just don't see anything about this film that would make any true cinephile consider this a masterpiece. It doesn't lend anything to the cinematic landscape of the genre or decade or film in general. The only people who would like it would have to be Taratino buffs (who are a breed of their own) and love it because it was his first big film - which apparently is a rip-off of an Asian crime film.Honestly, unless you're a hardcore Tarantino fan (in which case you've probably already seen it) skip it! Maybe it was a landmark in sheer amount of violence, but it's certainly not relevant nor does it offer any redeeming value.",Reservoir Dogs
339,ericjg623,"Good, but no Pulp Fiction",7,27 May 2002,"Note *** Contains spoilers ***It's easy to see how Tarantino's unique style evolved, which later allowed him to produce his masterpiece a couple years later. The same elements are in this film as well: intense violence, snappy dialogue, abrupt changes in time (forward and backward) as well as a memorable ensemble of characters. And he uses an ingenious plot device, namely, an experienced crime boss and his son have hired six thieves to pull off a robbery of a diamond wholesaler. The catch is  none of the men know each other, and are assigned names such as `Mr. White' `Mr. Blonde' and so forth.  This way, if one gets caught, he can't rat out any of the others. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. One of the `crooks' is actually an undercover cop, as a result, the robbery blows up into a huge shootout, with the men scattering madly to escape a police ambush. The bulk of the film deals with what happens as the men try to reassemble at the agreed meeting point; in fact, we see very little of the robbery itself, the details are revealed later by the various characters. What Tarantino achieves here is not only an interesting crime drama, but also, due to both the pacing of the direction and the actors' skills, he presents a gut wrenching mood of fear, mistrust, and paranoia which ends up in a classic three way confrontation not unlike the one in `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'. The movie really does grab the viewer right from the start and doesn't let go until the very end. And Tarantino is to be credited for assembling a first rate cast of classic movie `dirtbags' (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, etc.).So why then don't I rate this higher? Part of the problem is that, at least when compared to `Pulp Fiction', this movie is too cynical and nihilistic. `Pulp Fiction' was fun; this film isn't. It leaves you feeling somewhat dirty and slimy, as if you'd spent a couple of hours in a sewer or rummaging through a garbage dump. There's one graphic scene in which one of the robbers, a certified psychopath, engages in extreme acts of cruelty in torturing a cop he'd kidnapped. This was, IMHO, gratuitous and simply didn't need to be there. Also, I didn't like the ending at all. At this point, everyone is dead except for `Mr. White (Keitel) and `Mr. Orange' (Roth) and the police are about to move in. `Orange' admits to `White' that he was the mole. This I have a really hard time buying. After all, he has managed to stay in character despite being shot in the guts, he's witnessed several acts of extreme brutality, and at the very end he wimps out? No way.
So, in the final analysis, this is a decent movie that gives us a taste of what Tarantino has in store for us with `Pulp Fiction', but it's definitely not in the same league as that work of genius.7/10",Reservoir Dogs

First, there's the opening scene that introduces Tarantino's trademark of the camera hovering around the table while the immensely entertaining dialog is carried forward in all sorts of directions (there is a similarly brilliant conversation in a car later on). Secondly, there's the introduction to Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), during which he gets to rehearse and then tell a terrific smuggling story. Finally, there's the iconic ear scene; I had forgotten just how disturbing and simultaneously hilarious everything that the psychopathic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) does in the movie is. Madsen is, along with the always as watchable Steve Buscemi, the standout actor in a fabulous cast.I did, however, enjoy the film a bit less this time around.

In instances such as these, dialogue must be employed to fill the void. There were a few nice quote, such as, ""If you ever dream about killing me you better apologize in the morning,"" but not enough. Moreso, with a lack of plot and dialogue - I mean good plot and good dialogue ofcourse - unique characters are a last option to save a movie. Maybe it's because of the already saturated american mafia movie genre, but I was never really connected with any of the characters.

The way the camera is used has something I can't really explain but it makes every frame of this movie look like a cool poster in my opinion (something Tarantino kept up to this day imo).
Also the story is a hell of a ride and the order which the story is told in is just pure genius and could not be done any better in my opinion.
The puzzle gets resolved more the further you look and collapses in a bangin End.
This movie catapulted Tarantino into my personal Mt Rushmore of Movie Directors and to this day he held his spot.",Reservoir Dogs
350,Mcnabbbeasty,A Timeless Classic of Epic Proportion.,8,4 July 2021,"The remarkable Quentin Tarantino's film making debut was unfathomably brilliant; arguably the greatest first product from any film maker to ever live (with the exception of Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption). ""Reservoir Dogs"" is far from your typical, or, ""who's the culprit"" crime movie, it is an unconventionally stylish and enigmatic work of cinematic art. Quentin most definitely rose the bar for stylish crimes in the modern era with this 1992 classic. There are so many iconicly unforgettable quotes and scenes in this all time classic making it amongst the most rewatchable films ever. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the infamous Quentin Tarantino's finest works of art.",Reservoir Dogs
351,dj_xand325,"Tarantino's hip, cool, naturalistic, incomparable gangster masterpiece",9,24 February 2007,"Reservoir Dogs: Tarantino's debut of writing and directing.Reservoir Dogs is a fitting and satisfying beginning to the series of Tarantino's excellently unique film archive. This film entails the story of a gangs heist of a jewelery shop that goes terribly wrong. They think there's a rat in the gang and things get pretty violent!.To protect the gangs identities, they only each other by colour. There's Mr Pink (Steven Buscemi), Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr Brown (Tarantino), Mr Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Mr Orange (Tim Roth). This mysterious and unparaleled alias inclusion is a cool feature that I am sure none of us have ever seen in a gangster film.Despite the films low budget, the cast was very good with such faces as Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth. Keitel even helped produce the film. This just proves how gripping Tarantino's writing is to be able to rake in the top stars for a low budget. Tarantino also managed this in Pulp Fiction.Keitel pulled off a blistering performance as the sombre and somewhat pseudo-professional Mr White. Steve Buscemi's performance was also spot on, his depiction of the allegedly gay Mr Pink brought the film to a deliciously ironic end. Michael Madsen was also exceptional as the psychopath murderer Mr Blonde.The film opens with one of the most famous scenes of the 90's, the classic scene of the gang sitting in a coffee shop. Its a scene of constant pop references, irresistible Tarantino dialogue and dark humour. This bona fida scene shaped the beginning of Tarantino's career and provides something none of us have ever seen before.Tarantino's retro 70/80's choice of music is very cool. Especially, the music in the famous ear cutting scene. 'Stuck in the Middle with you' by Stealers Wheel was a perfect on-screen juxtaposition that reaches into the viewer and rips out any sense of calmness.This is the start of a legacy of stylish cinema from one of the hottest directors in Hollywood. However, this doesn't live up to Tarantino's later work 8.3/10",Reservoir Dogs

Whereas many heist films would focus on the heist and action itself, this low-budget intelligent indie classic instead takes place after a heist gone horribly wrong and the group of thieves each ponder who the traitor is. But not before a comedic diner conversation to introduce each of them.Each of the characters are distinct and the film takes place out of order in order to highlight the perspective of each of the characters. It's a great thriller that will have you piecing together the puzzle of what exactly happened.

Not Tarantino launching a massive influence and career following Pulp Fiction (DUH), but the writing itself is top notch. That would be nothing without the electric chemistry of pretty much the entire cast. No weak links. Which is a massive rarity. And a fun, thrilling gorefest that seems to top itself every rewatch.A heist that isn't a heist, which is propelled by its active deconstructions of its inspirations and narrative structure play. There's tons of time spent in mainly the warehouse, where our macho men duke it out verbally and physically. We don't even witness the robbery. This is a needed compromise for its low budget. And Reservoir Dogs knocks this format out of the park. Another frequent vehicle for its black comedy is Tarantino's drawn out conversations. The movie revels in every moment it can to talk about petty crap. Most would recognize all these elements as the patented ""Quentin-style"" but it's hard to believe his creative voice was so strong so early on.",Reservoir Dogs
357,bulleetz37235,A film of genuine quality...,9,7 October 2005,"Reservoir dogs epitomises the stark violence that Tarantino was known for. His first outing as a director is the best other than the miraculous Pulp Fiction, but face it that is one of the best films EVER made. For the most part the film is set in an abandoned warehouse, where a motley crew of criminals dwell over the aftermath of a jewellery store heist gone wrong... With fantastic performances from the ensemble cast of Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Tarantino himself, the late Lawrence Tierney and of course Michael Madsen in a career defining role form the colour coded gang who are furious at each other as they discover there is a rat in their midst who has set them all up. But who? Of course we know, and it is quite ironic to see Mr White defending him oblivious to who he is. This creates a great elevated level of tension as you watch him biting everyones head off who suggests that he Mr Orange is the rat. Brilliant. The story is told in typical jigsaw fashion, and it lets you know how the crew came together. The ending is a very tense affair as the cops close in and the so-called professionals turn on each other. The dialogue is fantastic, great examples include. "" Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie. Or are you gonna bite?"" and "" was that as good for you as it was for me?"" These are pretty memorable, especially the latter which is said after one of the most notorious movie scenes ever, which is when Mr Blonde cuts off his poor hostage, Marvin Dash's ear... gory. But still one of the best ever scenes in film history. Sure these are great and memorable, but the film undoubtedly owes a lot to older films, in particular I think it owes a lot to The Asphalt Jungle. But I think Tarantino has created a masterful piece of film, with slick direction, brilliant dialogue and an exceptionally told story, I think this film will definitely go down in history.

This is a rare film indeed where the quality is in the feel and the atmosphere created by the people involved who have created a film where as one reviewer for this film puts it 'less is more'. In my opinion all of the actors have to be in a certain frame of mind for a film like this to work and the result could so easily been comical if one or more of its parts had been faulty. That automatically means that the man directing this film is a risk taker and probably an innovative and intelligent film maker. I know nothing about Quentin Tarantino other than seeing him in From Dusk till Dawn which I also enjoyed. Apparently he is only 46 and he will no doubt keep producing films of this quality, well at least I hope he does. I would recommend anyone watch this film, yes it is a violent and bloody film but there is a lot more to it than just those two aspects.

364,donuthaters12,"Despite It's Slick Style And Unique Take, It Leaves You Underwhelmed",7,6 January 2014,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from Quentin Tarantino and I can definitely say that he is definitely a dime a dozen. Tarantino was bold with making his debut film so unique from the it's competitors at the time.Reservoir Dogs is written by Tarantino and Roger Avary contributing some dialogue for the film. What Tarantino has written is a twist of a staple story in the crime genre, where the events of the actual robbery is not seen but rather shine a light the events after the robbery. Tarantino could have kept it with that road but instead the film flips back and forth between origin/specific robbery stories and the post-robbery events. The film is driven by dialogue, which is now considered a principle in his films, and the dialogue is definitely different from crime films that preceded this film. Instead of physical actions and deep insight of the character's emotional core, characters are instead shaped by Tarantino's dialogue with characters speaking about themselves or others which in turn shapes our perception of these characters, which I think is important in order to view the plot objectively and not gain a deep attachment to these characters. The issues I had with his script is the underwhelming origin stories that doesn't really show off the wildness and absurdity that is found with many of his future films. The screenplay also felt a little held back on pushing the boundaries of the dialogue when compared to his succeeding films. The dialogue also from time to time jump from being a natural and organic conversation, regardless if they are in a crisis situation, to basic plot driving dialogue.Quentin Tarantino is an amazing director and even though all of his films are not always in excellent condition, though his worst are miles better than most films it competes with, he still brings a sense of style that defines the film and it's fresh unique take allows us to be curious on what could come on the next scene. Reservoir Dogs is his first film which is the main reason why this film felt a bit rushed or amateurish, not in a bad way but rather in an inexperienced way. The film definitely is limited by a budget and that in a way restricted Tarantino, as he seems to show more crazy and fun sequences when he has the budget for it. The film for the most part keeps me interested with it's great pace and it's characters play with his dialogue, though Mr Orange's backstory did feel tiresome and did feel like walking through a mountain after the swift two thirds of the film. The film's non-linear approach does kind of play off the style that Kubrick applied for The Killing.Andrzej Sekula is the cinematographer for this film and he returns again in Tarantino's sophomore film. Sekula and Tarantino felt like they were held back in this film due to the budget therefore the film felt like it has this rushed hand held style that a lot of the moments of the film contains but this film does show hints of the photography style that Tarantino employs in his future films, with crooked angles, long takes and long shots of dialogue-full moments allowing the film to feel like a play, which is obvious in this film due to it's budget and boxed story.This film doesn't include a score and this does in a way allow the film to suffer with moments that felt overstretched and needed that cinematic flair. Pulp Fiction also has these features but it makes up for it by having a sufficient amount of musical nuggets throughout the film that keep it from being stale. Though the musical moments that do cameo in this film are top notch with moments that actually feel more gruesome and horrific than what it already is.Reservoir Dogs' cast is confined to 10 people and they are given the majority of the screen time, and it most cases it is shared. The actors do play off well with each other and along with the strong dialogue it makes the film entertaining. The standout actors in this film is Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, when they are bantering they all just bring the intensity that the scene required and are able to stay strong and fresh in long takes that includes monologues and subtle physical acting. Tim Roth was a bit of a distraction though, his American accent and the slight over the top acting did have me cringing.Tarantino's debut does bring something unique and fresh to the crime genre but with an underwhelming screenplay and the inexperience and budget constriction does bring the film down.",Reservoir Dogs

366,SebMoz,A great time,8,12 November 2020,"A lot of directors take some time to find their style, and they often make a few movies before they get it right. That wasn't the case with Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs is filled with all the tropes we now view as standard procedure for him, and it's honestly astonishing how he managed to create such an original and unique directing style for his very first movie. Almost the entire runtime of the movie is just dialogue, which would be boring had any other filmmaker made it, but Tarantino manages to make it interesting, suspenseful, funny and relaxed at the same time, his greatest strength in my opinion. The characters are full of personality and very interesting, the music choices are great, the plot is done really well. I do have a few issues though. The first is the fact that I didn't get much enjoyment of the environments, which were bland and boring to look at. I also think the movie is a little short, and it ends rather abruptly. Overall though, this is a great, fun, entertaining movie from one of the greatest directors of his generation.",Reservoir Dogs

380,soymilk,A Top Dog for Tarantino,10,25 January 2005,"Although not actually the first Tarantino film I ever saw, 'Reservoir Dogs' was the flick which made me realise just how much of a Quentin fan I was fast becoming. I'll never forget the very first time I saw it and the impact it had on me - back then, I knew right from the very first scene, the coffee shop prologue, that I'd fallen completely in love with his incomparable writing/directing style, and that this was one name in the film industry I would never be able to ignore. Ever since, 'Reservoir Dogs' has remained one of my all-time favourites - it's an absolutely fantastic piece of film-making, complete with stylish camera-work, a brilliant soundtrack (I just salivate over the opening credits sequence with 'Little Green Bag' playing) and stellar characterisation. Not to mention that Tim Roth gives one of the most incredible performances I've ever seen in my life.Whether or not, with the successive likes of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown' et al, this can be considered Quentin's ultimate best will always be up for debate, but there's no doubt that 'Reservoir Dogs' remains his most hard-hitting and emotionally haunting movie to date. More often than not, it seems to me that people who malign it as little more than a callous showcase of gore and gun-play have rather missed the point, and fail to realise just how much depth the implications of this story really have.The key to its effectiveness, I think, is just how well-constructed each individual character is over the course of its running-time, with so many fascinating and paradoxical dispositions on display that the viewer gets yanked right into rooting both for and against them. The story itself, though cleverly-told in terms of direction, is pretty straightforward, but the characters give it so much meaning - we have the slimy but lovable professional of the group in Mr. Pink, the suave but chilling bad boy in Mr. Blonde, and, perhaps most strikingly of all, the mutual friendship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange. The utter humanity in their interaction is so strong that it completely overshadows the increasingly bitter and nihilistic backdrop against which the drama unfolds - while the other criminals are busy descending into an almost animal-like aloofness over the outcome of the bungled heist, White's chief concern remains with the welfare of his wounded companion. He's completely unaware of course that his new-found friend could, under slightly different circumstances, just as easily have been a mortal enemyAt the same time, the movie is littered with hilarious dialogue and light-hearted banter throughout, thanks jointly to Tarantino's knack for penning such sharp, tantalising material and the cast's own slickness in delivering it. All the acting in 'Reservoir Dogs' is superb - in fact, there isn't one player on board who doesn't do justice to their character. Roth is definitely the cream of the crop here - he's just stunning in this film, period. I personally feel that he handled the US accent very nicely, and never at any point detected any real accent lapses. On top of which, he plays the deeply shaken and physically deteriorating Mr. Orange with such precision, you find yourself completely absorbed in his agony - my heart goes out to him every time I watch it, particularly when I see his facial expression following the encounter with the armed female driver; it's amazingly telling. Meanwhile, Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, as are Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel. Kirk Baltz too is outstanding as Marvin Nash, the poor young cop doomed to kidnapping and ear-severing at the hands of the sadistic Mr Blonde (a properly shocking scene, but not an overly graphic one, and it does serve its purpose - and, contrary to popular belief, most of us 'Dogs' fans DO feel pity for Marvin). Tarantino himself turns in a memorable job with Mr. Brown, a relatively minor role, but thanks to him, I can never listen to Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' in the same way again!'Reservoir Dogs' is in turns exciting, disturbing and always compelling, but it's the affecting aftertaste it leaves you with in the end - nothing could have prepared me for just how towering those last few minutes would become. Here, we see the friendship between White and Orange ultimately prevail, but in the most painfully tragic way possible. The sight of Mr. White, now bleeding from his own wound, cradling Mr. Orange's head so fondly, coupled with Orange's moribund gasps of, ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry"" is something which will haunt me for the rest of my life. The very ending left me heart-wrenched, but also full of admiration for Orange's final decision - having witnessed how true and altruistic a friend White had been to him, and just how many sacrifices he'd made for his sake, the only way that Orange could possibly return his great loyalty was to put an end to his own deceit, knowing full well what would happen to him if he didIgnore anyone who tells you that this is nothing but a violent blood-fest - it's a deep, unnerving and, in the end, very poignant film about trust and loyalty that works on so many levels.Grade: A+",Reservoir Dogs

382,jackrabbitslims-1,True Crime Classic,10,27 February 2002,"Quentin Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, you might have heard by word of mouth from your friends. This film is not critically acclaimed and Tarantino's is not as well known for this film as he is for Pulp Fiction, but the fact remains that this film is as great as Pulp Fiction, if not better. When you first start to hear the words from Tarantino's monlouge about Madonna during the opening credits it hooks you. If you see this movie, it's not one of those to watch with your girlfriend over a tub of ice cream. This is a film that you have to take seriously like you would be watching The Godfather, unless your girlfriend's into this stuff of course. You could usually buy this movie for 10 bucks which is really cheap for such a classic but if you become a true fan, wait till this summer when the special edition 10th anniversary disc comes out, then we'll all be happy wont we?",Reservoir Dogs
383,HORROR_FAN_1,Absolutely Fantastic,9,11 April 2002,"This is a fabulous film and nearly just nearly gains full marks. I am more into horror myself but this combines so much that it's hard to take in all in one sitting. Dark black humour, thrills, spills, drama, what else could you want??!!. Quentin Tarantino deserves the up most credit for this masterpiece as does Harvel Keitel, who leads an extremely strong and professional cast. An unuusual way to set the film in the form of it's timing, as the audience straight away is thrown into the drama from the off but it works beautifully & has the desired effect which Tarantino creates time and time again throughout the movie. A film which, to be enjoyed thoroughly has to be watched at least 3 times. ""Are you gonna stand there and bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?""

384,jbirtel,"Funny, Bloody, 1st Rate Gangsterama (& little green bag)",10,31 August 2002,"There is a deleted scene in 'Pulp Fiction' where Mia Wallace interviews Vincent Vega and says there are 2 types of people: Elvis people or Beatles people; you can like them both but no one likes them equally.In the same token, there seems to be similar groups who love 'Pulp...' and 'Reservoir...' (though some hate one or the other; or both) but few like them equally. As one of the 'Few' who love both films equally; especially when you consider that 'Reservoir...' was made for only 1.5 million dollars. AND! It was a directorial debut ('Pulp's budget was about 8 1/2 mil; equally impressive). Compared to all the mega million dollar movies, you wonder when will Hollywood learn that age old lesson that the 1st step to a great film is the step that costs the least: the Script.Minor spoilers! A movie about a jewel heist...but you never see the heist. A scene where the crime boss outlines the plan...but the scene cuts before he begins (a very hysterical exchange between crime boss Joe and the 'dogs'; no way am I going to reveal more). In fact, it's criminal to reveal much of anything. Do yourself a favor: if you haven't seen this, don't ruin it for yourself by reading reviews that simply regurgitate the plot. This film's magic works on each element of information carefully unfolding before the viewer. The story unravels! The viewer is hooked.The entire cast is top-notch. For one of the few times we're treated to 'acting' and 're-acting'; dialogue that responds to a response... to a response (etc.) to what was said. And small wonder there are legions of people that have the monologues memorized. It's priceless.Yes...the violence IS disturbing...the way violence really is (there's something very wrong when violence becomes entertaining which this film does NOT do...then again that may depend upon the viewer's perception).And the new DTS sound transfer on the 10th anniversary edition makes the gunfire blast that much more powerful and disturbing. And how about that ""K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's"".Now the screen aspect ratio. From the deleted scenes on the bonus material, it's looks like the film was shot at the 1:66 format (which fills the TV screen a little more than the usual widescreen 1:85 format, and a lot more than the very wide 2:35 format). Usually, I champion the wide screen format over full screen, providing that the widescreen format is a TRUE widescreen. This film is not It actually showed more on 'Resevior Dogs' 1st DVD release on the full screen side (and previous cable TV broadcasts). Because on a 1:66 ratio, when the transfer is zoomed in for the 3:4 standard TV; you, the viewer don't lose much visual information. But it was theatrically released in the 2:35 ratio. The point is: the 10th Annivesary Edition took it's full screen transfer from the 'already' zoomed in 2:35 (all you thousands reading this, raise your hand if you don't understand!).An homage to a 25 minute segment from a Hong Kong film called ""City On Fire"". Simular plot outline, that's it! These 2 movies are very different. And Tarantino proves that 'novel rules' works on the film format too.Oh!

I wanted to watch it but I was not given permission, as it was ""too violent"". I wanted to watch it still but eventually decided to just find a screenplay. I read the screenplay and it sounded brilliant. I finally got the film on video and got permission. I sat down in anticipation and turned it on.It was OK. I think this was a case of too much excitement left me feeling let down. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I need to take the time out to watch it a second time without the over excitement.So this isn't an actual review. More as a warning. Don't let yourself be caught up in the height.

This was *the* movie to see as a college student (along with ""Swingers"" and ""Pulp Fiction""), but I was deeply disappointed by it. For the first 30 minutes, I was just hoping the trademark Tarentino ""dialogue"" would end!!! I know Tarentino is very good at dialogue, but sometimes he overdoes it (also in ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"") and he definitely does so in this movie. The plot is intricate, the acting is well done, but the plot is at a full stop due to the endless drone of talk talk talk that I really don't care about. The ending was surprising and did save the movie from a lower score, but I guess I will never understand why people think this is one of Tarentino's best movies and one of the better movies of all time.",Reservoir Dogs
387,Brad K.,Fantastic movie featuring brilliant performances.,10,22 July 2000,"Reservoir Dogs is one of my favorite movies.  Unlike most people I prefer this film to Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Reservoir Dogs. The story line is fairly simple with a group of criminals who know nothing about each other meeting in a warehouse after a jewel heist turns violent. The criminals are the calm veteran played by Harvey Keitel (Copland, Bugsy), the dying young criminal played by Tim Roth (Rob Roy, Hoodlum), the sadistic but calm man played by Michael Madsen (Donnie Brasco, Free Willy), and the jumpy nervous guy played by Steve Buscemi (Desperado, Con Air).  They are waiting for their boss well-played by Lawrence Tierney (Dillinger, Born to Kill) and his son played by Chris Penn (Deceiver, Rush Hour).  As they wait what little trust there was disappears as they suspect that one of them is a rat leading to violent conflicts.  There are several tough scenes to watch, especially a torture scene.  The film however is very well-written and amazingly acted.  Keitel, Roth, Penn, and Buscemi are all excellent.  The film's best performance belongs to one of my favorite actors, Michael Madsen.  Madsen delivers an unforgettable and chilling take on his sadistic character.",Reservoir Dogs
388,dave fitz,Great debut film,8,9 May 2000,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's debut film. It is a violent, but very entertaining film. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Chris Penn & Steve Buscemi, all talented actors who usually play supporting roles, are the stars here. They are thieves brought together by Lawrence Tierney for a robbery. Their names are kept secret, they are known only by color names. At the beginning of the film, we see the robbery go bad. The rest of the film, through flashbacks, tells how things went wrong. One of them is believed to have tipped off the police. This film has alot of violence and profanity and is played out nicely by the great cast. There is a memorable scene involving the Stealer's Wheel song ""Stuck in The Middle With You"".

It has a great cast, terrific script, really good performances and breathtaking scenes. And it has what Pulp Fiction did not realize, a better storyline with a more convincing plot. The anonimacy that we get dragged into works perfectly well and allow us to think by ourself, and come up with our very own character development. Perhaps with some more runtime it could have been among my Top 5.9/10",Reservoir Dogs
392,eddie052010,One of the best debuts of all time.,9,5 July 2014,"A debut film is an important film in a director's career as not only can it introduce the film industry to a new talent, but also can give us an idea of what that director will later bring to the film industry's table. Whether it'll be a great career whose legacy will live on forever, or a frightening one that will give the industry a bad name, the debut can give us an idea of what we can expect from a newcomer. The former definitely applies to Reservoir Dogs. Made by a film geek with a tiny budget and a stellar cast, the film became a staple, not only of the independent cinema scene, but of the entire film industry in general. Critics and audiences raved and the film has gone down as one of the best films of all time. But is it worthy of that praise? Completely. While not being one of the best films ever made, the film is certainly a great one, with a great script, acting and direction.The plot is that a bunch of gangsters, only identified by colour, attempt to pull off the perfect heist, but it all goes horribly wrong, as the cops have been alerted. After regrouping at their rendezvous point, the gangsters, reduced in their numbers and extremely paranoid, try to figure out what went wrong. What follows is a complex plot involving tortured cops, betrayals, and bubblegum pop from the 70's. The plot works really well here, as it keeps you interested in to what's going on and the non-linear approach helps to do so by filling in the blanks of the plot, and it all gels together perfectly. It also helps that the plot has many surprises, twists and a lot of tension throughout. The rest of the writing is also very impressive. The dialogue may seem bizarre, considering that often the characters talk more about Pam Grier, tipping and Maddonna than anything else, but it is very clever and very quirky dialogue, which can often be very funny, and surprisingly, there are more laughs throughout the film (especially the opening scene) than you'd think, but the funny moments and the more suspenseful moments are balanced out perfectly, as each allows their own time to shine, and the film is smart enough to not veer too much into one genre or the other.Unfortunately though, the characters don't hold up as well. Outside of Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, none of the characters have much teeth to them, and aren't very different from one another in terms of how they speak and how their personalities are constructed, as the actors alone the only thing that differentiates these characters apart. That said, some of the characters are well rounded, particularly Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, especially the former as the writing and Michael Madsen combine to create a character who is charming and charismatic, despite being psychotic and he definitely leaves an impact even if he has limited screen time. Mr. Orange as well is pretty interesting, being a smart-ass who is overly confident and because of this, gets more than he bargained for. The style is also pretty cool as well. The film has a brilliant soundtrack, has great moments of exploitation violence and shows some smart ideas, particularly the ending, which is impressive for a first time director. The film may mostly take place in a warehouse, but there is more drama, excitement and hilarity in this one setting than many globe trotting summer blockbusters. Transformers, anyone?Overall, this is a great debut, and deserves all the praise it gets and more. Despite some missteps (ie flat characters and a few plot holes), this is a masterpiece that stands as a great work of art, and gave us a taste of what to come from the great mind of Quentin Tarantino.",Reservoir Dogs
393,fullonrobotchubby,How can you hate it?,10,15 August 2006,"Quentin Tarantino's first feature length film. What's not to like? Let's run down the list, shall we? The blunt ""I'll explain it later"" nosedive into these criminals' lives... QT's self-delivered ""Like a Virgin"" monologue... Mr. Pink's refusal to tip... Deadpan comic Steven ""The Guy on the Couch"" Wright as the DJ for K-Billy Super Sounds of the 70's... Possibly the best opening title sequence ever (""Little Green Bag"")... QT's refusal to let the audience actually see the heist go wrong... The mounting paranoia after the heist goes wrong... The unsettlingly quiet and laid back Vic Vega/Mr. Blonde... The assigning of the code names... Oh, and of course, an officer's torture (courtesy of Blonde and a razor) to the tune of ""Stuck in the Middle With You."" The list goes on and on, but I wouldn't dare spoil the many creative twists for anybody. I will say my favorite scene (or maybe scenes, since it's kind of long and scattered about) is Mr. Orange's memorizing and execution of ""The Camode Story;"" maybe it's the actor in me that relates... Reservoir Dogs is truly a must-see. Everyone in the cast is at the top of their game (especially Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and the recently deceased Chris Penn).

394,foxhound-37781,Quentin Tarantino's raw and fierce film debut!,10,17 March 2020,"I just want to start by saying, I am the father of two young boys who love movies. Everything from The Lion King to the Matrix Trilogy to the Lord of the Rings trilogy they absolutely love. As this is one of my all time favorites, Many, many times have I been tempted to put on Reservoir Dogs for them to watch, only my wife continuously comments on its R rating saying it's a bad idea. I first saw this movie in the year 2000 when I was only 10 years old. I'm a 90's kid at heart but Reservoir Dogs was one movie that well and truly slipped under my radar before I hit ten years old. It's funny in retrospect because suddenly as the year 2000 hit the scene all these amazing films suddenly started springing out at me. two of these movies was Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction..... I came across Reservoir Dogs in the video store one day and thought it had a cool front cover, My mother was hesitant to rent it out for me due to the R rating but she rented it out for me anyway as it didn't say anything about ""sex scenes"".... whenever my mother would rent a movie out for me she was fairly easy going as long as it didn't have sex scenes in it.Reservoir Dogs has no sex scenes and in no way, shape or form, does it need them. Set in LA, Following the aftermath of a jewelry heist gone wrong due to being setup by police, the remaining thieves who managed to survive the ordeal (an intense chase and shootout with police), end up back at their original rendezvous point, a dank, dirty, empty, depressing looking warehouse. It's there that they start to realize they've got a ""rat in the house"" and start arguing the point over who's the rat, who's not the rat, whether they should leave or not due to the cops narrowing in on their location. Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) is one of the most brilliantly portrayed psychotic killers ever seen on screen, he shows no emotion whatsoever at the concept of torture. He hates cops (due toi being jailed for something he wasn't even guilty of), and QT makes sure he goes out of his way at showing this aspect of Mr Blondes personality.Mr Orange who is the undercover cop (played by Tim Roth), gets his fair share of back story, showing how he gets to meet up with Joe and Nice Guy Eddy and ends up in their crew for the heist, rehearsing the story with a police co-worker he's going to sell to them to gain their trust. The heist backfires for him as well as he is shot in the process of a carjacking, leaving Mr White (Harvey Keitel) to accept responsibility as his carer while he tries relentlessly to get him to a hospital without arousing police suspicion.The thing I love most about Reservoir dogs despite its rugged and raw nature is the fact that it's all about a heist the audience DOES NOT get to see. We only get to experience the fallout of the aftermath and it adds to the films personality. We as the audience are forced into picturing or imagining in our minds what went down during the heist. We get all the details about the heist from the characters dialogue in the aftermath and we start piecing together in our own minds what happened.... When the film begins it's all the heist members sitting around a table in a restaurant having breakfast. the first voice we hear is none other than the man himself Quentin Tarantino discussing the subject matter of a certain Madonna song, only being interrupted by all the other heist members over everything under the sun. The heist happens after this scene (which we dont see), and it's straight to Mr White taking care of a badly injured Mr Orange.Reservoir Dogs was made from a very robust and adult style of gangster film making. Ranking right up there with the likes of Scarface, Casino and The Godfather movies, QT knew exactly what film he wanted to make and flat out went with it. No one was going to hold him back for his film debut. For someone who was a former video store clerk, he sure did a hell of a job on his first feature film. it's very raw, very violent, full of bad language, and develops the characters perfectly without giving them too much attention to detail.

399,paul_mampilly,Truly a classic which will run for ages.,9,30 July 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSBefore I write my review, I have to say that my previous entry on the movie did not do enough justice and did not contain sufficient superlatives to express the greatness of this film. People who maybe reading this review, may think that i am going over the top about placing this movie as the greatest ever made, but i do have my reasons.The story itself is a basic heist movie, where the event goes horribly wrong, and the participants doubt and mistrust each other. However what differs this movie, to other types of ""heists gone wrong"" is that the actual bank robbery event is not shown,  therefore it shows that the viewers would use their imagination to think up the situation. Many people have claimed that this movie has heavily relied on other movies, such as the Killing, i would say that the story reminds me of a Shakespearian tradegy.
The actors in this movie were to say were truly an amazing ensemble of unknown gems and forgotten stars. Harvey Keitel (Taxi Driver) was amazing as the leader of the colour coded gang, who tries to make sense of what happened within the day. Micheal Madsen was sinsterly good at portraying the psychotic sadist Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi fitted into the character, Mr Pink, like a glove. Tim Roth was outstanding as a rookie gangster Mr Orange with a hidden agenda. However the acting goes together with the visual script used in the movie. It is packed with so much popular culture reference, such as the Like a Virgin arguement at the beginning. Also the soundtrack in this movie is complimentary, with Stuck In The Middle Of You for the standout torture scene. A very surreal moment!To conclude, i would like to say that this movie should be watched by true movie buffs and fans, since it is a great flim, which should be watched through the ages.",Reservoir Dogs

402,brainofj72,"World, Meet Quentin Tarantino",9,14 October 2005,"Quentin Tarantino is loved and hated by many, as is his debut feature, Reservoir Dogs. Like the bulk of Tarantino's work, many criticize Dogs as being pointless, excessively violent, and filled with over-the-top obscenities. I've always looked at it in a different light, as I consider it something of a The Crucible for the '90s.The Reservoir Dogs are Mr. White (Keitel), the sympathetic veteran; Mr. Orange (Roth), the young rookie; Mr. Pink (Buscemi), the squirrelly yet levelheaded one; Joe Cabot (Tierney), the tough guy boss; Nice Guy Eddie (Penn), Cabot's enterprising son; Mr. Brown (Tarantino), bit part #1; Mr. Blue (Bunker), bit part #2; and of course the infamous Mr. Blonde (Madsen), the laid-back badass. The ragtag Dogs are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but their simple crime turns into a bloodbath, and the Dogs, one by one, regroup at a warehouse, where they hypothesize and accuse as to who among them is an undercover police informer.Right off the bat, Tarantino directs, writes, and pseudo-scores a film masterfully; not bad for a high school dropout whose resume consisted of porn theater worker and a video store clerk. His direction is fresh, gritty, and packed with homages.His writing is realism embellished with ""cool"". Considering that the Dogs are all ruthless criminals, the strong usage of expletives is perfectly feasible and never feels gimmicky. The dialogue is intense and thoroughly realistic, yet Tarantino sprinkles ""cool"" throughout it, and he does it so impeccably that one hardly notices (he does this even better in his follow-up, Pulp Fiction). And by ""pseudo-scoring"", I mean that Tarantino fills the film with fun, hip, energizing music, yet he did not write a note of it. A perfect example of this is the masterpiece of a scene in which Mr. Blonde tortures a young cop while the radio plays ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" by Stealer's Wheel. In fact, there is no doubt that Dogs almost single-handedly revived this great song and made it a pop culture classic. The uneasy juxtaposition of brutal violence and upbeat pop music is reminiscent of Wes Craven's The Last House On The Left, only it is done infinitely better than in the aforementioned House.But what impresses me the most about Dogs is: a) Tarantino's flawless direction of his actors. The cast is literally perfect and the chemistry flows relentlessly. The emotion is raw and real, especially in the performances of: -Tim Roth: Considering that his character has a profusely bleeding bullet wound in the gut throughout most of the film, what Roth does with his role is nothing short of remarkable. Through his visceral facial expressions and perfect delivery of dialogue, the audience feels his pain. -Harvey Keitel: Keitel reveals everything that is going on inside his character's mind through his immaculate facial expressions. -Steve Buscemi: Never before and never again will audience love such a squirrelly character, and this due almost entirely to Buscemi's absolutely fantastic performance. -Michael Madsen: In his limited screen time, Madsen delivers a performance that is sinister, funny, likable, and reprehensible all at the same time. and b) The storyline. On the surface, Reservoir Dogs is a stylized gangster movie, but underneath, it is an intriguing character study and a cynical commentary on human nature. Like in Arthur Miller's The Crucible, a dangerous suspicion breaks out, and for the duration of the story, the characters are in a flurry of accusations and frustrations.As for the infamous level of violence, this Dog has more bark than its bite. It has more of a violent reputation than actual violence. Yes, an ear is cut off. Yes, a number people are shot and killed. This is nothing new or particularly shocking. Hasn't anyone seen the far more brutal GoodFellas?Tarantino has crafted a masterpiece with Reservoir Dogs, a film that entertains and distresses from the opening scene (in which Mr. Brown offers a dissection of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and Mr. Pink explains why he does not tip) to the gut-wrenching final frame. A brilliant and remarkably impressive debut from a filmmaker who went on to greatness I need not comment on.10/10",Reservoir Dogs

405,someokiedude,"QT at his best, and he's only getting started.",10,6 February 2021,"I can usually count on Quentin Tarantino to make good movies, he's usually made enjoyable, perfectly good movies for me to watch. I don't know if he's a groundbreaking filmmaker by any means, but thankfully he doesn't pretend to be. But there's sometimes, just sometimes, where he'll make a great film...and by far I consider his masterpiece to be his first feature length film, Reservoir Dogs.But what about Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Indeed those are great films, and I won't contest their excellence, but I've always preferred the smaller, more intimate atmosphere of QT's striking debut, which is a taut, tightly plotted, and straight to the point crime thriller. It's hard for me to explain why, in many ways, Reservoir Dogs feels like a blue print to Pulp Fiction, with its use of non-linear storytelling, unusual, yet oddly likable characters, and a pulp like quality that's reminiscent of the pulp filmmakers who inspired him like Siegal, Thompson, Leone, and Huston. Yet, I find Reservoir Dogs to be more straight to the point, less lavishing in its visual language, and more engaging in its taut narrative than his much lauded follow up.If I were to give a class on non-linear storytelling, I would most likely make this film required watching for my students. The story isn't the deepest in the world, it is a pretty straight forward heist story with ne'er do wells who pull off a doomed heist and then figure out what to do afterwards. But it's the way that the story is told that makes it so special. The narrative has a frazzled, disjointed nature to it, playing into the men's own feelings of confusion and bewilderment at how such an easy sounding job could so horrifically wrong. It's almost like if Murphy's law was put into one movie, where everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Like Breaking Bad, much of the film's tension and suspense comes from everything that goes wrong throughout the run time, and the men's ever increasing distrust of each other. I'm often in awe due to Tarantino's ability to build suspense by using dialogue, which he would use so effectively in later films like Inglorious Basterds and The Hateful Eight, it's so often that tension and suspense is built through silence and visual storytelling but Tarantino has the rare ability to build and keep suspense high with both dialogue and visuals, it often makes you wonder how he does it.Many of QT's later trademarks come into play with this film: engaging, complex dialogue, building suspense and tension with both dialogue and visuals, references to different films, mass violence, great soundtrack choices, and so on. But they are often used in service of the narrative, rather it be to build the characters as we get to know them for the next few hours, or to distinguish bits of their personalities that might not have been explored earlier. Tarantino's use of violence is more unflinching in this film than in some of his others. Much like his later film Django Unchained, he showcases that violence isn't always fun and can even be horrifying, even if he isn't intending it to be. Violence in this movie is dirty, painful, and not fun to look at or enjoy, and I sometimes wish that he would remember that when making his films and not succumb to making it so fun, as he sees it.Another strong aspect of the film is the acting, and I'm still surprised at all the people that QT got to be involved in this film, most of them known cult/character actors like Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and others, some of whom would go on to continue collaborating with Tarantino. A lot of them came on based on sheer luck or connections that Tarantino and his friends had in Hollywood, but they're all great in the film, they take the characters depicted in QT's script and makes them feel like real, tangible human beings. The most interesting relationship in the film is between Orange and White, and easily the most engaging and emotionally resonant, White's belief in his friend turns out to be the most tragic thing that happens in this film, and without spoiling it...it doesn't end well.Everyone tries to make the next great film, but Tarantino has no such delusions about his craft. He makes his films as he wants them to be, with no compromises in the way, and one can tell that he loves every waking second of doing it. More filmmakers have higher aspirations and fail to deliver on them, and have less fun doing it. I can only hope that younger filmmakers can take a note from Tarantino, to try and focus on making good movies that they'd like to watch and inject more passion into making them, perhaps such a mindset can save modern American filmmaking from itself.",Reservoir Dogs
406,beaconb,Depiction of Depravity,2,12 March 2008,"I would have given it a ""1"", but there were some funny lines.Based on this movie, and others by Quentin Tarantino (probably spelled incorrectly), I think he should be thrown in prison for being a marketer of immoral depravity. Looking past the poor cinematography, it's just a story about lowlife crooks. I felt like I wasted 90 minutes of my life. I would have left earlier, but I kept thinking ""maybe it will turn around before the end"". I went on to be mad I didn't leave earlier. The only saving grace is that the theater charged only $7, compared to the normal $12 (that's right, now it's $12 to see a movie in Manhattan), since it was not a new release. This movie once again convinced me that it will be VERY difficult for me to ever like an R-rated movie. I don't mind violence, when it's a good guy, or guys, getting the bad guys, but this was almost all bad guys. Don't waste your time.",Reservoir Dogs
407,thetyvonlesure,One of the Greatest Directorial Debuts of All Time,10,7 July 2019,"Reservoir Dogs is a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino's knack for dialogue offers the film up as more than just a crime thriller. The film offers extensive intrigue to the viewer with its superb dialogue. The dialogue is masterful and while camera shots typically establishes a film's strength, the dialogue serves as this vehicle's steering wheel. Despite the incredible dialogue, the cinematography doesn't take a backseat. The camera shots elicit the film's thrill, presenting the viewer with scenes that will undoubtedly stick with them post viewing. The script is incredibly written, exhibiting Tarantino's masterful manner of holding the viewer's attention and keeping them engaged despite time jumps. The time jumps and pacing compliment each other and are cohesive throughout the entire film. The film wastes no time getting to the point and answering the viewers questions. The acting in this film is incredible. This cast is filled with incredible leading men who carry on as if they've known each other their entire lives. The anguish and ego is huge in this film, making the dynamic impactful. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a damn masterpiece of a film that solidifies itself as a timeless Crime-Thriller Classic.",Reservoir Dogs
408,AW_McGOWAN,A Breakthrough For Tarantino And Indie Cinema,7,14 December 2020,"For the general public, ""Pulp Fiction"" might be the movie that put Quentin Tarantino on the map, but for cinephiles and filmmakers, it will always be ""Reservoir Dogs."" Before production began on the film, Tarantino had only directed one previous title - a 36-minute amateur project called ""My Best Friend's Birthday."" ""Reservoir Dogs"" was thus Tarantino's debut feature, and it introduced a broader audience to the trademark techniques that keep his movies unique to this day.The crux of the plot takes place in an abandoned warehouse after a jewelry store robbery in Los Angeles. Eight men were involved in the heist, but one of them supposedly tipped off the cops, for police were waiting at the scene of the crime from the very beginning. Through flashbacks, we learn more about the characters' backstories, as they spend the present trying to weed out the rat in their entourage.Flashbacks are a staple of Tarantino movies, and he evidently began his taste for non-linear storytelling here. Narratively, ""Reservoir Dogs"" centers around a diamond robbery, but the crime itself is never shown on camera. The director only shows instances from before and after the event. In doing so, he creates something derivative of a standard crime movie. The film fits no absolute mold and takes on the gangster genre from a novel angle.Another way ""Reservoir Dogs"" stands out as a Tarantino movie is through its dialogue and characters. Tarantino wrote the screenplay as well as directed the movie; he therefore created its ensemble of slimy people and penned their ruthless vocabulary. Particularly through their language, the characters in ""Reservoir Dogs"" bring new meaning to the term ""toxic."" Few of them are easy to root for, but all are thrilling to watch and hear. Much credit is due to the film's superb performances, but the script alone is truly memorable. The lines are edgy, and perhaps offensive, but nevertheless fitting for this raw kind of film.And speaking of rawness, ""Reservoir Dogs"" also introduced Tarantino's most infamous trademark - over-the-top violence. Each character appears soaked in blood, sweat, or spit at one point or another, and the camera does not shy away from depictions of torture or death. All of this bloodshed is presented with an uncanny sense of fun, though. Tarantino will place upbeat music over gruesome scenes, and some characters seem to relish in their sadistic actions. One could easily call the film morbid, but Tarantino wears that criticism like a well-earned badge of honor. In reality, it is no bloodier than the average horror film, and as a movie, it's equally victimless. In today's market, it honestly feels more dicey for lacking diversity or any female speaking parts than it does for gratuitous violence.Nevertheless, I applaud Tarantino's daringness. Before this film, the director was working at a video rental store in Manhattan Beach. He was going to make the movie out of his own pocket until Harvey Keitel read the screenplay and decided to co-produce it. In 1992, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and made lots of noise. Miramax acquired it for distribution and it effectively began the indiewood trend of the 1990s. With ""Reservoir Dogs"" Tarantino established himself as an auteur, but also paved the way for other experimental filmmakers to find popular outlets in the mainstream movie world.",Reservoir Dogs
409,lefterisbeck,Terrific,10,5 May 2020,"A grand film debut by the great Mr. Quentin Tarantino. From its opening scene, the dialogue is top notch. As they walk out of the restaurant and the opening credits begin, I knew the film will be terrific. At times, they are joking and just enjoying the day, but then get struck with an unexpected turn and challenge. I was always guessing what will happen next? Trusting the wrong person and being faced with betrayal can lead to tragedy. Its narration, dialogue and great camera movements are very well done!",Reservoir Dogs

The film is about an old slick crook , Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his fat loud mouth son , Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) who set up a diamond heist. They pick six cons to pull of the job. They refer to each other as colors , they are , Mr. White (Harvey Keital) , Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) , Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) , Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) , Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino). The film takes place after the robbery , when they plan to meet at an old abandoned warehouse. Well all hell breaks loose! One of them is killed , one of them is wounded and one of them is missing. They start discussing what went wrong and why the cops were there waiting for them. They come to the conclusion... That one of them is working with the L.A.P.D! A great movie for crime fans as well as others. The movie is entertaining throughout and is true to life.

412,mazec666,"""Let's Go to Work.""",10,19 December 2012,"With the release of Quentin Tarantino's upcoming feature ""Django Unchained,"" I wanted to use this opportunity in discussing a film that has redefined my love of movies and the medium in general. That film is called ""Reservoir Dogs"". Arguably one of the greatest directorial debuts ever made, this particular film opened my eyes and realize that independent cinema is a far superior alternative to the processed Hollywood fluff.Dominant gangster Joe Cabot (played by the unforgettable Lawrence Tierney) gets together six dark-suited, color-coded criminals, unfamiliar to one another, to succeed a jewelry heist. Although destined to preserve their identities, their cover causes more difficulties when something goes very wrong during the robbery, designating a set-up. Everyone soon recognizes that one of the gang members is psychotic, but they have yet to discover that another is an undercover cop.Armed with a budget of $1.3 million, Tarantino single-handily breaks every rule in conventional filmmaking: it uses nonlinear storytelling to explore the complex origins of the three main characters, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth); it uses a soundtrack of '70s pop tunes to heighten the suspense instead of a predictable film score; and most importantly, it uses the opportunity not to show the heist in the film. According to Tarantino, the reason for this final statement was in his own words ""initially budgetary,"" but I think the idea works because it allows viewers to participate in the film from beginning to end.The violence in ""Reservoir Dogs"" was very graphic and sadistic not on the level of ""Die Hard"" but on the level of ""The Wild Bunch"". Ironically, it is played for dark-humor as seen in the infamous scene where a kidnapped cop's ear is being carved off with a razor blade to Stealer's Wheel's song 'Stuck in the Middle With You'. Whether you've cringed or laughed at this scene, this becomes a later crucial point in the film.The film is indeed a modern classic of not only independent cinema, but is among the best Hollywood films of the '90s. By the way, I almost forget about the well-known commode story which is another great scene to watch.Mr. Orange: What happens if the manager doesn't give you the diamonds? Mr. White: Cut off all of his fingers. The little ones.",Reservoir Dogs
413,happytoms,The original Tarantino masterpiece,10,28 August 2019,"It's the original Tarantino masterpiece in which events happen in a nonlinear timeline and overall it adds to the story by letting us know what happens and later on explaining how it happened while showing what happens after. It's quite something and I love it. It's the one where the legendary Diamond heist takes place and all the iconic colorful characters are introduced like Mr.Blonde,Mr. Orange. It's filled with iconic scenes,characters and their interactions between each other, music in the right places to enhance the expierience of whatever happens perfectly and you can never forget the K-Billy's super sounds of the 70s playing in the background in important moments. It just has everything needed for a great movie. It's still very enjoyable after all these years.It's the original time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days to understand Tarantino better and watch how it all began and evolved over time.Would 100% reccomend to anyone familiar or not with Tarantinos work.",Reservoir Dogs

415,Shilo_R_A,"8.9/10 - a Well-Made, Instantly Iconic Film",8,15 June 2021,"My first Tarantino film IS the first Tarantino film! How apropriate.Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is the directorial debut of one of the most famous directors out there - Quentin Tarantino. It tells the story of a bank heist gone wrong, backwards - I mean, the film starts after the bank heist, and we follow the characters as they try to understand what really happened, thinking that some team member sold them out. We learn what happend and about each character through flashbacks and dialogue, mainly.So, gotta tell ya, I get why this film is so iconic. This film is pretty fast-paced, so it just grabs you in and throws you from one iconic scene to another. The dialogue is so natural, and its flow is truly great. Each main character is so well-written too, and memorable in its own unique way. The acting is mostly solid - Mr Orange, Mr Pink and Mr White are quite legendary acting-wise. Eddie is the only one whose acting fell a little short for me from time to time, but it was decent most of the film. I love the structure, too - it may sound weird on paper, but it works so incredibly well here.The soundtrack is really on point as well, and I honestly think that this is one hell of a debut film.I mean...damn, it's only his first film and it's that good! Definitely looking forward to watch more of his stuff.Feeling an 8.9 on this one. Probably will grow on me with time, but that's for now. Highly recommended.P.s
I think that the symbolism that each color had here (I mean, the names of the characters). Pretty cool, Tarantino. Pretty cool.",Reservoir Dogs
416,oldman007,An instant classic. one of the most important films ever made.,10,6 May 2006,"This movie was very well made. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan on Quentin Tarintino. I can't stand his work. I thought Reservoir Dogs would be the same, but I was wrong. Just by judging the way the cover was, it looked like a gangster movie where they spend the whole movie in the bank, but it isn't. It's about the perfect robbery that gets organised and it goes terribly wrong. They then realise one of them is a cop, but which one, is it? It was quite a change to actually have a relationship with gangsters for once. It was good to know that gangsters are human too. In an evil way, but they are still human. Most people say ""They're gangsters, they're not human."" But it's not true. They are human. Quentin Tarintino makes them human. It explains their backgrounds and how they got their job, etc. It had great 70's songs too such as ""Stuck in the middle With You"" by Steeler's Wheel. The cast is fantastic. They do act childish in their situation, but who wouldn't? All he characters in this are so lovable. This film is very important because it's exactly what gangsters do and i'm 99% certain it's what they talk about. It's just good to have a relationship with bad guys for a change instead of the good guys all the time. I recommend it to Quentin tarintino lovers and people who love gangster films. 10/10 Advice: A lot of people hate reservoir Dogs, which is fine, but don't get mad. Don't say something like ""You just didn't get it and you're not adult"", it's the fact that they don't like it.Respect their opinion. You can't make everyone love the same movie. The world would be boring.Oh, and another thing, just so the people who haven't seen this, there's no action in this movie, it's all about the dialog.",Reservoir Dogs
417,zanghi_james,The First Film,9,27 May 2019,"Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite guilty pleasure directors. I'm not a huge fan of ultra-violent films with blood, guts, and torture, but it's just the way that Tarantino does it in his movies makes it enjoyable.I love how the film starts, too. A bunch of tough guys sitting around a breakfast table enjoying diner food, shooting the breeze about various stuff while smoking some cigarettes and getting almost philosophical about Madonna and whether or not tipping is a smart thing to do. Plus, there's the cool title sequence set to a band that I had never heard before playing a song that just fits the scene.Reservoir Dogs is shot very well and still holds up nicely on a good HD screen. The camera work is clever, and usually quite steady. There are some really iconic shots all over the place, especially given the fact that the majority of the film takes place in essentially a warehouse, an office, and a bathroom. I also notice that the film has a good soundtrack, like pretty much any of Tarantino's films. Tarantino's use of music like 'Stuck in the Middle with you' and 'Little Green Bag' in the scenes they are featured in is wonderful and, well, iconic. I can't think of 'Stuck in the Middle with You' without thinking of Michael Madsen dancing around with a straight razor and looking smooth and crazy.The violence in this film is a major driving point also. The primary event of violence the film focuses on is obviously the botched diamond robbery. What's genius about it is that Tarantino doesn't ever show the robbery at all. All you know is that Mister Blonde went nuts and shot a lot of people. With just a few choice sentences, though, and a little overactive imagination, you can imagine a whole bloodbath. Much of the raw violence of the film takes place, if I am correct, in the last half-hour with the flashbacks involving how Mister Orange gets shot and, of course, the Mexican standoff between three of the characters at the end that looks right out of Sergio Leone's films. It's sort of like Jordan Peele's 'Get Out', a slow build-up to a violent climax. However, there is one scene that still is hard to watch in terms of violence and that is the scene with Michael Madsen torturing the uniformed cop. It's harder to watch for me, since I respect the cops a lot.Acting-wise, this film is pretty cool. Of course, you can see the usual Tarantino regulars like Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth (and personally, I wouldn't have been surprised if the role of the black cop would have gone to Samuel L. Jackson if this film had been made today), but also a few actors I had never seen in a Tarantino film. Steve Buscemi is okay, but doesn't do too much in the film. Keitel and Roth have great camaraderie as a sort of master-apprentice style relationship and personally, I would have loved to learn more about Keitel's character than just that one flashback, since he seems like a just interesting character. Tim Roth, who I know of from watching Pulp Fiction and Marvel's The Incredible Hulk, is pretty young and slick. I should probably look into a few more of his films, since I find his performance in Reservoir Dogs not too shabby. Chris Penn plays a good gangster who kind of reminds me of a smarter Santino Corleone with a much cooler temper, too. Same with Laurence Tierney. On the other hand, Michael Madsen, whoa. This guy plays a real nasty psychopath and does it with gusto. If they had actually filmed the Robbery sequence, I think he would give me nightmares with his thirst for blood. The torture sequence he partakes in is, as previously mentioned, really simplistic yet at the same time, messed up. Eddie Bunker and the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, are, like Buscemi, woefully underused also as they play a couple of interesting characters who, like Keitel's Mister White, are characters I want to learn more about.Like I said, this film is a good film. I don't know if it is Tarantino's best, since I've still got a few of his to watch and since each film builds off each other, it's hard to label it. Nevertheless, a good film to watch if you got some free time and want to start watching Tarantino's style of cinema.",Reservoir Dogs

419,mhajs,Realistic like hell. But reality sometimes may be it.,4,3 April 2005,"*1/2 out of **** Let's talk about music. I am a true heavy metal fan and my favorite bands are Iron Maiden, Stratovarius and Iced Earth. I also like other bands and even I like jazz and blues. My cousin likes blues a lot. Sometimes we listen to blues together when we go out, when we drink. I went to a musical concert in 2003 of a death metal band called Krisiun. I can tell you that since that day, my life has completely changed. My left earring is not the same anymore as it was before, but still I can listen pretty well and this is truly cruel. Cruel to know that my earring is not the same anymore. Now, if going to a musical concert and not listening the same way I did before is already cruel, can you imagine what would it be if I had my earring cut? This isn't cruelty anymore, it's madness in colors, physical. When Quentin Tarantino directed Reservoir Dogs, I really do believe he was trying to show how mad he could get. But I mean, mad. To the limit. As we see Michael Madsen slash the earring of a cop off, and then we see that big red whole in the face of the poor man, we see how Tarantino turned to be a monster director in this movie. That scene is way too violent, too extra-terrestrial mad and insane, not only I felt completely beaten in my chair, I wanted to throw up. After the end of that scene, I was so shocked, I couldn't almost keep my head holden up to watch this insanity to the end. After the movie was over, I wanted to take a look at the deleted scenes. And what do I find? Not only that scene was way too cruel, but there's another scene, another version of the scene, where the titles on the screen appears: ""Warning! This is a very violent scene, not suitable for some viewers"" or something like that. Do you know what I did? I turned the DVD player and TV off. If the scene that got inside the movie was already the way it was, how would it be as a deleted scene? Reservoir Dogs (1992), insanely directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a movie for people who have guts and stomach to watch. It's a movie for those who can have launch while watching Steve-O throw up in Jackass - The Movie (2002). I understand that this is a debut movie and I even dare congratulate Mr. Q. for having directed this movie as a debut. But it's not because it's a debut, I should give credits because we must be professional writers. I don't consider myself as a professional writer, but I try to be, at least. This was just one scene, but if we discuss the rest of the movie, we're going to find out that it's about a group of men who must do a dirty job. They must go on a mission where they must steal some diamonds and leave. But everything goes wrong, because the alarm gets triggered (it was shame that this hasn't been filmed, but it's OK), Mr.Blonde (Michael Madsen, more hateful than ever before) starts firing people, almost killing Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Tim Roth) gets shot in the stomach. Everything went wrong because the alarm got triggered, policemen arrived at the crime scene and there's a traitor! The plot is incredibly good as it always was in the Tarantino movies. But Tarantino is a man who as he likes to show violence, he shows it as a masterpiece. Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill Vol.1 (2003) and Vol.2 (2004) are all great, because Tarantino knows how to use violence. The eye scene at Kill Bill Vol.2 is quite shocking too, but when I went to Krisiun concert, I didn't leave having eyes trauma. God, I'm even shaking as I'm writing this down! I'm totally dizzy.Well, to conclude this review, I must say that if you like violence and/or have an iron stomach, you might have fun while watching this piece of insanity and may like the movie. But I don't think that if a director likes violence, he has to show it the way he wants. OK, Reservoir Dogs has its characters, plot, good songs (as always in Tarantino movies), greatly great performances (as the actors really showed they're actually dogs) but also violence. And a lot. If you, like me have watched this movie and hated Tarantino, but haven't seen his other movies, let me say something to you. Watch the other movies! They're much greater as evolution took place. I might even watch that deleted scene of the different version of the earring cutting, but only if I'm really way too drunk!",Reservoir Dogs
420,templar77099,Quentin Tarantino is THE MAN!,9,13 June 2015,"I've always loved the work of directors like Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, Sam Mendes, Martin Scorcese and Matthew Vaughn. With that said, I also need to reveal I always felt some kind of attraction towards Tarantino's work. Growing up I always wanted to watch his movies. Some said to me there were B-Movies, something more independent to a more restricted public and now that I'm on my teens and after watching ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", I can surely assume the films really are niche-focused. After the viewing of this two I'm now seeking to see the two ""Kill Bills"" and ""Django Unchained""(which I've seen roughly 30 minutes a long time ago)But,now, let's go down to business and talk about the gem that is Reservoir Dogs.Tarantino made his feature film debut with this one, in 1992. The plot revolves around a jewelry store robbery that goes incredibly wrong. The gangsters then try to uncover the true identity of the one who has set them up. The cast on this one is simply amazing! We have Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) giving one of his best performances as Mr. White (the most experienced member of the group); Tim Roth who in his first outing with Tarantino gave a very solid performance as Mr. Orange; Steve Buscemi also is quite good as Mr. Pink; Michael Madsen shines as Mr.Blonde; Quentin Tarantino himself gives a good performance as Mr.Brown(specially with his ""Like a Virgin"" interpretation in the beginning) and also other good performances by Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino was one of the first directors to adopt the widescreen technology which grants the movie some amazing shots. He directs his features as no other, mixing humour with gore and intensity. The soundtrack as always in his movies, his excellent, taking the viewer back to the 70's. The pace of the movie is well built and Tarantino takes time to explain the three major PoVs of the plot : the one of Mr.White, the one Mr.Blue and the one of Mr.Orange. This develops the storytelling and also gives us even more background information about these characters. After watching I can truthfully say this movie sure deserves it's place on IMDb's Top 250, being an instant classic. It's just amazing and unpredictable, being of the best of the 90's and one of the best films ever made. Let's just wait for ""The Hateful Eight""!",Reservoir Dogs

And Reservoir Dogs was the only one which i missed out. Well here's a Tarantino era on the making in Reservoir Dogs, his debut work, was just immense and classy like any of his later movies. With no stupid surrealism, a clean and real violence plot which is definitely not meant for the sensitive fellas.There's no hanky-panky twists, no dupe-floured action scenes or chase, yet, u get engrossed in the drama. Well i loved the theme of getting into how the heist went wrong rather than showing how it went wrong or say what the heist was all about! Now that's why i thought it was real classy. You don't get to feel a female part in the whole movie, i don't get reasons to think why!

424,sam_3,"Woof, woof",7,20 November 2001,"Saw this film last night on TV.  Heard of it for a long while, butnever got to see it actually.  Scene after scene which could easilymake impressive posters (Mr. White & Mr. Pink pointing gun to eachother, Eddie, Joe & Mr. White pointing their guns, Four men walkingwith their trademark Black&White outfit, etc.) shall stay in my mindfor sometime. It's not the viewers' task to find out who the ""under-cover"" is, as itwill be revealed quite bluntly (but surely with surprise), and evenbefore that, Quentin plays around giving clues on screen (might I say,""watch out for the balloon""?).  What are we expected to enjoy with thisfilm?  Dialogue, plot, action, yes yes of course.  But what I trulyenjoyed was the mind of the characters in the film.  Men (I don't knowabout women, because I am not) can relate to each and every characterof the colorful gangsters.  Of course not to the extreme act ofviolence, but to the emotion behind each words that are shot out like amachine gun, and to the thoughts behind each action and reaction togiven situation...Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Orange, eachof them have something that men have or wish to have. Mr. White's paternal care for Mr. Orange, which at the end, costs hislife.  Trusting dad figure. Mr. Blonde (proto-Antonio Vanderas), blood-cold with no remorse,nevertheless knows how to practice loyalty in a primitive but precisemanner, which loyalty bears fruit even beyond his death (his loyaltywas THE key when Eddie figures out who the ""cop"" was). Mr. Pink, you've got to love this guy.  He's by no means ""cool"", butalways finds his way out.  Note the way he leaves the scene unhurt. And as already mentioned, he's the only one who hasn't got one's""Christian name"" revealed.  He is by no means a stupid idiot.  He talksa lot, but knows each and every word he spits out. Mr. Orange, all he had to do was stay quiet until everything wassettled at the end of the film.  Why on earth did he ""confess"" to Mr.White, who's holding a gun?  But this, my friends, is the sad nature ofmen.  At the end, you can't help it.  Anyone in a calm state of mindwould say, ""Don't blow your cover, cuz that would do no good.""  Butthere's this wee thing in your gut which can't stand it.  So, you blowthe story big time.  We see this all the time.  Men are bad in tellinglies and sticking to them.  But again, you've got to have sympathy forhim at the end of the day.If you are a guy, there's a fairly good chance you'll enjoy this.  Andwhile you watch, for heaven's sake, don't get too much into details. That will do no good.  And also, don't get too morally correct aboutthe film.

426,Patel_KH,Almost Perfect casting and a good film,8,28 July 2009,"I must admit Tarantino has his own unique style of making films and this film is no exception. I'm still not a fan of his work but I liked this film. I've tried watching Pulp Fiction a couple of times but I could only manage a maximum of 45 minutes into that film...Lets just say Pulp Fiction is not my cup of tea, who knows maybe third time I'll see it completely and then decide for myself. So before watching this film I was a little skeptical about the quality of the film-making from Tarantino. As it turned out he did a very good job. I was pleased with the movie and I believe it was never off-track. Probably the best thing other than the plot and the characters was the casting. Kudos to the man behind the casting he was almost spot-on. Now that brings me to the point where I felt a little let down. Chris Penn as ""Nice Guy Eddie"" was a DOUCHE BAG. I absolutely hated his acting especially during the Mexican Standoff scene when he yelled at Mr.White and while asking Mr.Orange for the answers{Chris was trying to bulge his eyes out}...That looked damn Phony and unrealistic. That scene really bothered me. The other not so good thing about the movie IMO was its profanity{especially the ear-cutting scene...it was gross}. Everything else was very good.Due to these reasons I give this film a 8.0/10",Reservoir Dogs

The movie is realistic,has logic and i realy like that,you understand why the characters do what they do.Something that i love about Tarantino is that he is not afraid to kill his characters, and thats so exciting,beacause with Tarantino you never know whos gonna live and whos gonna die.

428,TheyKilledTheGiggler,Brilliant Film. Quentin Tarantino rules!!,10,25 December 2002,"Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, Reservoir Dogs is a relentless and fierce film from beginning to end. Director/Writer/Actor Quentin Tarantino directs and screenwrites this film about a group of criminals put together to pull off a diamond heist. The simple heist goes horribly wrong leaving a huge mess for the criminals to sort out. In the middle of the main plot the film also tells about each character and their aliases. (which are based on colors) The film stars: Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie, Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, and the voice of Steven Wright as the hillarious DJ K Billy. All of the acting in this film is far past excellent. Mr favorite actor in this film has got to be Steve Buscemi, who turns in an excellent performance as ""The Professional"" criminal and cynical Mr. Pink. On screen the film contains many shocking visuals including the infamous ""ear"" scene played to the song ""Stuck In the Middle With You."" Throughout the film all of the criminals are trying to figure out which, if any of the members is an undercover cop because it seems like they were set up. I won't give way any more details but all i have to say is that this film is revolutionary and paved the way for the visonary Quentin Tarantino who would release his greatest accomplisment in 1994 with Pulp Fiction. Buy this movie right now (get the special edition 10 year anniversary DVD) and enjoy one hell of a ride!",Reservoir Dogs

Everybody just did a great job.Joe,Eddie and our prominent colors steals the show. Infrequent violence scenes make it powerful and the acting is just over the top.Screenplay rules. I really liked everyone but Steve Buscemi,Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel just steals the show. This movie starts the style of Tarantino's long conversation about pop culture,daily and criminal activities which people enjoys till now. Especially,the infamous cop-torture scene and the when Mr. Pink shoots at cops repeatedly are too good. This is a perfect crime movie. It's that kind of movie ,you can see 10 times ,if you liked it. It was my first non-linear storyline Hollywood movie ,they did it so perfectly that now i love this kind. It's fast pace wouldn't let you bore for one freaking second.

430,prudhoeboy,Gonzo Hitchcock,8,27 August 2021,"This movie is now as old as the Hitchcock films it imitated were when it was made in 1991. Though not really my cup of tea, the movie is much like the playhouse theater movies of the 1950s and early 60s with emphasis on dialogue and noir violence rather than taking you somewhere. Obviously low budget but that goes with the genre. The cop bashing seemed over the top to the point of pandering and I doubt any cop these days would sacrifice himself to bust some garden variety mobsters. The three way shooting scene at the end also seemed a bit hard to believe given that the the subject of the argument, an informant cop who took a bullet to the gut was about to die anyway. These issues notwithstanding, what was really missing from the movie was one more big ticket star. The trivia says Tarantino tried several times to get James Woods for the movie but his agent didn't pass on the offer to Woods given that it was below what he normally gets for a movie. That is too bad, because Woods wood have been perfect in this movie, say as the wounded police informant. This is the one thing that separates this movie from a Hitchcock classic - Hitchcock always got big stars for his movies to make sure they will be iconic films. I don't recommend this movie because of all the violence and bloodshed. But if you don't mind that, go ahead.",Reservoir Dogs

432,Movieguy-47,A Few Good Ideas,4,30 July 1999,"Before the brilliant ""Pulp Fiction"" and the epic ""Jackie Brown,"" writer-director Quentin Tarantino burst onto the independent films scene with this morbid little piece of filmmaking called ""Reservoir Dogs."" It tells the terribly unpleasant story of a few chatty thugs, with color-coded names, who assemble in an abandoned warehouse after a jewel heist goes terribly wrong. Loud arguments, gun-fights, and a nasty little torture scene ensue. Still, Tarantino had a few good ideas, and I'll give him that. Narrative through flashback was done with a clever flair and I did like the way Tarantino chose to have all his characters lacking morals (even the ""blue rat""), so we wouldn't be forced to sympathize with any one of them. That's all that ""Reservoir Dogs"" really is though, a few good ideas but a genuinely unpleasant moviegoing experience. Rated R. 99 minutes. 4 out of 10.",Reservoir Dogs

434,Sonic_Ocean,A F$@*%d Up Situation,8,16 May 2013,"The first thing that occurred to me after having finished watching 'Reservoir Dogs' was that it had some qualities that reminded of '12 Angry Men,' with whodunnit scenario and especially the economical approach to the movie. When you have strong performances outweigh superficial methods to entertain the audience, you know you have something special going on with this film, especially with Tarantino's unique method of storytelling.This may be a heist film, but instead it shows what happens before and after. Basically it deconstructs the whole scenario and seeing what goes on is pretty interesting to watch. The witty dialogue is the entertaining part of this movie and to me, that is more entertaining to watch than a bunch of explosions, as I feel this would not even fit in with the story here.If you are a person who is desensitized to movie violence (or in fiction, in general), you have to know that there is some graphic violence here, but it is not unnecessary violence that was plugged in for the sake of value. It perfectly depicts the brutality of the situation these characters have thrust themselves into.But to sum up my review of the flick, 'Reservoir Dogs' perfectly shows Quentin Tarantino's trademark style of directing, with pop culture references, violence, black humor, and every vice thrown in. Tarantino really showed a huge transition with the follow-up, 'Pulp Fiction,' but don't get me wrong, whereas 'Pulp Fiction' felt more heavily layered, 'Reservoir Dogs' has its own unique sense of charm with its more minimalist approach and simpler story. This is a must-see for all movie lovers or anyone who appreciates a good story.",Reservoir Dogs

But it all go's wrong when the police make a suprise spring on there operation and the survivors of the crew are convinced that there was a set-up and a rat amongst them.This is where we get the strength of the story and the full quality of the actors on board, especially Buscemi and Madsen who show great on edge performances.  The Flash Backs that guide the backgrounds to the mob are fantastic and give great descriptive information on the characters, this was well inputted by Tarantino.  The violence is very classy and stylish and it draws your attention to the screen.

The screenplay is great and so is the directing and acting. Several things that make this movie worth seeing: (may contain spoilers, depending on how you look at it) the story manages to show before the robbery and after the robbery without showing the robbery itself and still have it be interesting. Also, it uses a radio like it were an actual radio (in the ""stuck in the middle with you"" scene, it's noticable when you watch the movie). As far as I'm concerned those two things alone would be enough reason to see it, but, there are even more reasons to see it, just ask anybody who's seen it. Bottom line, those who have seen it, I don't have to tell you to see it again and if there is anybody who has not seen it: SEE IT.",Reservoir Dogs
438,tangreat-bk,Humble Beginnings,8,28 April 2018,"Tarantino's first feature is rich in characters, witty writing and sudden violence that would later become his trademark.Reservoir Dogs's plot is told in non-linear fashion. One of the great joys of watching this film figuring out the coherent narrative lying within. Making the pieces fit. It is an exercise in style. While technically a heist movie most of the movie is centered around either before the heist or in it's aftermath. This allows Tarantino to flesh out it's ensemble of characters. It's a great testament to the movie that all the characters come off as complex and fascinating within a span of 99 mins.There are twists and turns to keep you hooked throughout. And who can forget Michael Madsen slicing of a dude's ear while 'Stuck in the Middle with you' plays in the background. Classic Tarantino.As enjoyable and fresh it feels, I think it is imperfect. It feels too stagy and the dialogues aren't quite naturalistic (Something Tarantino would perfect in his next film). Still this is a great thriller with tensions mounting while you're as clueless as the characters are.Moral of the movie : Don't Tip, you will live longer.",Reservoir Dogs
439,keuhkokala,My top ten movies of all time #5,9,11 August 2004,"This is Quentin Tarantino's (referred from now on as QT) first movie ever and it, like many other debuts of great directors (like Terry Gilliam, Peter Jackson, John Carpenter or Sergio Leone) has been made with considerably small budget. This is only good because it has forced QT to focus on the story and the relationships and not to some gimmicks like the three separate stories in Pulp Fiction or the huge battle scenes in Kill Bill vol. 1 (not to say of course that these movies aren't great too). Small cast and a simple setting in an abandoned warehouse bring the best up. Keitel and Roth are great and Madsen and Buscemi have the best roles in their whole career. And even the smallest roles are noteworthy; Stephen Wright as the bored DJ of K-BILLY always makes me smile. It has been said that this movie is not an important one because everything in it has been taken from another movie. You know, the color codes from Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, the set up from the Killing etc. But I disagree. If not else, this movie introduced the world what the new generation of movie-makers was capable of. The one, who has grown up watching old movies from TV. And of course every movie maker in the world can learn how QT makes the characters more human by making them have normal discussions about Pam Grier or Madonna's songs or tipping or anything like that, what we discuss every day or his choice of music. Normally music is suited to the movie to depict the emotions or to strenghen the scene or to earn more money with soundtrack albums that have new songs by hit artists like Jerry Bruckheimer does. On QT's soundtrack there is some old music from the 70's which was so out of fashion in 1992 as possible. But it works. The music choices are of course great and they also succeed in bringing up an eerie feeling when they are used in an improper scene. Like ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" in the ear-slicing scene. All in all, no matter what everyone else says, this movie deserves to be one of the best movies in the 90's and the fifth in my top ten list of best movies of all time. The only downside is that the movie is perhaps a little too short. I would've liked to know Mr. Pink's story for instance.9/10The best part: The Psychopathic Mr. Blonde dances to ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" with a razor blade in front of a tied-up cop, the camera tilts to the left and comes back and Mr. Blonde has the cop's ear in his hand. Then he shouts to the ear; ""Hey, what's going' on?""",Reservoir Dogs
440,mbuchwal,A tasteless exercise in violence.,1,9 March 2005,"When critics say that some films are pornographic because of the way they depict violence, they are referring to the type of violence that appears in ""Reservoir Dogs."" The film maker's artistic judgment seems to be clouded by a bloodthirsty hatred of police officers. I am thinking particularly of a scene in which a captive police officer is mutilated by his criminal captors. The feeling conveyed to me was one of sadistic joy in the victim's suffering, a sense that he deserved to be mutilated simply because he was a cop. I am sure that some misguided admirers of this film applauded the scene precisely for that reason. Unfortunately, a lot of people hate the police, and for them such a film functions as escapist ""entertainment,"" but ""Reservoir Dogs"" seems to lack any redeeming value of another kind, like a snuff movie. The only other time I've seen such poor artistic and ethical judgment in a film was in ""Caligula,"" by the producer Bob Guccione, where in one scene a Roman aristocrat forces a soldier to drink a gallon of wine and then cuts his belly open for the fun of seeing the liquid spill out of it. Some gullible members of the audience actually cheered when they saw that. Like Guccione, Tarantino, director of ""Reservoir Dogs"" may be a big fan of pornography and possibly he doesn't make the distinction between sex and violence. Certainly everything of his I've seen looks like a porno film stylistically, but he focuses mainly on bloodshed and torture instead of lust and love. Unless you're in the mood for a tasteless exercise in violence, you would do much better to rent John Huston's ""Asphalt Jungle,"" one of the best and most intelligently made caper gone wrong movies ever made.",Reservoir Dogs

The only thing that brings this movie down is Quentin Tarantino who looks very out of place and the fact that the pacing was a little bit slow at times. Other than those two criticisms this movie was very good in my opinion.,Reservoir Dogs
442,dimitrisalomao,Modern Masterpiece,10,23 March 2010,"I don't know if this movie is worth a 100%, but the fact that I had the courage to give it a 100%, shows that this movie is something more than great, it's a masterpiece, and although I think it's not as good as ""Pulp Fiction"", it's almost there.Six criminals, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss Joe Cabot to carry out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads among the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated meeting point (A warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.Quentin Tarantino, which is one of the finest directors of all time, impressed me more as a writer than as a director in this movie. Right in its first scenes, we can see how well made the screenplay is, the conversation about ""Like A Virgin"", and about tipping are priceless (He really convinced me that I should only tip when the waitress really deserves it). The dialogue is incredibly funny and unusual, that in it's first film, Tarantino defined his own genre. Some dialogues are so original, like when Mr. Pink (Buscemi) asks Mr. White (Keitel) about Mr. Orange (Roth), ""Is it bad?"", and Mr. White answers, ""As opposed to good?"". Or when Mr. Pink asks Mr. White if he killed any real people, and he answers, ""No, just cops."". Or the classic ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or you're gonna bite?"".The acting is really great too, Keitel makes a tough, but sensitive Mr. White, Buscemi makes a Mr. Pink that only cares about getting out of there without going to jail, not carrying about the others, and Michael Madsen does a charismatic psycho, and sadistic Mr. Blonde, that doesn't care about anything. It's hard to talk about the other actors, without giving any spoilers, so I'm not gonna do it, although they all deserve highlights.Verdict: If you are a Tarantino fan, you'll idolize this movie, and even if you don't like this director, you'll recognize this is a masterpiece.",Reservoir Dogs

I felt in that way may be it was not the kind I like, but the film quickly makes up for it with the suspense being revealed just after the mid time and the aftermath. The end was quite fantastic but I would have loved if Freddy was not caught. But still the movie is directed in a unique manner and really it needs gut to make movie about heist without showing the heist. The acting I would say was top-class, all the characters were in their character till the last. It felt perfect for the movie, even the dialogues as expected were top notch.

This man is an absolute genius. Armed with just $1.2 million, Quentin Tarantino is able to provide a movie that has it all. A clever, mind bending story, compelling characters, and even an exceptional soundtrack. All of this in his first movie! Despite how simple the story may sound on the surface, Reservoir Dogs takes a big left turn when it decides to make one of the men an undercover cop. It is then left up to the viewer to decide who the ""Rat"" is. Tarantino's decision to include a ""Rat"" adds an element of mystery that keeps the viewer engaged throughout the whole movie. However, where Reservoir Dogs really shines is with its characters. 4 of the 6 men are given such vibrant personalities that it not only makes them entertaining character, but it also helps make each one of the characters a plausible choice to be the ""Rat"". The nonlinear storyline also works great in the film as it provides back-story in a way that coincides well with what is happening in the main plot. The hiccups Reservoir Dogs suffers from is a couple of awkward moments in the dialogue. However, Tarantino was able to show in his future films that he is fully capable of delivering spot on dialogue. Overall Reservoir Dogs is what you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. Over the top violence, profanity, and characters that all work great together. Quentin Tarantino has done it again!!!!",Reservoir Dogs
445,PeterWilliamson,Reservior Dogs is an Excellent Movie,10,10 July 2007,"I think Reservior Dogs is an absolutely brilliant movie. The cinematography is (in my opinion) the best that Quentin Tarantino has done (closely followed by others). Both the lighting and the camera angles in the scene when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) is approaching Marvin Nash with the shaver was absolutely superb. I think, when the camera focuses on Marvin in that scene, it is probably the best camera shot I have ever scene. It's twists and turns made the movie gripping and (I don't know about other people) but, I found it hard to blink through this movie, not wanting miss one bit of the brilliant and sometimes humorous dialogue. The way the movie ended was great, with Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), running away with the diamonds, the prize possessions of the movie, the goods; after all he did was say how he wanted to, (and almost did) leave the area and then hid while the rest of them shot each other up over who they thought the cop was. The timeline (as always in a Quentin Tarentino movie), was done very well; and the way he introduced the characters separately, in their own special chapter, explained everything very easily. The movie is one of my two absolute favorite movies. The movie would of been definitely worth going to the cinemas for.",Reservoir Dogs
446,alexdelliott,Misunderstood masterpiece,10,8 December 2011,"Who would have thought such a simple plot could become this much of a classic. I can't find any fault at all with the film itself and I'm so glad to have it in my collection.The plot is simple as I said focusing on 4 survivors of a failed diamond heist as they attempt to unravel who was the rat who set them up. This film isn't about the plot, however, it is about the characters and this is where the film shines as possibly the best ever. Each character is unique but not clichéd and this is very clever. They manage to make the watcher both like and dislike them at different times. This is true even to the extent that a conversation about Madonna and tipping can be interesting to listen to. The most interesting parts of the film are where it takes you into the back-stories of the main characters including the planning of the heist.The acting is carried off superbly particularly by Michael Madson as the quiet psychopathic Mr Blonde and Steve Buscemi as the prickly nervous but logically thinking Mr Pink. When it gets to the end of the film you will have got to know all of these characters and the tense climax holds up against the best modern films. This film proves that you don't need a huge budget and CGI to make a good movie.Reservoir Dogs is somewhat similar in style of directing and filming to Tarantino's later film Pulp Fiction. But I prefer Reservoir Dogs as it is the classic that started it all off. I would recommend it to people who appreciate a movie that makes you think and isn't about action heroes or explosions but is much more subtle. It would be easy to mistake this for a plain movie with too much bad language and violence for the sake of violence. It is much more than that trust me and you'll soon find that Reservoir Dogs goes much deeper than so many titles out there.",Reservoir Dogs
447,DavidPumpkins,The Definitive 90's Film,10,10 March 2001,"Back in 1992, a movie written and directed by a video store clerk rocked Hollywood.  There was a new kid in town, namely Quentin Tarantino.  With ""Reservoir Dogs"" he had re-defined the crime thriller with his quirky dialogue and controversial depiction of violence.  The amazing part is, people talk about it as much today as they did then, and why not? It deserves all the credit it receives.The film centres on a heist gone wrong; Six guys are put together on one job -  a diamond heist.  To protect their identities, they are each given a colour-coded alias:  Mr. White (the outstanding Harvey Keitel, who, incidentally, had a big hand in getting the film made); Mr. Orange (the then-relatively unknown Tim Roth); Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen); Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker); Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi, surely one of the most under-rated actors around) and Mr. Brown, played by Mr. Tarantino himself. 
The film opens with a perfect example of Tarantino's dialogue, as the guys discuss whether or not Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" was a metaphor for big dicks and then debate with Mr. Pink on why waitresses should be given a tip (""I won't tip just because society says I have to"").  From then on, the film is told in flashback, as Mr. Whit and Mr. Pink, along with the wounded Mr. Orange try to figure out why the heist went wrong. Keitel really carries the film and it's his presence that probably ensured the film was made.  Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde is the perfect cold blooded killer and there is also able support from the likes of Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn.Tarantino went on to make the similarly impressive ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994)(which included some of the ""Reservoir Dogs"" cast) and then later ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), an adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is probably my personal favourite, though, with it's fast-paced storyline and terrific acting.It's been said so many times but it's true: ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the most influential film of the 90's, of that there is no question.",Reservoir Dogs

Kietel missed a cigarette lighting in one scene.But the film still gets a solid 8. It feels like an ""independent film"", because even though it was a simple story, it was told with its own voice. Not for the masses, but for itself. The film's got character.There's nothing mind blowing about it, but it's short, mean, raw, cool. It knows it's not clean, but is still professional about it.

However even with this you were never really told what happened to Mr. Blue, only that the died, and what ever happened to Mr. Pink after he ran out, or Mr. Orange and Mr. White at the end, but that is the fundamental controlling idea of this film, its unpredictability and its unanswered questions.Tarantino really does put his own spin on this event, and at the end of the film part of me was wandering what I had just watched and why I just watched it, but everything else about me enjoyed the journey and loved trying to figure out what all of the unanswered questions were supposed to mean and why they were left unanswered.A well conducted story, with the interesting idea of all of the current events occurring in a single location, and further that we never saw any of the events in the film happen, and we get the pure aftermath without any of our minds being set about a character before this crucial part came, instead it was the film, and this is something that I don't think I've ever seen done before.A film that is completely unique, and something different from the usual mobster styled films, especially in terms of perspective.",Reservoir Dogs

453,HandHStudios,Classic Tarantino... and Then Some,10,5 September 2013,"Review #4 of ""My Top Ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction.Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more.Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie.Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing.No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now.The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie.Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",Reservoir Dogs
454,plsj,Good Crime Thriller,8,26 June 2002,"I putted off seeing this movie for the longest time because I thought Pulp Fiction was absolute garbage. I tried watching it again, but I fell asleep right in the middle of it. My friends, though, kept telling me to rent this movie. So about a week ago, I rented Reservoir Dogs with the lowest expectations. After the movie was over I was pretty surprised. It had a good story line, good plot, and good acting. In my opinion, this is 100x better than Pulp Fiction.8/10",Reservoir Dogs
455,EJBaggaley,A load of tripe,5,4 November 2004,"This film had its good moments like when the gangsters were planning the robbery in the basement and when they were sitting in the cafe discussing about waitress tipping etc..but on whole I thought this film was rubbage. The funny thing is, is that I've always enjoyed watching these actors in different films(ie Harvey Keitel), but in 'Resevoir Dogs' I hated watching them because there acting (for once) was terrible, when usually I like there acting. However, the only actor I did like watching and did act well was Tim Roth for he is a superb actor. The scenes of the gangsters in the warehouse arguing and torturing the Policemen/Marvin Nash, I thought was childish, bad acting(especially by Mr.Pink/Steve Buscemi) for they clowned around talking non-sense and when they weren't doing that, they were either killing one another or behaving like kids on trying to find out who the rat of the pack was. This film completely dragged on, for it had a lame dialogue with no proper plot. I always wondered, did Mr. Pink get away with the diamonds in the end, or did the cops catch him with them?",Reservoir Dogs
456,dogspit,Violence incarnate !!! (SPOILER),8,13 January 2003,"Referring to Reservoir Dogs as very violent would be an understatement. From start to finish this film is packed with violence & blood. If you like the violent action genre you will absolutely love it (I sure do)! Tarantino has packed this one with an all-star cast including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, & Steve Buscemi. The soundtrack is a very good mix of 70's pop music. The scene in which Mr. Blonde tortures a cop is accented by the delightful ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" by Stealer's Wheel. This film is a first class bloodfest !!!",Reservoir Dogs
457,bubbathom,Brilliant movie.,9,27 August 2008,"The plot of this movie just blew me away...It was just awesome. Then the acting was great for a non-all star cast, and Tarantino executed it very well. My impression on the movie changed, because I heard it had banned in other countries for violence, but there wasn't that much. I thought it was going to have a ton of action and stuff, but it was really just a cool movie with some pretty awesome scenes in it. I thought some parts were funny, some parts were smart, some parts were sad, and some parts were just cool. That's why I like Tarantino, most of his films blend so much stuff into them, this is one of those. Also, the ending of Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen. Overall, great movie.9/10.",Reservoir Dogs
458,mtrburrows,Pulp Fiction Before Pulp Fiction?,8,4 August 2018,"As someone who considers Pulp Fiction to be one of the best movies ever made, I was looking forward to seeing a movie made by the same writer/director about a group of criminals playing off each other after a heist gone wrong. And when the Dogs are arguing, stressing out, fighting in that werehouse, you can truly see the roots of Tarantino's style, because anything that takes place in that warehouse truly had me hooked. Me White and Mr Pink are definitely the standouts, with both actors giving a brilliant performance and their squabbles feeling realistic and tense. However, the film begins to lose steam once the story begins to flash back, showing dull and uninteresting scenes that feel as if they were only included to get the picture to an hour and a half. These sequences truly drags the movie down as the conversations aren't nearly as compelling, and feel unneeded as they hardly shed any light on the current situation that couldn't have been told through the chafacgers in the werehouse. Ultimately, Reservoir Dogs is passable, and a decent first effort for the genius that is Quentin Tarantino, but it pales in comparison to his later works, as I feel there's nothing here that memorable or interesting.",Reservoir Dogs
459,krishdaggins,Gratuitous violence,5,13 March 2019,This is not Tarantino's finest work. It was heavily violent for the fun of it to make you cringe and squirm and took away from the plot and character development. Wasn't a fan.,Reservoir Dogs
460,Terry-32,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,10,11 March 1999,"My uncle told me about this movie before I knew who Quentin Tarantino was. I watched it, and it is a totally different movie from other titles. I've never seen violence, swearing, and adult stuff dealt with in this sort of matter. (I'm 16, so I understand it exists.) After that, I'm now in a position where I think that violence and profanity are VERY essential elements. This movie changed the way I write my own movies. My characters talk like these guys do. And I show violence in the same manner. My movie is an action film entitled ""Hard Job."" Look out for it in the future. All the actors are great! My favorites are Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. The torture scene, that was so outrageous. I now have a new view towards bad guys. I think all bad guys should be like Mr. Blonde. I liked every part of this movie. (Not when innocent people were killed. I thought those scenes were strong, but that's what happened in the story.) This is one of my personal favorites. I think everybody who can take swearing and violence, and doesn't critisize movies for being ""All talk"" should go see this movie. All the people who say this is all talk, SHUT UP!!!Sorry about that.

461,snakejenkins,A Bleak and Disturbing Film from a Treasured Director.,7,23 March 2004,"** / **** Reservoir Dogs is an interesting beginning to one of America's finest filmmakers careers. I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself.",Reservoir Dogs
462,wmattifo,A Masterpiece of raw violence,10,4 December 2002,"Quentin Tarantino couldn't have done a better job than he did with this film. I won't include spoilers but I will say that I never could have believed that a radio could have been part of a film's dialogue. Keitel is in top form, and Steve Buscemi has a break out role as ""Mr. Pink"" that really put him on the map. But the actor who steals the movie is Michael Madsen. There aren't enough adjectives (positive ones) for this movie, but I would call this as ""raw"" as a movie can get. The violence is personal, at gut level, and you'll never feel the same way about a certain song. You'll see. If you haven't seen this movie, don't just rent it, go out and buy it. You'll be glad you did.",Reservoir Dogs
463,Egg_MacGuffin,"Second-hand, second-rate cut-and-paste job.",1,17 June 2005,"To quote the great Terry Rossio:""There are many films with the goal 'to find your way home.' But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.""What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it's (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a ""good, it's over"" point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot! Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the ""infamous"" and ""extreme"" violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggest:The Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three",Reservoir Dogs

465,ZoSoJr182,"A great directorial debut, so what happened with Pulp and Jackie?",8,13 February 2005,"This is QT's second best film out of the 2 great films he made, so far, right behind Kill Bill. The story is great, and told in a creative and intriguing way, first you see the crew relaxing, telling jokes, about to commit the job, then you see Mr Orange bloody in the back of a car, opening a whole chest of questions (soon to be answered), then you see Mr White and Mr Pink trying to figure out what went wrong, then you learn about the characters while slowing piecing together how the job got messed up, until finally the truth comes out, and the ends meet. Now this screenplay was worth an Oscar, not Pulp Fiction (not a bad film, but not a very good one either, and entirely overrated) which had a simple story, and wasn't very interesting or entertaining. The acting in this is believable and good, the story is masterfully handled, its funny, its sad, its entertaining, and is easily the best heist movie, even though you never really see the heist (which could have made it alittle better, especially to see how crazy Blonde got, it could have helped the overall movie). I hope QT still has some tricks left for his future projects, because he certainly didn't have any for Pulp or Jackie, and i hope he didn't use them all on this and Kill Bill. 8 out of a 10.",Reservoir Dogs

It's a vicious, cynic, modern masterpiece and one of the best debuts I known to date.The story about a robbery that's gone very wrong is told in an amazing way. We never actually get to see the robbery, the only thing we viewers get to know about it is what the characters say, as they are trying to figure out who's the rat among this bunch of vermin.A great cast where Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel stand out among the others, whom are also great.A masterfully written, witty and highly sarcastic dialogue and well thought out scenes and screenplay, this is Tarantino in his prime.
The cynical and at some parts sadistic violence might put some people off, but that's their loss. After this movie, Tarantino's career has been somewhat of a yo-yo, Directing and/or writing great stuff like ""True Romance"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and less inspired flicks such as ""From dusk till dawn"" and ""Kill bill"".Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, you should know what to do about know.10/10",Reservoir Dogs
468,Cloud20,Noir Excellence.,9,11 April 2007,"Reservoir Dogs (1992)- 4.5/5 Possible Spoilers.Superbly entertaining and exciting fare that is definitely rewatchable. Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is a stunning debut film - one where the director is not ashamed to depict realistic dialog and violence. Told in mixed chronology, a crime boss named Joe Cabot (Tierney) hires five men to pull off a difficult job - to rob a jewelery store and bring the diamonds back. When the job goes bad with the police disrupting the heist, the remaining men, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), meet in a warehouse and discuss what went wrong. They come to the conclusion that one of them could be a police informant. The story has flashbacks giving clues to who it could possibly be, leading up to the surprising climax. Reservoir Dogs is definitely a credible film, with the success inspiring him to write the even more brilliant ""Pulp Fiction."" Tarantino's first film really does out with a bang, but the dialog and cleverly-scripted characters are what really make the film work.

Then as a team they set off to rob a jewelry store? The robbery goes bad and what ensues is a bloodbath as the police and the robbers face off with each other. This is not a good movie. I love all the actors but I don't think this movie is well written or directed. If you're going to make a movie about gangsters one should do more research then Mr. Tarantino did. He stayed home for a few years watching old cowboy movies and came up with this garbage. I love Pulp Fiction but this film is so horribly conceived its impossible to take seriously. I don't understand Americans. I don't understand why people like this movie. It is so completely unbelievable.

Great camera-work and scene transitions, like a work of art, and hey the film's high ratings may entirely be based on that so maybe I'm wrong with my negative review. However, the positives don't change the fact that the plot doesn't progress farther nor show more intelligence than a comic strip. The acting is great, but the plot just isn't there to hold it all together.By the end I know almost nothing about the characters, don't care to know, and have no interest in knowing any of their stories. Everything is just a big pile of ""meh"". The violence just seems abrupt and needless, which is I suppose an intentional metaphor, I get that. Still, the violence is kind of overdone. I really did try to like this film. I was expecting a great movie since it's rated so highly with so many votes, but I was disappointed. Some great dialogue in there, but it's a film I don't want to watch twice. This ain't no Pulp Fiction, folks. Pulp Fiction draws you in and holds on tight, Reservoir Dogs just beats the snot out of you and leaves you on the floor a bloody mess.

476,tangietangerine,Stuck in the middle with you,10,26 June 2014,"Tarantino is one of my favorite directors, and he couldn't have landed a more powerful debut film than Reservoir Dogs. It must have been really exciting to see, in 1992, this new wonderful kind of filmmaking arise. The great thing about his movies is that they're always so fresh, so authentic. I've heard some people say he does nothing but plagiarize from the classics, I couldn't disagree more. Besides paying homage to his favorite movies and directors, he ends up subverting whatever contemporary notions we may have of movie-making, and creating something new out of it. He simply blows our mind with a totally unexpected script, characters, dialog and plot twists. By the way, his bloody plot twists are the best (so are his long and genius dialogs). Like he answered as to why his movies always feature a great amount of graphic violence: ""because it's so much fun!"" Tarantino succeeds in casting nothing but a pack of great actors, something else to prove the quality of his work. Tim Roth gives one of the best monologue performances I've ever seen. Everyone else is just great, be it separate or together. One of the best moments is the initial scene, with that discussion over the meaning of ""Like a Virgin"", or the discussion about the assigned color names, just typical Tarantino. Also, the unexpected ending, I doubt people were accustomed to see that much blood in Hollywood flicks, maybe not since the 70's exploitations.And if we pay enough attention, there's a ""classical"" feel to it, be it from the special ""team"" of con men put together to rob the jewelry store, or by Pam Grier being brought on during a conversation - and, of course, there's ""K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's"" radio we hear occasionally throughout the film. I'm always glad for the musical discoveries QT provides us in all of his movies. With Reservoir Dogs it's not different, one of the most iconic scenes is the one where Mr. Blonde tortures an unfortunate cop to the sound of ""Stuck In The Middle With You.""",Reservoir Dogs
477,nyancatcandy,The first Tarantino Classic,8,31 March 2019,"This is the film that spun Quentin Tarantino's long running career of gruesom and violent masterpieces. With this film, Tarantino has made his first classic, and it remains a classic to this day, and will continue to do so for a very long time.A director's debut for Tarantino and he came off to a really great start with this immensly intruiging and different take ganster genre. With this piece Tarantino started sharpening his knife, and he had a real sharp one to begin with, but you can tell there are some rough edges still.The movie starts off with all the main characters having coffee together, chatting, doing what Tarantino is best at. Having seemingly pointless scenes, but that actually establishes character. Here from the beginning you get a sense of who is the leader, the comedian, and who you might wanna look out for. Even forshadowing some events to the trained eye.But here already can some of the rough edges be seen, as the dialogue isn't as sharp as some of his other movies, and the Tarantino-esque stories don't have quite the same sting in them. However it is forgivable, as it is infact his debut film, and it is overshadowed by the rest of the films brilliance.The film is beautifully built up towards the ending, through tense interactions and clever glimses into the past. It is a bold move to play haywire with the script and have it go in a non-linear order, but in this sense it works really well, building up tension and unravelling more and more as we go. And it all leads up to the scintillating and brutal ending, that would set out to become one of Tarantino's trademarks. The only problem I had with the flashbacks was the character of Holdaway, who we don't get any introduction too. The only thing we get to know is that he is a buddy of one of the other characters (not to spoil anything) and that he helps him in his task. A more detailed introduction of him would have been needed, to not make his character seem somewhat unnecessary.That said, the movie is very nicely done with little to no music, except for the songs playing on the radio, providing a raw touch to the film. It is not too long, as a story like this could easily have turned out boring with too many bland and boring scenes. Instead Tarantino has made sure every scene is counts and is of importance.A genre defying movie, or rather, a genre making movie. As this movie falls under the gangster and crime, it also creates it's own genre, or should I say, Tarantino has. With his first film, Tarantino manages a clean birdie, and creates for himself his own genre: The Tarantino-genre.",Reservoir Dogs

I prefer it to Pulp Fiction as it is his (Tarintino's) first.What I like about it most is the fact that there is no hero and no villain. None of these guys are pure evil and all of them are from good. Some great performances are in this film, put across that these are real guys in a bad situation. The two that stick with me are Harvey Keitel as 'Mr. White' and Steve Buscemi as 'Mr. Pink'.People talk about the amount of violence, however, most of it happens in you minds eye and ear. Many of the shootings and the ear-cutting happen off screen. But unlike Pulp Fiction the violence in this film doesn't push the story as much.The script is this film is great, a lot of shouting, some memorable lines, a lot of tension between Blonde and White and a few great conversations about nothing in particular.And....what else can you say. Thanks to Tarintino's individual style, this will be remembered as one of the great debuts from a director.9/10",Reservoir Dogs
483,Bobson10,"Are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?",9,19 February 2013,"Directed by Quentin TarantinoStarring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen.Written by Quentin Tarantino'After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant' Reservoir Dogs was the film that put Quentin Tarantino on the map. This was his first film and it was done with such class that you are left stunned that this was his rookie film.Quentin Tarantino did an incredible job with this film. His writing stands out the most more than anything. The words that come out of the actors mouths are words used as if you're talking to a best friend. So modern and 'street' like. It wasn't difficult to understand the film one bit. Another aspect I enjoyed was the story telling between the characters. At first, you begin with Mr.White, Mr Orange and Mr. Pink at the hideout after the failed heist. The only information that is given to the audience are rumors and personal outlooks. As the story goes on, more characters arrive to the screen and more information is told throughout. It's as if you are pulling the string from a ball of yarn bit by bit to find the end. It's great. I also enjoyed Tarantino's camera work. I noticed some 'Scorsese-esque' camera movements particularly in the police officer torture scenes. The manner at which Tarantino positions and moves his cameras are as if you're actually at the location witnessing everything with the other characters. The camera is itself a character and is brilliantly orchestrated.The cast was amazing. Not only are the characters developed very believable and real but the actors do the writing justice. There are no unnecessary characters. I especially enjoyed Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen in this picture. Steve Buscemi is the character that brings the most paranoia to the story and also to the audience. He is the character that questions everything and at the rate of his words, you can feel his emotions running through his veins. Michael Marden's character has to go down as one of the best bad-asses in film. As there is so much mayhem circulating around the group, Marden's character seems the most relaxed. His quotes are great and he does everything in the film with such class and patience. Great performance and a great character.Tarantino has proved to me time and time again that he knows how to choose music in his films. The music presented this film's attitude, especially in the slow motion gang walking scene at the beginning and the torture scenes. The music creates the atmosphere and mood of the characters in it.Reservoir Dogs is a classic film. You can't allow yourself to leave this off your movie list. The story, director, cast and music all come together to create one of or perhaps the best independent film of all time.",Reservoir Dogs
484,ronnay_barkay,A timeless classic...seriously,10,15 July 2005,"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: ""Are you gonna bark all day..."", ""I'll make you my dog's bitch"". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.",Reservoir Dogs

A bunch of whiney hoods that cannot pull off a ""perfect"" jewelry heist. The plot (what plot) is just an excuse for Tarentino to stretch the limits of gore and sick violence. Again, we must suspend belief that all the shooting in the warehouse does not bring the cops. I realize this movie is set before cell phones, but someone must have heard the 4 or 5 shots Mr Orange gets off before the others arrive. Not to mention the head shots to the poor cop before others arrive. A really stupid Mexican standoff where the two worst guys are shot and Mr White is severely wounded? The timing is not realistic for the gunshots - White has to take out two guys that have their guns trained on him. The torture scenes are just sick. I'm surprised Tarentino didn't allow the lighter to drop on the gasoline trail just to add more torture for his drooling fans. Wouldn't we be better off without Tarentino's style (?) of movies? Even The Godfather had better violence - those thugs were killed off quickly. You wouldn't have one thug (Orange) hanging around bleeding internally and externally, and still able to have enough of his senses to kill Blonde? And why does someone place a gun next to Orange when they are waiting for a doctor? Just so Orange could shoot Blonde - the only reason. There are plot holes everywhere.",Reservoir Dogs

492,Mr_Vai,One of the most inane and dated movies of our time,1,30 August 2004,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I did not know what to think. I mean, it was different. I could not remember seeing dialog like this before or a scene where a guy cuts another guy's ear off. It was unique in that regard. Mind you, it was different, but not really special. Moreover, some parts were very boring. Other parts were so ""talky"" and somewhat over the top, that they strained credibility. However, there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again, some ten years later, I can say with all honesty, this film has not aged well. On second look, you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines, but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe one-liners, that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act, sorry. He is cool, but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy, it looks filling, but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this ""cool film"" high marks, but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However, Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here, but that don't make it so.",Reservoir Dogs
493,andy-66447,Great Fun Watching Tarantino's First Effort,8,4 September 2015,"Quentin Tarantino's 1994 release ""Pulp Fiction"" is perhaps the single most important film of the past quarter-century. Its heated, in-your-face dialogue, hardened criminals, coarse language, and particularly its non-linear story line, peppered with occasional scenes of hilarious comic relief, ushered in a new era in filmmaking. Often copied but never equaled, ""Pulp Fiction"" made a star out of its young writer/director, Quentin Tarantino.But many of us may not realize ""Pulp Fiction"" was actually Tarantino's second film. His first was 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a caustic, claustrophobic paean to the great caper noir films of yesteryear, updated for a more percipient audience. The highly original story involves a diamond robbery which we never see. Think ""Deliverance"" without the rape scene. We're treated to an opening scene in which a mob boss and his son have coffee at a diner across the street from the soon-to-be crime scene, along with a bevy of hardened career criminals hired for the heist. The men, previously unknown to one another, don't use their real names. Instead, they refer to each other as Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, Mr. White, Mr. Brown, and so forth. They are played by some of the best tough-guy actors of the day – Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Chris Penn.The next scene takes place immediately after the robbery. Something has apparently gone wrong. One or more of the criminals has been shot. The rest of the action takes place at a nearby abandoned warehouse, in which the remaining criminals attempt to find out which of them, if any, is an informant. Here, we delight as the double-crosses accumulate like horseflies in a swamp at dusk.Interspersed with the warehouse scenes, Tarantino gives us flashbacks highlighting the backstories of each of the primary criminals. This serves to break up the present-day action and give us some breathing room, as it were, while pulling back the covers of cynicism we instantly develop about each of these characters at the beginning. In other words, the more we learn about each of the major players, the more we understand the ongoing warehouse scene.Having seen ""Pulp Fiction"" before ""Reservoir Dogs"" (as did most filmgoers), a lot of Tarantino's trademark effects first cultivate in the earlier picture. While not as brilliantly effective as in ""Pulp Fiction,"" the non-linear screenplay is first on display in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" with the individual backstories shedding light on the robbery aftermath. As in ""Pulp Fiction,"" once the movie ends, we then want to see it again from the beginning, due to our now-complete hindsight.""Reservoir Dogs"" first introduces the Tarantino trait of uncomfortable scenes which are intentionally too long. The best of these features the great character actor Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blonde (Yeah, I know; he's not really blonde), torturing a police hostage for information. After slicing off his ear, Madsen douses the cop in gasoline, then continues to talk to him while holding a lit match – all the while Stealer's Wheel's 1973 hit ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" plays on the radio in the background. But before the cop can be set afire, Mr. Orange (who's passed out on the floor in the corner, due to a gunshot received during the robbery) rises to life and kills Mr. Blonde – because he's the informant.This stuff is classic Tarantino – from the non-dead body, to the classic pop/rock oldies, to the double-crosses, to the mordant, uncomfortable nature of the scene itself. He's employed these techniques for the past twenty years. This scene is the first.While the majority of the film takes place on a barren stage, if you will, I like the fact that we don't actually view the robbery take place. Why does Tarantino eliminate the apogee of the film? Because it isn't truly necessary! Much as the real heft of ""Deliverance"" takes place after the rape scene, Tarantino has given us the longest denouement in film history – everything after the opening credits! Again, think about ""Pulp Fiction."" Remember that we never see John Travolta accidentally shoot the man in the back seat of the car. We hear the gunshot, then Travolta and his cohorts spend the next fifteen minutes dealing with cleaning blood off the vehicle's interior. That's what we have here. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is about the ""clean-up,"" if you will, of a flawed heist.My favorite scene of all is the first. Remember in ""Pulp Fiction"" how audiences latched on to the humorous dialogue between Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, as they discussed what the French call a Big Mac sandwich? Same here, but even funnier. As this tableful of career criminals plans a horrible crime, they discuss the fine details of the lyrics to Vicki Lawrence's hit song, ""The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia."" Really. It's a seemingly effortless marriage of downright unpleasantness coupled with meaningless everyday conversation. We find it funny, but it's probably more realistic than screenplays in which every uttered line is pertinent to the plot. No one has perfected this technique as well as Quentin Tarantino.In fact, no one has come close to mimicking Tarantino's love for the cinema, processed and regurgitated from a unique perspective, and thrown back at us in classic film after classic film. I always claimed no one could watch a Stanley Kubrick film in the background. In other words, if a Kubrick film were on television, you were instantly drawn to it. You couldn't knit, play cards, read the paper, or think about anything else. Same is true of Tarantino. He's still one of our greatest living directors, and it's a thrill to go back and watch his very first work. That's why ""Reservoir Dogs"" is this month's Buried Treasure.",Reservoir Dogs
494,Wolf30x,Overrated,5,7 August 2001,"Now don't get me wrong, the film is alright, but its nowhere near as good as the cult following this film has makes it out to be. On the plus side, the cast is definetly great. All the principles are completely immersed in their roles, and give magnificent performances. However the directing does feel a bit amateurish at times, and the script is out and out weak. The story revolves around a botched diamond heist where the thieves involved suspect one of their own is a rat. I don't know if it was because of a small budget or just a weak script but the story doesnt come off as good as it sounds.For starters the film uses a very disjointed means of telling the story. However there's no real flow to it. Most of the movie is set in a warehouse after the robbery, with the charachters trying to figure out the snitch. You'd think the movie would build up to this fact, but it gets revealed midway through. Fair enough. In fact the part of the movie that goes into the snitch's story is probably the best part. So you'd think there'd be some really big conclusion instead, right? Not really. This film has got to have one of the weakest most abrubpt endings I've ever seen. Hell they never even actually show the robbery, which sounds interesting and is something i would have like to have seen as a viewer, but instead its only referred to. So, if you're really big on violent crime films, fine. Go ahead and give it a go, but be warned, its nothing compared to the work of, say, Guy Ritchie. And if you're just seeing this movie to find out what all the buzz is about, you're going to be really dissappointed. Go rent something like Jackie Brown or Snatch instead.",Reservoir Dogs

The action has a realistic brutality to it which causes audiences to cringe and it has the best soundtrack a film has ever had. The cast is the stuff of indie film legend. Keitel, Madsen, Buscemi and Roth. Madsen shines above all these others due to his performance and the actions of his character. This film has been called overly violent but I didn't find it shocking to watch, entertaining but I grew up on Braveheart, Terminator and Pulp Fiction, three films I saw before I saw 'Reservoir Dogs'.

I watched this movie as I had been told by so many people it was a classic film that could never die and I have to say i was seriously unimpressed. I am a movie viewer who on principal will watch all of a movie and then judge it because I think its unjustified to comment if you haven't got the whole picture but it basically ended up a pointless bloodbath.I can see why this movie got its violent reputation as with all tarantinos movies yet the others such as kill bill and pulp fiction do not seem quite as pointless as this. The acting however was of a good standard but with lines like this and a story this bad you have to be fantastic to even seem OK as an actor. Tarantino himself who appeared in the movie seems to much of a wet blanket to be connected in any way to this Mafia like gang and to be honest it was obvious to me who the policeman was before you found out. I only give this movie a two as it wasn't soo bad i HAD to turn it off but it was pretty close.xxxxxxxxxx,Reservoir Dogs

It manages a balance between a detective story to find out who ratted the team out, an aftermath story of finding out who did what and what happened, a crime story with conflicting characters and a heist movie where villains (robbers) organize a heist. This film is an exciting story of betrayal and of humane trust and sadistic violence. Quentin Tarantino weaves a web of stories together to make pragmatic characters and situation where the viewer struggles with the moral choice of right and wrong. Of course, the choice is all in the audiences head where they root for morally flawed characters that are all acted with gusto by their respective actors. This story is the simplest that Tarantino has brought to screen but I enjoyed every second of its minimalist structure as it permits the viewing to become much more personal.",Reservoir Dogs

503,livstrongeva,The alienation in Reservoir Dogs,7,24 August 2013,"Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through.I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist.Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them.Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal.Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police.Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie.So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.",Reservoir Dogs
504,lukehere99,Reservoir Dogs Review,9,24 September 2013,"The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever.Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic.Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable.Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs.I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/",Reservoir Dogs

506,kheops,A lesson of cinema,10,7 December 1998,"With this movie america proves that all movies made over the Atlantic ocean are not all similar (difference between 'Independance day"", ""Men in Black"", ""Stargate"" ?) This movie is a kind of lesson of making a movie. There must be dialogues, screenplay, actors, director, music. The movie begins with dialogues came directly from a Sacha Guitry's screenplay; Who had seen ""Like a virgin"" like a pornocrat ? Who had really reasons not to give a tip ? You got them. The story is well-built, with those flashbacks and ""coups de theatre"". Sending few guys in outer space can't make a screeplay. The actors are all perfect. Tim Roth shows that he can play every kind of role (Joshua Shapira, Van Gogh, Pumpkin, Charles Ferry), idem for Harvey Keitel who plays in every kind of film, for every generation (""The piano"", ""From dusk till dawn"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Le regard d'Ulysse""), or Steve Buscemi, the actor with the most eclective filmography (""Con air"", ""Fargo"", ""The real blonde"", ""Armaggedon"", ""The big Lebowski""). Michael Madsen shows that the word of maniac or psycho is very often usurpated. Mr Blonde is the new Norman Bates. Q Tarantino the director always knows where to put the camera, to see the ""little differences"" that make the differences between the different characters. Try to listen to ""Stuck in the middle with you"" without thinking about this scene of torture. When the right song is used at the right scene, the fact is that you can't hear the music without thinking about this scene. Martin Scorsese said that ""Resevoir dogs"" is the film where the music is used by the best way. I think it sounds very good. By using the music this way you can also add ""Halloween"" and ""Sonatine"" (Takeshi Kitano). ""Reservoir dogs"" is a lesson to the new directors who try to make films. Putting music or telling ""f***"" in every sentence is not enough to make a film. This is a message to Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich.10 on 10",Reservoir Dogs
507,WordtwisterMN,"Great story, wonderful camera work.",10,4 June 2005,"I had seen this movie years ago, but forgot most of it. I'm so glad that I watched it again. Now I had the chance to really enjoy the dialog, music and camera work. The camera work impressed me the most. It was shot with a look Hitchcock could appreciate. The direction reminded me of some of the great westerns. The camera brings you into a one-on-one relationship with the actor as much as possible for a movie. The dialog is hip, very hip...and leaves the viewer laughing, frowning and in deep concern from time-to-time. This is one movie where the music does play its fair part in the movie. So many times music is just an addition to a movie, written to be a part of the movie. I'm not sure if the movie was sometimes written around a song, but the music was perfect with the crime, and or the sentence. Reservoir Dogs, over many years could become one of the top rated American films. Almost everything was perfect. However, whether on purpose, or to play with the fans; I did see the shadow of a boom microphone in a scene. I'm guessing that's what happens with perfectionists who write and direct movies. In Pulp Fiction, I saw the holes appear in the apartment room before the actual shots were fired. Not many directors and writers could let something so obvious slide by without leaving us guessing if he did this purposely. Same with Kill Bill, Tarantino allowed the parody of blood squirting from limbs. Reservoir Dogs is a beautiful movie in all aspects. Enjoy a true American story!",Reservoir Dogs
508,strangelexicon,A good work of cinema,8,4 August 2006,"I must admit that had I not been totally prepared for Quentin Tarantino's general formula for cinema, I may not have liked this movie so much. Having seen Kill Bill first, my expectations for his other movies was somewhat different and Pulp Fiction really did'nt work that well on me. With an open mind, this movie was found to be quite good, with some of the early dialog being boring and the few locations being too repetitive. However, as the movie progresses, it does slowly get better and better. The ""ear"" scene has been shot so well that it is disturbing. At this point in time, the psychology of the gangsters being analyzed wouldn't seem so original but it must have been for its time. As a low budget movie, it has been quite an achievement.",Reservoir Dogs

I didn't.The stunted, pointless dialog in the beginning of the movie made it pretentious. Tarantino refined his trademark of making ordinary, everyday speech extraordinary in Pulp Fiction. In Resevoir Dogs, it remained ordinary; painfully so.The only real trick in this movie is how Steve Buschemi didn't die from loss of blood. This was simply rediculous. He seemed to try too hard with this one. PF was simply a better movie..",Reservoir Dogs

515,ron_72180,The best crime drama ever made,10,11 April 2003,"Reservoir Dogs is an incredible start to Quentin Tarantino's career. First off a lot of people say that this movie is too bloody and too gorey. Not so. Yes there is blood and gore, but its not in excess like a lot of people think. You mention this movie and sometimes all people say is how bloody it is. This movie tells an incredible story of when the perfect plan goes bad and you dont know who you can trust. Michael Madson plays, in my opinion, one of the most sadistic characters ever. He is so arrogant, sarcastic, demented and crazy that you can't help but love him....Hence the ear scene. It's great that now people are starting to really discover this movie. It took 10 years, but hell you will not be disappointed. The acting, story, suspense, humor and twists make this movie a masterpiece. Check out the new 10th anniversary DVD set to get the real scoop on this movie. Get your fave character as the cover. It has some great behind the scenes stuff including a full view of the ear scene. This and Pulp Fiction are my favorite movies. Jackie Brown was okay, but a little to dragging for me. Hopefully the upcoming Kill Bill will get the Tarantino fans back. Check this movie out.",Reservoir Dogs

Dogs wouldn't go down as the best crime drama ever, but to me, it even beats The Godfather.Over this past year, Quentin Tarinto has become a hero of mine because of his ability at story telling through dialouge. Every critic knows that Tarintino is a God when it comes to wonderful dialouge, and Reservoir Dogs is no exception.I mean, practically the whole movie takes place in a wharehouse, minus the flashback scenes, so normally, most people would be bored with what little action is taking place. But not when Tarintino steps in.Not only was the dialouge perfect, but so was the casting. This movie will go down in history for one of the best casted films ever. Steve Buscemi, in a twisted way, was the comic relief for this highly emotionally bound movie.Roth, Keitel, Penn, and Tierney were the perfect matches for their roles. It was like Tarintino was picturing these actors in his head when writing it. But I would have to say that my favorite actor out of the bunch, and I don't think that I'm alone here, is Michael Madson. He was the only person born to play the role as Blonde.

The story is very intriguing, the narrative novel, and the acting simply brilliant. I cannot name one scene that I did not enjoy or does not work, and almost every line feels authentic and amusing. I do have one problem with the movie that the theme is somewhat ambiguous. It is not absolutely a bad thing, because you can see clearly that Tarantino sacrificed some of the possible screen time for thematic development and used it on the storytelling, which is great, and it pays off wonderfully. However, for me, I would prefer just a little bit something more out of the already amazing plot.",Reservoir Dogs

The structure seems pleasing enough, we start with the introductory scene for the characters and even spoils who is the traitor in a clever way.Each one of the characters are later re-introduced in a more detailed way, all well performed and engaging, except for Tarantino he is a bad actor.
The movie is also violent and its quite disturbing yet fun to watch.
There is also the theme of betrayal and why it's never a good idea to make bonds with you ""co-workers"" and yet its kind of inevitable, hence its the reason their plan failed.It was innovative for its time but I can not considered a masterpiece, on the other hand is one those films that you end up liking and remember why we need the support for low budget films in this era of big expensive blockbusters.",Reservoir Dogs
519,leviot,Unique and amazing movie,10,24 April 2006,"'Resevoir Dogs' is a one-of-a-kind film, which only a guy like Quentin Tarantino had the vision and guts to make, and it is, in my opinion, his best movie to date.Intense and thrilling from the first moment of the action, you find yourself in the back of a car with a man bleeding to death, being hauled away to the agreed hideout by his fellow criminal. A meticulously-planned heist just has gone awry, and someone is to blame. But who is the rat? The criminals don't even know each other's names as they all have been named in colors (Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink etc.) to protect their absolute anonymity. What will the boss have to say about this total botch-up, and how long will it take for the cops to track them down?What stands out about this movie is how straight-up and realistic it is. No cheesy banter, no makeup, no fake romances or over-hyped personalities. This film is as raw as they come. Just a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what the hell to do after their perfectly planned robbery has gone to ruin.It contains a lot of blood and gore, often too much to stomach. But it's all part of its realism. The filmmaker wants his audience to feel like they are living this story, that they are in that room with all these frantic, bloodied and bruised criminals trying to make sense of the situation. Unlike other films where you feel like you're watching someone else's life from afar, here you feel like you are there, part of this incomprehensible mess.The plot is delicious and it has no holes. The acting is so great, it will not seem like acting, but real life. A truly unique and engrossing film. Highly recommended, although not for the faint of heart.",Reservoir Dogs
520,seraf,"A Tarantino-fest of chatting, cheating, stealing, and killing",7,24 February 1999,"Tarantino's more visceral film-making ingredients are here, all pumped up to the max. Suit-and-tie baddies argue and BS each other regularly in expletive-laden conversations, with sudden outbursts of violence in between. Even in the resulting bloody mess of gunshot wounds and mutilation they still have to keep talking. Unspoken directives for them could be: talk, shoot/kill, talk, and perhaps get shot/killed in return. This kind of existence becomes almost an art form in Tarantino's hands.Overall performance can only be good with a cast like that, and this should be more than enough to make Reservoir Dogs a classic for fans of Mr. T.

524,joeydean61869,A bloody mess of a great early quintessential Quentin film,8,4 June 2008,"***1/2 out of **** starsOkay...I've been a big fan of Tarantino's work since he exploded onto the scene in the early nineties. I've watched Dogs several times and watched it again tonight on IFC with the instantaneous intention to finally review it. Not for the squeamish, this one: large pools of blood; screams of pain; a severed ear; people (cops mostly) being blasted with deafening gun shots...so how can Dogs be so darn funny with so much carnage and suffering? Well, it's what makes Tarantino so darn special; the melding of gut-busting dialogue and gore, along with the prototypical wardrobes of black and white gangsta suits. Let us not forget Quentin's love for 70s nostalgia as well, which in one case is evident in his characters parleying about bygone blacksploitation movies and television shows. And what a fantastic ingredient to use Steven Wright's dead-pan voice to introduce all those archaic B-siders on K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70s.A lot of Reservoir Dogs could be a stage production. I can easily imagine sitting front row in a playhouse watching all the actors hit their marks with precision, and hearing their voices reverberate throughout the building. Obviously, I speak of the warehouse scenes. For me, this is quite an accolade because how often can actors work so wonderfully and successfully in two different mediums with the same story? I realize that Dogs has never been made into a play, but it could be...don't you think?Only a half-wit would bitch about Tarantino's formulaic storytelling. Does every movie have to begin, then go on to the very next thing, and the very next thing, and the next, and the next? Tick tock tick tock? Zzzzzzzz. What brilliance to amalgamate past, present and future with such rotating uniqueness. Keep teaching your audience to tune-up Quentin. Nothing wrong with starting your story somewhere in the middle and going anywhere you want from there. Way to go man, is what I say.It seems as if Tarantino's career will be a bit like Kubrick's: quality instead of quantity. The bummer is having to wait for his next project, which can never come soon enough for me. What I love most about Q is his obvious great love for film-making. He seemingly has a child-like enthusiasm for the creative process, and his love for simply viewing movies, let along making them, is very evident.Keep making movies as if you're watching them for $9.50 like most of us Quentin. If you do, you'll always have an audience that is just as excited about your stories as you are!",Reservoir Dogs
525,d-christianson-1,Far too self-indulgent,6,23 March 2012,"Tarantino movies hit the world by storm. Watch them again and you'll start to ask ""why?"". His pan-around-the-table scenes where everyone is making a case for some silly argument, (whether it be foot rubbing or Madonna's 'Like a Virgin') that is supposed to have rich, deeper meaning, is just boring, dry and plain dumb. At least in Pulp Fiction this was somewhat related to the story, in RD, it's nothing but filler. I found it less than humorous. Over-the-top violence and black humor are now so common, seeing this in any movie seems like a cheap trick. RD with the famous Mr. Blonde dance is just screaming ""look at me and how sick I am"" and has the subtlety of a sledge-hammer. The plot falls apart near the end as you think to yourself ""this is completely out of character"". And if you've seen any Tarantino movie, you know how this one ends. If you like his work, more power to you. His style had an impact 15 years ago, and Pulp Fiction was enough. It's time to stop relying on hard violence, over-indulgence, and brainless dialog.",Reservoir Dogs
526,sadrec1,Brutal Epic Poetry,8,9 October 2006,"Quentin Tarantino is the most colorful director of his time, standing apart from the other directors of the nineties and 20-aughts. Though he is arguably a one-trick pony in some ways, (releasing almost only non-linear crime thrillers with poetic dialog and sadistic violence and gore), it has yet to fail him, and sets him on a winning streak with his first film, Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino takes a sub genre of crime films that is tried and true, the heist flick, but adds new touches to it that glow with his brilliant touch. Most heist flicks involve three distinct acts- The setup, the execution, and the fallout- but Tarantino mixes this up; he throws act two out the window completely, leaving the heist a complete mystery save one thing; we know it went horribly, killing one of the six guys and leaving another missing. Secondly, he switches back and forth from the two remaining acts; in one scene, we're with the three survivors, hearing what went wrong and witnessing the flimsy bonds of loyalty slowly unravel. The next, we see the doomed heist come together, watching the characters talk about their plans and joke with one another. These are some of the best scenes in the movie; Quentin is a master at dialog, giving his characters profane poetry exchange in a Shakesperean fashion. Watching grown men sitting around the table talking about top-40 Maddonna, arguing about tipping or pseudonyms, and describing humorous anecdotes from previous jobs is delightful. It really gives a chance for the actors to shine. Steve Buscemi, my perennial favorite, Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth in particular are incredible, and Chris Penn proves that the acting gene didn't just get passed to Sean.You have to see Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the best movies by one of the best directors of the 90s.",Reservoir Dogs

528,StayPuft003,Five Reasons.,9,30 May 2006,"Five Reasons why Reservoir Dogs is an AMAZING film (In no particular order): 1. The Opening Scene- The opening scene to this movie is one of the most memorable movie scenes in a long time. It really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but it draws you in and you can tell this movie is going to be different.2. The Music- From the opening credits to the end credits, the music sets the tone for the film like almost no other movie can do. Tarantino really knows his music and this is no exception.3. The characters- The characters are original and entertaining, each in their own different way, no matter how little screen time they get. They develop well over the story, and their relationships with each other are authentic and wonderful 4. The inter-splicing of scenes- This was one of the first films to not be shown in chronological order and it works perfectly. You don't understand the characters at first, you don't really feel for them, but as you learn their stories you care for them and understand their objectives. It also changes the tone of the movie quickly without seeming forced. If told in chronological order, it would not be nearly as good as it is in it's final cut.5. The final scene- The Mexican Standoff is thrilling and kind of humorous at the same time. It was a great way to wrap up a movie, and the dialogue is great. Also, you can feel the tension and you are thrown out of your seat at the resolution.So basically, this movie has very few flaws, and I recommend it to anybody who likes an enjoyable crime film.",Reservoir Dogs
529,MadeOfScars,"Not what I expected, but still good.",9,1 September 2006,"With all the hype that I heard about this movie I was actually expecting it to be a little better. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good movie, but I was let down a little because everyone said that was this really awesome movie and it just wasn't the best thing I've ever seen. It's a pretty funny movie, and anybody who watches it will have a good laugh. It blends comedy and drama together very well in my opinion. Here's my take on the ""bad guys"": Mr. Blonde: The homicidal maniac of the bunch. This is one of the craziest dudes I've seen in a movie in a long time. He loves to torture people just for the sheer fun of it. This guy has a few screws loose in his head. Overall, a well played character, but I just do not like Michael Madsen.Mr. White: The father figure of the group. He tries to take care of everyone, and he's the only compassionate one of the bunch. He seems a little out of place with all these killers, but his role does fit very nicely with the plot of the movie. Nice job casting Keitel.Mr. Orange: The young ""innocent"" guy of the group. He's very inexperienced (of course) when it comes to this robbery business. He comes off like the whole deer caught in the headlights when everything goes down. Tim Roth does an excellent job playing the scared, innocent kid.Mr. Pink: The paranoid schizo of the group. When everything goes down, he's the one trying to figure out how to save his own skin. He seems like he would be the guy you always see blabbering about the whole government conspiracy stuff. He's the first one to talk about a setup, because that's just how his paranoid mind works. Personally, he's my favorite character in the movie, and Buscemi played the part to perfection.Mr. Brown: Pretty much just a filler character. His character is never fully developed and he doesn't play a very big role in the film at all. He does have that hilarious ""Like A Virgin"" scene though, which had me laughing so hard it hurt. Tarantino plays this guy and it fits pretty well.Mr. Blue: Another filler character. I can't really say anything about this guy because he only has like 2 lines in the whole film.All in all, this was a pretty good film. If they had stretched the time a little longer and developed some of the characters a little more then this would have been an excellent film. There were just too many characters who didn't play any kind of significant role in the film. Other than that, it was a good movie, worth a 9/10.",Reservoir Dogs

532,sideburnmikeguitar,A study in style over substance,6,13 July 2007,"This is probably Quentin's best movie of the ones I've seen simply because it IS so stylized. However, beyond that this is nothing to hold it up. I don't care how great the acting is, there's just no real plot. OK, there is a plot but it's totally beside the point.There's a heist that involves a group of criminals who have to split up and meet up later. An undercover cop who is in on the heist watches as another cop gets tortured. Tempers flare amongst the criminals and one gets shot. Despite being criminals and not really knowing each other, some show loyalty. That's pretty much it.Some friends have told me that I missed the part in the end where you hear the cops show up and gun some of the criminals down. That doesn't change much. I'm not compelled in any way to really care for any of the characters. There's not really any background on any of them. There's no substance. It's all one-dimensional even down to the stupid ""mr. pink"" ""mr. white"" names they're given. Twelve Angry Men is an awesome film that does the opposite of this and uses pretty much one boring room as the entire setting. Yet it's interesting because the plot is good and it's all about the characters. Breakfast Club is a totally different film that does the same. Both make more lasting statements than are made here. The most memorable of which deals with lyrics from a Madonna song and Michael Madsen's almost comical ""Are you gonna bark all day...?"" ooh i'm a bad-ass line.No one will ever make a movie that can beat Tombstone in that category. And yeah that movie is all style, but there's still a story to it. The characters resemble people.The fact is that Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen and most of the rest are all great actors. They all play their parts well and exhibit that one ""color"" as it were. There are some cool lines here and there. The music is great. The violence is sort of inventive (using the old trick of letting your imagination fill in the blanks IS brilliant). The rest of it is...well I don't see anything going on.

Because it's probably one of the best films of all time. It's one of those films that is just perfect. The casting, the score, the editing...In general everything.First let's start with the casting. Everyone embodies their characters so well that it's kind of hard to think of the actors without thinking about their roles. Harvey Keitel is great as always. He plays the honorable Mr. White. Then there's Steve Buscemi's Mr. Pink, who is always a professional and doesn't believe in tipping waitresses.There's also Michael Madsen as the psychotic Mr. Blonde, and Tim Roth as the quiet and mysterious Mr. Orange. Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Eddie Bunker and Q.T. himself, also give great performances as part of this ensemble cast.The music is amazing and it fits the film perfectly. I mean who doesn't remember Little Green Bag from the infamous opening sequence.Q.T. is one of those natural talents. Even without going to film school he delivers an amazing film. What I love about this movie is that it's so complex and yet it's so simple. It's a low budget film, but the audience barely notices that because Tarantino makes the film play out like a big blockbuster. He spends every penny well getting just the right footage. He makes the characters appear larger than life.I think aspiring filmmakers out there who can't afford to go out to college to study film should take Quentin Tarantino as an example that you don't need to go to a fancy school to do what you love.",Reservoir Dogs

A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie.

536,Sickfrog,The Purest Evil,10,14 August 1998,"Quentin Tarantino proved his cinematic genius to the entire film industry with the revolutionary Pulp Fiction. Yet, several years before that, he burst onto the scene with this film, with just as masterful a showcase of solid, colorful ensembles of characters, dramatic empathy for usually unsympathetic archetypes and gory violence subdued and made watchable by mixing a sadistic sense of humor and style into the mix. Michael Madsen delivers one of the most frightening performances ever seen in modern cinema as Mr. Blonde, a devil-may-care sociopath. After watching his most graphic scene, you will never be able to listen to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" in the same way again. Also, Havey Kietel and Tim Roth give the film its most touching edge, as Kietel's Mr. White develops a very paternal relationship to the mortally-wounded Mr. Orange, creating a trust and honor to protect him at any cost, which is just what he is challenged with. The cast is rounded out with equally remarkable performance by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Laurence Tierney as this drama eventually hits a crucial peak, leaving you with a climax that won't soon be forgotten, even when listening to the spookily sedate Harry Nillson song ""Coconut"" as the credits roll.",Reservoir Dogs

He manages to make the most violent scenes humorous, somehow.  For example, the opening scene at the restaurant was brilliant and witty, then it goes(SPOILERS) right into the scene where Orange is bleeding in the back of Mr.White's car.

It is shocking, powerful, and very riveting with excellent acting, sharp dialouge, cool pop culture references. Tarantino could not have kicked his career off with a better film. It is a very violent and offbeat movie, however, anyone that has even the slightest interest in, not only crime movies, but in action/drama fans should definitley check this out.

544,Will3451,Million times better than the Bollywood copy Kaante (2002),9,21 May 2010,"I saw the Bollywood copy years before I saw the original because I am from Pakistan and in my region Bollywood movies are more famous and popular but I always admired movies from Hollywood and other movie industries more than Bollywood movies because I always admire good movies. I am watching movies from Hollywood and other movie industries since my childhood but much less than Bollywood movies but in last 2 3 years my love towards movies from Hollywood and other movie industries just skyrocketed and I now watch lots of movies from Hollywood and other movie industries and very few Bollywood movies.In that process I saw many movies that Bollywood copied from other movie industries and Reservoir Dogs is one of them.Unless you consider adding songs and other Bollywood garbage big difference, Kaante is a complete copy of Reservoir Dogs even some dialogues and scenes are just translated including the scene when Mr. White argues Mr. Blonde about why he started shooting everybody during the robbery. Creators of Kaante added some additional scenes so they can say that their movie is not a copy, those scenes include a scene at the beginning of the movie when main characters meet at a jail and start planning a robbery because they are so angry at the police, this is also a copied scene and copied from The Usual Suspects. Another additional scene feature the robbery scene but the robbery is a complete reenactment of the conversations between the main characters of Reservoir Dogs about the robbery. For the record, I used the word 'copy' rather than 'remake' because the creators of Kaante never admit that their movie is a remake of Reservoir Dogs they just quietly copied it.Now about the original movie. Its just great, despite the fact I already knew many things about this movie including the ending because I saw the Bollywood copy before I saw Reservoir Dogs I still loved this movie. Direction is brilliant, screenplay is just great the way the movie paced towards the end is just awesome, it like watching a 99 min movie in just 30 min. Every actor did a splendid job, all of them did their part perfectly, too bad they didn't got the recognition they deserved many of them are still underrated, the movie itself didn't got the recognition it deserved from awards jury.",Reservoir Dogs

546,deus12ex,It's a dog eat dog world out there... (etc.),9,24 September 2003,"It's obvious from the opening conversation on reasons why not to tip and the meaning of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' that Reservoir Dogs tries to be different. To begin, it doesn't fit the expected narrative structure. Instead of the usual 10 minute robbery at the end of the movie after various stages of planning, the entire running time is centered around the surrounding hours of the heist - with only flashbacks giving any information of the characters lives before. The dialogue is refreshingly different, often hilarious. Even if there is a heavy reliance on taboo. The film is cool. Very cool (unlike that cliched pause just now). The crooks are smartly dressed in suits and walk down the street to 'Little Green Bag' in what is the most stylish strut in cinema history. Other sophisticated attributes are the aliases given to the crooks, which each resemble a colour instead of revealing their own names. It leaves the impression that they don't trust each other, which they don't. So not surprisingly violence is a key theme. Claret is present in almost every scene. Whether it's Tim Roth losing several pints of blood or Micheal Madsen amputating a cop's ear in a torture session to the tune of 'Stuck in the middle with you' ( a powerful juxtaposition of a feel-good music with stomach-churning knife work) . The acting is generally good, especially from Madsen as the psycho 'Mr Blonde' who has a dominating screen presence in every scene he's in. The only flaw is a rather basic screenplay, which has an over reliance on dialogue. The concept isn't entirely original either, the plot and several scenes are borrowed from the Hong Kong film 'City on Fire' which was released much earlier. Despite this, the film remains an impressive and refreshing debut of a quality seldom encountered.",Reservoir Dogs
547,stratsz28,"Emotionally charged, superb acting, too much dialogue.",7,13 May 2004,"Although written before Tarantino's other blockbusters, I saw this movie after seeing the Kill Bills, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown.  I was disappointed; this movie is clearly inferior to all the aforementioned titles.The acting was superb, and the actors really breathed life into the hackneyed dialogue and saved an otherwise mediocre movie.  Tarantino's other scripts are wittier and sharper.  If you are looking for a riveting tale of distrust and greed, watch this movie.  If you are hoping for clever dialogue and moments of comic relief, you won't find them in Reservoir Dogs.The emotion of the movie builds in a void of real action.  Depending on your taste in movies, the excessive dialogue may bore you at times.  One of the classic rules of a screenplay is to show what happened rather than having characters describe it.  Consider Tarantino a rule-breaker in that respect.The overall story, characters, set designs, etc. are simpler than other Tarantino movies I have seen.  Compared to the standard Hollywood crime drama, this movie fares well, but certainly should not be considered a classic.  Rent the Usual Suspects or LA Confidential instead.  I give it a 5 on the Tarantino scale and a 7 for my IMDB score.",Reservoir Dogs

I had said not very good things about ""Kill Bill"" but compared to this, that's a great film!By what it seemed to me, i should give it an 0/10. However there are two reasons why I give it a 2. One point is thanks to the first scene, a conversation about the connotation of ""Like a virgin"". The other is the scene where Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde?) is torturing a guy. He makes it very funnily.For the rest, I have no desire now to watch ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""Jackie Brown"" and when needing action, I'll just pick a John Woo film, or simply watch ""Mean Guns"" again (years go by, and it's still my favourite American action film)2/10",Reservoir Dogs
549,walion,A crime classic? Very doubtful.,7,12 April 2016,"I clicked the play button with huge expectations for this movie, alas 'Reservoir Dogs' did not show any evidence of being a classic one admired by most of the critics. The much-loved Quentin Tarantino impressed with his first work, which definitely shouldn't be considered as one of the best crime thrillers of all time. It would be a big mistake to think of it as one.'Reservoir Dogs' follows the story of a newly formed crew that has the simple, yet dangerous job, which eventually would go terribly wrong - a diamond robbery. The intriguing thing is that the 6 members (1 of them is an undercover cop) of the crew do not know anything about each other, and are given new names by the guy who hired them - Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). The movie starts with a conversation between the members of the crew that of course has nothing to do with the film plot itself, reminiscent of a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in 'Pulp Fiction'. During the robbery (which is just described), when the alarm goes off, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) starts shooting at everyone like a psycho. That's the moment when the police officers arrive and things go nasty very quickly. The criminals should gather in a barn after the jewelry heist. Unfortunately there's only 5 left of them, the other 2 are shot dead.The best thing of this movie was definitely the acting of Steve Buscemi. In the role of Mr. Pink. Steve shows that he has the ability to give the needed color to a movie with his unique acting.",Reservoir Dogs
550,maniepranav,"A great debut, but not a classic.",9,13 August 2019,"I watched Reservoir Dogs only recently, while having matches everything else except Jackie Brown. It is a great film, not one of Tarantino's best, or the best of all time, but still worth spending time on it.The acting is top notch. Harvey Keitel was the best among the five, with a compassionate layer underneath the professional criminal experience that he obviously has. Steve Buscemi was also fabulous. Camerawork was very solid, and I love how most of the movie centers on there being a long-drawn Mexican standoff of sorts. The cross-blaming, self-doubting progresses the plot forwards very well, and the pacing is done really well. The movie has a perfect length.However, this film does have flaws. The dialogue, while in much of the movie very stylish, sometimes feels hammy. QT could have done away with many lines, because a lot of it was telling us the same thing again and again. Of course, that has its own context, but it feels too much. The dialogue style is a precursor to how Pulp Fiction would be structured (a movie that, like most people, i consider one of the best ever made). But, even when the gangsters are talking about Pam Grier, it feels much inferior to the whole legendary Quarter-Pounder conversation in the first scene in Pulp Fiction, and underwhelming in general. The flashbacks were not all effective either, especially the one for Mr Blonde.Granted, it was QT's debut, so it would be a little immature and excessive. It also serves as a great story about trust and compassion, because you're hooked to the end. When the end comes, you will be in disbelief, as to ""Why did he say that?"" But, it will make sense eventually. It warrants a watch for sure, if you want to know how it all started, especially since it was an indie film.",Reservoir Dogs
551,Brooklyn-10,Tarantino's Best,10,4 October 1999,"Tarantino's best and most inspired work. I was unprepared for the pure impact of this movie, although the opening diner-table dialogue between all members of the cast marked it immediately as a Tarantino film. No one shows us that ""crooks are people too"" the way he does, yet he will follow with scenes of such crushing brutality that we once again remember the differences between the good guys and the bad guys. His colorful characters- Mr. White (with the ""cool-sounding name), Mr. Orange, psychotic Mr. Blonde, and feisty Mr. Pink interact with a variety of personality clashes that produce some outstanding scenes. No one character is the star, they all play tug-o-war for our attention. A lack of musical score lends a gritty, realistic, ""Cops""-like feel to the interspersed action sequences- quite unusual, and a welcome change from the orchestral bombardment present in other movies during shootouts, car chases, etc. The crime that is the center of the plot is never shown, therefore the viewer uses his or her imagination and stories from each individual character as they tell it to piece together what took place in the jewelry store. Quite a lot of blood flows in the course of the movie, but it is never gratuitous nor glorified. Oscar-worthy performances abound, most especially from greviously wounded Tim Roth and nervously intense Steve Buscemi. Some wonderful twists and a stunning ending make this movie what is sure to be known as one of the classics of the 1990's.",Reservoir Dogs
552,Fractalizer,Tarantino's Roughest,8,19 March 2002,"(Might contain minor spoilers.)Like many people I saw Reservoir Dogs shortly after I had seen Pulp Fiction (""wow, that was great, what else is there by this guy?""). I remember I found it comparatively weak, but I guess after Pulp Fiction I was just wasn't prepared for Reservoir Dogs' grittiness and simpler plot and didn't realize how great it actually was.Now, after a second viewing I think I can fully appreciate this film. I still like Pulp Fiction better (and also Jackie Brown, incidentally), but Reservoir Dogs is a totally amazing first film by a genius director.One of its most interesting aspects is, I think, the dense atmosphere Tarantino creates here. When Pink and White were evaluating their situation shortly after the heist I found the sense of uncertainty and threat so tangible and their decision to actually _stay_ in that warehouse so unbearable that _I_ almost wanted to leave the room so that at least _someone_ would be getting away from that place...This atmosphere for the largest part is created by the excellent acting and the well-written dialog. Tarantino can write at least as good as he can direct and his films always have the cast to deliver his lines perfectly.With these ingredients you would probably have a decent movie already but then Tarantino's clever narrative comes into play. The way it switches from right before the heist to immediately after (interrupted by the opening credits) is just the perfect start for this film. The blanks (the heist itself) are filled in gradually throughout the film by flashback sequences, and there is another level of flashbacks that introduce the main characters to us and give us some insight into the planning of the job. This works so wonderfully that you can only marvel at the screen in awe.Bottom line: Doesn't quite reach the perfection that Pulp Fiction is and doesn't have the style and class of Jackie Brown - but still a 9/10.",Reservoir Dogs

This is very rare to see in a movie, even in massively popular and critically acclaimed movies like The Godfather and Shawshank, there will be some unnecessary scenes. I did not find that to be the case in this movie as every scene adds creative and structural dialogue to the entire plot of the story. The only complaint I have is that some of the acting seemed a bit weak, but in the case that happened in, it was very insignificant. Overall, great movie.",Reservoir Dogs
554,Veteransson,An incredible debut from Tarantino,8,12 January 2017,"Quentin Tarantino did not miss his debut with this one. He wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs which premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. A lot of great movies have premiered at this festival but 'Dogs' will probably remain the most famous passage. Although, 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Memento' are better movies, in my opinion. 'Reservoir Dogs' stars the great Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself.The cast is simply terrific, everyone is great in this movie. This is of course partly due to the many talents in the cast but also because of the great dialogue and characters. Michael Madsen's character in particular will stay with you forever. The 'Stuck In The Middle With You' scene is brilliant and horrific. Tarantino is at this day still a controversial director, and it all started with this movie and this scene. It's a shame that the violence gets so much attention in Tarantino's movies, because it shouldn't. The violence serves the story, and is in fact essential to the movie. Reservoir Dogs is a crime movie but isn't your average crime movie. The opening scene is a banal, but funny dialogue between the 'Reservoir Dogs'. It sets up the characters brilliantly and shows that the movie is going to be entirely different from what you might expect to get out of a crime movie. Dialogue is the core of every Tarantino movie. In 'Dogs' this becomes clear right from the start. The dialogue in this movie is however not the best Tarantino has written. Great dialogue builds character or introduces characters, serves the plot, is interesting, and does this without being straightforward. Every line of dialogue in this movie was interesting, it always is with Tarantino. But sometimes it didn't serve the plot and merely confirmed what we already knew about the characters. But of course, it was still interesting, entertaining and incredibly funny.'Reservoir Dogs' deserves to be called a classic. Tarantino's debut was so innovative to the movie industry that it will remain a classic forever. Reservoir Dogs will never cease to be relevant. Tarantino's potential is shown in every aspect of the movie. He was however not yet the film maker he is today, in my opinion. The bar scene in 'Inglorious Bastards' is one of the smartest scenes he has ever written. The level of suspense of opening (milk) scene of that movie hasn't been matched very often in movie history. In my opinion 'Pulp Fiction' is still his best and even though 'Reservoir Dogs' is absolutely great and innovative, I don't give this one a higher rating because there was still room for progress, in Tarantino's standards. In his next movies he achieved this progress.",Reservoir Dogs

559,Mr. Film,A Waste of Skill,5,19 May 1999,"Many people believe ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film. It is not. Tarantino failed to make it into anything but violence and the combination of music and camera-work. The screenplay was poor, but the lines, or at least the way they were written, were convincing. This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and I use the word ""redeeming"" loosely about movies. Without a doubt, many movies are about nothing and are good. ""Dogs"" is about a group of men who messed up a bank robbery and went to a warehouse to talk about things and get very angry at each other.Many find the movie hip, but at best the movie itself is not hip, the pitiful characters may seem to be, but really the only hip character is Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel.

The fact that it was a cheap film with little action yet, on the back of slick dialogue with a slick delivery from all actors concerned, it managed to entertain and fascinate you the whole way through, created a whole new rash of imitators and dreamers.  Now, like horror is compared to Stephen King and fantasy to Lord of the Rings, popular crime is compared to this movie and all Tarantino offerings.The story is revealed perfectly with characters introduced quickly but fleshed out with masterly timing (Tim Roth's story set-up is priceless). Personally, I love Steve Buscemi and can't help but compare his every performance to this one (""I don't want to be Mr Pink!"") and Harvey Keitel's role must have been directly written for him, it fit so well.10 out of 10...easily.",Reservoir Dogs
561,Duck_of_Death23,Hidden Agenda,10,31 May 2001,"Talk about violence. This film has plenty of it. Most of the killing in Reservoir Dogs can be easily avoided but isn't. The male ego takes over here as all of the characters have their own hidden agenda. For example: Mr. White: Save Mr. Orange. Mr. Blonde: Kill as many people as possible. Mr. Orange: Not bleed to death. The only one of the thieves who doesn't really have an agenda except survive is Mr. Pink, the only character who is professional. As history has taught us, people are willing to die for things that they believe in. The things they believe in may be void or completely irrelevant to the mission at hand. The film is more of a satire than anything, of this nature because everything that happens in terms of tragedy was avoidable as easy as looking in the other direction and dropping these agendas for something more important. Quentin Tarantino makes movies that are a landmark to modern day cinema. With all this death, it appears the main reason he made it was to kill people. The way the characters talk is as if they were actual people in a conversation. I laugh at many of the jokes they tell. I like the suits they wear as well as the story-line because it never really shows the robbery, and as we learn throughout the movie, the chaos in the store may have in fact been more intense than originally thought. I can't wait to buy the action figures, especially the Marvin Nash torture play-set with the removable ear. That brings me to the movies most controversial scene: Stuck In The Middle With You. The most chilling person in this movie is Mr. Blonde played masterfully as Michael Madsen. The scene with him and the cop is disturbing and at the same time politically incorrect (You don't torture people for fun). An obvious versatile actor, Michael Madsen went from this movie to Free Willy. Wow, his career really soared. One minute he's mass murdering a jewelry store.

565,ehol,"pushy, manipulative, annoying, offensive",2,10 March 2003,"I'll give the director this much: few films have ever gotten me thinking so much about why I dislike them.  Actually, I would have just walked out on the thing and be done with it, but the movie's undeserved reputation caused me to wonder if I'd missed something in my rush to judgement (and, not coincidentally, to the exit).  I suspect I didn't miss much.  There's a lot to dislike about ""Reservoir Dogs"".  The film's violence is legendary, as is its potty-mouthed dialog, but neither of those are necessarily bad things in a movie. 
No, what's unforgivable in this movie is the way the director revels in his ability to offend the viewer.  The stage is set in the diner scene, as the cast takes turns mouthing cleverly-scripted yet coldly unfunny trash talk, and by all accounts reaches its climax in the bloody scene that finally got me to walk out of the theater, 20 minutes after I first felt the urge. 
But never mind the blood and guts--though one suspects that if Tarantino had directed ""Fargo,"" it would consist of little more than shots of the woodchipper in use.  The diner scene pretty much spells out that the director's not interested in making the viewer laugh or think, but only to make him recoil.  Tarantino is undoubtedly skilled at this, but it's not the sort of reaction I'm willing to pay to experience, as one gets enough of that for free these days.",Reservoir Dogs
566,stevedorsett,Quality little film,8,21 November 2001,"This is a nasty violent little gem.  Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is about a group of gangsters after a jewellery heist gone wrong, and the events surrounding them within the following hours.  The plot isn't as important as the relationship between the characters and the trust and dis-trust being built in their minds.The acting is superb.  Remember that this was Tarantino's first flick and look at the cast list: Kietel, Madsen, Penn, Buscemi, Roth.  Those are some damn impressive names.  The violence is nasty, but it is in keeping with the style and spirit of the movie.Where the movie lets itself down is in the pacing.  The script follows the stories of a few of the leads and shows how they inter-connect.  This is done to a much better effect in his follow up Pulp Fiction.  Here, however, it drags the movie in places.  The Mr. Blonde story is excellent, whereas the Mr. Orange story that follows it, kicking in about 2/3 of the way through the film, really slows it down and loses the audience attention.Overall though this is a good movie, really for the guys.

I really love how he writes long and tension rising scenes with great, humorous dialogs and confab. The way he tells the story, the way he grabs the audience impresses me so much. And I think he's a great role model as a contrary filmmaker in Hollywood; the way he handles slang speech, tension and violence is brilliant!In this movie, Tarantino tells the story of 6 men, ""reservoir dogs"" and how they end up in a terrible situation after an attempt for robbery. The story is easy, characters are kind of easy (they only have color nicknames), but the way the story is told is brilliant.

I find it hard to explain, but this movie defines some of the super-violent crime thrillers we see today. Each character is well- developed and causes me to be emotionally attached. Each character is set to act in a certain way that inevitably leads to conflict. Those who see will understand that statement. Here are some pros and cons (the cons do not apply to myself because I don't see them as such). Pros: 1. Symbolic (again, hard for me to explain but those who watch intently will pick it up) 2.

571,hollywood2k2,"Madonna, guns, blood, and gems",10,26 March 2000,"Some people say ""Reservoir Dogs"" was too violent, offensive, and crude. But others say because of the fact that this movie is violent, offensive, and crude makes it one of the greatest movies of all time. I fall in the later of the two groups.The smart moviegoers make reference to ""City on Fire"" and how ""Reservoir Dogs"" either resembles, borrows, or rips off from. I don't doubt this but I hadn't heard of ""City on Fire"" until ""Dogs"" made it big so Lamb better be kissing Tarantino's shoes for making him a hit. I'm sure Lamb is a good director but not too many American film buffs are familiar with the Hong Kong action genre. The majority of America's insight on HK movies go as far as John Woo's ""Face/Off"" and maybe Chow Yun-Fat because of ""The Replacement Killers"" and now Jet Li because of ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Lethal Weapon 4"". I'm a big fan of all three men's work but I'm also a big fan of Tarantino's work.Bottom line: Give QT the credit he deserves. Maybe his movie resembles Lamb's but does that mean that these two movies are the only one's with: diamond heists, Mexican standoffs, undercover cops, and guns? So maybe the storylines are similar but Lamb lacks in one area, he's not Tarantino.""Reservoir Dogs"" works not just because of the story but because of a lot of other elements. Each and every character in this movie has style (even Mr. Blue who had no more than 5 lines) and they all work off each other. What makes this movie great isn't the story but the character's and what they have to say. From Mr. Brown's ""Like A Virgin"" speech to Mr. White's ""Let's get a taco"" diatribe there's nothing but witty lines and it's this wit that made Tarantino a star.Was this movie too violent, offensive, and crude? HELL YEAH! But isn't that what Tarantino wanted? He wanted us to be shocked, disgusted, and offended because it made the movie memorable. You may hate this movie but you'll never forget Mr. Blonde hacking off Marvin Nash's ear. There are critics out there who say Tarantino's a racist because he uses the word ""nigger"". So does that make Blacks racist because they call each other that? They'll say no because it's just an expression to them and the same is true with OT. Tarantino grew up around Black people and watching Black based movies, one of his favorite actresses is Pam Grier, does that make him a racist? So if you were squeamish by the blood, offended by the words than you just proved that Tarantino's a great writer and movie maker.",Reservoir Dogs

Everyone always talks about how its such a classic, and how ""Tarantino is the voice of our generation"". The plot is about a bunch of thieves with code names who are trying to rob a bank, and one of the crew happens to be a cop. In usual Tarantino fashion, he dices the film up into different parts - first is the end, and so on. He cuts it up so you don't actually see the robbery. Really annoying. The script is constant swearing. Really nothing more. The cast leaves some to be desired. Michael Madsen makes me want to hit myself in the face constantly. The ear cutting scene was a letdown. Tarantino can't act, he should of stayed behind the camera. Pulp fiction had a slightly better cast (Willis, Jackson, Travolta), but an equally horrible script. This movie looks like it was made on virtually no money. There are only 3 major sets, and a few other places on the movie. A giant warehouse were a good chunk of the movie is spent, along with the diner, and a car. In the end, I was not impressed. With all the hype and hoopla around this movie, one would think it would be better. This is not the case. Avoid this movie at all costs.",Reservoir Dogs

Reservoir Dogs is one of the most-surprising films that I ever saw. All the movie's turnarounds (is there anyone?) are unexpected and brilliant. The performances are unforgettable, with under-rated actors. The soundtrack is amazing, with the ""K-Billy Supersounds of the 70's"" and some Tarantino's personal picks. I can't see a mistake in this movie, and it's just a matter of time for it to become a classic. If you have a weak stomach fast-forward the ear-cutting scene, even though its camera movements are brilliant. Perhaps the greatest movie since Blade Runner.",Reservoir Dogs

580,bigplatts,A modern gangster classic,9,26 June 2011,"Quentin Tarantino's first movie before he gained fame with pulp fiction, reservoir dogs is about a gang of criminals hired to do a simple robbery.The story is told in out of order scenes that show the events leading up to the heist and the things that happen after. The characters use colours instead of names so no one can rat them to the cops, and the entire cast give career-top performances. Harvey Keitel takes the lead as Mr.White and is in my opinion the best performance of his career, Tim Roth plays Mr.Orange in one of his earliest roles, playing the young member of the crew doing one of his first jobs. While Micheal Madsen plays the psycho Mr.Blonde in another top role. Other performances include Chris Penn and Tarantino himself. The story moves a lot quicker than other Tarantino work, while keeping all of his trademarks like a great 70s inspired soundtrack and chunky well written dialogue that moves the plot along. Overall Reservoir dogs isn't QT's best movie but is still a brilliantly fun crime movie that has became one of the most iconic and quotable films of the 90s. Its features tons of famous scenes that became huge in pop culture including Micheal Madsen's controversial scene with a policeman.I'd definitely recommend.",Reservoir Dogs

The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool ""Super sounds of the 70's"" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie ""Little Green Bag"" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end.

582,Shnorg2342,Reservoir Dogs- My favorite Tarantino movie,10,24 November 2019,"Reservoir Dogs is one of the coolest films ever made, along with being one of the best thrillers ever made. The film is about the aftermath of a failed diamond heist. None of the robbers no each other true identity, as they were given color code names, and they suspect that one of them is an undercover police officer. There many interesting players in the game, Mr. Pink, the level headed professional who is all to vocal in his lack of care for others, Mr. Orange, a newcomer who's been shot it the stomach, Mr. Blonde, a man who seemed on the level until he started murdering in cold blood and cutting of people's ears, Nice guy Eddie, who's father orchestrated the heist, and Joe Cabbot, who planned the heist and is Eddie's father, and Marvin Nash, a cop who has been kidnapped by mister blonde. Pink, Orange, White, Blonde, and Eddie are basically stuck in an abandoned wearhouse, which served as there meetup point. Tensions are high, and it doesn't help that Mr. Orange was shot in the stomach prior to arriving at the wearhouse, and is currently bleeding to death in the floor. Mr. Pink claims to have gotten the diamonds, and says he stashed them at a nearby location. Mr. White and Eddie follow, Leaving Mr. Blonde in charge of keeping an eye on Mr. Orange and Marvin, the cop. Mr. Blonde decides that torturing the police officer would be much more entertaining than just sitting there, so he turns on the radio, does a little jig, and begins to cut up his face with a razor. He eventually cuts of the officer's ear. He then attempts to burn the cop alive, but is stopped by Orange's 9mm. It is then revealed that Orange was the undercover cop all along. Oranges back story of how he infiltrated the organization, leading up to the robbery, and then the immediate aftermath of the robbery are shown to us via flashback. It is during this that we experience one of Tarantino's most well crafted scenes. Mr. Orange, or Freddy Neundyke, is preparing to go undercover. His handler is teaching him an anecdote that the criminals will enjoy hearing about. Freddy/Orange goes from learning the story, to telling the story, to living the story while narrating it. The film ends when Pink, White, and Eddie come back with the diamonds, and Joe shows up, a bit annoyed with the situation. Joe announces that he is going to kill Orange, because he believes him to be the rat, even though he has no evidence. He justifies it with instinct. Mr. White points his gun at Joe, stating that if he shoots Orange, he'll die next. Eddie, frustrates with White's threats against his father, points his revolver at White. During this tense Mexican standoff, Pink is hiding in the corner with the diamonds. If these people want to shoot each other, fine, but I'm keeping my money. Joe starts off the dominos of death by shooting orange. Joe is then shot by White, who is in turn shot by Eddie, who is in turn shot by White. It turns out both White and Orange survived. Out of a sense of obligation, Freddy reveals to White that he was the undercover cop all along. This moment is especially tragic, considering that White has been a father figure for Orange throughout this whole ordeal, going so far as to take a bullet for him. It is then that Pink scampers off like the rodent he is. The movie ends on a cliff hanger, with it being implied that White killed Orange and was then killed by police officers, but the camera zooms in so far we never actually see any of this. This movie is very clearly inspired by French crime films, most notably the ones by Jean-Luc Goddard, and Hong Kong action films, most notably City on Fire. One thing I noticed is that the camera is almost always handheld in this movie. I believe this was done to add a sense of franticness, and anxiety, and it sure accomplished that. Reservoir Dogs is a perfect thriller and a perfect film all around.",Reservoir Dogs
583,JessyCritical,Tarantino fans won't be disappointed,8,12 November 2010,"Reservoir Dogs tells the intriguing story of a handful of 'colour-coded' criminals. They're out on a job, robbing jewels and the like, when something goes wrong. It's set mainly in an empty warehouse, with 4 of the nameless criminals: Mr White, Blonde, Pink and Orange and a poor kidnapped policeman. As you will expect from a Tarantino film, it has a lot of shooting, a lot of blood and a lot of dead people. However, this shouldn't put you off. As it is only a mere 95 minutes long, it won't take up too of your day and will keep you adequately entertained. Right from the start you know it is not going to be your usual crime- thriller. Tarantino's unique direction and clever dialogue prevent this film from being forgotten once you've seen it, it will probably persuade you to give it another watch. There are some excellent performances by Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitl, Chris Penn and Tim Roth. A small part, of course, was saved for Quentin Tarantino himself. Being Tarantino's first film; it is very impressive and definitely paves the way for his future successes..Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill. There is only one thing I'm going to be critical about: the discovering of who is the undercover policeman came about too soon for my liking; it could have easily been drawn out a bit longer. However, this didn't mean I wanted to stop watching once I knew. There was still a lot more to keep me wanting to watch. The flash backs in the film gave it more depth, and saved it from being a typical linear narrative. The funny opening scene where Buscemi ""doesn't believe in tipping"" could be one of my favourites and instantly reminded me of the bar scene in Desperado, where he tells the story of a man urinating all over a bar and the barman being pleased about it. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is not my favourite Tarantino film, but it is highly entertaining and well worth watching.",Reservoir Dogs
584,wickedjazz,Mindless violence,6,17 February 2019,Tarantino could have done better. There's some heavy scenes here that were gratuitous without propelling the plot. Seemed like a reason to put A listers in a room together. Still- it's a genre I like so I watched it.,Reservoir Dogs
585,ziggystardust-88692,The foundation of Quentin Tarantino,8,19 July 2019,"So Reservoir Dogs is a heist film that is basically shot in four rooms. Who would have guessed that would be enough to show the essence of Tarantino's vision. Trademark dialogs-about-nothing, unconventional but positively engaging narration, splendid intentionally superfluous acting and unparalleled sensibility of crime aesthetics, the formula was established here, in Reservoir Dogs, and it still works, as you are quite well know. The general plot may be unoriginal but who cares when you can listen to how a bunch of daunt men discuss the meaning behind ""Like a Virgin"", how Mr. Orange retells the story of a weed, police and a toilet or how Mr. Pink haggles for another nickname. It is not even important to the plot but, well, it is *more* important than the plot. If you like Tarantino works have no doubts about this one. And if you haven't seen a single Tarantino movie... expect it to be different from what you commonly see.",Reservoir Dogs
586,V Hanna,Better Than Pulp!!,10,22 July 1999,"This movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Let's get that straight right now. I have seen it a number of times and it just keeps getting better. The story line is fresh, the casting perfect, camera shots are unique, and the sound bites original. Oh yea, the soundtrack is great too. Six guys commit a robbery and you don't even see it. You spend the whole movie watching the planning of the caper and the turmoil afterwards. Harvey Keitel may have given his best performance of his career and Steve Buscemi is a classic. In fact it's Buscemi's 'Mr. Pink' (there is a great line in response to his disapproval to the color pink) weasel character that I feel is the gasoline in the Reservoir Dogs engine. He represents the voice of reason and clear thinking on one point and sneaky and scheming on the other. Michael Madsen's 'Mr. Blonde' was made for him. Tim Roth 'Mr. Orange' has his ground breaking role (I can't say what as because it ruins part of the plot). Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney are perfect as the father son mob team. What is really great about this movie is the dialog. Some of the best ever and truly original. The dialog in Reservoir Dogs flows so smoothly and naturally that it gives a more than a movie feel to it. For example the part in the bathroom with the cops standing around talking was beautiful because that is how how cops chit chat to each other about who's butt they busted or how stupid this guy was. Tarantino even had the cops talking about it with that kind of smirky ego locker room talk. That and having Roth break in and continue his description of the story right there was great. Also, the opening scene is a bona fide classic. The Madonna speech, the discussion on tipping, everything about that was great dialog. I also love the way Madsen and Keitel go back and forth at one point in the movie (""I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan""). If you haven't seen the movie yet be prepared because it jumps around between past and present like 'Godfather 2'. But, that is also part of the genius of it. It's bloody, so if you hate violence go rent a Disney movie instead and save yourself from stopping a great movie and complaining that this is what causes violence in youths. Wrong (that's another argument I won't get into but we can't make every movie for 10 year olds and if they happen to get a hold of it where were you when they did!). Reservoir Dogs goes on the classic list. It's a top of the shelf action movie with dark comedy and great lines to boot. One word of advice to Mr. Tarantino, stop putting yourself in your movies. You are not an actor! Stick to directing where you do your best work.",Reservoir Dogs
587,dogg01,Stuck in the middle with you.,9,23 July 2000,"There are few films that have revolutionised cinema. Citizen Kane. The Godfather. Jaws. Die Hard. Reservoir Dogs. Before Reservoir Dogs came onto the scene, we were stuck with any crappy script making it's way to film within a year of it being written. The 80s were a bad time for movies. The excellence of the 70s movies(Godfather, Jaws, Apocalapse Now, Taxi Driver) had gone. Video had meant cinemas were not as popular as before. Then came one small film made an a tiny budget with no- name (except Harvey Keitel) actors, written and directed by a newcomer who had dropped out of school at 16 and worked in a video store until now. This little film was the best thing to happen in cinema for a long time. It was a simple story about a heist gone wrong. It was set in a warehouse. But it was told with a set of flashbacks to make it more complicated than that. There were pop-culture refrences throughout this film, and the acting was superb. Did I mention it contained lots of profanitisin' and violence which sparked up controversy? A cops ear being cut off to the sounds of 'Stuck in the middle with you'.

It certainly isn't in the direction or story-telling.  It's an incredibly badly-written and episodic piece, full of irrelevant scenes without which it would only be an hour long.  What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino's 'genius' seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It's a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.  Maybe Reservoir Dogs was meant to have deconstructionist elements a la From Dusk Till Dawn, but I think it's just what it appears to be:  a really bad film.William Bell",Reservoir Dogs

591,CadeFilms,Near Perfect Story Of Deception & Instinct,10,10 April 2021,"Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is an absolute powerhouse of a debut feature film. However, there are a few specifics that keep me from seeing this as a perfect movie. Firstly, although the film's opening scene encapsulates exactly what each character stands for and inhabits within their personalities, it garnishes a few choices that detracts from its excellence. The cuts throughout the sequence, no matter how amazingly up close and personal they may be, do seem sloppy and without precision for most of its duration. Besides this, its also very apparent that Tarantino didn't really care too much about what I refer to as ""the restaurant cliche."" Yes, these characters are very outlandish and probably don't care about those around them so the volume of their conversation isn't an issue. However, to add to immersion, it would have been best if the audience could see reactive shots of the other customers in the establishment reacting to their embellished jokes and stories. Instead, its obvious that the other customers are bland extras without precise direction. Furthermore, there are another couple of intricacies later in the film that could easily have been fixed, such as Mr. White not lighting his cigarette for some odd reason and the bag of diamonds continuity error during Mr. Pink's escape sequence. Speaking of Mr. Pink's escape, its inclusion wasn't necessary at all. I do think that it was incredibly executed and beyond exciting. However, it detracted from the film's suspense since the audience now knows for 100% certainty that Mr. Pink couldn't be the rat. Anyways, besides these few criticisms, the film is amazing due to its performances, writing, incredible pacing, and every other aspect of film-making that one may consider important.95% or 9.5/10.",Reservoir Dogs

593,Mr_Blonde3,"Flawless cinema, and Mr. Blonde rules.",10,10 July 2003,"This is rhe one that put Tarantino on the map, and rightly so. A brilliant ensemble work is flawlessly brought to the screen with a group of terrific actors.The plot consists of a group of men brought together to pull of a jewelry heist. Things go awry when an alarm is pulled and the cops respond quicker than they should. The group then rendevous back at an abandoned warehouse and try to decide whether there is a rat in their midst who is tipping off the cops.The acting, as I have said, is flawless. Harvey Keitel is  perfect as the leader, Mr. White. Tim Roth playes Mr. Orange to perfection, and he spends a good portion of the movie laying on the floor (You'll find out). Steve Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. I know that Tarantino wrote the role for himself, but he made the right decision by putting Buscemi in the role instead. Chris Penn is also great fun as the continually P*ssed off Nice Guy Eddie and he is perfect in the role. And this is the first film I've seen Lawrence Tierney in a film and he couldn't be better cast. No one, Not even Robert DeNiro could play Joe Cabot better than Tierney did. Also of note are Eddie Bunker, who is great with what little screen time he has as Mr. Blue, and Tarantino himself is great and funny as Mr. Brown. Who can forget his ""Like a Virgin Monologue. And I have to point out Kirk Baltz, who makes you feel his pain in the ""Ear torture sequence"". He is great. And Randy Brooks is great and entertaining in his supporting role.
But I have to give special notice to The chilling Michael Madsen. For those who have only seen him in ""Free Willy"" or ""Thelma and Louise"" Prepare to be terrified and blown away. Madsen is better than perfect as the showstopper Mr. Blonde. His look, his acting, everything about his performance is flawless and I have to admit, (Though you probably guessed by my I.D.) That Madsen's Mr. Blonde was my favorite character in the piece. He has unforgettable lines ""Are you Gonna Bark all day, Little Doggy, or are you Gonna Bite""? And he has the best and most chilling scene in the movie, the ""Ear Torture Sequence"". Wait untill you see him dance to ""Stuck in the Middle with You."" you will be revolted and want to turn away, but you won't be able to. Alternatingly cool and alternatingly terrifying, Madsen's performance, at least in my opinion, is the best in the film. Because even though he's terrifying, the audience has to admit that he's cool.
This is definitely not a film to have the kids watch with you, but any adult who likes crime drama will enjoy it. As to the violence, It is very violent. But it's not half as bad as the recently released ""Gangs of New York"". The first five minutes of that movie are gorier that the whole of ""Reservoir Dogs"". We don't see blood spurting from anyone in this film. In ""Gangs..."", we are treated to blood spurting out of the side of Liam Neeson's character. I won't lie to you and say that people don't get bloody, but it's definitely not as graphic. So if ""Gangs..."" didn't bother you, don't even worry about being revolted by this one.Overall, loved the film, loved the actors, especially Madsen, and I hasve the film on vhs and dvd (the Mr. Blonde special edition). I definitely reccomend this one.
*****/***** 10 out of 10",Reservoir Dogs
594,Mr_Blonde3,Are you gonna bark all day.....,10,7 March 2004,"A couple of weeks ago, I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally, being a ""Dogs"" freak, I went down and saw it.To say I was blown away would be an understatement. I have only seen two of Mr. Tarantino's films in the theater. This being one, and ""Kill Bill"" being the other. I only became a fan of his a year ago and have subsequently seen all of his films and own them all.It really was a treat to be able to sit in the movie theater and watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn and drinking a grossly overpriced soda.For those who don't know, the film involves a jewelry heist. Six strangers including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and Tim Roth are recruited by a crime boss named Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie, whom everybody calls ""Nice Guy"" (Chris Penn). The six are almost all friends or associates of Cabot, particularly Keitel and Madsen. Cabot gives them colors for names (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, etc.) And expressly forbids them to reveal anything about themselves to each other, so if anyone is caught, no one can inform on anybody. But the heist goes wrong, the cops seem to show up way to fast, some members of the group are killed, and the rest start returning to the rendesvous point to try to sort out what went wrong. After the arrival of Mr. Pink, They realize that one of the number is a police informer. The arrival of Mr. Blonde, and the present he has in his trunk, complicates things even more. Things are also complicated by the fact that since no one knows each other, discovering who the informer is is given added difficulty, since no one trusts each other.This film, Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done. but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast. Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing, he has the distinction of being the first older actor who's career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that, because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself, and he would have been good, but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could. Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery, Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his character (Like a Virgin is a metaphor for big d*cks), and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding. But then, of course, I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece, Mr. Blonde, as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of ""Bad*ss"", and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable, as is the ""Ear torture sequence"". Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde, I don't think the ""Ear"" scene would have worked, Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen rocks!""Dogs"" Is one of the few movies where I don't think thae casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else, and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has. It's this mindset that, I think, has made ""Dogs"" the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.As a side note, This came out a year after ""Thelma and Louise"" which also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However, in ""Dogs"" They play ruthless characters. In ""T&L"" they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch ""T&L"" then ""RD"" and really see the difference. They are two great actors, and they deliver. And for those who enjoyed Madsen in this, I also recommend ""Kill Me Again"", made a few years earlier, and which also features a scene where he tortures someone.""Dogs"" is a great film to watch. Not a date flick, but for a cops and robbers movie, it's perfect. Seeing it for the first time in a theater, it hasn't lost it's touch, and the ""Stuck in the Middle with You""/Ear sequence has never been more intense or memorable.*****/***** !0/10",Reservoir Dogs
595,knoll360,"Proof that Quentin Tarantino was a skilled filmmaker from day one, already beginning to master his craft.",9,1 March 2011,"As Quentin Tarantino's first film this one truly sets the hallmarks for the director which would be used in his later films. The movie is about six criminals who work together to rob a bank but their employer attempts to keep it professional. They all dress in suits and never use their real names so as to keep their real identities hidden. Interestingly the film completely revolves around the robbery but it is never actually shown with the entire movie jumping back and forth from before and after the robbery. It shows how the different men got hired on for the job and how they react to the robbery going completely wrong. Most of the group believes that they were set up so they also must discover which one of them is an undercover cop. So the story is very non-linear which really keeps it interesting and the movie really makes you keep on guessing about who the undercover cop is which is really good storytelling. So overall an excellent plot that works very well in the film.All of the actors do a stupendous job here in each of their roles. Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White and does a great job at getting sympathy, professionalism, and the ability to do what is necessary without needing to be pushed. Then there is Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde or your psychopath of the film. He seems incredibly calm and professional around others but once they leave he really seems like a loon which means that he does a good job in his role. Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange who is injured throughout the majority of the movie (all of the after the robbery scenes) and he works really well too with how someone would act when they are injured like that. And we also have Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink who isn't crazy or very professional either but he is smart and plans everything out. Just like everyone else in this movie he does his job perfectly. So we have some excellent acting here from the entire cast.When it comes down to the special effects they are quite good for the time period and budget with some very realistic looking injuries and wounds plus some great looking gunshots and just about everything else. The music has a lot of 1970s songs in it and it works surprisingly well for the movie. The soundtrack is iconic and memorable which really helps get the film off the ground.Overall, this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best film but it is still incredibly entertaining. It is incredibly violent and has some very course language but if you can sit through all of that then you'll really see a skilled filmmaker just beginning to master the craft. The non-linear storytelling is rarely used in films which really keeps the audience thinking and with such an incredible story, stupendous acting, and some decent production values this one is worth a watch. Score: 9/10",Reservoir Dogs
596,ev_snyder,Great Tarantino film,10,24 August 2004,"I thought the movie Reservoir Dogs was very well made and had a good script and good directing.  But even better than that was the movie's excellent acting and great cast.  Every role was cast perfectly and acted very well, even Tarantino's bit, and, although Sam Jackson is an excellent actor, I respect and support Mr. Tarantino's decision not to use him in this film. Harvey Keitel was a special treat in this film, as was Steve Buscemi.  The story is in every way perfect and the setting, although very different from that of Pulp Fiction, is every bit as good.  Tim Roth didn't give as good of a performance in this as he did in Pulp Fiction, since he was playing an American in Reservoir Dogs, but he still did a good job.  Michael Madsen did an excellent job in this film, playing his role perfectly (probably just as writer/director Quentin Tarantino originally saw the character in his mind), and it's a shame we didn't see him in another Tarantino flick until Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Reservoir Dogs is second only to Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction, and the opening credits sequence is very cool and clever.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.

It's almost all off camera and left to the imagination - its not even much of the plot. Compared to Django Unchained - it's barely worth mentioning.I wish I'd watched it years ago - its a very solid *story* about the fall-out from a heist that went horribly wrong, not the usual action movie about the robbery itself.The cast are super - and golly do they look young - whilst the tension between the characters as they argue amongst themselves about professionalism is visceral.I found RDogs a bit short on the humour front as its almost played entirely straight and I didn't feel I got to know the characters well enough before the film was over.It isn't often that I'd like a film that's already 2hrs to be longer, but this was one that could've easily been 2.5hrs without me noticing.

I remember reading a quote from Quentin Tarantino about where his films should be classified in the video store.  He said with the comedies.  It is real easy to view the film in this light, the violence becoming nothing more than that of cartoon characters.   I have always liked the Stealers Wheel song, ""Stuck In The Middle With You,"" but never knew it was in the soundtrack to Reservoir Dogs.  Michael Masden as Mr. Orange, dancing around to this in the famous ear scene is an absolute classic.  I'll never be able to hear the song again without thinking of this scene.",Reservoir Dogs

If you stick with it to the end, you will not be disappointed! Great soundtrack as per usual.The way he tells the story with time jumps is not only there to make it more tense, but is told in a way where we learn the most important things about a character purely through dialogue with others at first and get the blanks and plot-twists filled in at a later point.The most interesting thing is, that this movie is still enjoyable after you know everything there is to know about the characters.Maybe it even gets better, since you get to sit back, relax and let the story and chars just unfold upon you.I'd give this a 10/10 if I only scored Tarantino Movies.

(So, clearly I saw this second.) However, unlike Pulp Fiction, you are not left with warm and uplifting memories of delightful, witty conversations at the end, instead the movie leaves you depressed and feeling sick at having just witnessed humanity pretty close to its worst. The unnecessarily vicious scenes of violence and endless ranting of angry men screaming at each other are what you take away from this film.If that's your idea of a good night out, you'll watch this and enjoy it.

611,mrdjx,This Little Doggie Bites,8,18 November 2010,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut film of director Quentin Tarrantino. While its not a masterpiece like his later effort Pulp Fiction. For a first time effort coming from a video store clerk who didn't go to film school, this is a remarkable achievement in the world of independent cinema. The storyline is simple. Crime lord, Joe Cabot and his son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie have arranged a diamond heist. To cover their tracks, they hire several associates who don't know each other personally and thus can't give information out in case they get arrested. These associates are Mr White (played by Harvy Keitel), Mr Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr Orange (Tim Roth), Mr Blonde (Michael Madson), Mr Brown (in a cameo by Quentin Tarrantino) and Mr Blue (played by real life former criminal Eddie Bunker). The heist immediately fails ending with a massacre that leaves Brown and Blue dead, Orange has been shot, leaving it to others to figure out who snitched them. What makes the plot interesting is not in the story itself but how it's told. When discussing mainstream cinema, Andy Warhol said that ""All the interesting bits of a film are left in the cutting room floor"". Reservoir Dogs is the anti thesis of Hollywood filmmaking. Yes, the heist happens but we don't see it. What we get however, is the events that happen before and after, feeding enough details to figure out what happened. This is Tarrantino's skill as both story teller and director, he can make details or characters we don't even see seem significant. Part of this is easily attributed to the excellent script. This is where the dialogue deserves a special mention. In an ordinary film, the dialogue is typically used just to explain the plot to the audience. Tarrantino breaks this rule by letting his characters converse from Brown's graphic explanation of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" to the humorous interaction between Eddie and Blonde. By avoiding the usual traps that plague Hollywood films, Tarrantino manages to make a movie solely dedicated to its characters and their knee jerk reactions to the heist. Raising the mark even further for the film is the carefully chosen ensemble cast. Harvey Keitel is superb as Mr White. His skills shine in the films early scenes where he shows his empathy with the dying Mr Orange. One might say that this portrayal is almost the exact opposite of the typical hardened criminal. Michael Madson, whilst having a limited screen time delivers the films most infamous scene as Mr Blonde, a psychotic criminal who is both brutal and cool. His dry deadpan delivery sets up most of the films tension. Perhaps the most memorable performance however goes to Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink. Out of the entire cast or characters, Pink is the most interesting which is ironic given that he is the only character we know nothing about. Buscemi manic performance proves equal match for Pinks loyalty and concerns about what is ""professional"" in the crime world. It is the films finest and most articulated performance. Reservoir Dogs is still not perfect though and I wouldn't recommend it to all people. For starters, Tim Roth's performance as Mr Orange while strong suffers greatly from his constantly slipping vernacular. You won't be sure is he's Italian American Mafioso, a street wise kid or simply a whiny brat. Thankfully, his most of his dialogue is kept to minimum as he spends much of his screen time lying in a pool of blood. Secondly the level of violence in this movie is bloody and gratuitous, peaking at the torture scene which was reportedly disturbing enough to prompt several people to leave the theatre. Yes the film is violent, but in the stylized way of the Hong Kong films that inspired it. Thirdly, the film is full of enough profanity laden dialogue to fill a text book. I don't actually mind it though, as it makes sense given that these characters are p*ssed off at the failure of such a carefully planned heist. But if you cant stomach excessive bad language, then isn't the film for you. These arguments should not be seen as detractors to the film though. Would I recommend Reservoir Dogs? That depends. If you're a cinephile, a pop culture fanatic or just want to see a refreshing film, by all means do. If however you're a concerned parent who wants to see something with the children or someone who cant stand such graphic violence and language, then avoid it all costs. Make no mistake though, this is a fantastic film that paved the way for the way for the career of a talented director.",Reservoir Dogs
612,synicalsaint,Great caper from early 90's,9,23 June 2005,"Tarantino's career started off with a bang thanks to this caper film. It's not suitable for all audiences but if you like a little ultra violence and aren't too tight you'll definitely like it.The dialog is extremely well written, it contains lots of humor, especially sarcasm which is very hard to achieve. The opening scene and the debate about the aliases are priceless. The acting is flawless. Buscemi, Madsen, Roth and Keitel are all equally outstanding. Tierny and Penn team up perfectly. The smaller parts played by Tarantino, Jackson and Bunker are all very colorful. The directing may not be anything special, but even though there are a few incoherences, it's rather solid. The (in)famous ear cutting scene has some smart direction as the camera moves away from the mutilation and shows us a door with ""WATCH YOUR HEAD"" written over it. Many interesting themes are brought up throughout the film. Loyalty and reliability seem to be the main one, Mr Blonde stuck up for Joe, Mr Orange tells Mr White the truth, all the robbers go to the meeting place despite the fiasco.As always the soundtrack is excellent. In Reservoir Dogs it has something more than in Tarantino's other films as the heist takes place at the same time as a special retro 70's music radio show. Tune's from the 70's are scattered all over the story as characters turn the radio on and off. I think that that was a very good idea and a nice little touch. All the more because the songs are often used to illustrate what's happening on the screen. As Mr Blonde tortures Nash, 'Stuck in the Middle with you' highlights the two cops' situation who are stuck in the warehouse with a few panicked criminals. The last song 'Coconut' brings us back to reality, if you listen to the lyrics, it's just a silly song about a guy who wants to get rid of his belly ache. This is very ironic as one of the characters has just spent the last 90 minutes with a bullet in his gut. Tarantino is basically saying that this was just a film, not real life.Although Pulp Fiction is probably the better of the two, Reservoir Dogs is my favorite Tarantino film. I'm not too sure why, I think the experimental side tips it for me. Having the whole story happen in the warehouse with just a few flashbacks to tell us everything was clever and hard to pull off, but here it's done perfectly.9/10",Reservoir Dogs
613,harrybraff,Dances with violence.,2,21 May 2020,"It is obvious that Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking is popular. I understand that. What I don't understand is why Tarantino fans defend his work with anyone who has a dissenting voice with rabid-like vehemence. Understand this: if everyone were the same, it would be a boring world indeed and nobody wants that. So just relax, ok? You guys are starting to sound like a cult.I am not going to say anything bad about Reservoir Dogs or Tarantino's style of films. There are more intelligent people than me who have already done that, no need for redundancy. What I will say is that to exert one's preference is a characteristic of all humans. Even Bresler's (the ice cream people) understands this. That is why they have 31 flavors instead of 1.I prefer films that entertain me. Once again, I am not saying Tarantino's films are not entertaining, I speak only for myself as a human being exercising preference. I also prefer films that give me something to like or be interested in: a plot twist, or a mystery to solve, an original song to hum, or even just a good-guy to root for. These are old-fashioned notions to be sure, but still a preference.I will be honest here, I find it difficult to finish a Tarantino movie. The Reservoir Dogs DVD was loaned to me by a friend, and it took all I had not to fast forward through it. But I made it all the way through and paid attention. Did I like it? Doesn't matter. Would I have preferred watching something else? Probably. Could I in good conscience recommend this to anyone? No. And will I ever watch it again?

From the beginning of the movie you feel confused, because of the different charakters, that discuss the strangest things on the dinner table and you have know idea what is going on. Tarantino clearly knows how to write dialoges and grips the attention of the viewer, even if they do not want to look at it. The concept is very interesting and leaves the viewer always with less information than the charakters, so the viewer wants to know more. Every detail that is revealed makes the story more interesting. Unfortunatly near the end the scenes fell out of the story and reveal information that had been better unlocked. The acting of all charakters is brilliant and especially Tim Roth delivers an extraordinary performance. The brutal movie is accompanied by fitting music and makes the viewing experience very special.Overall Reservoir Dogs is a very good debut film from Tarantino that delivers almost on every level. The brutal take on the Gangster Scene is unique, surprising, full of black humour and very thrilling, even though it falls a bit near the end. 8/10",Reservoir Dogs

2) Characters are more understandable.
3) Movie focuses on same characters who are connected to the same story which makes it easier to follow.I believe all of the actors did a pretty good job. Movie is violent no doubt so be careful if you're new to Tarantino. If you already know him and like his movies you've probably seen this but if you haven't, go see it.

The plot is a tad 'similar' to the Ringo Lam film 'City on Fire' - there are undeniable connections between the two films, from the phrase ""Let's go to work"" to the scene with Harvey Keitel firing two guns into a car, and the near identical scene in City. But I think Tarantino does it better. The whole approach to the film means it has a very different style to City, in which we know who the cop is right from the start. Reservoir Dogs begins by inspiring empathy with the criminals, which then leads on to the horror of Mr Blonde's actions, and the tragic relationship Mr White and Mr Orange develop. Quite simply, Reservoir Dogs is a very good film, not very complex perhaps, and scratch beneath the surface and you'll find very little substance, but it has a very impressive surface indeed...

Quite frankly, RD is not that loaded with blood and guts. The infamous ""ear-cutting scene"" is hardly as graphic as you might think. If you are going to watch a gangster movie, expect guns and expect blood. You won't find any gangster movie where they're picking flowers and baking muffins.Background isn't given on most of the characters, and that's the point. The anonymity of the characters (hence the code names) is important to the movie's plot. These people are mostly all strangers to each other. We know as much as they know, for the most part. Part of Tarantino's genius is his ability to give you only what you need, and nothing extra.
Furthermore, the movie makes you care about the characters. Despite all being ""Bad guys,"" Mr. White obviously has good tendencies, while the main evil character is Mr. Blonde. Mr. Pink is the pro - he's there to do the job and nothing else. While not overly in-depth, the characters are developed enough to make the viewer empathize with them. Anybody who can't see this movie for what it truly is, should maybe watch something a little more suited to their mental capacity: The Lion King.SPOILER - Do not continue reading if you don't want to know what happens at the end.Mr. Pink, the only one to escape alive, is the only real professional of the group. Mr. White becomes emotionally attached. Mr. Blonde forgets the point of the job, and occupies himself with the torture of the cop.

Reservoir Dogs defined what he was all about, and this raw, bloody story aged like a fine wine, despite some critics' opinions.The acting is supreme, especially when we look at Mr. Blonde and Mr. White, played by Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel. But, my favourite of the cast is Tim Roth. His acting isn't flawless, and his accent is a little weak at times, but it's not about being perfect. A big part of his screentime is lying in a puddle of blood, on the verge of death, which isn't easy to pull out. Instead of just lying there, he makes use of his facial expressions and his voice, which completely sells the character.The story is quite interesting too - it's a heist movie where we don't see an actual heist. Over an hour of men talking to each other? - seems boring. But actually, it isn't. There are flashbacks, strong dialogues and scenes that hit us hard. And the opening scene?

624,claytonators,Bloody Brilliant,10,2 November 2007,"Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be. It's pretty simple. Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up. With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house. But which one is it? That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.The writing is off the hook. Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue. Why? Because the characters talk like real people. In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme. In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing. His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humour.The cast is terrific. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice. Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role. Buscemi is hilarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen. But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie. 10/10 Outstanding.",Reservoir Dogs

Not because it is the best direction, the most polished or the most entertaining, but because it is his most innovative.He takes the crime genre and dispels all charm, glamour and prestige. The characters are believable, likable, detestable and pitiful. They make bad decisions, show extreme cold bloodiness and great loyalty. And it feels like they're doing it all for very little.The dialogue speeds up, slows down, takes great turns and is punctuated by great humour. It is as well written as Tarantino has managed.As a director he cleverly uses music with a local radio show playing the songs on cue with the scene and plays with time in a manner that doesn't feel like showing off but rather ""you need to know this now so here it is"".It ends as it starts with it all seeming just not worth it and yet you loved every minute.",Reservoir Dogs

Quentin Tarantino's ""first"" movie was to saw the least good. The plot was good and kept me guessing for a long time, once the characters were down the ending was pretty much obvious, however I don't thing it would have been as obvious if I'd watched it back 11 years ago when it came out. The cast were/are great actors and play their characters really well including Quentin Tarantino himself (I wish he'd play a bigger part though). The music isn't as well chosen as what he later comes up with but it's still pretty good, also it doesn't add as much to the movie as it does in his later movies.Still Reservoir Dogs is a good movie and a most see for any person with larger then average interest in movies.

It is necessary to emphasize many things of this great movie: the excellent distribution headed by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen, this one is captivating in his chilling paper of sadistic thief; the great and unforgettable soundtrack; a very well constructed and developed script and the memorable scenes: the cut of the ear to the policeman and the initial scene, I can't describe this scene but the word that I would say would be perfect.

But there is one moment which TRULY is brilliant:  a fictional story (told by Tim Roth's character) which is developed and devolved until the storyteller stands in the middle of his story telling it to its characters as the camera spins 'round and 'round.

The story seems very simple however it is several layers deep it all revolves around the aftermath of a bungled robbery where 6 men total strangers to each other except the father and son who organised the caper the robbers are given aliases on the job and are told not to tell each other their Christian names. After the disastrous robbery which leaves two of the robbers dead, one badly wounded and the other driving around with a cop in his trunk, Mr White(Harvey Keitel) Mr Blonde(Michael Madsen) Mr Pink(Steve Buscemi) Mr Blue(Eddie Bunker) Mr Brown(Quentin Tarantino) Nice Guy Eddie(Chris Penn) Mr Orange(Tim Roth) and Joe Cabot(Lawrence Tierney) can't believe it when one of them turns out to be a double crosser even taking a regular cop whose hiding a big secret Marvin Nash(Kirk Baltz) doesn't answer the question..who is the rat???. I wont spoil the big secret all i can do is praise the brilliant film the acting is top class some of the best i have ever seen especially Harvey Keitel who should have won an Oscar for his performance however all of the other actors turn in the performance of their careers, the script is one of the best i have ever seen with some of the best one liners and comments i have ever heard GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.....NOW",Reservoir Dogs
636,SidelinePictures,Seems As If It This Story Really Happened,10,24 August 2007,"'Reservoir Dogs' more than likely refers to a pack of mean, killing, blood-thirsty dogs reuniting at a warehouse after what seemed to be a well thought out heist went terribly wrong. It truly is a very original plot, and unique in its ways relating to violence and the psychos that perform this violence, as if it is routine. The acting is marvelous, especially Tim Roth's who must portray a dying member of the crew of criminals involved in this failed heist. Tarantino's dialog is completely realistic and memorable in a way that you would honestly think that real guys sitting around a table in a coffee shop would say. QT's directional debut is flawless. Lower-budget crime films like these don't get any better than 'Reservoir Dogs', for it is a great all around film, with great action 'shots', and dramatic conflicts. With all of these characteristics that go along with the realistic dialog, it is as if this movie plot really happened, and you are watching it take place, and if the viewer feels like that, then this film is a must-see. For all of the movie-goers out there, this is a crime film to watch, at least once.",Reservoir Dogs

After sitting through it, I can't stop thinking about it.The film was composed beautifully. Instead of a simple plot line, it was broken up and rearranged making the audience work until the end. The music and character transitions were perfect.Tarantino did a great job making the characters true to the people portraying them. Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. White could have not been more perfect to their characters. The sheer fact that I hated and loved the various characters almost to a point of them being real is a feat in it of itself.I felt that the profanity was a bit much and it may be necessary to the plot and emotions, but at times it was a bit overbearing.Overall though, I was very impressed by the rawness of the story and how developed all of the characters were.

638,mikfisher64,(re)Defining Cinema,9,16 October 2010,"As soon as the movie starts , you get the feeling, no you know it will be good. Not good, brilliant. The story is quite simple , depicts the moments after a professional robbery that went wrong and how they deal with it. It is told ""In medias res"" , fact alone that's responsible for the way the film captures your attention.If you've seen other Quentin's movies, you must know the style : realistic, humorous, perfectionism - and they are all so perceptible . The way the scenario is purposely confined and yet is pictured to the extreme ; how natural the talking is, not only believing but compelling ; and of course how Tarantino's way of having us laugh in a uncommonly way.Last note for the actors, they are all memorable but it wouldn't be right if'd not mention these : Quentin Tarantino itself , Steve Buscemi, and last, Tim Roth's performance blew me away. It's a fact i was already a fan but the guy doesn't cease to amuse me.Eventually, the movie's essence is so accurately delivered that , even though they are criminal , pretentious scumbags of the society, you grow fond of them, actually having compassion for them - more on that, you not only want to know what happened, what went wrong, but you actually wish them good.If that's not something in a movie , then i don't know what it is.9.4/10",Reservoir Dogs

There are no over the top effects, maybe 3 settings and to be honest not a lot happens. However it is the characters that make this film. This is one of those movies that are not at all complex, but are also exceedingly enjoyable. The acting is pretty good, especially Steve Buscemi. Mr. Pink is without doubt one of the most memorable characters I have ever experienced.

Of course there's the infamous ear scene, which was pretty powerful despite the lack of visuals.  I still cringe at it.  But as Chris Penn explains, it's not so much that movie's violent, it just does such an excellent job of building up tension that when there is violence it just feels so much more magnified. It's a definite must-see for anyone who watches movies.  If you're a Tarantino fan, then there's no reason for you not to have seen it.  If by some chance you haven't then you should be slapped until you do see it. Reservoir Dogs is easily among my top ten.",Reservoir Dogs
641,firashaidar66,Brilliant,9,2 February 2013,"moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comI was lucky to watch Reservoir Dogs without knowing anything about it, making it a total surprise. It's not your average crime movie, with the crazy shootings and car chases, but it's a movie that brings you close to every character, when in fact, you don't know anything about any of them.After a jewelry store robbery goes wrong, four of the men hired to do the job return to their safe house, trying to figure out who set them up. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a heavily wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) to the safe house, trying to fix him up. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) arrives just minutes later, and all three are then joined by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) who brings a ""pleasant"" surprise. The movie avoids all the cliché bullshit, giving us a unique storyline and dialogue. It doesn't have all that unnecessary romantic subplot, nor any goofy scenes clumsily thrown in. Every moment of the film is a new idea, different than any other ideas used in movies at that time. It's a testament that ""less is more""; the details of the failed robbery, which the entire movie is based on, are only conveyed in the dialogue, which attracts the watcher to every word said by the characters, and putting our imagination in motion so we can try to picture what happened.Being one of Tarantino's first directed movies, Reservoir Dogs is perfectly put together. The directing, the producing, the plot, and the acting were sublime. For a story line so straightforward, the actors had a real challenge to highlight what their characters are all about. But, surprisingly, every actor did his job just fine, giving us a great performance, making us believe that they were real criminals in a documentary. And to put up with the actors' brilliant performance, the production had to be at its best, and again, it did not disappoint. Not to forget Tarantino's famous signature, the trunk shot, which I think is really awesome.Some people may say that Reservoir Dogs is a little too violent, but the violence here is used to develop every character's personality, their disregard towards human life. Every character's own way of being violent shows the difference between him and the others. (Won't add anything to avoid spoilers)Reservoir Dogs is the kind of movie you can watch again and again without ever getting bored. Because, putting aside the brilliantly crafted Hollywood masterpiece, it's all about a message, making us think about the consequences of our actions. Reservoir Dogs will always be a Tarantino classic, and won't be forgotten by anybody who watches it.",Reservoir Dogs

Renegade director Quentin Tarantino has done a masterpiece with this movie. Such films are remarkable just by style: In that film everybody dies.The second aspect of the movie was the background racism against Black which is the personality of many inglorious American republicans bastards.This film was the hitting movie of the Sundance film festival. Even with the language and the multiples gun shot sequences it doesn't change anything about the fact that the ""K-Billy Super Songs"" are the best music adaptation and the Intrigue is perfect.The best scenes of the movie are : The Restaurant tipping part, the tortured cop who got his ear cut-off and then the fire revelation and of course the end with the SHOWDOWN AMONG PROS.",Reservoir Dogs

If nothingness was entertaining, it would exactly look like this movie. A jewelry heist goes all wrong to get the mutually unknown gang members suspecting if one of them is an undercover cop. If you want to watch out for the heist sequence to use your grey cells and find the undercover, you would lose it all. Because no one cares. This is all about those dogs, and Tarantino ensures that watching them go witty and nutty for 100 minutes is all worthy an experience.Straight from the first scene of his first film, his love for detailing in characters and nonsense conversations is out there. Being an alien to the style of Tarantino's storytelling, one would take his time to sink in, but you get little of it to absorb the insanity. The movie does barely proceed and changes gears from the laughs to the bloodshed, and the big picture is told in all flashback. If you have an eye for watching someone literally removing other's ear, this one's surely for you.

644,paytonsapp,Tarantino's masterpiece,10,3 December 2016,"Being a young, aspiring film maker, I try to learn from the greats such as Spielberg, Fincher, Scorsese and yes, Tarantino. I've seen all of Tarantino's films from Pulp Fiction to Django Unchained but I had yet to see his directorial debut Reservoir Dogs. Now having seen it, I can easily say Tarantino has not yet topped his first film and likely never will. For those who don't know, Reservoir Dogs is about 6 total strangers, Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Blue who come together to pull off the perfect heist on a jewelry store. But, when it all goes wrong and the police show up, the remaining men start to smell a rat.Where this film really excels is the dialogue and direction. Contrary to popular belief, the violence in this film is not overly grotesque, but more driven by the story and it is very realistic. The dialogue in this film is so witty and smooth, it makes it impossible to be bored and it's hard to look away from the screen even if two side characters are having a conversation.The relationship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange is a big driving point for this film in my opinion. Mr. Orange is shot in the stomach by a pedestrian during the getaway after the failed robbery and Mr. White tries to comfort him while they race to the reandevu point in a warehouse. Mr. Pink shows up shortly after and He and Mr. White argue about who the possible rat is. And during the argument, Mr. White says that Mr. Orange is without a doubt NOT the rat, and ""MAJOR SPOILERS HERE"" when Orange shoots Mr. Blonde as Mr. Blonde is about to burn a cop alive and confesses to the cop that he is actually a police officer, it leaves you breathless and you totally sympathize with Mr. White when he finds out later in the film. The non-linear story telling in this film is also a big plus as it makes it easier to get to know the characters as the story unfolds before our eyes. This is a film that had truly stood the test of time and will continue to be a classic for the years to come. This is one of my all time favorite films and my favorite film by Tarantino and I give it a 5/5.",Reservoir Dogs
645,MovieLoversAnonymous,You're watching a master at work.,9,27 March 2015,"Reservoir Dogs is one of the greatest bank heist movies that I have ever seen. This genre of film has been sucked dry from over saturation through the years, but there is something very unique about this one that I certainly was not expecting: the heist is never shown.Reservoir Dogs marks the first in an increasingly impressive list of films directed by Quentin Tarantino. If I had just watched this movie without knowing this piece of information, I would easily be able to recognize his signature style with the highly entertaining dialogue, and long conversations about pop culture throughout the movie. However, I never would guess that this was the very first movie he directed. I still believe Pulp Fiction is his best movie, but if someone told me that the think Reservoir Dogs is better, I wouldn't be able to argue with them very much.The movie is almost entirely consisting of the members of the heist mission in their hideout, after the heist had already taken place (off camera). The cops had shown up to the scene suspiciously early, and the men start to suspect a rat in their midst. Other than the flashbacks, the entirety (really about 98% of the movie) is composed of conversations between characters. The dialogue in this movie is just as excellent as we have come to expect from a Tarantino film.The performances by everyone in this movie are stellar in every right, but Steve Buscemi shines the most with outstanding portrayal of Mr. Pink. If you like Tarantino's style of violence mixed with comedy mixed with high amounts of dialogue, you'll love this one. Great movie 9/10 (Oh, and this movie is incredibly quotable too.

Pulp Fiction is amazing but it doesn't come close to the genius that this movie has to offer.A non-chronological plot (which became Tarantino's style) revolving around a diamond heist gone terribly wrong, an amazing 70's soundtrack, and disturbingly well done scenes make this movie a must have for any collector. I'd consider this much better than films like Scarface, The Goodfellas, or any of those typical Italian mobster movies. This movie should be the benchmark by what any gangster movie is compared to.The dialogue is brilliant at times where the characters are literally just sitting and talking to each other. The ending will leave you to make your own conclusion on what happened based on all of the events that took place.You're going to want to pick up the soundtrack for this one as well.

It was supposed to have been banned in a few countries due to the fact of the violence. If you watch films today such as A Man Apart, that is an extremely violent film, but if you think about the Rating in 1992, violence and cinema has evolved a lot!I also think that the cast for this film is just, THE BEST! Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi i think play their roles perfect and the film couldn't have been better! According to the IMDb, Reservoir Dogs is Rated #64 in the Top 250, i think it could be a lot higher in the list because i think that this film is a classic that will never become forgotten, its just one of those films that has made a huge impact since it was first released.Reservoir Dogs - 10/10 (I would advise that you watch this film without youngers, it does get abit Graphic:))",Reservoir Dogs
650,Weezer-16,Just great!,10,4 September 1999,"This is Tarantino`s first movie as a director. I can just say that he did a great job! We see many good actors, examples are: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and my favorite actor: Steve Buscemi. I would say that his performance in ""Reservoir dogs"" is his best ever. He plays the role of a paranoid, big mouthed and cynical gangster. Harvey Keitel plays the role of an more calm, experienced and ""caring"" type of gangster. I would say that the rest of the actors did a great job too.   What I like about the film: I love that the gangsters is the main- characters and we develop a sympathy for them during the movie. We can see the other side of crime, not just the usual ""goodguy"" view. I like that we see the plot from several points of view and in the end it narrows out to a climax and a sudden end. This technique is, in my point of view, Tarantino`s specialty. The dialogues is also superb. They are so natural and catchy that this spices up the action and makes it a really good film.Absolutely recommendable! 9 out of 10 STARS.",Reservoir Dogs
651,oscar-50,Short of a masterpiece,8,4 June 1999,"The thing to pay attention to when you watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the relationship that develops between some of the different characters. A scene that I took great interest in while viewing this for the second time was the scene where Mr. White and Mr. Pink are discussing the events that took place that afternoon. Mr. White is combing his hair when Mr. Pink cocks his gun; Mr. White quickly turns toward Mr. Pink in panic. This event illustrates the mistrust between the characters. A scene that created somewhat of a hole in the movie was the scene when Mr. White pulls out his guns and lights up the two unsuspecting cops. In an actual undercover assignment there's no way that a cop in Mr. Orange's position would allow two police officers to be murdered. Now the rationale behind this event is that there is an existing bond of friendship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange, but Quentin Tarantino needed to show the viewer more information to this effect. I hate to criticize such a wonderful, brilliant film but I believe that aspect of the film sticks out like a sore thumb. People who write this film off as repulsive trash are merely two-dimensional thinkers and are afraid to deviate from their sheltered lives. Very good effort by Quentin Tarantino. Many aspects of this film (i.e. out of sequence events) were mastered in ""Pulp Fiction."" But Pulp Fiction lacks one thing that Reservoir Dogs thrives on: Bravado.",Reservoir Dogs

It shares all of the things that I hate about his other films (bouncing around in time & sequence, unnecessary blood & violence, no plot and no resolution) with the rest of his films, but for some reason this one does not make me want to sort my socks instead. I would still say that you should not waste your time watching this movie unless you really just want to waste time. The only redeeming quality of this film is that you can watch this one film and and you will have just seen every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made, because they are all the same. Just be sure that you can handle the violence and the blood because that is about all you are going to get from this film.",Reservoir Dogs

I had seen it at the local Hollywood Video and I always wanted to rent it, being a fan of Quentin Tarantino. After the credits, I sat there in awe. This movie was the best crime thriller I had seen in my entire life. Quentin Tarantino writes tremendous dialogue on par with Kevin Smith(my all time favorite writer). Excellent performances include Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Steve Buscemi as Mr.Pink, and the excellent Harvey Keitel as Mr.White.

656,justcoolb,I strongly disagree,6,15 May 2008,This movie was a total waste of time. The acting was OK and it just was not very interesting. The majority of the movie was swearing and shooting and flashbacks. This movie reminded me of The Departed. Mindless killing and pure stupidity. All this might be because I have not liked but one or two of Tarentinos films. However i watched this movie like all with an open mind and i was completely bored for the entire first half of the movie. The rest of the movie got me interested and then dropped it with the bad ending and the mindless violence and stupidity. It is just not very entertaining to me. Somehow people like it enough for it to be on the top 250 but i think it should be on bottom 250.,Reservoir Dogs

The heist is only loosely described, it is not the point of the story nor the vehicle that moves it.  Great performances all around by the cast.

Reservoir Dogs is a simple and small casted movie with a genius shoestring plot stronger than your average convoluted Hollywood drivel.",Reservoir Dogs

I felt that the way the characters were introduced wasn't as effective in The Ususual Suspects. But back to the movie. I didn't really learn much from the movie except to not trust anyone.

Quentin Tarantino is an excellent writer/director, and he proves it to us with this, his first film. Excellent writing combined with great acting (compliments of Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, hell, the entire cast, including the minor characters) make this one a winner.

It is directed by Quentin Tarantino, directing his first feature-length film. I've got to confess that I was disappointed. I thought it was going to be fun, creative, wonderfully weird, etc. The whole thing didn't really seem to have a point. And the fun dialogue got old after a couple minutes into it. And it just kept building up and I thought it was going to lead up to an amazing climax, but it didn't. The whole film leads up to nothing. Thus it being pointless.One thing I have to give the film is it is creatively directed by Tarantino. The use of music during the torture scene really lightens the mood, even though someone gets his ear cut off. It just would've been stupid without the music. And the opening scene where all the guys are at a restaurant talking about normal things is amusing and one of the best opening scenes in a movie ever.But it all goes downhill from there. Like I said before, Tarantino makes you think like this is going to be a great film but it ends up disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie because of its creativity but the script completely ruined it for me.I don't recommend this movie but I do recommend Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction. All of the positive aspects of this film that I mentioned above are in Pulp Fiction but ten times better. Plus, Pulp Fiction has a good story and actually leads up to something. So I suggest for you to skip this film and watch Pulp Fiction instead.",Reservoir Dogs
663,higeswhiskers,Stupendous Film,10,11 July 2005,"A couple years back, a movie called Kill Bill, Vol. 1 was released. It was written and directed by a man named Quentin Tarantino and made quite a bit of money. Well, before Kill Bill was released, Tarantino was well-known to independent film watchers for two films: Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1991).Reservoir Dogs is about a small-time crime boss named Joe Cabot, his son, ""Nice Guy"" Eddie, and the six armed robbers Joe hires to steal a diamond from a bank: Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Blue. However, the robbery goes to hell quicker than you can say, ""Mr. Giggle Stompstomp.""Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown are killed and Mr. Orange is shot in the stomach. The four remaining ""Reservoir Dogs"" suspect that one of them is a cop, and they must decide who it is by the end of the film.The casting is great: Steve Buscemmi shines as the cocky, somewhat arrogant Mr. Pink, Tim Roth is superb as the nice, charming Mr. Orange, Harvey Keitel is excellent as the sometimes funny, caring Mr. White, and Michael Madsen is truly believable in his performance as the evil madman, Mr. Blonde.The soundtrack is pure hits from the '70s: Coconut, Little Green Bag, Stuck in the Middle With You, etc., and it blends perfectly into the film's wacky, diabolical tone.This movie isn't for the squeamish: Lots of shooting, ears getting lopped-off, and other gruesome images lie around the corner.One of my favorites, I give Reservoir Dogs a 10 out of 10.",Reservoir Dogs

You tell this or Pulp Fiction in non-linear fashion and the story is not as good as the one he tells using flashbacks. He is also a master of using music in this (and in all of his movies). Only Kubrick can possibly top his use of ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" during the ear scene with ""Singing in the Rain"" during the rape scene in Clockwork Orange.One note. I wonder why his characters are derogatory towards black people. I heard Tarantino on Charlie Rose and he wants to do a movie about John Brown (The famous abolitionist).

665,CinematicEddy,The timeless Tarantino breakthrough,10,15 February 2015,"This is my very first review on IMDb, so I should start with my favorite of all time!Released on 1992 'Reservoir Dogs' is the breakthrough title of director Quentin Tarantino, the cast consists on: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi. All of them are great on the film, the plot is about a group men who plan a heist, things start to go wrong during the heist and little do they know, there is a rat on the group, the film focus on each and every one of the men to find out who's the traitor.The movie is written by Quentin himself, and benefits from a non-linear storytelling, which was the perfect way to tell this particular story, the movie is most dialog based, but it is so well acted that invests you in the characters and makes you believe in what's happening on the screen, the film presents us with a great soundtrack, the editing is awesome...Well, as I said, this is my favorite film of all time, so I definitely recommend it to everyone interested in great filmmaking.",Reservoir Dogs
666,DzeFrenchman,You'll never get tired of it,10,31 March 2008,"This is one of those films you can watch over and over and over again, and never get tired of. Tarantino knows exactly what we want and gives it to us in so many of his films, just like he does in this one. The story (undercover cop ...) has been done so many times, but never it was made like this. How come Tarantino succeeds where others fail? There are lots of reasons, but let me just give you the most important one: the dialogs! They are brilliant brilliant brilliant!!! The movie begins with this one: Mr. Brown's vision on what 'Like a virgin' is all about... geniality! Every word that comes out of Joe, the big boss, is so hilarious! As I'm running out of synonyms for funny etc., I'll stop here. As in all Tarantino's films, the editing is also of a very high level, as is the music, but then again, how could the music possibly be bad: it's K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's!!! You can't but love the DJ. And on top of all that, we have the honor to see a top-cast in action. I'm talking 'bout Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and I also want to mention Lawrence Tierny (Joe), cause he really made me laugh a lot of times.So, if you're a Tarantino fan, you'll definitely like it. For those unfamiliar with his work: watch it, really, it's the perfect film to get familiar with his style; and it's simply a really great movie.",Reservoir Dogs
667,danegem,The birth of the Tarantinoesque doesn't disappoint.,9,7 January 2010,"Quentin Tarantino was prepared to shoot his film with some of his friends for a decent sized budget, when Harvey Keitel got hold of him in hopes of producing ""Reservoir Dogs"". Tarantino agreed, and he still got to direct the film too. Even before the movie, hit film festivals, Tarantino's name was echoed all over town. This film represents the birth of a new genre; The Tarantino. The movie incorporates many different genres into one, complete with Tarantino's own style of film-making with a very unique way of story telling. It is true, as Tarantino admitted, that this film did indeed ""rip-off"" older films, but the director did not just simply plagiarize, he improved what he took and made it his own (You could say he simply borrowed but did not have time and the rights to explain why he needed to borrow). The final result, however, marks a new trend in cinema; one that many filmmakers have tried to rip-off themselves.The film is basically about a group of thugs hired by a man named Joe, who commissions them to rob a Jewelery Store. Using aliases (which are associated with colours), the men plan the heist but something goes very wrong during the robbery. The difference between this film and most crime films that came out before, is that this film does not show the actual crime that one is expecting to occur and see, but it is only talked about, before and after it happens. Tarantino allows you to hang out with his characters and lets you either sympathize or hate these guys. You could argue that the film is indeed a character study of all the reservoir dogs. The story is told in a non-linear time-line, which was uncommon back in the day.Overall, the film has a good story, well written characters, great dialogue (which is usually the most talked about in Tarantino's films) very well acted (Tim Roth could have been a potential Oscar nominee for this film in my opinion) and, of course, pure fun. This isn't Tarantino's best film in my opinion (his second one is though) but it is definitely his second best. One can definitely learn a thing or two from this film and it's filmmaker.",Reservoir Dogs

Kind of like looking at someone's baby pictures. He has always had an amazing ability to choose soundtrack material, and this movie is no exception.

Well what can I say? If you like the genre and want to remain on the same page as Tarantino's then you gonna get thrills. I can suggest that. But nothing special though. And one thing for sure I didn't expect special something from Tarantino from the beginning.
Actually from the starting of the movie you know how it's gonna end. He's a legendary director though, nothing personal but after all it was his trial round. You'd get one level up but some same kind of thrills in Pulp Fiction though. I think he thought yo this one went really well, why not another one ?
Blood and blood, everywhere blood. The film starts with blood and ends with it as you'd expect. Not very professional I'd say 😂😂.
Well you and your boys, I'm talking about neighborhood trouble makers can watch it together. You gonna get real gruesome feeling.

675,t_gilks,Reservoir Dogs pales in comparison to Pulp Fiction,6,23 August 2001,"""Reservoir Dogs"" contains the same macho, profane, tough-guy attitude and non-linear story telling as Tarantino's other film, ""Pulp Fiction"", but lacks the love of dialogue and the diversity and interest of characters. The characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" all had views, mannerisms, and characteristics all their own. They loved to talk, and we loved to hear them, because, insightful, funny or just plain stupid, Tarantino made everything they say interesting. In ""Reservoir Dogs"" however, almost every word spoken serves only to advance the plot. The characters are more or less interchangeable. None of them say anything that you couldn't imagine another character saying. With the exception of Red (Madsen) and Orange (Roth) none of the diamond thieves have any background. There is very little uniqueness to any character in this movie.I mentioned the non-linear storytelling that was used in both ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", unfortunately however, the concept that was so exciting in ""Pulp Fiction"", seems like a gimmicky way of hiding the movie's greatest flaw: Nothing much happens. The story involves a robbery (which we don't see) and the setup to the robbery (which we don't care about, because we don't see the robbery).With ""Pulp Fiction"" already out on DVD and video, there is very little reason to see this movie, apart from, of course, curiousity.",Reservoir Dogs

I loved it, and I hated it. Here's why I hated it...1. Too much violence. And I like violent movies. But this one went too far. I mean really. When did cutting a guy's ear off become cool? The reaction to this from IMDB visitors disturbs me. There was absolutely no reason to include that torture scene. 2. Blood. I don't mind blood...blood doesn't scare me...but I mean really, come on, is it POSSIBLE to tone it down a bit? 3. Quentin Tarantino. I HATE Quentin Tarantino. What the f*ck is that guy's deal? I wonder if his goal in making movies is to desensitize us to EVERYTHING? Why is every character in all of his movies a racist? This is completely unnecessary. It's one thing to put it in one movie, but to have racist terms just blurted out nonstop in more than one of your movies, that AREN'T even about racism...is idiotic.Now why I liked it.1. This movie was one of the first to tell a story the way it did. The Usual Suspects is still a million times better than this movie, but I think that Christopher McQuarrie probably was influenced by this film. 2. The convincing enough acting. I thought Tim Roth was great. But I didn't think anyone else was great. Just good enough. (Q: And when did Michael Madsen become a great actor? A: He didn't.)That's it. I have two separate opinions.

678,boris82,QT's First (and worst) Film,5,18 April 2002,"I loved Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, it's in my all time top 5. Jackie Brown was also quite good. QT is truly a natural born filmmaker that doesn't have to resort to stylish excess and cinematic acrobatics like so many mainstream directors do.But Reservoir Dogs is a very weak movie. There were several plot holes: SPOILER ALERT1) Why would the head criminals, who have had decades of experience, let Mr. Orange into the heist just because he told them some lame drug story? Anyone could make up that story, ESPECIALLY an undercover cop.2) Why did the cops risk a bloodbath by not stopping the jewel heist before it happened?3) And...(SPOILER) Why did Mr. Orange tell Mr. White that he's a cop right before the film ended? Isn't that incredibly dumb? I know that QT probably used that as an homage to samurai films with the theme of pride and loyalty. But Mr White did not do much to help Orange in the first place. Orange asked to be taken to a hospital and White didn't do that. So what the hell does Orange owe him?My last complaint isn't a plot hole but the dialogue. Granted, the dialogue is nice and a breath of fresh air compared to James Cameron crap, but it had nothing to do with anything. The dialogue in Pulp Fiction toyed with the audience by foreshadowing future occurences and tricking us into thinking about Royal With Cheeses and Foot Rubs right before Jules and Vince blow away 3 guys in 5 minutes. The dialogue in Reservoir Dogs doesn't do any of that. It doesn't even say anything about the characters. I would greatly appreciate e-mail responses to my complaints, because I could be wrong.I have to hand it to QT though. He's a marketing whiz. He made a film too damn flashy for it's own good and with disgusting violence. This was the formula to get him noticed by Hollywood. And as you see with his later films, they are not at all flashy and hardly have any blood in them. Pulp Fiction wasn't violent at all. And Jackie Brown had absolutely no blood on screen.Reservoir Dogs sucked, but I think it was QT's ""gateway"" into greatness. Long Live Tarantino. Can't wait to see ""Kill Bill.""Rating - 5",Reservoir Dogs
679,sirhiram,"Disjointed, Unappealing Flick (Quasi-Spoiler)",4,25 February 2003,"*Spoiler* Quentin Tarentino has the habit of using an uneven timeline for his movies. While I thought his subsequent movie, ""Pulp Fiction"" was quite good, I wish he followed the timeline as the events occurred.  Sometimes it is necessary to jump around in time from scene to scene.  In this movie, it was unnecessary.  He could have easily started from the beginning and shown the movie in the order the events occurred.  The average moviegoer would not like this movie and would be more appealing to the avante garde film buff. While this movie is certainly original, that does not make it good.  The plot was difficult to follow and had minimal enjoyable moments.  While some of the scenes were intense, it is definitely not a feel good movie.",Reservoir Dogs
680,OppressedWriter,A knockout debut from Quentin Tarantino.,10,22 April 2003,"First things first lets drop the argument that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a blatant copy of Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire.""  While Quentin Tarantino outright steals some concepts, ultimately ""Reservoir Dogs"" its own kind of animal. Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a dramatically better film; ""City on Fire"" is a gritty, but ultimately forgettable film that has suppressed potential. ""Reservoir Dogs"" takes the suppressed potential of a story about friendship that develops between two characters on opposite sides of the world--a common theme in Hong Kong cinema--see John Woo's cult classics: ""A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2"",""The Killer"", ""Hard Boiled--and mixes it with Tarantino's now cliche to praise dialogue.The dialogue is what makes the film sublime; the dialogue features a myriad of quotable lines: the diamond speech, the madonna monologue, the rapport between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr. Blonde (Micheal Madsen).  The film feels fresh not because it is gritty, and violent; the film takes a genre which is innately violent, and infuses it with witty dialogue.  It gives it's characters an arc not usually associated with crime films: Cynical character's who talk about day to day pop culture s**t, albeit it is a bit more vulgar--they're gangsters after all.The film doesn't just rely on dialectical laurels; the film also features a non-linear narrative which puts a refreshing spin on the typical beginning, and end archetype.  These flashbacks allow the viewer to piece together the heist; basically giving the viewer a chaotic feeling much like the films characters.  It also allows for some entertaining dialogue: the conversation between Mr. White and Mr. Pink discussing the psychotic Mr. Blonde going trigger-happy at the bank.   Their discussion paints a menacing picture in our heads; so when Mr. Blonde is finally revealed we realize his subtle, malevolent nuances.  Speaking of Mr. Blonde his torture scene is one of the most gruesome, and hilarious scenes--he listens to Steve Miller Band's ""Stuck in the Middle with You""--ever filmed""Reservoir Dogs"" is a film about witty gangsters, who seem to have a bad bout with lady bad luck.  The films mix of kinetic dialogue, ferocious filming style, and perfect choice of 70's pop music creates a film wholly it's own.  Do yourself a favor, and see the film that jump started Quentin Tarantino's successful career.",Reservoir Dogs

682,NiceGuyTommy,THE film of the 1990's!,10,14 September 2004,"Q: How many heist films start with the looters sat discussing the meaning of a pop song? Or the virtues of tipping at diners? A: One'Reservoir Dogs' is not a standard heist movie. Whereas in most cases we would be confronted with elaborate planning, all manner of hi-tech gizmos, and a slight visit to the rendezvous (maybe five minutes screen time); we get a whole movie dedicated to the rendezvous... and not a gizmo to speak of. A group of colour-coded crims get together to pull off a heist, and everything that can go wrong, goes wrong. One of them is a cop. Two die on the job. And another turns out to be a ""stone cold psycho"". In the inimitable words of Mr White (Harvey Keitel): ""You can't work with a pyschopath, you never know what those sick assholes are gonna do next"". Indeed, White's prognosis would be well followed, as we realize after the psycho - Mr Blonde - shows us what you can do with a straight razor and a policeman's ear.The film boasts a steller cast. The favourites: Keitel, Buscemi and Tim Roth. The curios: Madsen, Penn and QT himself. And the old timers: Tierney and real life crook Ed Bunker. All give great performances, helped along by brilliant writing and assured direction. Indeed, the real star of the film is Quentin Tarantino: writer, director and movie geek superstar. He has gone on to make 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown' and the 'Kill Bill' volumes. But for me, 'Reservoir Dogs' remains my favourite of his films.Favourite line: ""You gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?""

683,Mckenzie_Voice,Reservoir Dogs on my Classic List Without a Doubt,10,23 July 2013,"The reason I went to watch this film because I was on a date with a nurse at the time. She suggested this movie and I didn't even have any info on the film at the time. I was really impressed with the film because of the catchy music (wonderful soundtrack) and the witty and sometimes close to the edge lines. Lots of swearing throughout and I remember at the time saying to people you should see this film. Some people didn't see it because of the violence and the swearing. I remember telling people that if you were robbing a bank and you got shot and was bleeding to death then you would be swearing, so I think it captured the real life of a criminal before the likes of films like Snatch. You get shot, you're gonna swear, You listen to music, so you're gonna talk about Madonna.A masterpiece still today and though Tarantino's other films like Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Bastards get some rave reviews, this was the film that brought him to the fore.My date unfortunately didn't last as long as Mr Brown in the movie!

685,NewandykeFreddie,Perfection.,10,4 February 2017,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, comedy, action and witty dialogue. It also is not too short and not too long, in that it does not drag on with useless scenes. I feel that every bit of screen time is utilized to the max.Six men who know nothing about each other, and only identify each other by their assigned colours, plan to steal a shipment of diamonds from a diamond wholesaler's. The heist itself is not shown and we can only piece together what might have happened from the stories the men relay afterwards. This causes a bit of a Rashomon effect, in that we don't really know %100 what may have happened. It becomes increasingly apparent that there is an undercover cop lurking among the misters and they must find out who it is before it's too late. The resulting consequences will go down in cinematic history.I have seen this movie at least 10-15 times just in the past year. I definitely would recommend this movie to absolutely anybody.

The juxtaposition of different times is highly effective in this movie, as it gives more information about what is happening as the movie progresses.
The few locations and resource demanding aspects, are not missed in this movie because of the great dialogue and story that this movie has.
I highly recommend this movie",Reservoir Dogs
688,minx-pietz,"very good, worth watching",10,7 April 2007,"The film is set in a warehouse, in which a group of men hide out after a diamond heist went wrong. You know there's no way out for these characters, and as the film progresses, you learn more about their situation, and more about the different characters.I like to think I know a lot about films, although I often get the feeling that the reasons why I think I like them are wrong, and someones going to laugh at me and tell me I got the completely wrong idea about the film. Nevertheless, I am going to say why I liked reservoir dogs so much. The film begins with a very calm, friendly atmosphere, introducing the characters as if it were a day like any other. It then jumps to a very dramatic scene, one of my favourites in the film, showing that, and all the characters involved knew this, this day was definitely not normal. I love this scene so much because the acting seems so realistic, and the dying Mr.orange seems so convincing as a dying man, it really cut straight through to my emotions. I like how it isn't made to seem graceful, or sudden, as many films do, and this writhing agony seems a lot more realistic to me. Mr white reacts in a way i also love, speaking to him almost in a way you would to a panicking child, with a slightly tuneful side. This discreetly introduces the characters of Mr. orange as vulnerable, perhaps new to these situations, like a child, and Mr. white as more experienced, more focused on the situation, although a note of panic can be detected in his own voice, showing that this situation is also distressing for him.As the film progresses more characters are introduced, and we learn how their human side corrupts their professional side: I find this more realistic, as a film such as mission impossible may show people within the profession easily cutting out any human emotions from their job, whereas this shows how realistically that is a lot more difficult for them. The more caring side to these characters, or the side of them that we could understand most of, is the side that destroys them all in the end. The character who at the beginning it is easy to despise, Mr. Pink, the person who seems most heartless and selfish, is in that way the most professional, and I find it distressing to find at the end that this character I hated the most is the only surviving character. I think it more true to real life that the ""good guys"" don't always win. It is also more true to life that who is good and who is bad is less clear. Mr. Orange is the legally decent character, although the way that he is introduced in the middle of the film makes him appear to have betrayed us in what we as the viewers have first thought of him as, and also betrayed the gangsters who have put their trust in him, especially Mr White, the man who put his life on the line for him. Mr White, although a criminal and morally ""bad"" person, still has some caring characteristics, such as defending Mr. Orange.This is just what I think of the film, its probably either completely wrong or completely obvious to everyone else to the extent that they want to beat me repeatedly round the head, but I just thought I'd put it anyway.",Reservoir Dogs
689,shinigmailight,Overrated!,3,31 May 2020,"There was nothing special or spectacular about this movie unlike ""Pulp Fiction."" This movie is not that great in comparison to other Tarentino movies. It's still worth a watch if you're fan of Tarentino, but the movie has a very vague storyline and too dramatic at times especially the ending. The ending don't make sense.",Reservoir Dogs
690,stoned_bunnies,Maybe Tarantino's best...,10,10 June 2006,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is, of course, the movie that lifted the legendary director Quentin Tarantino up to the A-list and is what paved the path for such movies as ""Snatch"". I suppose I do have a biased opinion of the movie, as Quentin Tarantino was on my list of favorite directors from having seen his other movies (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Jackie Brown) but I also have legitimate reasons to have absolutely adored this one.There are seven main characters in all; Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Eddie Nice Guy (the late Chris Penn) and finally, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney).So here's the main summary: Joe, the boss, has assembled all the other main characters to steal a bag of diamonds for him. He assigns them color-coded aliases to hide their identities from being known even to each other, just to avoid any slip-of-the-tongues with cops or maybe even a rat in the group. But something in their plan to steal the diamonds went very wrong. One by one, the surviving men find their way back to their warehouse hideout, which is where almost the entire movie takes place. There, they try to find the traitor among them who tipped off the police and chaos strikes. There's a lot of blood, sudden outbursts, confrontations, disloyalty, unexpected fights and a lot of dark humor during this time. In all, it is a violent movie with clever and funny dialog, and with a great ""Sounds Of 'Seventies"" soundtrack. The ending is also unexpectedly moving (well, I haven't really given anything away!). No one could ever get bored during this movie (or any other Tarantino movie for that matter) because the dialog is just so perfectly conversational and spot-on. I know that I said this before, but I had to say it again. The witty and realistic conversation in the first scene in which Tarantino's character, Mr. Brown, dissects Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" is simply hilarious. You'll find yourself laughing smugly during the entire movie.Also, every single one of the actors portrayed their characters extremely well. Harvey Keitel really proved himself an amazing actor to me in this movie. I was never much of a fan of his until I'd seen ""Reservoir Dogs"" (his role in ""Taxi Driver"" wasn't too challenging and in ""Mean Streets"" he was just annoying really). His character was compassionate and bad-ass all at once, and both those adjectives are very contradicting so for him to have done the amazing job he did do by playing them at the same time, I would have to cheer loudly for Keitel. Tim Roth was also wonderful and I can't say why without having to give most of the movie away. But if you watch it, you'll know what I mean.To be honest, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this movie. (Okay, so seeing an ear being cut off wasn't exactly my cup of tea but that's probably the only criticism.) A definite favorite, and a classic.",Reservoir Dogs

By showing flashbacks we get to see an objective view of the person's character. Then suddenly the snatcher betrays him, and the story develops to the tragical anti-climax.By making this low-budget movie, Tarantino shows he is superb. The structure is outstanding (great use of flash-backs and flash-forwards), the music is outstanding (this movie is responsible for the come-back of the George Baker Selection), the players perform high skill acting (Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen), the dialogues are stunning (very bad language, but isn't that realistic in these 'cultures'?).Bottomline: if you haven't seen it yet, see it; it's a must-see.",Reservoir Dogs

It was being played at the University of Panama theater along with some John Woo's and Takeshi Kitano's movies.  I could only watch one of the show and I selected this one.  It would be my first experience with hyper-violent movies and I didn't know what to wait.  I hate Stallone, Seagal, Van Damme, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis' action movies, and I feared this could be another action flick.  But thanks God it wasn't.  It turned to be a wonderful movie full of interesting characters, with a coherent plot (something that most movies lack of) and intelligent dialogues.  It just made me see movies in an entirely different way.  It may sound silly for some of you, but this movie really touches me.  I understood perfectly Mr. White feelings, as well as I understood why Mr. Orange told him the truth at the end. Since that day I am more exigent with the movies I see; it made me see that there can still be made good movies, intelligent movies; and those are the only ones I want to see, because those are the only ones I deserve. I know, this is not a proper review, and maybe it is too sentimental for this kind of movie, but I just wanted to share with all of you what this movie did for this young woman here in Panama.

695,lanceaugust1,"Distinct characters, witty dialogue, bullets & blood",9,31 May 2019,"Tarantino's love of genre, his deep understanding of the importance of genre to storytelling on film is evident in 'Reservoir Dogs'. It is hard to believe this is his first movie: an argument can be made that it is still his best. The casting is excellent: Lawrence Tierney as the mob boss, Madsen as the psycho, Keitel as the career criminal (who wants to get tacos after casing the jewel heist). This film gets better with repeated viewing. High-priced talent would not have made this a better movie, in fact movie stars probably would have diminished its brilliance. (Tarantino's casting acumen is also evident in 'Jackie Brown'). The story is told episodically, delving into each character's connection to this heist. As events unfold, and people die, the stakes are raised to a boiling point. Deception, betrayal, mis-placed loyalty, depraved violence ensue in a truly satisfying drama.",Reservoir Dogs

In the mean time, I am in awe of the man's utter brilliance and grasp on dialogue.  This film actually makes the antagonists (GASP) human.  No one actor breaks away from the pack in this film since it seems their natural banter and characterization are united. It is an ensemble piece sort of ""The Big Chill"" on crack.  Yet every aspect is filled with whimsy and genius.  Tarantino's blatant disregard for feelings and the faint are exhibited through many a grotesque torture and shoot out scenes.  While making the most violent piece of cinema ever, Tarantino ultimately launches in to an anti-violence tirade made relevant by exposing the utter evil and absurdity of death.",Reservoir Dogs

700,astridgelmini,"Are you gonna bark all day, lil' doggie, or are you gonna bite? No, Mr.blonde, I'm gonna explain why this movie is a masterpiece.",9,28 July 2021,"From the beginning, Reservoir Dogs is a violent and bloody thriller directed and written by Quentin Tarantino in 1992. This film includes funny and brilliant dialogues, a powerful cast (the strong performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madesen), the most sadistic scene of torture I ever seen, a director's cameo in a minor role, beautiful music and a WTF final.Although the low budget, the simple location and the simple story, this film is an extraordinary debut, I mean, he made himself remembered.The style of the director is full of inspiration for me, how he moves the camera, how he put the music and the effects, everything.The feeling you get when you watch the debut of a great director, knowing how far he has gone, is WOW, I mean, the first film from QT is something important.So, the story is simple to understand, it is about another robbery gone wrong because of a cop infiltrated in the gang.We don't see the robbery, but we know the most important information listening to the characters talking and screaming panicked to each other.In this movie the intro-scene in a restaurant is in contrast with the absurd final.To add this, the plot isn't chronological, the facts about the gang (how the members are inside it and their story) are told after the robbery. You can think it's a confused film, but it isn't.Although, in some strange way, in the beginning, the characters are close to each other maybe as a group of friends, for feel this, helps a lot the master shot in this scene the camera movement around their table. But after no, they suspect between themselves.The relationship between the characters is simple, only for work even if sometimes they talk and act like friends.After all, I think they are good persons, in particular Mr. White in contrast with Mr. Pink who is egoistic and thinks only how to save his skin and how to earn. My favorite is Mr. Blonde, I like how he talks, how he is sarcastic and psycho.Changing argument, I LOVE the music in this film, everything is connected by the radio program K-Billy's Super sound from the 70s.For example: how Quentin Tarantino presents the characters is something special, I mean, I watched that scene like a hundred times (and I'm not kidding).They walk in slow motion towards the robbery (but only after you realized towards what) on the notes the song Little green bag.If we analyze this, we have first the screen all black with some credits and in the background the voice of K-Billy, then a wide shot where the gang walks from right to left of the frame. Later every character framed in a close-up and below the actor's name.First Harvey Keitel's Mr. White, second Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde, then Chris Penn's Nice Guy Eddie, Steve Buscemi's Mr. Pink, Lawrence Tierney's Joe, Eddie Bunker's Blue, Quentin Tarantino's Brown and finally Tim Roth's Mr. Orange.After this we have another wide shot which in this appears the title of the film, then credits later interrupted by the Mr. Orange's screams.I love a lot the fact that Tarantino does this effects also in Pulp Fiction, he begins immediately the film with the dialogues and then he interrupted it with the credits paired the music, the music..., I don't know how to describe it, maybe ""strange"" or ""exotic"".Another example is when Blonde is going to torture a cop, Blonde put on the K-Billy's program and then begins the song Stuck in the middle with you. The character interacts with the music, he dances, he sings, and we feel fascinated by the power of music.For finish the talk about music, even sometimes it fit ""wrong"" with the scene, the director makes it, in a word, perfect.I admit, before watching this movie I was skeptical about it but now I totally changed my mind and I love it, especially for the confused and intense final and why not, also the plot.For concluding, I like this movie a lot and on 10 stars I would give 9.Thanks for reading until this point :D""You know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses""

There are so many memorable quotes in this movie, I lose count.Now I'm not going to pretend that it's a perfect movie, because it's not. The movie is essentially an hour and a half of listening to people talk. There is not much action to be seen. Most of it is only talked about and never shown on screen. As well written as this movie is, I wish it were longer. Many of the most interesting characters are left without much of a backstory. I know the stories of Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, but what about White and Pink? Those are two very interesting characters that I would love to know more about.Fortunately, these complaints are small and don't make a great impact on my feelings for this movie. The lack of action is a very unique feature in a heist film. The fact that the heist is never shown to the audience means that the viewers must decide for themselves what went on that day.Anyway, words cannot describe my love of this film.

708,WarriorAlien,"Tarantino's First Film, and an awesome one at that.",10,21 November 2003,"Quentin Tarantino is a genius. He is able to take the violence, the obscene, a well-thought of plot, and humour, and mix them together to make a wonderful film. The first of these films he made was Resevoir Dogs.RD takes place in Los Angeles in 1992. A crime-boss named Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, 'Nice Guy' Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn), have gathered together six experienced crooks to pull off a diamond heist. Under Joe's orders, they are not to reveal their names to each other. From then on, they're known as Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself). Everything is planned out perfectly, but when the heist takes place, alarms unexpectedly go off, and everything goes to Hell. Police arrive, Brown and Blue are killed, and the survivors get separated, leaving White with a shot and severly bleeding Orange. White brings his wounded partner to a warehouse, where Pink arrives, and eventually Blonde shows up as well. Pink theorizes that the heist was too well-thought out to fail, and that one of the six men was an undercover cop, who informed the rest of the police. Suspicions grow, leading to the Mexican Standoff climax between White, Joe and Eddie. Overall, Resevoir Dogs put Tarantino on the map as a great director and storywriter. Each character develops his own personal attitude. White and Orange form a father-son relationship, respectively. Pink is cocky and paranoid, Blonde is calm, sadistic, and truly a psycho, this showing in the vomit-inducing cop torturing scene. I rate this film 10/10, for it's non-linear style and a plot as well-developed as the diamond robbery.",Reservoir Dogs

Essentially a character based piece, Reservoir Dogs tracks the fortunes of a group of robbers after a heist on a jewellery store.  The movie caused controversy when released as it contains some disturbing scenes, but as with all Tarantino offerings, most of the violence is off screen, allowing the audience to think about what is actually happening, rather than showing them it in the flesh.
This is a movie that would be hard to follow, and must go down as one of the greatest directional debuts ever.BEST ACTOR: STEVE BUSCEMI is outstanding, delivering a comic feel to his role.  There are a lot of good performances in this movie, especially Michael Madsens, but Buscemi's is so elaborate that he stands out in a crowded room.  BEST ACTRESS: No females of importance in the movie.  BEST SCENE: Without doubt, Madsens ear chopping scene to the beat of 'stuck the middle with you'.

Tim Roth's performance as Orange is often overlooked for some reason(kind of like Roth himself). Michael Madsen is scary as Mr. Blonde and that's a good thing seeing as how Blonde is a psycho.The actors actually become their characters.

This is definitely one of the best films made in recent memory and the film that alerted Hollywood to the writing and directing talents of Quentin Tarantino. Superbly acted throughout by all the cast especially Steve Buscemi and Micheal Madsen and with instantly quotable dialogue, this film really is happy relief from all the effects bloated, studio films that the cinema is full of these days.The extra special thing about the dialogue in this film is how real it is. The characters are like average people you would see around on the street and they talk about average things like tipping or the real meaning behind Madonna's Like a Prayer. (Hilarious scene!). The issue about the violence is a dumb one. Contrary to popular belief, there isn't a whole lot of violence in it. And the big controversial scene (the ear chopping sequence) isn't even on camera!In conclusion, this movie is incredible in a low key way. It shows that you don't need a massive budget or loads of special effects to make a brilliant movie. This film is timeless and will definitely be in top 100 movies lists for decades to come.

724,Andrew!,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is the birth of a new CINEMA",8,10 July 2000,"An incredible piece of work for it's time. A true inspiration for new filmmakers and even veterans of the art. I am still amazed at the myriad of details behind the making of the film. Originally slated to be a $35,000 movie (profits earned from Tarrantino's sold screenplays-""Natural Born Killers"" & ""True Romance""), it was given a shot in the arm by Harvey Keitel, who somehow managed to get a peek at it. he liked the script so much, that he helped raise the $400,000 budget (while taking a huge cut in pay himself). This is a movie with such ENERGY. A film that screams out for repeated viewings. Try it sometime. Watch it over the course of a month, 3 times, and you will see something new every time. There is a layer of details under almost every sentence. *(SPOILER AHEAD!!!)* For instance, at the opening scene, when they're sitting around the table talking. Each individual's character is revealed totally by what they say. Keitel's character conflict's with ""Joe"" (by taking away his book and stubbornly NOT returning it), this is a clue to the end confrontation. Michael Madsen's character seems slightly trigger happy (""should I shoot this guy over here?""). And Steve Buscemi's ""Mr. Pink"", is the only one who strives to stick to his personal creed of professionalism (""I don't tip-I don't believe in it""). Also watch for the ""rat"" amongst the group. He's the guy who tells Joe who wouldn't leave the tip. It only ten minutes into the movie and all of the characters are completely defined and played out like a card hand. But you don't notice this. And even if you do, you don't care, because you're so enthralled with these crazy, colorful guys! Then there's the FINAL shootout, do you really know who shot chris penn's character? DID Mr. Pink get away? What does the orange balloon mean? *(SPOILER FINISHED)* There are a ton of ""hidden"" details and stories behind the characters and motivations that make this movie so rich with life, but this is not the place for them all. If you are interested in more, I urge you to find the literally dozens of well put-together fan sites out there filled with much more than i could ever write here. Also, i have to say, I love the new take on the contemporary mafia. I could talk for hours about this film, but if you haven't seen this one-I encourage you to go get it,see it, and if you're a fan of Quinten Tarrantino even in the slightest, you won't regret it.

Always a great combination for a good movie, but the addition of a razor blade and an ear have made this movie a 'band apart' from the rest.A lot of hype surrounded this movie. In the UK the BBFC withheld its video release for a year! It begs the question- did they actually watch it 'til the end?Violence is definately a major factor, but it seems to do the opposite of glamourize it. Tarantino proves his greatness with this movie, the contrasts and similarities of good vs. evil, law vs. crime are perfect. The famous 'ear' scene (which incidently was shot twice- once using a close up shot and the other the more artistic 'lookaway' shot- Tarantino opting for the latter) is great. What makes it stand out is the song and the dance of Mr Blonde. Michael Madsen is excellent as the psychopathic gang member.If you still haven't seen this movie- go and get it.

CAST:
Harvey Keitel as Mr. White/Larry Dimmick

Chris Penn as ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabot
Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink
Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot
Randy Brooks as Holdaway
Kirk Baltz as Marvin Nash
Edward Bunker as Mr. Blue
Quentin Tarantino as Mr. BrownREVIEW:
Six criminals who are completely stranger to each other are hired by Joe Cabot to carry out a Diamond Robbery. Right at the beginning, they were given some false names so that they don't get too attached to each other and focus only on their assigned job. Mr. White, a professional criminal; Mr. Orange, a young newcomer; Mr. Blonde, a trigger-happy killer; Mr. Pink, a paranoid neurotic; Mr. Brown; and Mr. Blue But the plan starts to fall apart when the alarm is tripped and the cops show up within moments. Of the group of men, all of whom are identified by colours, only four survive with one being seriously wounded. It is suspected that there is a police informant in the group, but no one is sure who it is.This was certainly cutting edge for its time and I believe the editing and sequencing of the film is still used in our time. The narrative structure of movies has undergone radical change in modern film, and I'm not sure if this film is chiefly responsible, but it's certainly there in the grammar of modern film. It's quite ingenious how it's put together, and how it's explained, this film of crooks and hoods planning a jewellery robbery that is hamstrung from the get-go. Hamstrung because one of the hoods/crooks is actually a cop that has infiltrated the group. It appears to be a random film, but it is only random in the sense that the order of the narrative is shuffled around. The narrative itself isn't or we'd probably be entering the world of the nonsensical.So, there's plenty of brain power behind this, and there's humour here too, but the aftershocks of the violent acts are quite disturbing. Tarantino dwells on blood and the physical and emotional aftermath of acts of violence to an extent that it could almost be a poster call (Tarantino's poster call) for anti-violence in the movies. It is quite hard to look at without turning away because he plays on acts of violence and their aftermath for such extended lengths of time. That's one of my personal arguments against this particular Tarantino film. Another would be his extensive and prolific use of obscenity which hits the registers as his violence does. He overdoes it. And he does make you feel it in ways you don't want to feel it. He gives violence and obscenity a bad name not because he uses it, but because he dwells on it extensively and purposefully. A third negative for me is that I found it hard to picture Tarantino as one of the hoods/crooks picked for the jewellery heist. Him sitting around the dinner table with the other hoods/crooks clasping coffee mug with both hands looked strangely out of place with the other hoods/crooks. He's certainly got some imaginative ideas about making film though - his editing, his story idea of a jewellery robbery given a modern make-over, his crook/hoods pointing their guns at one another, his choice of popular music soundtrack, his opening credits of the hoods/crooks walking in their dark suits in slow-motion, his actors which are all quite capable and sometimes funny. Hence four stars. This is something new. New and fairly raw.
Well this movie has adapted a new and very unique technique of storytelling in its time, which feels fresh till today, even after almost 3 decades of the film being released. And if we look back in time it can be called a tribute to Tarantino by himself as the film is characterised by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, aestheticisation of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film. It had almost all the ""TARRANTINO EFFECTS""
It is a must watch for all the movie lovers out there and the screenplay which should be studied by all aspiring directors and Screenplay writers. I have read the screenplay and I personally think that a seldom a 90 minutes screenplay has so detailed narration. the screenplay is full of witty and quotable dialogue (""Mr. Brown? That sounds too much like Mr. S**t."")",Reservoir Dogs

'Reservoir Dogs' is much more raw, more dependent on dialog, and perhaps slightly less interesting to look at.  I will admit that I originally saw this movie hoping for it to be another 'Pulp Fiction', but discovered it to be a much more simple and enjoyable movie.The entire cast shines in this movie, especially Tim Roth, playing such an incredible American character that I completely forgot that he was a Brit.

The characters were cool as i had come to expect after watching pulp fiction, but i would much rather watch pulp fiction again than watch reservoir dogs again, largely because in reservoir dogs not much goes on despite some interestin moments. i think that reservoir dogs doesn't live up to the rep i had been made to feel it would deliver to. The range of scenarios was to simplistic, there was large parts where nothing but waiting for people to arrive happens and the overuse of the word fock to make some men sound hard is annoying. the banter is funny tho. overall the films average to good, definitely worth seeing once so you know what its all about but its def not my favourite film as it lacks the wow factor, scope etc but won me over in terms of style. 6/10. i'd like to think i'm mr blonde.hah, well maybe not",Reservoir Dogs

736,filmfancritic,Great references,10,10 October 2006,"The reasons I hold this film so dear to my heart are numerous.I should firstly say that all of Tino's films are brilliantly entertaining, but even more importantly shot in a visual style that arguably no modern director with the possible exceptions of Fincher and Mann can rival.Heat was a great movie, Fight club even better, Reservoir dogs better still.I can compare Reservoir Dogs to good Theatre seen through the eyes of a great camera.The film is very witty, but in a banal everyday sort of way. The camera watches but never judges. Masden sits down instead of stands because he can't be bothered to get up. Keitel closes the door in the background because it opens by accident.References to Lee Marvin (extremely funny in Paint your Wagon)are made, Buscemi shines, Roth is truly believable as the cop/amateur thief. Keital well Keital is just a movie icon and Masden is truly frightening/but never amusing. Who have I left out.The opening is possibly like no other. Funny, brave and truly original. The opening theme is just so cool you want to stop it play it back and then write an essay on the beauty of image and soundtrack.Who designed the set? It works brilliantly, so simple yet the perfect hiding place for a bungled heist. The only crime (pun intended) is that this movie doesn't beat other opposition to land itself in the top 10.Incidentally this is not even my favourite Tino film.That's Jackie Brown.Could Fincher have done as good a job? perhaps.",Reservoir Dogs

739,theplanetsmasher1,One Word: Awesome,10,23 June 2004,"This movie, quite simply stated, is awesome. The characters are quick-witted and fierce and the action is taught. There is never a dull moment in the entire movie. Reservoir Dogs is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and still not get tired of. The plot centers around a group of six crooks and their ""bosses"", Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. Specifically, it focuses on the bloody aftermath of a gone-wrong jewelery heist in an abandoned warehouse. Specifically, Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Orange. Throughout the story, flashbacks of how Mr. Blonde, White, and Orange came into the job.The movie contains some violent scenes but not very gratuitous. The dismemberment of a police officer's ear is the most graphic, but it is the camera closeups of Marvin Nash and the taunting music that makes it more disturbing. Other conventional gun fights take place. In the beginning there is sexual content as the men talk about the true meaning of ""Like a Virgin"". But the most of the objectionable content is in the language. The men use f*ck close to 300 times along with s*it, n*gger, wetback, and other obscenities. But extreme as this may seem, it is no reason not to watch this movie.What really drew me to this movie is not it's cinematic ""quality"" per-say. It was the raw power and ferocity it contained. It was real, raw, and exciting. THere is no sugar-coating to make a gangsters life seem ""cool"" or ""hip"". You see the true nature of crime. To really understand how much i like this movie please watch it. I can safely say that you won't be disappointed. Grade: 10/10",Reservoir Dogs
740,MoonwalkerFairy,Tribute to Tarantino,9,12 June 2004,"Once upon a time, in the bleak, dark days of yesteryear films lacked power and interest.  Then along came a man who would change the filming industry, Quentin Tarantino.  Reservoir Dogs, truly is a tribute to filming.  This risque modern day gangster epic simply blew me away.  The scriptwriting in impeccible and the character format - using colours for each character - was genius.Harvey Keitel's performance as Mr White is astounding.  It was here where he became a gangster hero, in true Tarantino style!  This is a proper mind thriller, the greusome scenes which Michael Madsen, as Mr Blond are phenomenally brilliant, albeit quite disturbing!  However this lucid torture is accompanied by a now very memorable song 'Stuck In The Middle With You' - Stealers Wheel.  The juxtaposition between the torture and the song is pure genius!  Steve Buscemi manages to steal the show once again, as the unforgettable Mr Pink.  He makes his mark with his usual witty comedy and his humourous appearance.  However the thing that makes the film is Tarantino's small part during the first few scenes.  He plays the ill-mannered Mr Brown.  His philosophical outlook on the Madonna song 'Like A Virgin' is classic genius in itself. Never again will you be miffed as to what the lyrics mean, as he shrewdly and crudely depicts the true meaning behind the words.",Reservoir Dogs

They are ambushed by cops at the jewelry store where the heist was going to go down. The only people who know their plan are amongst them. Everyone is trying to find out ""Who done it"" and the only person they are sure about are themselves. Is it the psychopathic murderer, Mr. Blonde? Is it the looking out for himself only, Mr. Pink?

They meet, don't know each other, and don't tell each other their names. The dialogue between the characters sets up how they react to each other. When the heist goes awry they know they have a snitch in the group. They need to figure out who it is and get rid of them. As the cops close in and they have a member down they have to make a decision. The story is gripping without even having to show any of the heist.

Personally, it took me about a month for the movie to fully sink in. It's screenplay is streamlined; optimal, efficient, yet fully effective. The performances from the likes of Buscemi and Roth are of the highest quality. Don't watch this film expecting to see a heist movie. It unfolds into so much more: a character study, mainly. This is easily one of my top 10 screenplays, and definitely my favorite Tarantino work, over his slightly overrated, in my opinion, 1994 work, Pulp Fiction, which arguably was quite nuanced and well executed, but it lacks the simple nuance and smartness of Reservoir Dogs, which is blunt, pure and clever storytelling. I'd recommend this movie to anybody who loves the craft of telling a story, whether it be writing a novel, a song, or a screenplay. Tarantino knows how to do it, and well.",Reservoir Dogs
746,lonysimbasa,"Larry, stop pointing that f****** gun at my Dad!",8,26 July 2016,"Ever since I was a little kid, Back to the Future was the s***! For years, I tried to find out how to actually build a DeLorean time machine, or any time machine. I practically lived and breathed time travel, and I still somewhat do. But, after years of watching movies, seeing nothing that could compare to Michael J. Fox. Out popped a movie that was minimalist and natural. My new favorite movie ever.Plot - 6 guys robbed a bank under the guise of colors. They are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Blue. They were hired by two guys Joe Cabot and Nice Guy Eddie. S*** goes down, Orange is shot and Blue and Brown die. The guys start wondering how the cops got there so quick. They begin to suspect that there is a rat/cop within their group. There is nothing wrong with the plot except that, they only slick back their hair in order to mask themselves. Who is to say that not one person would see your face. They have artist renderings. Also the plot is sort of borrowed from City on Fire (1987) and Kansas City Confidential. 7/10Acting - The acting in this movie is superb. That can be credited to the fact that the dialogue is extremely relaxed and realistic. Props to the opening diner scene, where they discuss Like a Virgin and how it's all about d***. Tarantino had a sort of style that you're all familiar with. It's sort of laid back and the characters talk about stuff not important to the plot. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi are the best ones. Tim Roth would be the same, if it weren't for the scene where he's bleeding in the car. Keitel, Penn, Bunker, and Tarantino are good. I heard Lawrence Tierney was a pain on set, but he's not that bad. 9/10Set Design/Location Shoot - There are barely any locations in this movie. There is the warehouse, the diner, Joe's office, the bar, and another diner. It's really nothing to brag about, though the minimalist is just amazing, as Tarantino shows he does not need a bunch of locations to make a great movie. That warehouse is also pretty memorable. 7/10 Cinematography - I really don't like reviewing this part of any movie, as I feel that it is so mundane and uninteresting. I completely skipped it over in my An Extremely Goofy Movie review and my still not submitted Beauty and the Beast review. I however include it, as there are films that deserve for their cinematography, good or bad. The cinematography is good, not great. We see Tarantino is not an amateur with his shots, and I will mention the credits sequence and Mr. Pink's flashback. There is however, nothing great about it. 7/10 Costumes/Props - The actors all brought their own costumes, because it wasn't in the budget. Nice Guy Eddie's track jacket is actually Chris Penn's and it is hilarious. The suits add to the cool factor of the movie, the cop costumes are standard, and the guns are also standard. There's no real focus on the costumes or props in this movie. 6/10 Soundtrack - My god is that soundtrack amazing. Little Green Bag is forever stuck in my head, and Stuck in the Middle With You was unbelievably awesome. Other than that, the movie is quiet for the most part. 8/10 Script/Dialogue - Like I said before, the style is very relaxed and cool. It's a really great script with realistic characters. 10/10 Characters - We don't really no much about the guys' backstory. We do know about their personalities. White (Lawrence Dimmick) is compassionate towards Orange (Freddie Newandyke) and takes the responsibility of being his mentor. He is really hurt when Freddie turns out to be the rat, and regrettably shoots him afterwards. He however, can be a killer when he needs to. I couldn't really pin down what Orange's personality is, he seemed kind of cool and scared of death, but he was mostly knocked out for most of the movie. He is also way to quick to single out Pink for not tipping, foreshadowing events to come. Blonde (Vic Vega) is a sociopath. He just doesn't care. He shoots down cops and civilians once the cops arrive a little too quickly, and he tortures a man, while at the same time dancing to 70s music. All the while, he's cool and suave, and he shows no remorse. Pink is selfish, greedy, and just wants to get the job done. He fancies himself a professional and sees Blonde as nothing more than a Psycho. We never find out his name, and yet he is the only one to survive the entire movie. Nice Guy Eddie seems like his namesake at first, but will instantly lash out if anyone threatens his dad, or if he found out his friend was trying to make off with the jewels. Joe fells every one of them is untrustworthy, so he never gives out their names. Instead he gives them colors. Although, he never gives himself or his son a code name, so he's only protecting the guys he hired and not himself. Brown and Blue were barely in the movie. We did see that Brown is very talkative. Great characters who never spout out their backstories and instead show us who they are. 9/10 Overall - It's a really good movie that borrows elements from other gangster movies. But other than that, it's fine. It's good, it's a fun movie. Mexican Standoff, awesome. And was a great movie for Tarantino to start with, unlike My Best Friend's Birthday. Inspiration comes from Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Killing (1956), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, City on Fire (1987), and Au revoir les enfants. 7.875/10, rounded is 7.88/10, rounded is 7.9/10, rounded, 8/10.",Reservoir Dogs

But all in all, this movie was incredible, especially considering its low budget. The small number of characters, together with the small number of locations make it feel very confined, but in a good way. It surprises and keeps you in suspense throughout the entire movie.

However, when i began to watch the film i was very interested as it began to hook me. The dialogue is brilliant. Simply superb. The only other film that matches this sort of witty, catchy and super cool dialogue is pulp fiction.The whole film is brilliant from start to finish, showing that multi million dollar explosions and car chases are no match for dynamic acting and excellent writing.As for the story, well, i wont ruin it, but it is simply brilliant.Tarintino shows off all the skills and tricks he wanted to show off all the years he dreamed of becoming an director.If you are passionate about films, you Must see this.The actors in this film do not get enough credit, nor does the genius behind the film, the director.",Reservoir Dogs

But when making Reservoir Dogs, he was (in my opinion) maybe just searching for the borders of what other directors did not dare to do. A movie as RD with (just) a strong focus on violence is not enough for me to give it a high rating. Of course the acting and directing was very good, but I was missing a real strong script. And thats why I could not enjoy this movie and was just very disappointed because my expectations were very high (also based on the high rating on IMDB).

""Reservoir Dogs"" is an unabashed homage to heist films and Murphy's law: everything can and will go wrong! Oh, but what fun it is watching everything go wrong. Not that this film should be taken lightly, as it is quite disturbing in it's language, gore, and brilliant suggestions of maniacal violence. This film was, in my opinion, a breakout for most of the actors. But two in particular steal the movie: Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blond. Harvey Keitel, of course, is a human tornado and gives a requisite tour de force performance. But by 1992, anyone who knew Keitel's work expects him to be great. It's the actors that were lesser known that really kicked in the door. Not to take anything away from the other performers, but the movie truly belongs to Keitel, Madsen, and Buscemi (Tim Roth has been better, so I won't really mention him). When you do see this movie, or if you already have, don't be fooled into thinking it completely original. I suggest you take a look at an older (and better) Kubrick film ""The Killing"".

Many IMDb users voted this movie a ""10"", and for the life of me, I cannot see how this film remotely compares to any of the three ""Godfather"" movies (among my favorites), ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Platoon"", or even ""Scarface"". If not presented in the broken, nearly reversed chronological order, there would be virtually no plot, and very thin character development.WARNING - Spoiler section....I'm not one adversely affected by violence in films, but the torture scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" really put me off. It seemed realistic and sadistic, but I can't say that I was entertained. (I know, I probably wasn't supposed to be entertained at that point.)I had issues with a couple of the plot developments, and believe me, there were very few plot developments. First, I was rather dismayed at the idea that Harvey Keitel's character could stand against his long-time friends, Joe and Eddie Cabot, to the point of gunning them down, all while trying to protect someone he virtually did not know, and who could easily (and did) turn out to be the informer/cop. Then, if that weren't silly enough, the undercover cop (Tim Roth's character, Mr. Orange, I believe) tells Harvey Keitel (Mr. White) that he's a cop. What could have motivated such a move? Did he want to make Mr. White feel bad for saving his life? Did he have a death wish? I think my mouth fell open trying to figure that one out. In the end, I just lumped it into the category of ""no plot"" and moved on.My last negative comment relates to the lengthy, meaningless, inane banter between the thugs around the breakfast table and in the car. It may reflect real life, but so does mowing the lawn. Neither situation is terribly fun to watch for several minutes on film.On the positive side, I thought the movie was well acted, especially by Steve Buscemi. It was certainly realistic, and the chopped, reverse chronology turned a nearly non-existent plot into a bit of a mystery. Overall, I'd rate this movie a 4 out of 10.",Reservoir Dogs

I found it quite overrated. All the praise over this movie is misleading. It is also a matter of taste to whether you would like it or not.

I think this is one of the absolutely best films I've ever seen. The first time I saw it I was like 10 years old and like it OK, probably because of the violence. But when I saw it in the stores a year ago I got flashbacks of it that just said to me that I should buy it. And I saw the flick again and completely fell in love with it. It's such a masterpiece I can't find good synonymous words explaining it. Most people would say that it's only full of violence and blood, and I agree. But it's the way all the blood and violence is presented to you that's fascinating, it's pure art. And the favourite parts besides the violence are the incredibly cool scenes like when Tim Roth(Mr.Orange, the cop) is about to take a piss in ""the commote""-scene. He enters the room full of cops and a narc-dog which is barking at him, and when he explains how he feels about standing in that room with narcotics on him is one of the absolutely coolest scenes I can ever come to think of. If you see it you'll know what I mean, it's a stunning classic scene. But the best part is that the film is absolutely full of such groundbreaking scenes, one of those is the torture-scene, another fine classic. If you haven't seen it and you're a bit esthetic in your blood, you as I, will completely love it. If I have to give it stars which I think might be missleading I'd have to say that this is a definite 10/10!",Reservoir Dogs

He gives them names: Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue. The heist goes terribly wrong because they got ""set-up"". Now they must try to find out who did it.The movie itself doesn't show anything of the heist itself which is quite unique... You only get to see what happens after and what happens before in the form of flashbacks. The movie is often critizised for being too violent. I do admit the movie is violent.. but isn't all that bad. Violence is a thing that this movie has a lot of, but it isn't allways very graphic. Most of the violence happens off-screen, for example, the famous ear cutting scene.Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's movie debut, which is impressive. Pulp Fiction made the man immortal.

Extreme violence presents itself from the get go, but it makes the movie, it is done in a fashion that makes you want for more, rather then lean back in your seat.Tarantino has triumphed in what was his first movie, and it deserves better recognition.

I'm not going to go into deep detail about the movie because it would be a shame to ruin it for people who haven't yet had the pleasure to see it.The way time travels back and fourth throughout the film is so perfect that you cant help but just get completely lost in the film.

I'd also like to think it's a Movie for everyone, but neither of these claims are anywhere near true. ""Pulp Fiction"" outclasses ""Reservoir Dogs"" in any category you can think of, and, regretfully, most people just can't appreciate the artistic merit of gallons upon gallons of blood. I'd be willing to venture, though, that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is Ground 0 for all things Tarantino. Obviously, it's his first real Film. But with witty dialogue, gruesome violence and insane quotability, pretty much all of Tarantino's trademarks are featured in style here. Say, this movie does everything Tarantino wanted on a constant 8 or 9 out of 10 level. ""Kill Bill"" would find him expanding upon the violence, for example, but at the expense of the quotability? I can think of some fairly iconic scenes from ""Kill Bill"", but quotes? Basically, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is Quentin Tarantino's most consistent Movie. It's not at all graft or bore, it's shocking and hilarious, in turn. It's just very... EFFICIENT. Tarantino's ideas and Tarantino's script and Tarantino's setting (amazingly, largely one room) are all sturdy and reliable.

What I mean is that instead of following their gut and making what could have been an amazing movie, they doubted themselves and aimed for what they felt a focus group would contend to. I honestly feel that this movie would have been so much better if they had merely gone with the impulse. The cinematography is over dramatic, which is something you don't want to do too much in suspense films, it makes them seem fake and cheesy.

If the movie didn't have any of that, you have bad writing and bad acting, with the only thing keeping the movie on it's feet is Steve Buscemi's performance (and of course a good soundtrack). Pulp Fiction is a much better movie, but that is because it has great humor, and a great script. The characters are sick in Resivoir dogs, and the script is foul.

The film opens already at the warehouse, and never fully retouches on all the events of the robbery except through dialogue. As the small ties holding the group together fray even further, impulsive actions to find the informant lead the thieves to an Mexican style standoff in which all are shot except one man. As a the police informant slowly dying is cradled by his the one man who trusted him, also dying, the informant admits his guilt, as the movie ends with a closeup on his guardian, the sound of a gunshot and police barging into the warehouse.

This is the debut film from the often controversial and always twisted director/ writer/ actor Quentin Tarantino and it delivers the punch that he is now known for. Tim Roth (as Mr. Orange) gives his best performance, but, not to be outdone, is Michael Madsen who delivers a surprisingly enticing role as Mr. Blonde. This is often considered a cult hit, as are many of his films, but cerebral plotting and a cunning screenplay keep Reservoir Dogs a must see of 1990's cinema.",Reservoir Dogs

In fact, it IS an excellent theatre play that was taped and sold to us as a movie.  It is sad that we are so preoccupied with movies that a script like this has to be wasted on one.Making matters worse is the violence.  Tarantino often uses it in his movies to get attention, and this time takes it too far.  ""Pulp Fiction's"" violence was milder and stood out less from the rest of the story, but ""Reservoir Dogs"" goes way over the top.  It is very difficult to offend me with violence yet Tarantino does just that.",Reservoir Dogs
793,badmOP,Classic Tarantino Crime Caper,10,8 March 1999,"Simply put, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This 1992 predecessor to 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly in a class by itself.  This film has been a blueprint for basically every other wanna-be-like-Tarantino movie made in the last seven or so odd years.  The acting is truly superb.  Every one of the main characters turn in top-notch performances.  Harvey Keitel's turn as the o'er-the-hill criminal MR WHITE is perhaps his best ever.  Micheal Madsen's take as the psychopathic MR BLONDE is perhaps one of the most realistically frightening performances I've ever seen.  This was truly the role he was born to play.Rounding out the cast, you have the always enjoyable Steve Buscemi (MR PINK), Tarantino favorite Tim Roth (MR ORANGE), Tarantino favorite Quentin Tarantino (MR BROWN), Chris Penn as NICE GUY EDDIE and finally.....(whew)....Lawrence Tierney as the cranky mob boss JOE CABOT. The cast is utterly superb.One aspect of Tarantino's is his ability to say so much with so little.  Though the scene involving MR BLONDE'S shooting spree is never actually seen in the film, it is all too easy to picture Micheal Madsen in his JoeKool shtick, blasting holes into anything moving with eerie unemotional detachment.   Tarantino BUILDS his characters with amazing style. (see Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, etc...)  MR WHITE'S compassionate struggle to protect and save the life of MR ORANGE is gutwrenchingly moving. True ""honor among thieves"" type stuff here.All in all, this movie is a classic.  Be cool.....man.",Reservoir Dogs

This is one of the few movies I have watched, that I really can not find a single frame that I would like to be different - and that is actually the greatest compliment that I can offer a film director... In this case Tarantino really started off with perfection and now... well we don't really hear anything from him anymore and Jackie Brown was a great movie but nothing spectacular. The scene with Michael Madsen and the poor policeman in Reservoir Dogs will haunt me for the rest of my life... never have I seen a scene so fascinating and yet so repulsive ! If you are one of those few people that haven't seen this movie, please rent it or better yet go to a movie theater where they show it... One of my best friends left the theater when I took her to see this movie - she could not stand to watch the violence - but she is also such a kind spirit... so if you only like romantic movies like Splendor in the Grass or When Harry Met Sally - then you should stay away from this one...

Reservoir Dogs delivers a tragic, emotional, and sadistic story that plays with your heart the whole way through. Whether it's a mellow conversation in a café, a tortured man's talk with his victim, or a heated flurry of insults and compromises amongst four men pointing guns at each other, every scene has believable dialogs, which Quentin has always been an expert of. The acting blew me away and every character is vibrant in his own personality. Mr. White, the moral fundamentalist, Mr. Pink, the paranoid wise ass, Mr. Blonde, the maniacal tormentor, and many others all bring their own color into the movie. Tarention's sick way of toying with violence has always been my favorite asset of his directing and it definitely come into full bloom in one scene (in which Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of a cop and prepares to burn him alive while dancing to classical seventies music). His fantastic use of dialog and speech is constantly relevant as well along with the story's complex and fun nature all come together to make a perfect movie!",Reservoir Dogs

At a first glance the usual suspects seems to be a better film but in my opinion it is not. It lacks the life that reservoir dogs has. In the opening scene they are just talking about unimportant things. Also Mr. Orange and Mr. White have a strong friendship. Mr. White takes a bullet and kills 2 of his friends to protect Mr. Orange.

There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.",Reservoir Dogs

I've seen amazing movies. The Departed, Zodiac, Goodfellas, 7even. This movie stands up there with them in that it was just amazingly written. Amazingly well screened. And amazingly well casted. If you are looking for a movie that is gangster. Crime-filled. Action-packed. And just overall ball-kicking amazing. This is the movie for you. A couple of things that took it a part from the rest is that the scenes were all very thought out and drawn out. Each scene ranged from 6 minutes to even 15 minutes. I watched this movie very late so I was tired. But even still I was drawn to the screen every second of it.The acting was absolutely impeccable. Every line was said without a stutter and showed you exactly what was going on in a crime gangster way. The language was a lot but very expected and well thought out in the moments. It fitted the situation very well which made it not stand out. There are a lot of movies out there that overdo the swearing a lot just to make it darker, which doesn't work a lot of the time. But this movie made it fit in well enough that you didn't even notice as much.The whole movie was filled with a tension and release method which made you drawn to the screen a lot like I said before.

810,Professor_Isak_Borg,Toby Wong?,10,30 April 2003,"From the hilarious opening to the perplexing blood soaked ending 'Reservoir Dogs' is a masterpeice.  It centers around five men and a robbery they will do anything to pull off.As in all of Tarantino's works, dialogue plays an important role.  Not only do the men discuss how the plan went wrong and who the rat is, but also what the intent of 'Like a Virgin' was and the reason why one doesn't care to tip their waitress.  What's really terrific about Reservoir Dogs is that it shows us things that you would never seen in another crime picture.  Such things as under-confident robbers, the glee the criminals get when torturing a poor defenseless cop, and the over-all sloppiness of the in-and-out job they were supposed to achieve.  Tarantino directs by setting the camera down in front of his actors and letting them just play the scene straight out with not that many cuts.  During acton scenes, the man is willing to and will put the camera anywhere.  The film looks beautiful.
The acting is superb.  The legendary cast includes Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, Edward Bunker, Tim Roth, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself.  All of these men do wonderful work and fit their roles perfectly.  It's as if every character was written with each actor in mind.***** (Out of 5)",Reservoir Dogs

I'm pretty sure he will crown Hateful Eight as the superior movie.Hateful Eight is better in every aspect, yet its' rating is lower.

812,p-johnson122,A Great Film,9,10 December 2008,"This movie is possibly one of Quentin Tarantino's finest films, better than Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and the rest of his films, this film is what gained him national and possibly global recognition.The film is about jewel thieves who go on to rob diamonds from a bank, but predictably the cops show up, but what goes on next is unknown, as cleverly Quentin doesn't show what happens but through dialogue we learn what happens, Mr Blonde taking civilians hostage, Mr Orange getting injured, Mr Blue getting killed and generally the rest getting split up. The majority of it taking place in a abandoned warehouse some of it taking in the the streets.I ain't going to reveal too much about the film for fear of ruining it too much for people accidentally viewing this, but this film is genius for the whole plot, sure thieves robbing banks and the cops showing up is clichéd and predictable, but it's also originally in adding humour, although it emphasises on the n-word too much for my liking, it's also really funny. The other point i'm going to make is it's genius because it shows us nothing about the actual heist itself, only through dialogue we learn about it. Let's not forget the characters: the psycho Mr Blonde, the veteran Mr White, the snitch Mr Orange, the unknown Mr Blue, the whiny little Mr Pink, the boss, the son Nice Guy Eddie Cabot and the boss Joe Cabot, they are all excellently portrayed by their actors.The last bit of my review is something negative: i want to know more about the actual heist itself and it's too short for my liking, that's why it don't earn a 10/10 .

The non-linear storyline, the violence, the profanity. I love it all. In my opinion, violence and profanity are what make a good movie. And the overall writing of the movie, so to speak.One thing that I don't understand is why this movie is named as one of the most violent films. It's violent, don't get me wrong, but it's not THAT violent. At all. There are a few violent parts but if you ask me, which you wouldn't, it's not that violent. Pulp Fiction is a different story. But all in all, Quentin Tarantino is an amazing director/screenwriter and he has been a HUGE influence in my screen writing.

The jumping around in time (and, at one point, between reality and fiction) was not too disorienting and achieved a good effect.I'm not sure if I like the acting. I can't tell whether the characters were played poorly, or if the characters' melodramatic quirkiness was supposed to be naturalistic. As such, it was believable, but just barely. Like, the characters know they were mobsters, so they subconsciously conform somewhat to the Hollywood stereotype.

Madsen in particular is brilliant in his role as the chilling Mr Blonde, the sadist with a passion for violence who mercilessly guns down the store's customers leading to the shootout. His performance as he gleefully mauls and maims the undercover cop is marvellous and you really feel pity for the cop and total revulsion for Mr Blonde. Also his brief exchanges with Mr White is one of the highlights of this movie. Keitel as Mr White fits his role as the senior gangster perfectly. Not a calculating type but a gangster with ethics if there ever is one. Roth performs very well as Mr Orange. He spends a major port of the movie in a pool of blood from the bullet wound to his gut. His performance as he convinces Joe, Eddie and most importantly Mr White of his authenticity as a criminal initially is good. Buscemi also merits a mention for his acting as the self-claimed professional criminal who first figures out that there is an informant among them and wants to flee from the meeting point as soon as possible. Penn is good, paricularly the scene where he argues with Mr Brown about Mr Blonde. Tierney does well as the boss who assembles the crew for the job.

It's very intriguing to watch all the characters development (and lack of) and see how everything all fits together in the end. Also, the sequence of events was very cool. I love how Quentin Tarantino uses the "" chapter "" format to keep us viewers in suspense as to the events. The movie itself is very..symbolical, in a way. I mean, it's about strangers trying to work together without a basic foundation, of trust. I suppose they may have trusted each other at one point, but after the robbery went horribly wrong, they could barely contain themselves. Watching them try and figure out what had happened, when they probably didn't even know themselves, was very entertaining, and I don't mean in a ' OK, Mr.Blonde, kill that guy!"" way.

Truly, I always thought that ""how can I not watch this movie"" it is a shameful thing to do for a film fan=) In many terms this movie is beyond its time. Different shot techniques, involvement of the story, dialogs, the beginning of the movie, everything was really different and good about this movie. Especially for a crime movie. But (a big one) the ""Reservoir Dogs"" is not a fluent movie. Except the scenes that Mr. Orange tells about the ""joke"", dialogs were boring, so that i wanted to skip some scenes for a several times, but i didn't.

This a great movie and I think this is the movie that inspired people to do names like Mr. Blue, Mr,orange, and etc. In the movie Mr. Blonde is the psycho one, while M. White is the compassion one, Mr.Pink in the one that wants to contain the peace, Mr. Orange is the maybe or maybe not the least expected to be a rat, and I don't know much about Mr. Brown, and Mr. Blue.",Reservoir Dogs

And my God did it blow my mind . Now I said that this movie is better than Pulp Fiction .That is mostly because this movies realism . The dialogue is so natural like Tarantinos dialogue usually is . The characters are all great and you really get invested in them and care for them . The soundtrack is great and the acting though over the top is is till excellent ˙(it goes well with the tone of the movie ). The film is also masterfully shot . I definitely recommend that you watch this film if you don t mind violence and a lot of curse words . Now let s get to the plot . So , the movie revolves around the events after the failed jewelery store robbery ( which we never see but we do hear about it ). The robbers ( our main characters ) have been setup by someone in their group They meet at an abandoned warehouse and stuff happens and we get a lot of scenes that have happened before the robbery where we get to learn more about the characters . I won t give away the rest so you can enjoy the movie without any spoiler . Hope you found the review helpful . Sorry for grammatical errors ( I m in a hurry ). Anyways watch the movie you won t regret it .",Reservoir Dogs
827,danko_fett,Nothing short of a masterpiece,9,1 May 2016,"Reservoir Dogs isn't only one of the best heist films ever, but also one of the best films ever made. Quentin Tarantino couldn't have kicked off his career as a director in the film industry any better. What makes this movie so great is it's interesting characters and the brilliantly written banter between them. For example, the opening scene. It's not your typical exposition dump that so many movies use for their opening scenes. It's just a bunch of guys eating breakfast and talking about the meaning of Madonna's song ""Like A Virgin"" and how tipping is/isn't bullshit. The scene is both very entertaining and very original. Anyways, it's time for me talk about the characters. Mr. White: ""If you shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologize."" Played excellently by Harvey Keitel, this character is the veteran criminal of the group. You can tell by his age and by the fact that he handles himself more professionally than most of the other characters.Mr. Pink: ""Why do I gotta be Mr. Pink?"" ""Because you're a faggot."" A weasel-like criminal that isn't afraid to put you down if you're in his way, this character is nothing short of a cool character. He is played by Steve Buscemi who gives a great performance. This character has some of the most interesting dialogue in the film, which succumb to a few good one liners and logical arguments such as his opinion on tipping and his suspicion of who the ""rat"" is. Mr. Blonde: ""Are you gonna bark all day little doggy... Or are you gonna bite?"" This guy is a flipping psycho. An interestingly cool one though. Michael Madsen did a fantastic job of portraying Mr. Blonde. Apparently this was pretty hard for him because of his very non- violent nature as a person. I have a lot of respect for someone who can pull off playing a character that challenges them like that. One of the things I love most about this character is the fact that he stopped for fast food after he kidnapped a police officer and put him in his trunk. That is what I call gold. He also has a lot of great one-liners. Mr. Orange: ""F**k you man! I'm dying here!"" And last but not least the youngster played by Tim Roth. This character is arguably the most important character for the film's plot due to the fact that he is an undercover cop. He is the most fleshed out character in the film and it's interesting how the movie shows him practicing on acting like a legit criminal so nobody has any suspicion of his background. Mad props to that. So what are the other aspects that make this film great? The unconventional structure and plot. The film is not told chronologically and you never actually see the heist. You think that might be a problem at first but it's handled very well. The cinematography and special effects are pretty good as well. Since the movie didn't have a large budget it has a more raw feel to it. Overall, this movie is a very original masterpiece and is one of Taratino's crown jewels.",Reservoir Dogs

This film has everything, the right mix of exuberant violence along with witty comic irreverance. Tarantino destroys the mark with his freshman feature. With powerful performances by the Harvey Keitel as well as Tim Roth. An underrated performance by Chris Penn, and Steve Buscemi is over the top as per usual. While watching this movie you are transported to another realm, and in that sense you become one of the rag tag troop. The obvious choice for a memorable moment is clearly the Mr. Blonde torture scene, however in my personal opinion it is the commode story that Roth ""performs"" for Keitel, Tierney and Penn at the club. In short, this film with its criminal pinoche delivers a knock you on your ass punch. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've already seen it, see it again!",Reservoir Dogs

I don't know whether the film gets any better, I don't care if it does. Movies like Mean Machine are dull to start with too, but at least not detrimentally so, so when that movie turned out to have one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, it managed to pull itself up two marks, but if after 20 minutes I'm left skimming through chapters not even caring about story while I'm looking for at least a good action scene then a movie has failed me. I don't know. Maybe I had high expectations, considering I've very recently watched both Pan's Labyrinth and Grave Of The Fireflies very recently, but then again, Mean Machine. At least movies like Battle Royale II have serviceable action (and hilariously bad acting, an area which I will give Reservoir Dogs praise for - the acting is great, be it because the entire cast are accomplished actors) between the sections of boredom. It doesn't even make good background sound, lest I want to be pouted with ni**er every other second. I don't see how you can stick with this movie at all. Now, it doesn't deserve anything lower than 3/10, that's designated for particularly diabolical pieces of media, like Fred or Jeff Dunham. It doesn't deserve anything higher, either, though. It's a shame when you end up feeling that £1 was a ripoff.",Reservoir Dogs

838,corynye,"Tough guys, Violence, the F-Word, the Works!",10,29 September 2000,"Reservoir Dogs is a brutally violent, realistic portrayal of criminals with plenty of dark humor to keep you laughing throughout the film.  It is unquestionably one of the best movies I have ever seen in terms of dialogue, character development and the depiction of realistic, gory violence.  It's your typical Tarantino flick, where the dialogue gives the viewer an in-depth look into the adventures of men who live a morally-deprived life of recklessly breaking the law and attempting to satisfy their insatiable lust for money.What happens in this movie is pretty simple: a group of gangsters who have personal and business ties to one another decide to rob a diamond warehouse. After the robbery is completed, the gangsters scramble from the cops who are diligently attempting to capture and incarcerate them.  During this scramble from the police - which happens to be nearly the entire movie - the thieves come to the conclusion that there is a ""rat"" in the group.  Soon, the gangsters grow paranoid of each and don't know who they can and cannot trust.  But before we discover who the rat is, we get an insider's look into the lives of each of the thieves.Amazingly, Tarantino portrays the gangsters as not only greedy, heartless criminals, but as human beings with feelings of love, anger, fear and so on. In fact in the movie's very first scene, before we see any of the gangsters whip out their pistols and open fire, we see all of the men gathered around a table at a cheap diner, discussing the meaning of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"".  This scene sets the stage for a funny, macho movie that keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat until the time the credits roll.
This movie is extremely violent, gory and filled with expletives. Reservoir Dogs, like many Tarantino flicks, is not organized chronologically, and can sometimes confuse the viewers as to what is going on.  You have to keep your eyes wide open at all times to put the pieces of the puzzle together.With all this said, do not hesitate to rent Reservoir Dogs.  Its a guaranteed winner!",Reservoir Dogs

I watched it with a (kinda) friend of mine, whom said that this was by far his favorite movie. Of course, I was interested, and asked why, and he responded that I just HAVE TO watch it. Well I must say, the story line was absolutely atrochious. The conversations were indeed hilarious, but yet very random. The openining scene talks about the various women that the men have been with, and what they have done. The first 5 minutes, I thought this would be a great movie. But then from then on, I just got bored. Too much repeated conversation. Then one of the heist members tortures a cop, which I found quite disturbing, watching the cops ear get hacked off, and then almost having a flame lit on him whilst there was gasoline doused all over him. Yes, I must say, this movie was boring... no significant characters, and just way too random. And, as I said before, I must say, this movie was by far below par, and competes for my worst movie ever, compariing with ""Spirit"" (G movie) From Walt Disney.

A stand-out for me would have to be Tim Roth who, though on the floor for a large proportion of the film, excels in his role as does Steve Buscemi and the fantastically psychotic Michael Madsen.There is just so much to enjoy in this film, and yes, the violence and the swearing does play a big part but it is never gratuitous but rather, it enhances the characters'. For example, when Mr Orange (Roth) shoots the lady in the car and do I even need to mention the ear-cutting scene?Any person who calls themselves a film fanatic must see this film.

The fact that he made this movie with such a low budget yet it being so good makes it ever more charming. The characters are incredible, and all have their own moments that make you love them. (Personally, my favorite is Mr Orange.) The soundtrack is also awesome, and is the perfect mix of songs. After the torture scene, you'll never listen to 'Stuck in the Middle With You' again without thinking of it. The dialogue in this movie always makes me laugh, especially the ""Toby? Toby Wong"" line. Basically, whenever Im having a bad day I'll watch this movie, and it will immediately cheer me up. Everybody says that Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's best movie, but I truly think this is his best.

848,StuartHall,"Tarentino's brutal, offbeat deconstruction of a jewel heist.",8,19 May 2001,"Tarentino's debut in the film industry, which he wrote, directed and played a small roll in, the brutal and offbeat 'Reservoir Dogs'.  The film was originally slated to be made for a mere $35,000 but the films production's budget expended to $400,000 when Harvey Keitel became enamoured with the script and agreed to star and help finance the project.`Reservoir Dogs' is a shocking and precocious film and echoes films such as `The Killing'.  Tarentino deconstructs a fatally bungled jewel robbery, structured similarly to `Glengarry Glen Ross' the actual heist is never seen and what is supposed to have happened is disclosed via flashbacks from different characters points of view.  Tarentiono's favourite directors Goddard and Hawks influence are apparent in the fragmentation of the narrative which parodies the criminal subculture with a Hawksism theme of professionalism in which these gangsters of modern times are nothing more but big kids with guns, incapable of controlling themselves and acting professionally.Similarly to Hawks Tarentino uses extreme violence in which bloodshed becomes a kind of gruesome farce.  The infamous torture sequence with the cop is staged in real time making it seem all the more endless, ironicallyjuxtaposing the upbeat seventies pop classic `Stuck In The Middle With You' playing over the stylised violence in which little is actually seen but rather the viewer is asked to imagine.  Typically of Tarentino's dark humour the cop endures having his face slashed and his ear cut off whilst the camera cuts to a `Mind your Head' warning, then being doused with kerosene, only to come out of it concerned that his good looks have been ruined.
Criticised for being gratuitously violent and for having borrowed heavily from various other texts, `Reservoir Dogs' is often looked down upon by many who overlook it as being style over substance.   However this film does have substance and a style that stays true to its own and deserves credit for trying to do something different with the worn out conventions of the crime/gangster genre.  Hailed as a cult masterpiece by some and condemned as an overly violent rip off by others `Reservoir Dogs' is still definitely worth watching and is still probably Tarentino's best piece of work to date.",Reservoir Dogs

First of all, the locations of the movie were a garage, an office and sometimes the street. They were waiting and waiting for help for their wounded friend. This made the movie too boring. They didn't need to be there all the time. And when they left, the viewer stayed in the garage.Those were the disadvantages, but there's one very big advantage for this movie. The lines of the actors. Sometimes I had to laugh about them, and sometimes what they were saying was very serious. This saved the movie, in my opinion. The acting was great too. Especially Michael Madsen impressed me as the silent, but very sadistic hench-man.I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I don't want to join the trend of liking everything Tarantino is doing.

I agree, but the violence was used to develop the character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/*****",Reservoir Dogs

Lastly,the wonderful Tarantino,who also has a hand in nearly all my other favorite movies,deserves more than a pat on the back for his excellent story line and direction,without which,there would be know film!

Not only does this movie tell a very interesting story, but the characters themselves tell their own stories while passing jokes around and having conversations with each other, just like real people.

It remember me about Georges Méliès, the 1900 french cinematographer (or Cinemagician man), and the incapacity of write for cinema (but Melies comes with few innovations at his time, like multiple exposures and dissolve ). Tim Roth and Michael Madsen are one of my favorites actors, but in this film, Quentin Tarantino can not use their talent and outstanding skills.

Quentin Tarantino was one of the few lucky exceptions. Reservoir Dogs (1992) was a cool, yet brutally violent feature film debut, that took no apologizes by the ending frame. Think of the story first, a heist film, without the actual heist. It's a shame no ones thought of it until QT. Next, the cast feels so well placed in their own roles, that sometimes they can speak their lines like Shakespeare, but with profanity and crude jokes. And, thats just the beauty of Tarantino's dialogue, he captures it so well of how it can actually be uttered, that a script is unnecessary. All they would need is an outline of actions, and rest could be improvised. It's literally a movie you could quote for days on end. Another great aspect is the look of the film, the editing, and cinematography is smart without getting too out of control, with knowing when to pull away from the violence (ear scene,and final frame).

872,N667,"Shallow, unintelligent and pretentious",3,5 November 2003,"Quentin Tarantino seems to concentrate his movies very much along the lines of ""cool"" and ""tough"" and pulpy storylines and characters. To me, his scripts come across as done by someone who reads too many B-grade comic books, mainly because his movies have very similar content.The story is very thin, and to sum up the what you see on the screen most of the time: there's a bunch of cookie-cutter emotionally retarded tough-guys who compete over who can deliver the coolest and toughest lines to each other and wave their shiny guns at each other with the right sort of swagger. That sort of thing is just so ho-hum, clichéd, and juvenile that I felt like tuning out right away.Mixed into this macho posturing is some gratuitious violence (even to the point of being repulsive at times, for example when Mr. Blonde gets his way with the cop) and a couple of ""cool"" stories in the vein of Pulp Fiction's story about McDonald's in France (what depth). Too bad it's pretty much gloss over content. The only flash of intelligence in this movie is right at the beginning where Mr. Pink delivers his speech on tipping. That's what kept me somewhat interested at first. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.This sort of movie doesn't appeal to me at all, although I'm sure it has some appeal to teenagers who consider the like of _The Fast and the Furious_ to be ""cool"". Me, I guess I'm just too old (27) to be impressed by this sort of trashy stuff. Had I seen it ten years ago, my review then might have been somewhat different.",Reservoir Dogs

874,kumayl_patel-1,The Jumpstart that sealed Tarantino's contract with Hollywood!!,8,31 December 2003,"Reservoir Dogs : Review by Kumayl Directed by Quentin TarantinoAll you fans of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill have just received a feast! Sadly for others this movie will test their tolerance to the maximum level. See Reservoir Dogs is a movie with extremely gruesome and grotesque scenes featuring criminals torturing and abusing verbally as well as physically, their fellow cast members. People get shot in the stomach and there is a scene of an amputation (ehhhh). This is just not it; the four letter word is used 252 times! ..so this is definitely not a family film!Released in 1992 this film caused an enormous amount of controversy and hullabaloo, mostly for its content. It is still the worst movie to take your date out, topping the list after American Psycho. But if u put aside the grisly bloodbaths shown in this feature and concentrate more behind the cinematography of this legendary director..Quentin Tarantino you will appreciate his work.The plot outline is simply this: They were four perfect strangers, assembled to pull off the perfect crime. Their simple robbery explodes into a bloody ambush, and the ruthless killers realize one of them is a police informer. But which one? The Indian movie Kaante has badly copied this film so don't confuse yourself with the story boards.Coming back to the director who also wrote the script, he has cleanly and charismatically shown the precision of gangster dialogue. This movie is an in your face version of psychopathic violence, killing and bad language. But please please! Don't take it in the literal sense...these are just backdrops. Focus more on the long takes, like Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde) going out of a warehouse to grab a can of petrol from the car and then going back and splashing it on a cop.Lastly I would strongly recommend not allowing children and older people or more conservative people to view RD.",Reservoir Dogs
875,joycetyler95,Watch it Twice and You Will Love It,8,24 April 2018,"I won't hold back by saying at first this film is very confusing to the average viewer. The unconventional timeline and the many aliases used by the main characters make the film difficult to follow at times; however, this does not take away from the simple brilliance of Tarantino's first feature-film. In the opening scene we are introduced to a group of men in a diner, each with their own personal quirks and unique personalities. Steve Buscemi's character, ""Mr.Pink"", delivers a long rant about tipping at restaurants that sets the tone as one that is unusual, yet relatable in its own right. After the attempted bank robbery we are informed one of the men in the group is a police informant, but the mystery of who remains unclear. As the timeline jumps back and forth, we come to know more about each character and their backgrounds. With each character's connection to the ultimate heist revealed, it actually becomes more unclear who the informant is, for it seems any of them could potentially be the one.When the mystery is finally revealed, I was simply left speechless by the revelation of who the informant ultimately was. Tarantino's ability to provide clues throughout the film, while simultaneously distract the viewer from the answer that was evident all along, is truly intelligent writing. After watching the film a second time, I was able to notice more of the plot's subtle hints and clues, which made me appreciate the film to an even higher degree. I have watched all of Tarantino's films so far and I personally find this to be my favorite so far. I believe this film catapulted Tarantino into the brilliant storyteller that he is today. At the same time however, this film feels unique from his others in that it is simple and straightforward without the often unnecessary plot background. However at the at the same time, it is the film's unpredictability and realness that speaks volumes. While there is many scenes with violent acts and heavy dialogue, it never seems over the top or exaggerated. This is ultimately a timeless film, that I believe will continue to influence many films to come.",Reservoir Dogs

The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.

It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'.

884,isak_ea,Indtroudcing the world to QT,9,12 December 2013,"Quentin Trantino's first movie; Reservoir Dogs, is one of his best. Like many of his films it is controversial. It was both praised and critized for the violence. Sure, it is violent and very bloody, but not too much. The narrative is unique and has inspired many films that has come later. It is told in flashbacks, gradually explaining backgrounds.The plot is this: six strangers are put together to rob a jewellery shop. It goes terribly wrong and the police gets to the crime scene, during the heist. The heist itself is never depicted in the movie, but the aftermath is. The surviving criminals try to figure out who told the police? How these men got the job is told in the flashbacks. These fill several purposes: to explain and clarify the background and to vary the story. The actual story, that takes place in the present, takes place in a warehouse; the rendezvous for the criminals. To those of you that have seen QT's Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained I say this: This one is as good as those. Though, Reservoir Dogs is quite different from Qt's later movies. Mainly because it is more serious. Of course there are some very bisarre scenes in which the characters sit at a table and discuss absurd things; what the true meaning of Madonna's Like A Virgin is, for example.Loved it! 9/10",Reservoir Dogs

And that is the brilliance of Tarantino's films. He lures you in by intriguing you with regular everyday things that shouldn't intrigue you. And yet you are drawn in by this quirky and wonderful dialogue that can require deeper thought or even laughter...many times both.

The same will recur throughout the rest of the film, but you never can really know when. You are just hit with this conversation between characters....Why? You don't know, Quentin is probably the only one that truly does, but you love him for it. The extended continuous shots at odd angles and in odd positions make this and all other Tarantino films just great to watch. If you like movies, you like Tarantino, because it is his love of movies that produce such original and amazing pieces of film-making. This movie is very brutal and gut-wrenching throughout, but this is broken up by, again, the great dialogue and light-hearted intermissions from the nerve-racking. Tarantino gives you a great picture of each character, telling you certain information only when he wants you to know. He may show a character's background at the beginning, he may wait until the very end, but his movies keep you guessing, and he always finds the perfectly twisted finish that nobody could guess the outcome. It is just the curious nature of his best, and earliest films....and Reservoir Dogs is a great example. It is one of the most brutal films that I have seen, yet it is also one of the best.",Reservoir Dogs
887,aneeshm790-490-261131,Moral of the story - Be professional. Tarantino's first deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of a job gone awry.,7,5 June 2013,"Reservoir DogsDirected by: Quentin Tarantino Written by: Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avary (background radio dialogs)Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs, released in 1992, marked the entry of one the most gifted writer-directors of our time. A project that took off with Tarantino's lucky break with Harvey Kietel. The result was a film, which despite a lukewarm response at the BO has gone on to become one of the classics of the 90's. It's better regarded today than when it was released, I suspect because people watched it with more intent later, recognizing a Tarantino film for what it is; thereby reading between the lines and appreciating the genius in the film-maker's first. Tarantino's first film serves as a blueprint for the rest of his films. He touches up on all things Tarantin-ian, tension, violence, jumping narrative, brilliant dialogs and most of all his unique (or not so unique) style of storytelling. Reservoir Dogs is about 7 'professional' criminals on a mid day heist in LA. It takes us from a comical coffee shop scene, where the characters are introduced, to the opening credits followed by a drive to a warehouse, where most of the real action takes place. The robbery takes place in the time span of the opening credits and while we see nothing, Tarantino makes you think you've seen more than he's shown. Most of the film deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of the heist. To make a good film you have to make it personal but Quentin tends more towards self obsessed. It's an ever-present factor in all his films. He creates characters who are an extension of his personality, uses banter that's probably pulled out from his life and works his entire film around an idea which is far from the conventional yet inspired from other films. But that's absolutely fine, Tarantino is smart with his use of homages, their timing is perfect and although not completely necessary, seem like the best fit for the situation. After all good artists copy, great artists steal. Tarantino gets one thing bang on, the dimensions of male camaraderie, especially when the men in question have no knowledge of each others' identity. Each of them has a phony name given to them by the big fish, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) as a safety measure. There's Mr. White (Harvey Kietel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buschemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker). When things are going well everyone's getting along, cracking jokes and sharing stories, all the while trying to get the last word in. With no set hierarchy everyone's out to prove they've got the biggest dick in the room but with more bite than bark. It's all casual and positive when there's a promise of a big loot hanging in their future. However, when things don't go according to plan, panic sets in and the half-good criminals lose the plot, they stop thinking straight and personal matters come in the way of professional calls. There's the magic in the film, when the characters with fake names are put in a situation that slowly brings forth their true identities.It seems as though apart from Joe and Mr. Blonde, the only two to have served time, none of the others have the mettle to keep their wits about in high pressure situations. In the end its Mr. Whites judgment that moves him to play the role of a guardian to the dying Mr. Orange. Tempers flare, voices are raised and the guns are readied. In a situation that resembles an old western the film draws the curtains on a note of twisted poetic justice. Tarantino's screenplay works on the prowess of its cast and their interactions. In a colorful cast it's hard to separate some from the rest but Tim Roth and Michael Madsen do a little more than the others. Tim Roth shows good range as he shifts between characters. For the most part he's delivering all his lines while bleeding out and in constant pain, its odd, but he's convincing enough. Madsen, follows James Cagney's principle –When playing a mean character, find a lighter side. It works well and Madsen plays the vicious Vic Vega to great effect. Steven Buschemi as Mr. Pink does a good job as well. Its difficult to put Reservoir Dogs in a genre, while there is a lot of action and violence, it's not really an action film. There are elements of mystery but it's not really a whodunit. It's got shades of a thriller and black comedy but it can't be classified as either one. It's all about the there and now and there's no telling what's going to happen. One critic said; it's an action movie that works entirely on words. Words are Tarantino's biggest strength and he sticks to it all the way and makes for a commendable first outing. Reservoir Dogs is a highly enjoyable ride that promises to thrill, shock and entertain any audience able to listen, pay attention and stomach its brutality.

To sum it up in two words, it was ABSOLUBTLY BRILLIANT.Everything about it was brilliant. The script writing, the directing, the acting, the music and the way it was filmed. Awesome!Who would've known that a movie that takes place in a garage/warehouse for about an hour and a 20 minutes, (not counting the parts that were outside of the garage/warehouse, which was about 20 minutes) could be so damn interesting. I loved it. The dialogue is fantastic, well written, and the music is great. It rarely dragged, maybe in one or two spots, but other than that, it was great.I bought the 10'th Anniversary DVD and watched it twice in three days, and I noticed that every time you watch it, you find something new.

890,NiceGuyEddie75,the almighty DOGS,8,1 January 2005,"RESERVOIR DOGS: even the name reeks of gritty, serious, pulp storytelling. After all, that's what RD is all about-the story of 6 criminals who have just pulled off a diamond heist that turned into a disaster. They become convinced that one of their own number is a police informant or even, worse, an undercover cop. The whole film is very suspenseful and is very reminiscent of the classic noir films of the 40's and 50's, such as ""D.O.A."" and even the physcological ""Gaslight"", but Tarantino says that his biggest influence was Stanley Kubricks masterpiece ""The Killing"". The film is amazingly well written and directed, with superb acting from everyone in the cast, especially Harvey Kietel, Machael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi. All three of them manged to get in some of Tarntino's later projects, most notably ""Pulp Fiction"". RD even managed to spawn a whole generation of rip-offs. All in all, it is a very entertaining neo-noir film that is from an indie film legend. Great.",Reservoir Dogs

I watched it waiting for the action and waiting for them to show us the robbery. How can this be called a gangster movie if they don't even show you a robbery? It said everywhere that this movie is a classic. What's classic about it? Robbers who cuss and act childish all the time waffling on about a robbery? All they do is talk and swear for 94 minutes, that's all they do. And it was very predictable who the cop was. There was no surprise. The reason I knew it was Mr. Orange was because Mr. White was treating him like a little 5 year old and he still treated the others like they were a piece of garbage. The direction was poor. The pacing was off. The humor with them discussing body functions and people's religion, etc was way off. They tried too hard to be funny when it came to he humor. There are 2 great songs in this movie, but that's it. The only thing that's original about this movie is the color names. The movie just seemed pointless, especially after the ending. They all shoot each other. What was the point in that? Them waffling on about a robbery, then nd up killing each other? What sense is that? I guess people love Quentin Tarintino so much that they'll accept anything he gives you. The dialog wasn't even good. Gangsters talking about their life and trying to be humorous, BORING! A lot of people will probably abuse me for this review, but i'm sorry, this is what the film is about and you fall for such poor movies like this. The reason I type this is to also warn others to let them know that you'll be expecting nothing more from this film than gangsters (Who they don't even act like) waffling on about a failed robbery that they don't even show you. 1/10",Reservoir Dogs
892,jnateduff,Worse Than His Bite,3,15 February 2005,"Quentin Tarantino has become famous and been called a genius for showing us what he thinks is cool. He's been called other things too. You can practically hear him during each shot . . . ""Now, wouldn't it be cool if, instead of slicing off Marvin's ear with the razor, he ripped Marvin's ear off with his teeth, spit it into the air, called him an anti-Semite, then punched him in the face? That would be cool, wouldn't it?"" That would be cool, but it would take the Coen brothers and John Goodman to get that shot right. What Tarantino does in Dogs is use a simplistic backdrop to draw head shots of comic book gangsters, like a kid making shadows on the wall in front of a projector after the film runs out. A kid who tortures puppies. The whole film is a bad impression of a good gangster picture. The intimacy of the cinematography draws the audience in; makes us a part of this crew of facile felons. The dialogue leaves you searching for a Q-tip. The one that reminds us of our greedy little selves gets away with the diamonds; the rat, along with everyone else, dies violently. The audience gets one in the gut, too, as the screen fades to black. Tarantino's freshman bark comes out more Taco Bell chihuahua than New Jack City rottwieler.",Reservoir Dogs

Gangsters without names, gathered together for a bank robbing plan. Only 4 plans used by Tarantino to shoot the film, very economic and sensational cult that started engine of the modern independent American cinema. What we basically say is you can watch the best performance of each actors in their own acting history. A fresh breath to take. The film carries all of the elements of Tarantino's non academic film addict background, and strings to his favorites Rio bravo, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, indeed its easy to say Tarantino is well effected by De Palma's directing skills. What we can say about directing technique of dogs is nothing more than a collage of Tarantino's top films, he builds the narrative just works with his directing fetishes. He uses 'exact' same shooting angles from his favorites to adopt to his own movie. Just before 'dogs' hit the screen people thought it will never work out in that way, but later on REservoir dogs crashed the Sundance film festival and became one of the most serious modern classic and a 'culT'.

Very quotable and will go down in history as the best heist film, that never shows the heist. It has one of the best movie soundtracks of all time! All brilliantly timed. The acting in this movie is outstanding. Harvey Keitel is cool and calculated. Steve Buscemi is awesome in a very Buscemi like performance! Tim Roth is the standout performance to me, he plays his character with such precision. The Story is simple, but effectively entertaining. A master class in Budget film making. It does have a shock scene, when someone ear gets hacked of to a 70's song. It is quite uncomfortable to watch, but gets the idea of brutality across to the viewer I love this movie and so should you!",Reservoir Dogs
897,brentos37,Transcends Time...,9,14 June 2005,"If you ever had a doubt about Tarantino's ability to make movies you were wrong... dead wrong.From the first scene, Reservoir Dogs makes you interested. Starting right in the middle of the action rather than at the beginning of the story, Reservoir Dogs never lets you lose interest.It's not surprising that this movie is one of the best, if not the best Tarantino Film.The first thing you'll notice about the film is the blood and violence. From the opening shot in the diner straight to a bloody Tim Roth in the back of a speeding car, the movie pulls you in and never lets go.Reservoir Dogs is probably most famous for the ""Torture Scene"" with Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde torturing Kirk Baltz as Marvin Nash. With Stealer's Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" playing Mr. Blonde goes to work on Marvin. This, to that date, had never been done in a film of which I am aware.Reservoir Dogs is still entertaining to this day. Watch this film.",Reservoir Dogs
898,lukemcn1995,a masterpiece for the crime genre,10,3 July 2014,"with this simple, bloody, and artistic masterpiece Quentin Tarantino tells the movie world with his directional debut that he is here, and he is here to stay, as perhaps one of the greatest artistically diverse directors of recent memory. the characters of this film are some of the most memorable and quotable of film history, with so many scenes that just ooze coolness, amazing scripting, and subtle creativity that leaves the viewer wanting to see more and more of Tarantino. But perhaps the stand-out characters of this movie are not the criminal yet moral Mr. White, or the young cop Mr. Orange, no, the true stars of this movie are Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink. Mr. Blonde, aka Vic Vega, is a calm, sadistic psychopathic killer disguised as a professional criminal - and the scene in which he tortures Marvin Nash will continually echo throughout the halls of film history as one that blends black comedy, gore, and excellent acting into one of the most memorable moments of cinema. In this, Madsen effortlessly depicts a man who takes nothing but pleasure from the pure torture of an innocent man, who in turn is revealed to be an unsung hero, for keeping the identity of Mr. Orange a secret. But Madsen's dancing to Stealer's Wheels stuck in the middle with you, is so subtly funny, that we almost do not feel sympathy for the poor cop who is robbed of his ear, yet, whilst we follow the scene from his perspective, our attentions are purely concerned with Madsen's subtle insanity. Indeed, you do ask yourself; ''why would Joe hire a guy like that?'' Mr. Pink however is the standout character of this movie; Steve Bescumi steals the show, and Tarantino leaves much to the imagination with this ambiguous and rat-like character. In a movie that is so direct in its dialogue and gore, we might almost forget about the art-work Tarantino puts into his presentation of Mr. Pink, which, in my opinion, is absolutely flawless. The opening ''tip-scene'' sets up Mr. Pink as the outside of the group, the one who applies methodical thought to his actions and reasoning, the one who will stick to his principles regardless of what the other characters are doing, and this scene alone, separates the wolf from the ''dogs''. You would never think it though would you, as Keitel's Mr. White humorously kicks the man on the floor, he looks rather helpless, squirming around, trying to find his gun to turn the odds in his favour - as the iconic image of the two men pointing their guns at each other shows us, even when he's down, Mr. Pink is ever resourceful. He is the only lead character whose identity is a mystery to us; he is an entity, we know almost nothing about this character, yet, he is the only one to escape, he is the winner of this film, leaving his partners in crime dead and bloody as he crawls away with the diamonds. The nothingness that consumes our knowledge of this character's profile is what makes him the movies defining star; he is the only man who does not reveal his identity, he follows the rules, stays, as he would say ''professional'', and for following his principles, he has emerged victorious - remember what I was saying about the tipping scene? He is the lone man who remains calm, who remains moderately objective and reasonable to the situation, as I say, emerging victorious. Overall, Tarantino's debut is one of subtly, and yet one of brutality, that makes the most of its characters, its dialogue, its soundtrack, and , if nothing else, its awe inspiring camera work - which is textbook for any director to follow if they want to know how to use a camera.",Reservoir Dogs

Despite the hyped reviews and high rating on IMDb it was nothing special. Mostly consisting of dialogue of pointless banter between the characters dragging out for uncomfortable amounts of time, the story had a weak plot and built up to nothing. Although to be fair the acting was very good, it did not redeem the overall poor script and plot which has its audience checking their watches within the first 30mins. The violence factor was nothing that shocking either, nothing much more you would find in a Bond film. Personally I do not understand how this film gets good reviews.

I hadn't watched it in maybe 10-15 years, and I think it's possible I liked it even more this time.The premise is simple, 8 guys plan a robbery which goes wrong. Seen this a million times right? But here, Tarantino tells the story in a broken time line, jumping forward and back between the action, slowly leaking information to the viewer. Seen that a million times? Sure, but not as well as it's done here. Also, it's worth remember that this was the first time a lot of this stuff was being done the way that it was being done.The performances are brilliant and the relationship between Mr White (a brilliant performance from Harvey Keitel) and Mr Orange (Tim Roth) is so well done that it feels like they have known each other for years.

908,anymouse-73569,What happens when a robbery goes bad?,10,28 August 2016,"There seems to be two schools of thought when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"". On one hand you have those who say that it is a gratuitous meditation on violence, and that Tarantino must be a psychopath. Then you have those who say it's a brilliant film and that Tarantino must be a genius. I belong to the latter category.Here in Tarantino's directorial debut we see all of his trademarks: excessive violence, rivers of blood, language that would make a sailor blush, razor-sharp dialogue, a non-linear storyline, and a terrific soundtrack. It is by these signature touches that we come to recognize a Tarantino movie when we see one. Love it or hate it, Tarantino has made these things his own.One of the things that makes ""Reservoir Dogs"" so charming is its humanity. The audience might not relate to the characters' violent tendencies, but they can certainly relate to the sometimes-goofy, sometimes-angry, always-honest dialogue and banter. In ""Reservoir Dogs"", criminals might torment cops for fun, but they also have strong opinions on Madonna's song ""Like a Virgin"". They refuse to tip waitresses. They have a celebrity crush on Pam Grier. In other words, they put their pants on one leg at a time. The only difference between these criminals and us is that, well--they're criminals and we're not.The cinematography and camera-work is flawless; every shot draws you into the red-and-grey world Tarantino has created for us. The acting is spectacular. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi and the rest bring their characters to life. Each actor brings something unique to the table and gives their characters a distinct personality.Even the notorious ""ear scene"" is perfectly executed. The scene is gleefully twisted, and the use of Stealers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" will send chills down your spine. Just as the actual robbery is never shown in the film, the most horrific part of the ""ear scene"" is never shown either. You hear the muffled screams... but that's it. And THAT is what makes this film so powerful. It's not what is shown but what isn't shown.This film is a prime example of ""Less is more"". With just a few speaking characters and a bare-bones set, ""Reservoir Dogs"" has the feel of a stage play. With limited resources and funds, Tarantino shows us you don't need a big budget to make a big effect on the audience.Shocking, hilarious, heartbreaking, ""Reservoir Dogs"" has it all. This is not your average 90's crime flick. It will make you laugh, cry, and reconsider your current stance on tipping waitresses. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",Reservoir Dogs

I wish I was more aware of him even before pulp fiction, but I was just an ignorant child there, with no appreciation for movies like these.

The cinematography to have bad guys. The whole movie contended a message of violence and sadism but also of a criminal innovation. The music score gives some total enthusiasm. Since a long time, movies haven't been that good. Characters personalities have such a shape of a sociopath form. Mr.Pink is the greatest characters with his dialog argument of the ""non-tipping."" Mr Blonde was a psycho maniac killing cop for pleasure and the others were fantastic madmen too. Such films should be more often in the American movies. However, reservoir Dogs is much more than a pure violent carnage it is a movie of attraction to see real bad guys been shot and having their own philosophy of how dealing with their situations.

It's got a decent plot and structure with beginning, development and an end. Good storytelling! The point is about trust and friendship, not corpse count or blood litres and therefore it's not measurable with something like 'and he saved the princess and lived happily ever after'. It's about weirdly realistic characters with ups and downs like normal people.As all perceivably ancient cultures say ""it's not the end that matters but the trip in itself."" From this perspective, Reservoir Dogs can be seen as a static road movie. It's a metaphysical journey through the characters' lives and how they are interconnected.

919,DonnaD-2,"""City on Fire"", the remake?",8,22 June 1999,"Despite the fact that this film 'borrows' lots of elements, i.e.     the main aspects of the story, from Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire""(1987), this is an excellent debut film for Tarantino.He has abstracted, in my opinion, the better ideas from ""City on Fire"" and reworked/formatted them in a fresher style.  The better ideas 'taken' from the storyline include - a young cop who penetrates and assists a wanted gang(and main leader) with a jewellery heist, which of course goes wrong because of an informed police ambush; the young cop becoming good friends with the older robber; then a fateful episode at the rendez-vous point, containing the memorable gun stand-off scene with three of the gang members(although this amounts to nothing in ""City on Fire"").Although this pretty much sounds like a blatant rip-off, Tarantino cleverly manages to freshen the plot up and modernise it by not even showing the heist and keeping the film in present tense, with relevant flashbacks. This adds to the audiences' intrigue as to what actually happened at the robbery and who the rat is.Another gripe that I have with the film though is regarding a couple of continuity errors.  Firstly, in a flashback straight after the robbery we see Mr Pink(Buscemi) running down the street with a bag(presumably containing the diamonds).  But when he goes to get into the car he places the bag onto the ground, and we then see him driving away, without picking the bag up!  Secondly, when Eddie, Mr Blonde and Mr Pink bring the hostage cop, Marvin Nash,  into the warehouse his hands are tied/cuffed behind his back.  Moments later his hands are in front of him, enabling him to be hung up from his arms.  And although this sounds like I am being picky, it's the tiny things like this which annoy me in films.Despite this ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a brilliant film with an excellent cast and great acting, especially Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi; superb dialogue which is occasionally witty; moments of violence, which I do not believe to be too gratuituous; a simple but effective wardrobe; and a really, really good soundtrack from beginning to end.To conclude, I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""Res. Dogs"", and I recommend it as a definite must-see film, along with ""City on Fire"". ""Res. Dogs"" is full of the style and black humour which Tarantino also later applied to ""Pulp Fiction"", and serves as a text which shows that the genre of violent films can actually also look really cool.",Reservoir Dogs

But the plan goes horribly wrong, the police were waiting for them and the result is a bloodbath involving the cops, civilians and some of the gangsters. Back at the rendezvous, a deserted warehouse, the remaining dogs try to work out what went wrong. Suspicions arises that one of them is a rat who sold the others out and paranoia soon sets in when they each realise that they can't trust each other. Emotions run high resulting in an unpredictable yet dramatic climax in the final two minutes of the film.Reservoir Dogs is typical of Tarantino's refreshingly unique approach to the genre of action/thriller. He uses the flashback technique constantly and effectively throughout reservoir dogs to not only gradually reveal additional information about the sequence of the bloody events that have lead up to the present situation but also to give the audience an insight into characters histories and perspectives. Clear parallels can be drawn between Reservoir Dogs and Tarantino's critically acclaimed Pulp Fiction, which was made two years later. In Pulp Fiction Tarantino intertwines three stories with random flashbacks and it is only by the end the movie that full sense can be made of the events that have transpired which stimulates viewers interest and involvement. Tarantino's focus is on the violent side of life as can be seen in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, the only three movies, which Tarantino has taken full credit for as director. He explores this focus through stylish characterization drawn from the criminal world in LA.Although this film contains a diverse range of techniques, I would have to say that the most original aspects of the film were: The camera angles and the music. Despite the plot being superb, every word out of the character's mouths interesting and unusual, the casting brilliant, and the acting gripping and totally realistic, it is the camera angles and the music which really give Reservoir Dogs its atmosphere, which in this movie is everything.The camera shots in this film add much to the suspense and are at times uniquely directed. Many times throughout the movie the shot is so far away that it is impossible to ascertain which character is actually speaking and therefore it almost seems that the characters play a secondary role to their dark and miserable surroundings.Although the camera work effectively creates the mood it is the music which truly plays the most vital role in Reservoir Dogs. Everyone is stylish in Tarantino's world and this is reflected  through the use of music. The recurring theme of the radio show `K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend' plays an extremely important role in the music element of this movie. Nearly all the music present in the film is actually heard from radios in cars or bars and is always K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend. The gangsters talk about their identification with the Radio show, and have a kind of shared memory with each other through the songs.Overall this is my favourite film of all time and no matter how many times I see this movie I just can't seem to get tired of it. It could be something to do with me and violent films, but I think it's more because this is the only movie I've ever seen that mixes such a diverse range of techniques so successfully. This is summed up by the fact that even the dramatic and somewhat tragic end to this film leaves in its wake a strange sense of completion.The test of a great film is whether or not at the end of it you would want to see it again immediately and if you find yourself sub-consciously uttering the phrase ""Goddam, that was brilliant film"", you know what you've just witnessed won't be forgotten for a while.If you haven't seen this movie SEE IT NOW. Even if violent films aren't your forte, bear with it and watch it to the end, you won't regret it.",Reservoir Dogs

927,notthepromqueen,not just your average after-dinner movie...,10,7 January 2001,"...this is the whole damn meal. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is about a crime gone horridly awry, and it makes no apologies for its violence, slurs, and language.  It doesn't have to, because of its brilliant, gripping script and plot twists, acting that makes you think these people are real, and a flashy presentation of it all. Quentin Tarantino came on the scene not with a whimper but a bang with this story of a diamond heist which is foiled by an undercover cop--one of the criminals.   The story unfolds backwards, beginning with Quentin Tarantino waxing poetic on Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", and manages to cover Tim Roth writhing around in Harvey Keitel's backseat with a bullet in his stomach, Michael Madsen with a straight razor and a bound & gagged cop, Chris Penn crying rape in his father Laurence Tierney's office, and other insane, violent, and/or hilarious plot lines leading to a dazzling end.  The soundtrack adds just the right amount of style and superiority, which you'll understand immediately when the Dogs walk in slo-mo to the tune of ""Little Green Bag"". This movie can only compare to ""Pulp Fiction"" with its brilliance, otherwise, it is completely and utterly a unique experience.",Reservoir Dogs

Tarrintinos ability to twist a movie like this is truly remarkable. I feel this film superceeds ""Pulp Fiction"" and is beter in a number of ways. This film is arguably hosts the best berformances of ALL actors including Harvy Keitel , Micheal Masdon etc.For a truly enjoyable experience se this film. I put a challenge out and feel free to object to my comment on this film being tarrintinos best. It is truly the best Tarrintino film. Micheal Masden is so cool.

934,rpsm-22565,Who was the Reservoir Dog?,9,17 April 2020,"Probably everybody was but there is someone who fits better in that characterization.
I've watched this movie more than 5 times, and I just saw it tonight, and these time I finally understand something different and that's why I am writing this. I know that critics used to focus on general stuff but, I rather focus on a specific character.
One of the first scenes shows ""Mr. Orange"" bleeding and being assisted by Mr. White, and it's clear that something went really wrong, after the first dialogs we know that they were robbing a company and they used fake names to refer to each other.
The plot of the whole movie asks: ""what marvelous event happened at the company or who was the amazing friend that sets them up?""
In that intrigue situation, Mr. White played a major role, who was blinded by himself, during the tragic scene, by his own perception of what had happened (as I explain in the further paragraphs).
Mr. White is definitely a man who put his shoes into another person as it describes it on the first scene: talking about waitress and her realities how they have to live the day to day in order to subsist and showing us how he cares about these minorities and maybe feeling responsible to do something, he is also concern in some way about minorities problems (when talking black women being treated by his black partners). And for that, there is a big probability that, he is a responsible person, a team member and maybe a good mentor. That makes us empathize really quickly because of his human nature (as the movie achieves really great, intentionally definitely).
And that characteristic is really intrigue because with this kind of thinking it should be hard to murder or to damage someone, so probably he just do his job to prejudice the opposite of who he cares, not minorities in other words wealthy/powerful people. So, probably, there is some personal issues related to not minorities because he understands people problems and that is really important.
When Mr. Orange was shot, the first reaction of Mr. White is compassion about his comrade, but then he shows us that he felt guilty about his comrade being injured as he explained to Mr. Pink. And that minor detail is which blinds Mr. White the whole situation until his dead, the guilt. He could not understand how someone who protects and who he could seem as a pupil In order to make him part of the team could be a rat. And this self-inner definition of Mr. White is covered with the responsibility of the damage made to his pupil. Because how he could be responsible about an injured kid when in his head he should be protecting these minorities. Furthermore, thinking about his pupil as a rat, is in some way against his own values ((loyalty and protectiveness), identity and who he really is.
With all these reasoning inside Mr. White head, he don't understand that the rat was Mr. Orange even though logically speaking there were no more option of who could be the rat. And that started in one of the last scenes, when Mr. Orange killed Mr. Blonde, and he argues and blame Mr. Blonde for act psychotic. Then Mr. White instantly supported his comrade, because Mr. Blonde cannot understand people feelings, cannot feel responsible about someone, because he was a sociopath which is the total opposite of Mr. White's believes. And with that in mind, Mr. White made his emotional decision to believe the kid (as he sees him) and entered in a really rough discussion with Joe and his son, putting his own life in really danger in order to save his own identity. 30 seconds later, Mr. White killed Joe, an old friend, In order to be loyal to his own ideals.
Thinking about this character made me wonder how he ended up in that kind of job, even though if it is possible as a human being.
Continuing ... Before the cops appearance , Mr. Orange confess that he Is the undercover cop. In that moment Mr. White made a moan with much distress and realize that his own reasoning played against him.
And it's because Mr. White acted very emotional, which blinded to see clearly the whole situation in a more logical way. Probably the reason is because he had fidelity, he seemed like a mentor, a good friend, he is definitely affectionate and protective of people who he cares, and more than anything, he was naïve and loyal or in 2 words a Reservoir Dog.
I know that there had been some conjunctions about the character reasoning, but when something explains the reasoning behind Mr. White actions and seems logical make you want to believe it.",Reservoir Dogs
935,sofiaastorino,Fantastic,10,6 October 2019,"I think this is one of the best film I've ever seen. This was the third film of Tarantino that I enjoyed watching, after Pulp fiction and Django Unchained. This film really shocked me. The stillness of the scenes is opposed by a pressing rhythm, thank to this device Tarantino perfectly manages the suspence. At the beginning of the vision I was a bit prejudiced, because knowing that it was the first film I thought it was structured worse, as soon as I heard the opening speech I just realized Tarantino's genius. I also find the psychological analysis of the characters very interesting. Each of them represents different human types, exalting their vices and virtues. The script is absolutely fantastic in (implicitly) mixing the tragic with the ironic. An interesting food for thought is the value of loyalty, which becomes the protagonist in the last part of the film. When trust is betrayed man often reacts violently, is this justifiable? No, personal revenge must be punished. Well, this is briefly what I caught from the film, although there would still be so much to say. Rate 10/10",Reservoir Dogs
936,fergusonfrank,A feast for the senses and a famine for the soul!,5,16 June 2006,"Wow! What can I say... the wife picked up this gem in a mad rush from the local video store. Which is to say she didn't read the cover jacket warning in time! Hence, we got to be intrigued and disgusted, pretty much in that order.I was OK with the dialogue, which is intriguing -- like one of those conversations where you're privy, but you don't open your yap because it's too damn interesting to interrupt.But, then things went horribly, horribly wrong. Now, don't get me wrong -- I like a good blood-spattered, pleading-victim, grinning-sociopath, sadistic torture scene as much as the next man. NOT! Apart from the rest of the blood and gore, which is excessive (much like watching open-heart surgery), the torture scene just got way too up close and personal for my taste.Reminds me of when we used to play 'Look!' You know, you chew up your food and say, ""Wanna play 'Look?'"" Then, you open your mouth to a disgusting view of partially-chewed carrots, peas and corn and scream 'Look!' If you're lucky, your little brother faints or at least heaves.Well, apparently Quentin seems to think this is a way cool technique in the cinema. Duct-tape the victim to a chair and pull out the old straight razor! 'Look!' Apparently, a lot of folks think Quentin is way cool, too, judging from the many favourable reviews of this gore-fest. And, wow he uses the 'N' word, too. He's sooo deep! This movie has a lot of interesting little novelties that are worth checking out. But, the gore is over the top.

I recently decided, based on the ratings at this site, to purchase without first viewing. What a mistake! This movie is good, but it sure as heck wasn't worth $20! I think, truthfully, that the DVD of this movie was probably worth around $8. Too bad for me, I guess. If you, as the viewer, have any morals it's extremely easy not to sympathize with the characters.

The acting is superb, mostly containing no names of the time, and the dialog is some of the greatest (and Funniest) of all time. This movie is great for many reasons, but what takes the cake is the fact that the entire movie uses maybe 15 scenes.

It's both hilariously funny and perfectly created for a clever anecdote. The script in itself is so real but at the same time so perfect! How Tarrantino writes like this I will never know but it's definitely not a bad thing.Like I said however this movie isn't just witty dialogue...it's the best movie ever made. A poignant message wrapped up by a gripping plot, with flawlessly created characters on the side, and all told using the twisted narrative skills of Tarrantino.Every little detail of this movie screams brilliance. It's much more than the bloody violent masterpiece that it is known as and, as far as I'm concerned, this movie is to film making what the bible is to Christianity.Too short? This seems to be the only problem that people have this movie. Yes it is too short...but it will forever be too short because it's complete perfection!

The actors themselves gave their own little bit of magic to the picture. It may be low budget, but it looks like a $10-15 million budget.The aspect which is the tip of the iceberg for me and what made me on the edge of my seat when I first watched this film back in 1996 is the skipping of one bit of the film to another. A genius idea by Quentin, I think this film doesn't get the praise it rightly deserves.I was so happy to see him make Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bill series along with Death Proof. His screen play and story writing is also out of this world, for the other films he hasn't directed; True Romance, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn.I wish I could rate this 30/10, but I can only rate it as a ten.

The film, while gritty and unattractive, manages to play to Tarantino's strongsuit: characters and dialogue. While a little inferior to Pulp Fiction, and much less stylistic than Kill Bill, this proves to be the markings of genius at an earlier stage. The movie, about a group of bank robbers whose clean heist turns into a bloodbath rests on a heavy dose of irony. We never see their heist, nor do we see the ultimate outcome of the loot.

It portrays what happened before and after a botched jewel heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast with Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino also has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes and aesthetics that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, memorable dialogue with excessive profanity and a nonlinear storyline.The film has become a classic of independent film and a cult hit. It was named ""Greatest Independent Film of all Time"" by Empire. Reservoir Dogs was generally well received and the cast was praised by many critics. Although it never became a major box office success grossing $2,832,029, it achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It is often criticized for its high amount of violence and profanity, and audience members reportedly walked out during the infamous ear-cutting scene.Thanks Sanjiv Christian SEO",Reservoir Dogs

I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie.Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie.Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work.

After having just watched it, the gritty violence is still fresh in my mind, and I can appreciate how well the actors played their parts, but in the end I'm left quite unsatisfied.I came into the movie thinking that there would be some sort of resolution, or actual focused conflict; what I got was a disappointing ending, weak dialogue, poorly-organized meandering flashbacks, and a struggle so scattered throughout all the characters that I stopped caring altogether about their concerns.Odd thing about my disliking Reservoir Dogs, though, is that I normally love blood and gore in cinema!

Reservoir Dogs, the first of his movies in a short (but sweet) line of films is fabulous. Seeing it has made me respect him and the other actors in the film to a higher extent.  Harvey Kietel shows up his role from Taxi Driver, Tim Roth is fabulous (and he has been bumped up on my fave actor list for this role alone), Steve Buscemi is just awesome, and you can look at Chris Penn and see what happens to you when you live in a town without dancing...It is a typical Tarantino-style movie, where everything is messed up, and he starts with the end, and ends with the ending to the end (got that?).  His development of the characters is wonderful, and his ingenious is inspiring. Pulp Fiction was good until I saw Dogs.  May I never look back.",Reservoir Dogs

After watching this movie... I have come to the conclusion that my friend is completely delusional and everyone who rates this movie so highly also is. The film never delivers the goods.

967,EmperorOfIceCream,"Original, Violent, Insightful, Humorous, Shocking...but most importantly, Gripping",9,12 January 2010,"From first impression, this film appears to be slow, difficult to follow, and completely random. However, 20 minutes into the movie you will find yourself glued to the television. Being Tarantino's first film, it's not his best but it is still excellent! It operates how you would expect a Tarantino film to do so - in a seemingly unclear, incredibly violent and dialogue-driven manner. However, just like most of his other films, the plot soon becomes evident as the action shifts between characters and time (yes, the film is not sequential, so this may not be the film for you if you have a tough time following these types of movies). If you enjoy movies that really make you think and question some things you believe, especially reality, then this is the movie for you! Tarantino presents a gripping plot that is as real as it gets - this is not your typical Hollywood-ruined crime film. This is reality (or at least, Tarantino's reality).The performance of Madsen as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega is amazing! I don't believe that the role of this character could have been cast any better. Madsen will remind you of Al Pacino's Scarface with his attitude, and his acting is impressive. Tim Roth also offers an unforgettable performance as Mr. Orange - an incredibly deep character whose story is the most interesting out of all the others. Likewise, Harvey Keitel takes the film to a whole other level with his emotion as Mr. White, especially through his relationship with Mr. Orange and his actions at the end of the film. The ONLY thing I DISLIKED about the film was Tarantino's acting performance, which I found to be completely unnecessary, below-average and awkward (thank God he doesn't play a major role in the film). I understand that it is a staple of his films, but he needs to provide performances like the appearance he did in Pulp Fiction if he wants anyone to like him.Otherwise, this film is a MUST-SEE and belongs higher on the IMDb top movies list!",Reservoir Dogs

The plot is so full of holes that it is just ridiculous. I am so disappointed that I don't believe I will ever watch a movie by this director again. Watching this after 'Inglourious Basterds' made dissatisfaction even more unbearable. My advice: watch the first 45 minutes of this film and simply shut off the television. Ponder for several minutes as to the end result, but do not, under any circumstances, finish this calamity. I would not want to hear any more reports of self-mutilation or people gouging out their own eyeballs. Furthermore, for those of my unfortunate brethren who have had the hardship of viewing this catastrophe, answer me this: Who shoots Eddie?

971,christineboss,Spoiler,8,8 December 2010,"This film reminds me of a film called Goodfellas. This movie is filled with violence and foul language however if gangster movies are your thing this will be right up your alley. The theme is a robbery terribly gone wrong all but one end up dead.The movie starts with six look alike thieves. They are all dressed in identical suits but they all have drastically different personalities. They are trying to pull off a diamond heist but boy does it go all wrong. Their aliases are pretty funny. First we have Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel). We learn quite abruptly Mr. Blonde is off his rocker so to speak. He beats a police officer close to the point of death, cuts his ear off and than almost burns him to death. Mr. Orange saves his life for the time being. Mr. Orange reveals during one scene that he is an undercover police officer. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are ordered by Mr. Blonde to go and get the diamonds. Mr. Brown is shot in the head while trying to escape from the warehouse. Mr. Orange is than shot in the stomach while trying to flee by a female and ends up shooting and killing her. The remaining group finds Mr. Blonde dead in the warehouse. Eddie Cabot; who is the son of the gangster Joe Cabot (who the cops after and that's why Mr. Orange is undercover) ends up shooting Marvin, the captured police officer and killing him. Eddie is angry over the death of Mr. Blonde. Joe Cabot finally shows up to the warehouse and tells everyone of Mr. Blue's death. Joe accuses Mr. Orange of being an informant and Mr. White defends him. There is a standoff and Joe and his son are now dead. Mr. Orange and Mr. White are severely wounded during the standoff. At the end Mr. Orange confesses to Mr. White that he is a detective and Mr. White cries and points his gun at Mr. Orange. Mr. White shoots Mr. Orange and the police end up opening up fire on Mr. White. Meanwhile Mr. Pink had been hiding comes out with the diamonds and ends up being arrested. The movie is full of shot 'em up action. The movie follows the same gangster theme that all of them do however it's an enjoyable movie. Quentin Tarantino though I think he is very odd does a great job directing the movie. The scenes are shot realistically and the characters fit the screenplay. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Tarantino's movies.",Reservoir Dogs

974,benedi07,You better know who your friends are in Reservoir Dogs,9,2 February 2011,"Reservoir Dogs is an interesting story of a gang of criminals and their planned jewelry heist. The gang runs into some issues and suspect someone tipped the cops off of their plan. After a shootout and fleeing from the authorities the remaining gang members meet in a warehouse to discuss the job, and find out what really happened. The story is told in a very interesting manner, because the scenes are not in chronological order. This can be confusing to some viewers, however if the viewer can stick out being confused for a bit the plot will all come together brilliantly. The director Quentin Tarantino uses this technique often throughout his films such as, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.The most apparent theme in this film is that someone must know who his or her real friends are. In many scenarios throughout this film, this becomes an important issue. When dealing with crime you have to be especially careful. All of the members of the gang are given nicknames so that their real names are not exposed. However, during the traumatic shootout and running from the cops one of the thieves, Mr. White, reveals his real name to another thief, Mr. Orange, who is injured. Mr. White then questions weather or not he should take the injured Mr. Orange to the hospital since he knows his real name. If he knew he could trust Mr. Orange he could take him to the hospital for the treatment but since the recent events, none of the thieves know whom they can trust. The gang eventually begins to accuse each other of being the cause of the problem, and many people are killed. Reinforcing the theme that you must know who your real friends are.The lighting and special effects of this film are very well integrated. They help capture the realism of the story. Very little artificial lighting is used in this film and most lighting comes from natural sources, which helps capture the realism and mood intended. One example is the poor lighting in the warehouse, where much of the story takes place, gives the viewer the feel of a grimy old dimly lit building where nothing good goes on. There are very little special effects used in this film because the realism of the subject does not require much special effect to capture the reality.",Reservoir Dogs

Someone at my college put the movie in, I'd never even heard of it before that day. It turned out to be a pretty straightforward experience. You're introduced to a bunch of criminals, suddenly they're leaving a crime scene (that you don't watch take place) and it seems like most of the movie is everyone waiting to meet up at an empty building. Yes, there's violence (that doesn't make a movie great to me) yes there are big name actors (I didn't recognize most of them).

976,mamarichey,Resrvoir Dogs,10,17 June 2011,"The movie Reservoir Dogs, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, was a great movie. It is a movie that is created with the classic cops and robbers theme, but with a creative twist and motif. A group of criminals, all who use code names for protection, attempt to pull a jewelry heist that goes bad. The group consists of actors such as Harvey Keitel (Mr. White), Steve Buscemi (Mr. Pink), Tim Roth (Mr. Orange), Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde), Lawrence Tierney (Joe Cabot), and Chris Penn (Nice Guy). I felt that the actors chosen for the roles were a great cast job by Tarantino. The group becomes suspicious that one of them is a cop due to the response time of the cops to the heist. The movie has major amounts of violence and foul language; however it is necessary to convey the ruthlessness of the criminals. The movie shows that even the hardest criminal can have a heart and care as well. It also shows just how evil one can be as done through Mr. Blonde. Mr. Blonde kidnaps a cop from the heist and tortures him by cutting of his ear and covering him with gasoline. These are two elements shown in the movie Training day, written by David Ayer, as well. The angles used help the viewer to feel inside the scenes as if you are taking part of the movie. Overall the movie was very well cast and thought out. The common theme of man going undercover to ""get"" the bad guys was done with a creative twist. The use of violence and harsh language is a necessary to get the message across, but done in a way not to glamorize the criminal lifestyle.",Reservoir Dogs
977,jeena_d,The film revolves around the aftermath of a failed robbery,8,16 June 2011,"The film revolves around a group of individuals who get together for a robbery. The gang comprises of Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Eddie Bunker as Mr. Blue, Quentin Tarantino as Mr. Brown, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink and Harvey Keitel as Mr. White. Lawrence Tierney plays the role of Joe Cabot who is the master mind planner behind the robbery. Joe Cabot gives false names to the gang members to conceal their private identities. We see them all in the beginning of the film having breakfast together and later get introduced to each one in detail. The confusion starts when the police arrive at the robbery location as soon as the alarm is tripped and now the question arises of which one of them is the undercover police officer. Mr. Brown gets killed in the encounter whereas Mr. Orange gets seriously hurt. We see Mr. Orange as bleeding profusely and Mr. White driving him to the warehouse. Mr. Pink arrives at the warehouse after a while and he argues with Mr. White about the fact that they were set up. The theme of the film was one of violence and action. There is also racial discrimination. We see the gang members speaking ill of the black and also telling each other that they were talking like the black. They definitely think they are better than the black but the irony is that they talk in the same way as any gangsters would and commit illegal acts such as the robbery of the jewelry store. In the film we see how Mr. Orange worked his way in the gang by telling them various stories. One of them being that he could get illegal actions done under the scrutiny of police. Mr. Blonde makes an appearance at the ware house. He captures a police officer, Marvin Nash and we see him play the radio, dance to the music and torture the police officer in the most grotesque manner. He takes a razor and slashes the cop's ear. Mr. Blonde next gets some gasoline and is about to burn Marvin Nash when Mr. Orange mustering a little courage shoots Mr. Blonde. Mr. Orange informs the captive police that he is an undercover police officer. We see the remaining gang arrive at the ware house to find Mr. Blonde dead. Joe Cabot accuses Mr. Orange of being the one informing the police. In the later scene we see some gun shots which leaves Mr. White and Mr. Orange wounded and Joe and Eddie dead. Mr. Pink takes the diamonds and runs away. Mr. Orange tells Mr. White that he is an undercover police officer and in his anger Mr. White shoots Mr. Orange dead. The scene where Mr. Blonde gets to slash the cop's ear is the height of violence in the form of extreme torture. We see him as a psychopath who dances to the song, ""Stuck in the Middle with you"" and seems to be getting pleasure out of torturing other people. His acting was commendable since his dialogs and actions portrayed the psycho character that he was playing. While answering Mr. White we hear him saying ""Are you going to bark like a dog or will you bite"". Another film that shares a similar theme would be ""Pulp Fiction"" which is also directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film's theme revolves around violence just like the film ""Reservoir Dogs"". Both the films have racial discrimination and include illegal actions like robbery and killing. Lighting and angle have been effectively used to introduce the characters in the film and enhance the theme of violence in the film. The opening scene where we see the individuals gathered for breakfast has been shot utilizing the appropriate angles to emphasize each character separately. Most of the lighting in the film utilizes high key lighting including the scenes inside the warehouse. There were instances of low key lighting such as in scenes where Joe Cabot was shown in his office with Mr. Blonde. Both lighting and angle was used to portray the characters of the gang that were involved in violence. In conclusion, ""Reservoir Dogs"" was a film that revealed violence but the film did an incredible task in revealing the picture of reality. It is a film of all times and shall be enjoyed by many people in the future.",Reservoir Dogs
978,figdrop,"According to Joe this is to be an easy job, but when things don't go as planned, the remaining members feel there is a rat amongst them.",8,17 June 2011,"Reservoir Dogs ReviewReservoir Dogs, (1992) written and directed by Quentin Taratino, is a story about a group of six criminals: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Taration), and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), brought together by Joe Calbot (Lawrence Tierneya) a mob kingpin to rob a jewelry store receiving a shipment of uncut diamonds. According to Joe this is to be an easy job, but when things don't go as planned, the remaining members feel there is a rat amongst them.The movie opens with all the members including Joe's son Eddie (Chris Penn) at a restaurant having long conversations that range from the meaning of Madonna's song ""Like a Virgin"", the radio program ""Billy K's Sound of the Seventies"", to the reason why Mr. Pink will not throw his dollar in for a tip. As Joe returns to the table from paying the bill, he says, ""let's go to work"". We are then flashed forward to the results after the heist, where Mr. White is driving with a wounded Mr. Orange in the back seat of a car to a selected warehouse for the team to meet. After getting to the warehouse, the first to meet them is Mr. Pink. He is sure there is a rat among them, because the police were waiting for them and someone had to tip them off. Mr. Blonde shows up and Mr. White and Mr. Pink are questioning his mentality and unprofessionalism by killing a woman and shooting other innocent people. The conversation again goes to who is the rat. Mr. Blonde tells them he has something that will make them feel better and follow him to his car. In the trunk is a policeman Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) he has taken hostage and as Mr. White and Mr. Pink grabs him out of the trunk, we go to a dead screen with ""Billy K's Sounds of the Seventies"" playing the song ""I Gotch Ya"". Back in the warehouse Mr. White and Mr. Pink beat Nash to try and extract information from him on who the rat is, but he knows nothing. When Eddie arrives, a bloody Mr. Orange is still lying on the floor bleeding to death. Eddie and Mr. White and Mr. Pink leave the warehouse to get rid of the vehicles so not to draw attention. This leaves Mr. Blonde who has become mentally unstable alone with the beaten Nash and Mr. Orange. Mr. Blonde tells Nash that he is going to torture him and turns the radio on to ""Billy K"" and the song ""Stuck in The Middle With You"" is loudly playing. After Mr. Blonde has cut off Nash's ear and is getting ready to torture him some more, Mr. Orange shoots and kills him. Nash and Mr. Orange have a conversation before the others return and Orange admits he is a cop. When Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Eddie return they are confused about the situation and get into an argument. This leads to all of them pulling their weapons and shooting each other. The last one standing is Mr. Pink who as the movie ends is walking out of the warehouse with the diamonds. Quentin Taratino uses the warehouse, which is large, bland in color and empty, as the set that give us the feeling of a dark place where bad things are going to happen. His use of ""Billy K's"" radio show, lets the viewer know that there is going to be a brutal scene is about to happen. He also uses the flash forward and flash back to give the audience different information on the theme and plot. As a viewer, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a coarse bloody mob movie that takes us on a journey of emotions delivered by the characters. While I feel the movie was well produced and written, I wish Taratino would have delivered the scene of the botched heist; it seemed I was missing how the rat was involved in telling the police. The shootout that happened at the jewelry store because of the rats information, reminds me of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Law enforcement was waiting for the unexpected criminals and a blood bath occurred.",Reservoir Dogs
979,jejhnson,Reservoir Dogs - Not Your Grandma's Type of Movie,8,20 June 2011,"***This review may contain spoilers*** Reservoir Dogs stars Quentin Tarantino as Mr. Brown, Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Eddie Bunker as Mr. Blue, Chris Penn as Eddie Cabot, and Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot. The film is a crime movie directed by Quentin Tarantino in 1992, and is his premier as a movie director. The films plot centers around the formation of a group of criminals that are tasked with stealing diamonds from a vault within a diamond distribution center. Joe Cabot is the head of the group and carefully selects the members of the criminal gang consisting of the above individuals, as well as plans the heist. After planning the heist and carefully preparing the gang, Mr. Cabot activates the plan. Although, careful planning had taken place the heist quickly becomes derailed. Police officers are near the diamond distribution with a plan of their own to bring down Mr. Cabot's crime syndicate. Unbeknownst to the gang, their group contains an informant who has tipped off law enforcement to the plan. As the botched attempt takes place violence ensues with a few police officers and a couple criminals losing their lives. Following the botched robbery attempt the gang returns to an old burial casket storage facility which they had designated as the rendezvous point following the heist. As the members slowly start to arrive the plot takes a couple different turns which catches the viewer of guard. It is revealed who the informant amongst the group is, and other members of the group are killed. The films theme contains a combination of Moral Implications and A Moral or Philosophical Riddle. The implication that ""The Love of money is the root of all evil"" is not lost on the viewer. This film is not void of the motifs that have come to define future Tarantino films. There is a plethora of scenes that dramatically display the use of profanity, violence, action, and references to pop culture of the era. The dramatic structure of the film is a classic representation of nonlinear structuring which has become a staple of Mr. Tarantino's film. The sequencing of scenes out of chronological order keeps the viewer guessing and yearning for what led to the current events. This type of structuring can also be seen in another film directed by Mr. Tarantino titled Pulp Fiction. The film, Reservoir Dogs is definitely not a movie for children. The violence is hard to watch and the profanity may cause your grandma's ears to bleed, but the film is realistic to the situation. Neither the violence nor the profanity is the focus of the film. The films storyline is the primary focus, with the violence and profanity being a necessary evil.",Reservoir Dogs

981,bmfmovieswebmaster,A fantastic foray into the early works of Tarantino,8,15 September 2011,"In 1992 Quentin Tarantino took 7 guys and an amazing script to an abandoned warehouse and started shooting. When Reservoir Dogs was first released it was met with relatively warm critical reception, however almost 20 years later I am here to tell you whether or not it holds up.For those of you still unaware Reservoir Dogs is a heist movie, but only in premise, in execution however it plays out as a heist gone wrong. We follow a group of robbers each brought together for their specific talents, skills, and most importantly their ability to be trusted. However, it becomes quickly apparent that one amongst them had been miss-judged when they get to the location of the robbery and into the waiting arms of the police. This sends the group scattering in their own directions. This is where the action opens. (I say action because the movie itself opens with a hysterical breakfast conversation regarding Madonna.) After this we see very little of the rest of the heist.From there the film turns into a sort of Clue for adults, as we are slowly introduced to each of the major players of the game. Each of these scenes plays brilliantly, Quentin manages to create within each character a personal motivation and a quiet determined distrust towards every other character. He constantly has the viewer's scrambling towards the discovery of the mole and how each character feels, but he never makes it feel frustrating.This movie more so than any of Tarantino's others plays like a movie made by a writer. There aren't any spectacular sweeping wide shots, or any of the fantastic follow shots he has become so known for. No, this film is a well-planned and plotted sequence of dialog and events staged almost exclusively in an abandoned warehouse. And it is from here that Reservoir Dogs runs into its biggest problems. The film exists in such a singular environment that it seems to drag quicker than other films might. Though the quality of dialog keeps the scenes and movie as a whole from stagnating many viewers will quickly bore of the long scenes of nothing but dialog. Not only that but the characters we are presented with aren't incredibly developed. This is believable enough given that it takes place in a matter of hours, however we never really connect with any of the characters making continual investment in their story rather difficult.These things being said Tarantino's first film still stands as brilliant foreshadowing of the career he would go on to create for himself. The films greatest strengths still lie in the moments it creates, the ""stuck in the middle with you"" scene is still one of the most gruesomely original in any film. While some may say that the movie is marred by its simplicity I feel the simplicity was by choice. Everything about this film revels in its simplicity from the names of the characters (simple colors) to the plot itself. Every aspect exudes the outstanding minimalism that can be studied for years to come.While there are places where the film still stumbles, Reservoir Dogs still stands as a fine achievement of film making. Although it drags in places, the dialog and simplicity keep us hanging on long enough to make it to the thrilling conclusion. (The film is a perfectly portioned 99 minutes.) Tarantino's film making prowess proves to us why only he could make something like this work so well. Despite its few flaws Reservoir Dogs stands up twenty years later as a crowning achievement of independent films. (For more reviews visit www.bmf-movies.blogspot.com)",Reservoir Dogs

983,panzergon,Flying curses instead of bullets or chilling suspense.,4,5 February 2012,"Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a crime suspense movie about six criminals trying to find out who was a snitch after their botched robbery. The characters had alias named after colors. Mr. White played by Harvey Keitel, Mr. Blonde played by Michael Madsen, Mr. Pink played by Steve Buscemi, Mr. Blue played by Eddie Bunker, Mr. Orange by Tim Roth, and Mr. Brown by the director Quentin Tarantino.The movie doesn't have a lot of shooting scenes like many other action movies, yet featured a lot of scenes with plenty of blood, enough to donate for a leukemia patient. The gore and killings were accompanied by very slowly progressing scenes of flashbacks accompanied by hip music. Overall, the theme is slowly but violent meltdown of a band of thieves.From the opening of the movie, the gang of six were introduced as stingy, bad mouthing, degenerates who picked on each other for small bones. The lack of any dramatic action would soon be set upon by plenty of blood in the car with Mr. White and Mr. Orange. The style of loud hip music from the cast introduction would be kept for the rest of the movie, as that was the only type of music in the movie. The rest of the scenes had mostly dialogues by characters and occasional soundtrack of gun fire and blood splatter.The gang's member's flashbacks revealed the main plot of the movie as they bring the characters into view. The viewers get to see who is bad, who is ugly, and who is worse. There were hints of someone who might be an undercover agent working against the gang, but that would not come clear into the view until later on the movie as all hell breaks loose between them. That was pretty much the main plot twist to keep the viewers interested.Compared to The Usual Suspects (1995), between all the yelling and cursing of the gang of six, Reservoir Dogs lacked suspense between the criminals. The warehouse scenes were too bland in setting as well as editing. The flashbacks had plenty of blood and action but not enough excitement as the viewer is not attached to the characters well enough in the earlier scenes. The flashbacks also didn't bring enough surprises to expect more from the unfolding of plot in the warehouse.If The Usual Suspects was a hit pop-corn movie to watch with others, Reservoir Dogs is a movie that shows up on the list when there's no more re-runs of cop thriller Starsky and Hutch.",Reservoir Dogs

985,caseii01,Reservoir Dogs (Review),8,15 March 2012,"Reservoir Dogs (Review)This film directed by Quentin Tarantino is centered on six individuals with relatively the same type of background (criminals). The story of these six gentlemen starts with a calculated plan to rob a jewelry store. The men are led by crime boss Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) along with his son Eddie (Chris Penn). As they embark on robbing the diamond store they encounter resistance from the police. This ultimately leads to a shootout between them and the cops. Members of their group are injured and killed thus sending the message they were set-up. Each member begins to turn on each other realizing someone within their tight nit group is an undercover agent. As they question one another's integrity and commitment, tensions begin to rise amongst the group creating an atmosphere of distrust and animosity. The thieves are identified by names of different colors for the protection of themselves and their identities. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen). The theme behind this film is based on friendship and loyalty to one another. This is obviously tested when the group is forced to rival against one another to prove their innocence in being an undercover cop. Mr. Blonde a psychotic individual just released from prison (but very loyal to Joe), reveals his true self when he kidnaps and tortures a cop, his demeanor is very riveting and cunning in the sense of being one sick individual. The climax of the movie is when Mr. Orange (The undercover agent) finds the strength to kill Mr. Blonde before he burns the cop alive. When Joe (the crime boss) enters the warehouse and finds Mr. Blonde shot to death he then suspects Mr. Orange of being the undercover agent but the reinforcement of the theme, ""friendship"" is represented and clouds the better judgment of Mr. White which leads to a shootout between the group.There were multiple techniques used in this film to portray and enhance the theme of the movie. The first being the constant images and patterns that represents friendship throughout the film. For example, Mr. White's concern for Mr. Orange after being shot during the robbery was constantly shown through flashbacks, courageous words, and his actions. Another technique used to enhance the overall theme of the movie was the low-key lighting used in the film. I believe this enhanced the relationship and heightened the suspense in finding who was loyal to the group and who was not. The overall setting was also crucial in the success of the plot and theme, I believe it gives the viewer a sense of being part of the action and suspense.",Reservoir Dogs
986,mini-miles,my comments will be my opinion,10,16 April 2004,"when i first saw reservoir dogs i was just twelve years old.i think if a child is mature enough, understands violence and is with an adult it should be fine for a child who is under eighteen to watch the film.it is a very violent film but what can you expect with the genre of a gangster film.i thourouly enjoyed reservoir dogs throughout it all,along with violence and swearing it had comedy at sometimes wierd points.the best actors (in my opinion) were micheal madsen(mr. blonde) and chris penn(nice guy eddie). i think thats nice guy eddies real name anyway! mr. orange was a good actor too,being able to be cocky,angry and helpless.they were all good actors everyone who had a big part i especially liked marvin nash after he'd had his ear chopped off by mr. blonde how he was talking like some-one would talk if they were deformed. even though you didn't see his ear being chopped off i still closed my eyes and just kept singing 'stuck in the middle with you' it was a very good and well planned scene. over all the film was very enjoyable and i could watch it every day and still be suprised and shocked.",Reservoir Dogs

The only reason I even gave it a 3/10 is because it was so bad it actually made me laugh at times. The story line lacks depth and promotes violence. The hatred that is exhibited for police officers is somewhat repulsive. It was actually painful to watch. The actors did a good job at portraying characters but most of the scenes are so unnecessary and irrelevant that I lost interest in them. This movie is an absolute NO from me! Do not waste the hour and 39 minutes of your lives. I am actually in awe at the amount of people in the reviews describing this movie as a ""classic"".",Reservoir Dogs

I don't think it's a proper gangster film like good fellas or Casino Which are classics. I also don't like how some characters try to come across as tough. Complete Waste Of Time ...

991,simchakozberg,Classic Tarantino Film,9,13 June 2012,"This film is about a group of men who are involved in a heist that does not go as planned. As the film goes on, the men that are involved in the heist suffer consequences from there poor decisions while they are trying to figure out what went wrong and how the leader Joe Cabot gathered them. The cast is as follows: Mr. Brown is played by Quentin Tarantino who is also the director of the film, Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange, Edward Bunker plays Mr. Blue, Michael Madsen plays Mr. Blonde, Harvey Keitel who plays Mr. White Chris Penn Plays Nice Guy Eddie, Steve Buscemi plays Mr. Pink, Joe Cabot is played by Lawrence Tierney. The actors fit their roles quite well and Tarantino did a wonderful job directing. The actors do a great job playing their characters to the point where you think they are actually brutal in real life. This is a typical Tarantino film with gory scenes and foul language. Some scenes can be compared to Pulp Fiction with the graphic violence and the mistreated people. With mostly descriptive dialogue, there are some very graphic scenes that are hard to watch. Even though this film is pretty violent, it's a great action film that keeps you interested through out the whole movie and has classic actors that are perfect for their roles. It's hard to believe that some of these guys act the way they do. Mr. Blonde is a pure psycho. He has no soul. Some of the things he does in this film are just straight shocking. This film has so much originality that its one of those movies where it can be watched numerous times without getting boring. If this is the first Tarantino film that you see, this will give you an idea of how the rest of his films are like. This film will make you think about what the consequences' could be for making the wrong decisions.",Reservoir Dogs
992,speich03,Classic Tarantino,7,17 June 2012,"**This review contains a plot summary, however, the ending is not included.Reservoir Dogs is a film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino back in 1992. The films plot is about a group of six men that are of different backgrounds, with various wrap sheets, who are hired by a felonious boss named Joe Cabot, played by actor Lawrence Tierney. Joe and his son ""Nice Guy Eddie"", played by Chris Penn have accumulated a pack of misfit, criminal, and strangers from the lowest levels of society. Some of the men have done previous ""jobs"" for Joe Cabot; in fact, Mr. Blonde, played by Vic Vega, even served time for Joe. Through their proved loyalty, past experience, and willingness Joe chose each of these met to pull off a major heist of rare diamonds. To protect each other and themselves, each man's identity was to be kept a secret even for each other. This of course is why Joe gave each of the ""Reservoir Dog's"" color names. The movie is a combination of dramatic scenes before and after the heist. The heist itself is never shown. The move uses jump cuts to the past, which helps to give more insight into the character's and how/when they were hired for the job. These cuts from present to past, show what directly happened after the heist to specific characters. These jump cuts usually occur after one of the characters explained what they did or whom they killed after the spoiled heist. The opening scene takes place in a restaurant with all eight men sitting in matching suits (all except Joe Cabot, and Eddie Cabot) drinking coffee prior to the heist. Although they are all strangers, and are about to attempt a valuable robbery, their crude conversation is focused on the subjects of tipping (or not tipping) waitresses and lyrical analysis of popular songs. The language and dialog content in this scene, and throughout the movie is vulgar, but with a touch of dark humor. The film then cuts to the opening credits and introduction of the actors as each character. This iconic scene, with all the men walking nonchalant together to their cars is one that is recognize with people who haven't even seen the movie. This scene is shot in slow motion and then for dramatic effect, freeze frames on each man's face. As mentioned previously the slow motion is for effect and the freeze frames are to introduce each of the different characters. The next scene of the film cuts to a mortally wounded Mr. Orange played by Tim Roth, who is thriving in bloody agony after being shot in the gut. At this time the viewer realizes the heist has passed and something when terrible wrong. The remainder of the film takes place in what appears to be an abandoned warehouse, which served as the rendezvous point. It is at this warehouse that the film unfolds and occasionally shows flashback so the men being hired by Joe and their reaction/actions after the heist. We only hear about what happened during the heist afterwords by the characters recollections. At the warehouse the first three men present, are Mr. Orange, Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel, and Mr. Pink played by Steve Buscemi. Mr. White has been tending to the physical and emotional state of Mr. Orange while Mr. Pink frantically paces about stating that they had been set up. It is at this time that we learn Mr. Brown, played by Quentin Tarantino himself, had been shot in the head and killed. During this side we see the different personalities of the characters come alive. Mr. White seems to be a caring, nurturing personality, Mr. Pink seems hysterical and angry, and Mr. Orange dying in a pool of his own blood, makes us feel compassion for him. As the movie proceeds, Mr. Blonde, played by Michael Madsen, appears with a cop in his truck that he has held hostage. The men begin to beat the cop into giving them information on the ""rat"" in the group. Soon after the cop is savagely tortured and mutilated by Mr. Blonde. The ending is a must see, and will not be spoiled by this reviewI believe the theme of this film is that life of crime gets you nowhere and nowhere can lead you quickly to your demise. This film shows many different kinds and degrees of criminals; some are cheap, some are affectionate, some are hysterical, and others are torturous psychopaths. In the end, no matter what type or caliber the criminal the world they live in and the people they associate with, may eventually consume them. Bad deeds to not go unpunished and in this film's case, all of the criminals some how managed to turn and punish each other, all because of a robbery gone-wrong. The bizarre plot and characters of this film keep you guessing the entire time. The acting is stellar and truly makes you feel as if you are present in the film. The movie stay consistently morbid and gory, with touches of raw dark humor. Tarantino is known for his film's motifs, and gory violence. Many viewers who enjoyed Reservoir Dogs will surely enjoy other Tarantino hits like Pulp Fiction. These two movies are similar in many ways. Tarantino sets the bar high as far as film blood and gore, however, I would still recommend everyone to see at least one Tarantino movie in their life; they are like none other.",Reservoir Dogs
993,calum-rankin,Positive review for my Film Studies homework.,10,13 September 2012,"A group of eight criminals who do not know one another are hired by Joe Cabot to take part in a one-off job to rob a jewelry store. They are all given colour-coded names to protect each of their identity. Although, on the day the job goes horribly wrong and the police ambush the gang of criminals and they all have to make their own way out. As they make their way back to their arranged meeting point they soon start to consider that one member of the group must have informed the police or possibly be an undercover officer. All the criticisms soon turn into acts of violence in the location of the warehouse.What I enjoyed about the film was that it's not just a typical crime film. Reservoir Dogs is a lot more realistic, especially with the use of mise en scene, there is no make up that creates a good-looking criminal as a character, which would usually be seen in big Hollywood films. It is mostly set in the same room, which is the warehouse they meet up in after the ambush. Tarantino presented the film so simply that it is representing the genuine position a gang of criminals would be in after being chased by the police following a robbery suspiciously going wrong. Also, I liked that the dialogue is so normal as it starts with a standard looking bunch of men sitting having a coffee talking about women and music. I believe this is very unique to a film that it makes it even more natural and convincing. When I started watching the film for the first time I wasn't sure what to expect. But, from the soundtrack used after the first scene I was expecting a standard robbery that goes down to plan as they are walking down the street looking very confident with an enthusiastic song playing along, this created the image that they know what they are doing and are relaxed about it all.After watching the movie I read some reviews on the film and some said that the violence was a bit unnecessary, I completely disagreed with this as I thought that the violence helped to build upon the characters true personalities as it exposed Mr. Blonde as a genuine psychopath.Overall I would say Reservoir Dogs is a movie you must watch if you haven't done so already. It is one of my favourite movies due to the great soundtracks, the natural dialogue and the lifelike twist at the end.",Reservoir Dogs
994,volleydolly,Tarantino's Best,9,9 March 2005,"It seems to me that this film originally defined QT, who defined the cinema of the 1990's, so indirectly Reservoir Dogs defined the 90's film scene. It is a deeply emotional thriller, a far cry from QT's later Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill which offer a fraction of the character depth of even the most minuscule people in RD. It also has one of the most memorable scenes in American film history, as who could forget the Ear Scene. When compared to PF and other hit movies of the time most consider RD to be not-equal, but I think it is better. The dialog is witty, some scenes intense and gripping, making you almost fear what happens next. It is one of the most complete and near-perfect films of the 90's. The acting is |---| that far from perfect, with great showings from Steve Buschemi, Harvey Keitel, and the wonderfully sadistic Michael Madsen. It is probably the best indie film of all time and deserves its place on the Top 250, and should probably be higher. Thank you.",Reservoir Dogs
995,jd3795,The birth of a new genre: Tarantino,9,24 August 2015,"I've written about Tarantino a lot of times, which is allowed because he's one of the most famous directors in the world. And with the release of the trailer for his 8th (rumoured to be his last) movie, Hateful Eight, it seems fair to wax lyrical over his first, breakout film, Reservoir Dogs. One of those films that needs to be watched twice, Reservoir Dogs gained Tarantino a lot of attention in Hollywood, for all the reasons that Tarantino has since become globally renowned. Plenty of blood which keeps your eyes fixed on the screen, plenty of swearing which makes it difficult to zone out, and a plot that doesn't go very far but develops the story and characters subtly. The reason I say it needs to be watched twice isn't due to subtle clues alluding to the finale that can only be noticed once you've already watched it, like Fight Club or Usual Suspects, but simply that Reservoir Dogs is a bad movie the first time through. OK not a bad movie, but as I mentioned previously, the actual time line of the film only lasts about an hour, so it stands to reason that it would be difficult to fit much action or drama into that short a space of time. The film is about a diamond robbery, and at no point in the 99 minute run time do we see any form of robbery occurring. People anticipating a movie with plenty of fighting and action will be disappointed, and those who can't stand a movie which refuses to move from a single location will be in tears. But those people who can focus on every detail, and every piece of dialogue, will be rewarded with one of the greatest movies they will ever see. The movie begins with a bunch of gangsters sitting in a coffee shop, discussing Like a Virgin by Madonna, and tipping. Innocuous conversation between apparent life-long friends, before walking off into the sunset to the sound of Little Green Bag. The credits roll, and you wonder if you're watching the right movie. Then, as if on cue, the screen is filled with blood, a screaming man, and instant tension. It's impossible to look away, as the viewer must find out what went so horribly wrong with whatever it was these well- dressed men were up to. All is explained surely enough, and this is another of the films strengths. The gang of gangsters have conducted a diamond theft, which went wrong when one of the gangsters started shooting people he shouldn't. The police arrive, all hell breaks loose, and the gang must return to a secret warehouse to regroup (the warehouse being the main set for the majority of the movie). Once here, they work out one by one that they have been set up by a mole in the group, an undercover cop. It is at this point that the audience is assuming the rest of the movie will be trying to work out who the cop is. What's unexpected though at this stage is that the mole is revealed, and dramatic irony is flowing through, as the audience knows the cop, but no one else does. This leaves the story wide open, but it is clear that a climax is imminent, and there must one last twist in this tale to leave us feeling stunned. There is no twist, but the ending is no less shocking, over the top, inevitable, but no less perfectly crafted. One of the factors causing this is the cast. The gangsters include names which have since been involved in most other Tarantino films. Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Chris Penn all give excellent performances, but the standout was Steve Buscemi. He plays Mr Pink, and is the one guy you're designed to hate the whole way through. He complains about tipping waitresses at the beginning of the movie, which was unheard of in the USA in the 90's, as tipping your waitress was as important as paying for the meal itself. He seems to coward his way out of dangerous situations, and just seems like the one guy in the group that, despite them all being long-term criminals, you just wouldn't want to spend any time with. What's truly excellent, and I'm sure its intentional, is that Buscemi's character is styled and acted in such a way as to look as much like a rodent as possible, with the pencil moustache and slicked back hair. And when the finale comes in and guns are fired, Mr Pink manages to slink away unscathed. The definition of a rat, in the gangster community, is that it will do everything in its power to survive, typified by Buscemi's character. It's this sort of attention to detail, among other things, that makes this movie so re-watchable, that while there is very little visual action, the movie itself is a work of art. The soundtrack is understandably legendary, the dialogue is engrossing, and the ending catches you out every single time.",Reservoir Dogs
996,jarvie_a,A Fantastic Film,9,19 April 2006,"This is a great film. I loved it the first time i saw it on television and have both Region 2 copies of the DVD releases.I watched this film again at the weekend for the first time in ages and I had forgotten how good it actually is! It has a great story, a heist gone wrong, told in a non-linear fashion. It has a great cast, including three outstanding performances in my opinion (Keitel, Madsen & Roth) and a memorable script with countless quotable scenes.Everything about this film is interesting. The conversation in the coffee shop where we are introduced to all the characters and are given a little insight to them. This scene is funny, but doesn't prepare us for the mayhem to proceed. After the title credits we meet tow of the characters in a getaway car, one covered in blood, not sure he is gonna live and the other one panicking and trying to clam him down while driving away. We then reach the warehouse where we remain for the majority of the film and find put more about the characters and the robbery gone wrong.I wish I knew more about cinematography and the like to really appreciate films, but always listen to commentary's and watch the documentaries on DVDs to get a greater insight into that kinda thing, however the camera work in this film is really interesting and you can tell every shot had a lot of planning behind it.I think Quentin Tarantino is great and i have throughly enjoyed all of his films and scripts i have seen (TR, NBK, RD, PF, JB, KBV1&2) and think its great that he uses similar things in his films (big kahuna burgers, red apple cigs) and characters are referenced (Alabama and Marsellus are both mentioned by Joe in RD) I know this isn't very coherent, or in-depth.

The film's emotional core, and what elevates it to greatness, is the profound bond that exists between Mr. White and Mr. Orange. Their non-traditional dynamic (in which they both exhibit ""feminine"" traits; White's compassion/tenderness, Orange's vulnerability) is presented as something superior that exists outside of the masculine. The way 12 Angry Men is a film featuring white men while exposing the trappings of white male privilege, Reservoir Dogs is a film featuring hyper-masculinity that celebrates gender non- conformativity.

Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls.

1001,dj_mehdi_disciple,Quite possibly one of the best debut films by a director,10,15 January 2005,"I have seen Reservoir Dogs many, many times and didn't hesitate to buy the special edition when it came out. A lot of people have been writing off this film saying that it copies from lots of films, well get this, Tarantino worked in a video shop before making it big and so he would have had plenty of time to watch the many films on offer. He probably grew to love those films, especially noir, and decided to include the best scenes from those films in his films. Note the plot is like City of Fire or, less obviously, the Asphalt Jungle. Both films are about botched robberies and it's aftermath. I could spend all day defending Tarantino and his alleged copying of films but I don't want to do that. Instead, I want to talk about the actual film itself. Great acting, especially from Harvey Keital, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen among others. The dialogue is witty and fresh not to mention incredibly foul-mouthed but it's foul-mouthed in a good way. Exceptional pieces of dialogue is the 'Like a Virgin' meaning discussion and the commode story by Mr Orange. Sure, the story has been used loads of times but Tarantino breathes new life into it in a way that you can't describe. One of the brilliant factors of the film is the music. 70's music isn't exactly popular in films made outside of the 70's but in this film it doesn't sound out of place and the choice of music is unsurpassed. 'Stuck in the middle with you' during the cop torturing scene and 'Lime in the coconut' at the credits have a relation in some way to what goes on in the film but I'll let you watch and decide for yourself to see if Reservoir Dogs is as good as I say. Watch it and your viewing experience won't be the same. Thank You",Reservoir Dogs

The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail.I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.",Reservoir Dogs

For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...).

1007,nelewuyts,90 minutes of great Tarantino fun,10,29 July 2017,"I think it's save to say this is my favourite movie of all time. I'm not really sure why, though. Is it the suspense of the story line - who's the mole? Is it the iconic Stuck In The Middle scene, which is painful to watch but also entertaining? Is it the awkward and somehow hilarious stumbling in the last scenes? What I can say that this movie gave me a great mix of cringe, interest, laughter, sadness and repulsion... Another important factor is that the story isn't rushed; it seems like you're living the story yourself. It's not a roller-coaster of events, just a simple story line. For me, that's really important - maybe because I live in an action-movie loving family. In that respect Reservoir Dogs seems like a movie where I'm allowed to breath and to be calmly swallowed by the story. I would definitely recommend this movie.",Reservoir Dogs
1008,osufan4554,One of the Best,9,6 April 2005,"I have seen some of Quentin Tarantion's work like Kill Bill. I liked it but and my personal favorite, Pulp Fiction. When I was getting ready to watch Reservoir Dogs I had pretty high expectations. For the most part it filled them. Like most of his films it has a sweet opening scene where Mr. Brown, who is played by Quentin Tarantion, has a little speech when he tells everyone at the table what a song means. The music is prefect for the movie; I loved the opening music almost as much as I liked it in Pulp Fiction. I will never listen to Stuck in the Middle with You the same way again. The violence is pretty strong, but it does not really show that much. Quentin Tarantion might be one of the best writers of screen plays I have ever seen. The dialog sounds so real that it helps move along the movie. You do not get to see the diamond heist but that does not ruin the movie because the characters explain what happened at the store. I think if any other directors other then Tarantion were to do this movie it would be boring and would never have got all the awards that it did. This was Quentin Tarantion's first movie that he directed. Before that he was just working in a movie store. Over all I liked the movie for its humor and its dialog. If you can get over the film's violence then I think you will have a good time. Out of 10 would give the movie a 9.5.",Reservoir Dogs

Of course the performances are great too.This is basically a story of 6 men who pull off a heist, and I am not going to spoil it for you one bit if you haven't seen it already. The story may be summarized in a few lines, but what stands out is the way Tarantino was able to handle the script. If you look at it, you start the movie when they are about to go for the robbery, or are just done with it. There are six guys and Tarantino is able to seamlessly go into the flashback for many of them showing how they were roped in and what they are all about. In parallel, the story continues to move forward, and amazingly, it all makes sense! I would regard this movie very highly for this reason. There are threads (flashback, recalls, jokes) in the story, and at the same time total continuity is maintained, and the climax is the crescendo of all of it.People may say Pulp Fiction is cool... but for script work and control, I don't think it stands anywhere close to this.I rate it 9/10 - why 9?

He took a huge risk in making this the way he did, especially for a debut, but he did it, and I'm thankful.This isn't much of a review, but that's because the film was made in 1992 and there are plenty of other reviews that will present my view with more depth.The acting is fantastic, the dialogue is inexplicably intriguing, the soundtrack is like no other and it oozes that lovable Tarantino style.If you haven't seen it, what are you doing?

It shows a lot about the different characters, and the movie is presented in an excellent way for a director. Yay again QT. I would like to point out that Blonde is not a color, and that Mr. Blonde is insane. Pink considers himself a professional but he seems to be freaking out the most. Why does it seem like Orange is White's protegé? He seems to be pushing him around after they are leaving the car with Mr. Brown dead. He just seems to be nice to him and stand up for him because he was dying and asking for his name and other information. Why did he give it? BTW how did Joe find out that Orange was the rat?",Reservoir Dogs
1014,Sebbi1,28 years later - Still amazing!,7,24 February 2020,It's hard to belive that 'Reservoir Dogs' came out twenty eight years ago and still holds up. Tarantino made an enormous impact with this Movie.,Reservoir Dogs
1015,althompsone,"A delightful menagerie of non-linearity, earlessness, and Joe.",9,31 May 2005,"Reservoir Dogs is a (non-linear) story about six (four significantly) unacquainted career-criminals who are hired for a job but introduced to each other by alias only. During the attempted heist (apparently there is one), things go pear-shaped and the presence of a ""rat"" is strongly suspected. Distrust and paranoia predictably ensue, as do sporadic outbreaks of severe physical pain.I disagree with Joe-290 (the only other Irish person to submit a review for this film), in that I do, in fact, think Reservoir Dogs is a great film, certainly within its own decade. The quality of the overall plot (which is good anyway) does not matter, I feel, when the overall effect is considered. This film is endowed with a streak of intelligent originality I have rarely seen elsewhere. The famous inclusion of the soundtrack as part of a radio-station that features prominently during the film is just one of many individual examples.The script is non-linear and non-continuous, and so refers to some aspects of the story only indirectly and certain aspects of the characters which would have been treated with importance in other films are, almost flippantly, left to the imagination. This is, at least, an interesting and original effect and, at best, may even enhance characterization, as events on the screen can never emulate those which occur in the mind.Despite the heavy and sometimes unusual violence, there is an all-too-human and realistic feel to the characters and to events in general. This is perpetuated by scenes such as the ""meeting with Joe"", in which the hired criminals are seen to be assigned their ""job-aliases"" on an arbitrary basis.So what does Reservoir Dogs comment on and depict? Organized crime and its attendant unpleasantness I suppose, for a start. Human relations (I won't get into the whole ""love story between men theory"", although it is amusing to keep in mind post first viewing). It certainly doesn't resolve the problem of existence or articulate the fabric of the universe (though I think Joe almost does so accidentally at one point). It is, however, a verifiable work of art and ""great"" film  and it's damn cool.",Reservoir Dogs

And besides, WTF was in the suitcase in PF? Marcellas Wallace's soul? Bullshit!!! The part of Mr. White was to be played by Tom Sizemore, instead, the part of Mr. White was played by Michael Madsen, who in many realms of popular design is close to the same character as Sizemore would played if given the opportunity.

1017,nmcgraw123,Reservoir Dogs - great independent film,9,11 October 2014,"The master piece that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" is hands down one of the most underrated movies in history. The independent film was directed by Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind ""Pulp Fiction"", the ""Kill Bill"" series, and ""Django Unchained"". Running at an hour and a half, every minute is filled with blood, violence, and foul language. Three factors that would go on to define Tarantino as a director. The movie revolves around six strangers who come together to perform a heist on a diamond store. Unfortunately the heist goes bad and leads the six men to figure out who among them is an undercover police officer. The film has received many great reviews (IMDB=8.4 / Rotten Tomatoes=8.8) such as Empire magazine calling it the ""Greatest Independent Film ever made"". Since it was an independent movie it only managed to produce $2,812,029 in box office sales. This falls way below the amounts seen on the All-time Box office earnings list. This statistic is not surprising but it does prove that independent movies should be taken seriously and that box office revenue is not a suitable way to measure a films quality.",Reservoir Dogs

Quentin Tarantino has always had a knack for writing great dialogue in his movies, which spend less time dazzling you with explosions and hot actors and more time pulling you in with unique story lines and entertaining discussions that's not to say he hasn't had his fair share of adding flair to his films but I've always felt the focus was more on his characters and what they have to say as opposed to what they were doing.

If you plan to become a film director one day this film is a must. Quentin establishes his directorial sensibilities while protecting his vision from ruthless Hollywood producer. Q said he would have made this film with no name talent on 16mm film if the studios had tried to take any control. The direction of vetted Hollywood actors is out of this league for a first timer, but the true artistry comes through the lines on the page. QT used this film to cement the voice that today is inseparable from his own. ""Dogs"" is not QT's first writing success, he penned and sold the popular Tony Scott movie ""True Romance"" before he started writing ""Dogs"". The two films released around the same time and created a wave of buzz for the new director.

When I first heard of this movie I thought it was going to be just about a bank heist, but it ended up being much more. I loved the way the movie was put together( out of order). Quentin did an amazing job with this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was Mr.Pinks fate. I know that this is up to the viewer and makes the movie better, but I think that it is good to know. If he dies then it makes the movie much darker knowing that because of Mr. Orange, everyone would die. Another thing I liked is the intro scene. The choice of music makes this scene much better than it would have been with any other song. The complexion of this movie also is astonishing. The scene where Mr. Blonde cuts off the cops ear shows the characteristics of him.",Reservoir Dogs

It was filmed in a gritty, very real style that captured the simplicity perfectly. From Mr. Orange bleeding in a car's backseat to Mr. Blonde chopping a cop's ear off, the film is full of sadistic humor in Tarantino's usual style. Despite some's views on Tarantino's gore factor, I have to say the movie wouldn't have been the same without it. Every detail that appeared on camera was necessary to convey the tale. I must admit, however, that not everyone will enjoy it. For example, friends of mine absolutely hate stories that start in the middle of the events and go back to tell you what happened and they find it confusing even though Reservoir Dogs does a relatively good job of keeping the viewer on track. Anyway, I'd recommend it for film-buffs and the like, so go watch it.",Reservoir Dogs

The movie keeps you interested and guess the whole time. Brilliant acting performances by all involved. The actors truly make you believe each situation. Tarantino's story telling style is very unique. Mr. Pink's soliloquy in the beginning is priceless. It allows the viewer to feel like they are in the group and apart of the movie although it does very little to progress the plot. Surprising twist to look forward to allows the internal detective in everyone to actively pay attention. A wonderful ending that leaves imagination and closure simultaneously.,Reservoir Dogs

This is one of those movies that seems average at first glance, but upon watching, is surprisingly fantastic. I wish someone would have told me about this years ago. Quentin is a crazy man.It's violent, yes. 50% of the dialogue is lude and crude. It's not something you'd take your mother to see, unless she's partial to that sort of thing.

1025,Tarantinomaniac,"Disturbing, Thrilling, Fascinating, and--most of all--pure Tarantino.",10,16 July 2005,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's original masterpiece, his first movie to show what was to come in his future films and is as good as any other movie of his. It tells the story of a criminal, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierny--Dillinger) and his son, Eddy (Chris Penn--Starsky and Hutch) who hire six guys to rob a bank who are known to each other only by their given names for this robbery--Mr. White (Harvey Keitel--Pulp Fiction), the hot-tempered guy: a talkative, constantly swearing New York man, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen--Kill Bill), the sadistic guy: a gun firing, ear-hacking, cop-torturing maniac, Mr. Orange (Tim Roth--Four Rooms), the quiet guy, the silent one who occasionally puts in a few words, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi--Desperado), the smart guy, the fast talking one who's the best at keeping out of fights, Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino--From Dusk Till Dawn), the joker, the funny one who dislikes Madonna, and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker--The Longest Yard) the old one--the rarely seen one who always tips waitresses. They team up to rob a place of some diamonds, only to be caught by the police immediately. The survivors reunite back at a warehouse and conclude that one of them must have told the police about the robbery, but there is no way to tell who. Soon, they are all fighting against each other--either blaming one another of being the rat or sticking up for a friend.Reservoir Dogs is a very brutal film. There is graphic violence in it and nonstop profanity. But it's no less than realistic. It contains as much violence and as much swearing as is believable for a bunch of criminals. Though the script is unpleasant to listen to, you'll forget about it all by the middle, where the film takes it's real twists and gives real thrilling content. This movie is definitely an R-Rated movie. Bloody and profane, it makes no attempt whatsoever to get a PG-13 rating. But it is incredible. Anyone who has seen it will say so. Indeed, it displays Quentin Tarantino's full abilities in movie making.",Reservoir Dogs

You almost want to rub your nose into the film! I would even rate it 11 out of 10 for how great it is! The best independent film is this film! All other indies should take note on this one because independent films are getting worse and worse every year, or in a sense, sappy, not all of them are sappy, but enough where I can't stand the thought of independent films but when I saw that Reservoir Dogs was an independent film, I saw that I have to make one! Also, the ear torture scene wasn't shown on camera but you can put two and two together and figure it out! It is pretty realistic unlike other movies such as some bad horror movies where a persons eye enlarges and then explodes! That's just purely disgusting and very very very unrealistic! This movie is also better than The English Patient , which is STUPID!!, STUPID!!! I hate sappy romance stories and the worst part is that they get all of the awards for explaining people's dumb love lives! If you want to show your love life, get your own reality sitcom!!

1027,asennett16,"""We're Supposed to be F*****g Professionals!""",9,19 May 2016,"It's no wonder that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is part of the reason why Quentin Tarantino first started to became known as the ""boy wonder"" of Hollywood. Still in his late twenties, Tarantino had directed a movie that was as smart as it was entertaining. ""Reservoir Dogs"" left audiences in shock (and sometimes even out in the lobby) due to its violence, yet left them in stitches due to it's hilarity. There was not a second that went by during this movie that I felt bored, and that is a credit both to Tarantino's amazing dialogue and his ability to create tension-filled scenes.The characters in this movie are all tons of fun to watch, and are the kind of people that you guiltily end up liking even though most of them are hardened criminals. I especially liked Tim Roth's character, Mr. Orange AKA Freddy Newmandyke, and Harvey Keitel's character, Mr. White AKA Larry Dimmick. Both of these characters were complex and interesting, and their relationship with one and other in a sort of father and son-he-never-had dynamic was both touching and tragic; touching in that a hardened criminal like Dimmick could take a young thief under his wing like his own son, yet tragic in that Dimmick would throw his relationship with Newmandyke out the window once Newmandyke revealed that he was a cop. It just goes to show that there really is no honor among thieves. I also liked the character of Mr. Pink, who was the only one among the men that really saw the other men for what they were: scumbags. It was obvious that he recognized himself as a scumbag too, but what made him different was that he was a professional scumbag, and in the end that's what saved his life.Another thing worth mentioning about this movie is the way that it is told, both visually and chronologically. This movie introduced Tarantino's penchant for non-linear storytelling, (Inglorious Basterds, Pulp Fiction) and did it beautifully. With its constant reveals through flashbacks and flashbacks-in-flashbacks, ""Reservoir Dogs"" lets the audience know in its own time every detail that it wants them to know. This type of storytelling is truly exciting and fun to watch, and is a huge reason why ""Reservoir Dogs"" works. Also, I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Newmandyke was telling his ""commode story"", and it cut to him in the imaginary bathroom talking to some police officers like they were Mr. White, Joe, and Nice-Guy Eddie. This is another great example of ""Reservoir Dogs""'s unique style of storytelling, which is truly reminiscent of the French New Wave in that it breaks many of the ""rules"" of film.Lastly, and certainly not least, the soundtrack is yet another in a long line of fabulous Tarantino soundtracks. The fake radio station ""K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's"" works amazingly in this movie, and always plays the perfect song for the moment. I mean, c'mon, I don't think there could have been a more perfect choice of music for the torture scene.Listen, this film doesn't leave you contemplating deep life questions. This film leaves you bobbing your head to some great music, and repeating quotes from it for a good week or so, (""If you shoot me in your dreams, you better wake up and apologize""). In my opinion, this film is perfect for what it is: a kick-ass crime movie with snappy dialogue and lots of twists along the way. What makes this movie a classic isn't its deep metaphors on life or social commentary, it's its memorable characters and unique, riveting style.",Reservoir Dogs

When I put the film on, I was disappointed to see just a group of men in suits at a restaurant. I assumed this was just the intro to the film, before the dogs were introduced, but suddenly it becomes a movie filled with violence and swearing. The title is very misleading, as the film itself was enjoyable, just unexpected, mainly the reason for this low rating.

This is his first movie, which is a low-budget-movie. But This movie is too good to be a low-budget-movie. If Reservoir Dogs had the same quality like as Pulp Fiction, could Tarantino and maybe, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Michael Madsen won a Oscar for this movie. And the actors, I will start with Harvey Keitel.Harvey Keitel, who is a very good actor, had a very good performance. He played Mr.White: A dude who thought Mr.Blonde or Someone else was behind ""the police backup"".Tim Roth, who is a British-American, played mr.orange. I didn't liked him in this movie. HE was the one who shot Mr.Blonde.Michael Madsen, Which is MY favourite actor in this movie, played Mr.Blonde and had a very very very goood performance. I liked him dance to the song ""Stuck in the middle with you"" and torture the cop. He was a stone-cold psycho in this movie. My favourite quote with him is: ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy, or you gonna bite?""Chris Penn, brother to Sean Penn and died two years ago, played Nice Guy Eddie. He loved to see him in this movie. He played Mr.Blonde's best friend. ""They are just like brothers"".Steve Buscemi, who played Mr.Pink, had also a good performance. Eddie Bunker, who played Mr.Blue, was the only actor who had a bad performance.Lawrence Tierney, who played Joe Cabot, had a very good performance.And Kirk Baltz, who played the Marvin Nash and was tortured by Mr.Blonde. Poor guy.The Music was very good. There was songs like Little Green Bag, Stuck in the middle with you and Hooked on a feeling.The story was very good. Tarantino is a master and a genius. to make violent movies.Overall Rating to the actors:Harvey Keitel: 10/10 Tim Roth: 7/10 Michael Madsen: 10/10 Chris Penn: 10/10 Steve Buscemi: 9/10 Eddie Bunker: 6/10 Quentin Tarantino: 9/10 Lawrence Tierney:9/10 Kirk Baltz: 10/10Overall Rating to the Movie: 98/100",Reservoir Dogs

They were rounded up by a notorious and wanted mob boss for the heist.

The movie is about Six men, who pull off a bank heist, with colour-coded names - Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker). But, this heist goes terribly wrong, and they all plan to meet up at a nearby Warehouse. Some are hurt, crazy, and even dead - but the surviving Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and the half-dead Mr. Orange, suddenly figure out that they were set up, and one of them MUST be a cop. 'Nice Guy' Eddie (Chris Penn) is the big boss' son, and it was him, and his father, who planned the heist. They find themselves in crazy, unrealistic, and dramatic sequences - as we go through flashbacks of the characters to figure out who was the copper.Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic watch, but not everybody's cup of tea - as for it contains over 200 uses of the ""f"" word, and of course some horrific sequences (including a great 'torture' scene with Michael Madsen like you've never seen him before).

1035,puke_O_rama,dog heat dog day,10,16 September 2005,"i have really no idea what to say about this movie accept it is really a diamond in the rough. it is Quentin Tarantino's second movie. ""as far as i heard he wrote it in the back a movie store"" (haha at least that what i heard he did) ""i don't know for sure."" i love this movie. it shows us everything we need in a story. i saw this movie when i was very young 13 i believe . it just sticks in my mind. i cant help but think about my child hood without thinking about this movie which started it all. now seeing it 7 years later i still think its great. but now seeing it with a new eye, i can see the directing has its perfection. Tarantino as a young director takes what he can, and when he can get it, to make a movie that will stand out in time as one of the underdogs of movies forever.without a bias's opinion this movie is really good, the scenes are really well shot, the actors are extremely well presented, and the story is by far perfectly presented in a way that keeps you stuck to your seat. enjoy it please.",Reservoir Dogs
1036,doubledmw,Captivating 'Who dun it?' Storyline with unexpected twists,10,30 September 2021,"Having seen other Quentin Tarantino movies I knew what I had signed up to see before having watched the movie. His directorial style renowned, in the sense that, Quentin doesn't shy away from taboo subjects or vulgarity. As an actor growing up, he is one of the two directors I definitely want to work with. Needless to say this movie is chalk full of cussing and a couple gory scenes as well. Michael Madson's Character is probably my favorite. I like Mr. Pink as well played by Steve Buscemi. I don't want to give away any details but I will say if you enjoy Tarantino's style this movie will be right up your alley.",Reservoir Dogs

Reservoir dogs uses all the important plot point and just switch minor detail for western audiences minus the actions. If you seen one you basically seen the other.",Reservoir Dogs

1043,tdwarren65,Is there any better Film Debut than this?,10,7 March 2019,"I feel like since i was in HIgh School this movie has always been the reason i decided to work in the movie industry. This is one of those rare movies that never gets old, has the perfect opening scene of thieves talking about Madonna over breakfast before killing, robbing and taking hostages. It is just like Pulp Fiction where 2 hitmen discuss McDonalds right before killing a few people over breakfast.Tarantino has that keen vision that just makes his fans want more and more. That is why it is hard to rank his movies from best to worst, they are all great and different in their own way. Can't wait to see his new film this year. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best movie stars out there.",Reservoir Dogs
