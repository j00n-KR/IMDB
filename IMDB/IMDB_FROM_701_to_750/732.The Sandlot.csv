0,MartinHafer,wonderful family film that will also entertain the parents,8,12 May 2006,"This is a truly amazing film. It's a very good family film that can be enjoyed by BOTH your kids and yourself! That's rare, as often ""family films"" have too much smutty language or sexual situations for kids OR are so saccharine sweet that sane adults would prefer suicide over watching the films (think Disney in the 1960s).The film isn't quite a comedy, though there are really funny moments in it (such as the evil dog that eats baseballs). And, it's not exactly a drama. It's more like an occasionally surreal slice of life film about the good old days of the late 50s-early 60s. It's about a group of kids that live to play baseball--and that's all they ever seem to want to do! Despite this very simple plot, somehow the excellent acting, direction and writing make you really care about the kids and it engages you from start to finish.",The Sandlot
1,SnoopyStyle,Not just a kids movie. It's a great movie.,8,1 October 2013,"Scotty Smalls is the new kid in the idyllic small town with his mom and stepdad. He's an awkward kid who wants to play baseball with neighborhood kids. There were 8 of them, and he hoped to be the ninth. Their best player Benny Rodriquez takes Smalls under his wing. Over the summer, the group has great childhood adventures together. It all culminates to a story of a lost baseball signed by Babe Ruth and a feared dog named the Beast.This is more than just a kids movie. You can easily overdose on the innocence of it all. There is the group of kids. They are perfectly casted with amazing chemistry. Each one is an iconic child type. As a period piece, they picked an era just before the world goes into revulsion. In the sport of baseball, they have accentuated the childhood love of the game.This is a kids movie for the whole family. That's not a cliché. It has the feel of a timeless classic.",The Sandlot
2,Hitchcoc,Beautifully Constructed Movie About Childhood,9,28 December 2016,"I remember that for most of my childhood, all the way to graduation, I played baseball. I was never a varsity player, but my friends and I spent our whole summers doing pickup games. This movie captures a time that doesn't exist any more. Adults have organized so much of the fun out of sports that kids don't get to just play for fun any more. League. League. League. Here we have a ragtag bunch of kids who are all over the place talent- wise. One is fantastic. The rest just love the game. But there is more than the game. There is a mysterious place where balls disappear and a dog the size of a walrus holds forth. There are stories and bragging and all kinds of kid things. There's James Earl Jones, who is feared by the kids through most of the movie until..... See this. It will delight you.",The Sandlot
3,gavin6942,Kid Movie For Adults Who Are Young At Heart,7,3 February 2008,"Growing up as a nerd can be hard, especially when you're trying to make friends with the local kids at the sandlot (where day in and day out it's nothing but baseball). But you do what you can, which means learning the game. Things are going smoothly until the one day, when you find yourself in the world's biggest pickle -- sending your father's baseball (signed by Babe Ruth) into the neighbor's yard, which is guarded by a creature known simply as ""The Beast"".I watched this film on my birthday with my best friend Chelsea, not really knowing what to expect. I figured that not unlike her other preferred films lately (""Mighty Ducks"", ""Little Giants""), it would be a sports underdog film. Well, it's not. Sure, it features kids who come from less-than-wealthy upbringings, but it doesn't have anything to do with them facing off against another ""superior"" team. Just kids, a baseball and a beast.This film will appeal to kids and to adults who wan to be kids. It's a good, clean film with no nudity or violence and only a small amount of cursing. Good for the whole family. The father, who appears only briefly, is played by Denis Leary, but it's not the stand-up Leary or the Leary from ""Judgment Night"" -- it's the one from ""Operation Dumbo Drop"". So expect foul language and you'll be gravely disappointed.I really enjoyed the surreal quality of the beast, how it was played up to be a dinosaur or some other mythical creature. I also liked the Rube Goldberg methods to retrieve the ball. I was a little doubtful that anyone wouldn't know who Babe Ruth was, as the main character doesn't. Sure, you might spend all day reading Popular Science, but it's Babe Ruth. The name itself far surpasses what anyone knows of him.I loved this film. It helped that I watched it with one of my favorite people, but at the same time it was just enjoyable in general. It's nice to have a film that's not raunchy or too cerebral -- just a relaxing trip back to the days of our childhoods (like the protagonist, I also spend more time reading than anything physical). Share my enthusiasm!",The Sandlot
4,lee_eisenberg,even for someone not interested in sports,7,20 June 2005,"""The Sandlot"" may just look like it's about baseball, but moreover, it's about friendship, with some nostalgia thrown in. Set in 1962, Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood. Uncertain of the area at first, he becomes friends with some boys in a baseball field known as the Sandlot. Over the summer, they try to get girls, battle a rival team, and do a few things that they shouldn't have. All the while, they have to remember about a dog known as ""The Beast"".As someone who has never been interested in sports, I seemingly wouldn't take any stock in this movie. But I did. I admit that Karen Allen, as Scotty's mom, and Denis Leary, as her boyfriend, are the only cast members whom I recognize, but it's a really interesting movie.",The Sandlot
5,Quinoa1984,One of the greatest childhood films ever,8,14 June 2000,"The Sandlot is a great childhood film because it examines changes and friendship among a group of pre-teens.  It is really just good old fashioned fun (especially James Earl Jones' cameo) in the adventures of their baseball days.  Denis leary makes one of his breakthrough films here.  Entertainment supreme, and maybe adults will like it too. A",The Sandlot
6,michaelRokeefe,Life is baseball and baseball is life.,7,23 September 2005,"Heartwarming and enjoyable family movie about a young boy(Tom Guidry)that moves into a new town and desperately wanting to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood boys. In the summer of 1962, a bat and a ball is like life's blood. The sandlot is like a home away from home; a place for a young boy to exercise his fantasy and spend the best hours of summer. A good smack will send the ball sailing over the fence to never be seen again for it lands in Mr. Mertle's(James Earl Jones)backyard, which is guarded by a humongous dog...a super slobbering dog that devours just about anything and everything. The high drama and dilemma of the summer is trying to retrieve a Babe Ruth autographed ball from the territory of the big ass junkyard dog, Goliath. Other cast members of note: Patrick Renna, Mike Vitar, Chauncey Leopardi, Denis Leary and Karen Allen. THE SANDLOT is nostalgic, sentimental and stuffed full of innocence and humor. Worth watching again...and again.",The Sandlot
7,utgard14,"""A real pickle!""",7,8 September 2017,"Corny, old-fashioned fun about an awkward new kid in town who makes friends with the local yutes who play sandlot baseball. A likable cast of kids goes a long way to making thin material work. More than a few similarities between this and better films such as A Christmas Story and Stand By Me, including the narration by writer/director David Mickey Evans. It's lightweight fluff, but that's fine. Kids should like it most.",The Sandlot
8,zardoz-13,Diamond in the Rough,10,18 April 2013,"Watching ""The Sand lot"" is a lot of fun. The new kid in the block who doesn't know squat about baseball learns a lot about the game during its 101 minute running time. This tale of initiation resembles an Arthurian myth about a knight slaying a dragon. Our pint-sized knights are playing baseball when the protagonist accidentally loses his stepfather vintage Babe Ruth autographed baseball. The child actors are a likable lot and director David M. Evans orchestrate the action with enough flair to make these suburban shenanigans memorable. The first half of ""The Sandlot"" acquaints us with the adolescent adventurers as they accept the outsider and mold themselves into a single unit. Once our hero swats his first four-bagger, he becomes friends with his compatriots. The moment that he achieves this zenith of sorts, he creates the chaos that truly solidifies their group. All along Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry of ""Ride with the Devil"") has said that he knows who 'the Great Bambino' is, but he doesn't. One day after his best friend, Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez (Mike Vitar of ""Sunset Grill""), hits a home run, the guys are left without a baseball. Nobody has enough cents to buy one. Nevertheless, Scott wants to cement his friendship with the group and contribute something. He takes the prized baseball with Babe Ruth's John Hancock on the cowhide and offers it to the guys. Of course, they don't know that the ball Scotty has supplied is a trophy ball. Scotty attain his moment in the sun with his home run. Now, the kids have to figure out how to retrieve the baseball. Hatched a nerd, Scotty concocts several nerdy contraptions to enable them to recover the ball from the backyard where a monstrous watch dog with a reputation lives. Through the action, Evans appropriates every opportunity to build up the dog until it becomes the equivalent of a dragon. Eventually, Benny ventures over the fence in his brand new P.F. Flyer sneakers, retrieves the ball, but the Beast (an English Mastiff) pursues him relentlessly through backyards, a movie theater, a Founder Day Fair, and the swimming pool. The dog turns out to be more than a beast that ate a child. James Earl Jones plays the owner of Hercules. Like I said, ""The Sandlot"" is a whole lot of fun.",The Sandlot
9,view_and_review,The Neverending Game,8,17 April 2020,"""The Sandlot"" is now 27 years old so I can't add much by way of my review that hasn't been expressed already, so let me be breviloquent.This was a baseball movie that wasn't. In other words, it didn't follow the normal pattern of baseball movies, or any sports movie for that matter. It didn't come down to the last inning, the last out, the last pitch, or the last at-bat. It came down to a kid and a dog. How classic.",The Sandlot
10,evanston_dad,Cute and Nostalgic,7,21 January 2021,"A cute and nostalgic movie about kids and baseball.I can see why this film has developed a cult following. It's got kind of a ""Stand by Me"" vibe, and if you're not into baseball, there's still much to be enjoyed through the childhood memories the movie is sure to evoke in many. It's not as funny as I thought it would be. That's not a criticism of the movie, because it doesn't try to be super funny. It's just not the kind of comedy I was led to believe it would be, so my expectations were a bit disappointed. But it's still worth watching.I imagine a certain age group (those who were kids around the same time as the movie is set) will enjoy this more than others. I'm too young to relate specifically to this time period.Grade: B+",The Sandlot
11,Mr-Fusion,Captures the feeling of Summer,7,24 April 2017,"It's always disappointing - even just a little - when a favored childhood movie doesn't have the same sheen when viewed through adult eyes. Thankfully, ""The Sandlot"" is not one of those, and I think it's because of the this is a great group of kids; they have a nice camaraderie and their natural ball-busting is right for that age. That is, until James Earl Jones walks in and steals the movie, but that's a whole other virtue. But all of the comedic elements still retain their value, and it helps that it's in the nostalgic spirit of something like ""A Christmas Story"" (really feels like it should've been narrated by Jean Shepherd). My wife even thought of it as a fluffy ""Stand By Me"".It's easy to write this off as a kids movie, but it's too versatile for that.",The Sandlot
12,OllieSuave-007,Nice growing-up movie.,7,5 May 2014,"I saw this movie in a middle school class and it is fun entertainment for a bunch of kids in their early teens. Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a new neighborhood and wants to learn to play baseball. He befriends a local baseball group and is taken under the wing of Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). The group goes through many adventures together, including dealing with their secluded neighbor's menacing, huge dog.Many kids grow up playing sports like baseball, and go through fun times, thick and thin, with each other. So, this is a nice movie for that younger age group to watch as it delves on the elements of friendship, sportsmanship, and local adventures. The baseball plot may be a little basic in the movie, but throw in a subplot about a mysterious neighbor and his scary dog, it adds some intrigue into the movie.Just about the entire movie has an adolescent atmosphere, so adults may grow out of this movie over time (I wouldn't watch it again even on a slow day). Therefore, this one is best left for the younger viewers.Grade B-",The Sandlot
13,thesar-2,SmallsYou Are Killing Me,9,12 April 2014,"Recently, I started carpooling with an old friend of mine and we conversed a lot to/from work. Occasionally, he would say: ""You're killing me, Smalls."" I let it pass even though I didn't know what he meant by it.I guess after the 3rd or 4th time he said it, I inadvertently repeated that phrase to another coworker in a similar situation as my carpool buddy put me in. They laughed and exclaimed that they loved that movie. I asked ""What movie?""""What do you mean, 'What movie?'"" they shot back.I explained I didn't know where that movie line came from, but I somehow knew how it fit into conversation. They laughed and could NOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM believe I had never seen The Sandlot.Over the course of a few months, I would get the similar response of disdain that I had not seen this movie. In my defense, most of my coworkers are much younger than I and I explained to them that by the time this movie debuted, I was already too old for a young-kids-coming-of-age film. (Later it wouldn't be so bad, but at the age I was in 1993, I wanted to be older and not associate with younger kid movies.)Incidentally, this movie fell off my radar completely during the 1990s and 2000s, until that ""You're killing me, Smalls"" phrase erupted recently. So, I made it my mission to finally see it. (Believe me; I had a minimum of 22 people criticize me for not seeing it.)One recent Sunday night, I finally made time for itand DAMN. I am SOOO sorry I didn't see it sooner and further, I regretted I wasn't born later, like a decade later. This would've been MY movie. No doubt, I would've seen it a minimum of six times in the theatre – where I got the money for that many viewings from my poor family, would be the same challenge these boys had with the baseball replacements. But, I would've seen it many, many times. Not that I would've needed to: the famous quotes from it, much like the SMALLS line, would've been permanently engraved into my subconscious from the very first viewing and for the rest of my days.I would've surely identified with Scotty Smalls. Innocent, new, inexperienced and friendless. He moves into a new neighborhood in the early 1960s and takes a bit of time to become part of the gang. Once he does, he's there for life.I am the same way with each stage of my life. Especially with all the moving around my family made us do from the time I was seven until I was almost Junior High School. And then further, outside of school, when I moved from job to job, even when it was years at each employment.I digress. If not for so many movies, TV shows and other life-events in the way, I would probably watch this movie a multiple of times. I absolutely loved this movie, up and down, inside and out. I laughed out loud, cherished the ""PG-Rating/family rating"" which I don't watch too often, identified with the group of kids and reminisced of times, journeys and adventures I had outside and in the neighborhood as a kid.Sadly, I missed both the show: The Wonder Years and the movie: The Sandlot as a child. But, that doesn't mean I have to from here on out.* * * Final thoughts: I don't normally do this, but I want to personally thank my new coworkers and older friends for making me see this classic. I know a lot of other kids my age idolized movies such as The Breakfast Club, The Lost Boys and Stand By MeI never got into those. I wish I had been born later I would've surely idolized this one. So, thanks to you: Jessica Bojorquez, Andy Recinos, Nicole Meglen Davis and of course, Smalls, himself, Brandon Schildts. If I missed anyone, I apologize... Thank you too!",The Sandlot
14,ThomasDrufke,The Best Baseball Film Ever Made,9,6 July 2016,"No film better encapsulates the fear and wonder of the unknown, summer fun, and most of all; the everlasting bond of friendship and the love for the great game of baseball. The Sandlot is simply a classic.Being that I spent a good amount of my youth playing sports and particularly baseball outside, The Sandlot holds a special place in my heart. There's something about the relation between the characters in the film and the people who I grew up playing sports with that resonates with me. Luckily, the film holds up extremely well since I first saw it in the 90's. Taking place in the 1960's, the film definitely takes advantage of the history of baseball. Not only is Babe Ruth the MacGuffin of the film, but he ends up making a small cameo (played by Art LaFleur). But it's also fun to hear all of the references to various events to the history of the MLB and other pop culture phenomena. As a baseball lifer, the film still gets quoted in our dugout to this day.Besides having some great cameos by LaFleur and the legendary James Earl Jones, what I love most about the film is the comradery between all of the main cast. They all have their nicknames and unique quirks, which gives the group a broad appeal. But I think we all relate to Smalls, who just wants to make some friends and ends up finding a love for baseball that lasts a lifetime. It's not like a film like The Sandlot deserves a ton of critique. It's a perfect film for what it sets out to be, and that's a fun baseball flick about the power of friendship and how a common interest of baseball can change the summer and life of 9 boys from the same neighborhood forever.+Great cameos+Powerful story of friendship+Perfect baseball flick9.5/10",The Sandlot
15,ironhorse_iv,Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks! This movie was a home run sensation with me!,8,22 September 2019,"Written and directed by David M. Evans 'the Sandlot' also known as 'The Sandlot Kids', originally call 'the Boys of Summer' is a 1993 sports comedy that follows the summer misadventures of a group of tweens boys trying to play baseball during the summer of 1962, while also avoiding 'The Beast', a junkyard dog that lives next door to their fence. Without spoiling the movie too much; for the most part, this 20th Century Fox produced film indeed did step up to the plate and hit it out of the park! It was above all entertaining. It has truly gain a huge fan base due to its high nostalgia value. Most of them have given the film, favorable reviews. With some of them comparing the childhood baseball flick to the same heights as author Stephen King's 1986 coming to age masterpiece 'Stand By Me'. It's here where I have to take off my nostalgic googles and point out while, that both films has a lot of similarities, to the point that this movie can be seem as rip off or homage, depending on the person watching. It's still a far cry from director Rob Reiner's film. Yes, I know that both flicks set in the late 1950s/early 1960s, have an amazing soundtrack, follows a group of boys, have a chase scene with a junkyard dog & have adult narrators telling their stories. However, one of the biggest trouble with this comparing is the fact that this movie has hardly a coming to age story. It's not like this racially diverse groups started out as fledgling boys and through a series of trials and hardships, they becomes more mature young men learning to work together, depend segregation. The movie doesn't even deal with that. Nor does the film even bring up much about death or even sex. They is hardly much of adult themes for them to overcome and grow as individuals. Besides Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) strain relationship with his stepfather Bill (Denis Leary), most of the team hardly has much of a backstory or journey. Characters don't just don't really developed here. Most of the ragtag team stays the same in the end. Team Captain, Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) maintain the good leader type guy. Michael ""Squints"" Palledorous (Chauncey Leopardi) still really loves Wendy Peffercorn (Marley Shelton) & even the fat kid with the ill named Hamilton ""Ham' Porter (Patrick Renna) is stagnant stereotypical obese. Regardless, the acting from these young actors were top notch. They risk cold and heat to give us the performance of a lifetime. However, I hardly remember some of the other supporting characters like Kenny DeNunez (Brandon Quintin Adams), Alan 'Yeah-Yeah' McClennan (Marty York) and Bertram Weeks (Grant Gelt). They kinda got forgetten over the years. At least, those team members were not as dense & annoying like Timmy (Victor Di Mattia) & Tommy Timmons (Shane Obedzinski), whom are best remember for repeating each other. They were really shallow. Another problem with the film is the main plot comes really late into the movie. Most of the first act is mindless filler unrelated to the sport like the carnival ride and getting to first base swimming pool scene. Regardless those sequences are very enjoyable and funny. So good that they outshine the unrealistic over whimsical, but awesome slow motion 1984 'The Natural' style baseball cinematography & James Earl Jones 1989 'Field of Dreams' like speech moments. Because of that, I can hardly call this movie, a sport film. As for the visual effects like the puppet work, while they look so fake looking and low budget. It's so campy that it's fun to look at. The black and white flashback of the origins of the beast was hilarious. Still, some of the visuals jokes just didn't land for me. The whole array of well build Rube Goldberg items to attempt to get the ball back from the dog's backyard felt something out of silly cartoon rather than something that kids might honestly try. It was too jarring for my taste. What child would waste that much time, resources and money like that? At least, for a PG movie, I glad the filmmakers kept some strong language and colorful insults. It made the dialogue between the characters seem somewhat real even if some of the lines felt like product placement like the narrator stating out how PF Flyers are better than converse cause they guaranteed to make a kid run faster and jump higher. In the end, despite all the flaws, the original movie is way better than the two direct-to video 2005 & 2007 sequels 'the Sandlot 2' and 'The Sandlot: Heading Home'. Both of those films are total swing and a miss. Overall: While, not a perfect game, the 1st movie is truly worth seeing time and time again for repeat viewings. If you haven't watch it. Go see it! This comedy is a slugger.",The Sandlot
16,John6Daniels,"""You play ball like a girl!""",10,10 November 2019,Sandlot is a movie about nothing.Well it's about boys and baseball.One disturbing thing in the movie is how they allowed an ugly germ infested dog to lick a child like that.

17,sol-,Sandlot of Dreams,6,16 April 2017,"Passionate about baseball, a middle aged man fondly recalls the summer when he first learned how to play, the friends he made and the mischief they got up to in this popular comedy. While there are some funny moments to be had and the kids interact with one another credibly, the first half of 'The Sandlot' is difficult to get through at times with lots of excessively sentimental voice over narration and several silly shenanigans. The second half of the film is a blast though as a lost ball over a fence brings out the kids' creative sides. The inventions they come up with to retrieve the ball (without disturbing the dog in the yard) are delightfully wacky and inventive, especially a souped-up vacuum cleaner. The second half also features a chase sequence done with unexpected originality (if still the odd heavily telegraphed gag). Suffice it to say, footage from 'The Wolf Man' has rarely been appropriated so well. It has been said that 'The Sandlot' is the type of film that will only appeal to baseball lovers and those who like reminiscing about their youth. It is true that those from these demographics will likely get more from the film, but the project is still probably worth a look for others. The annoying voice-over does disappear for certain stretches and uneven as the first 45 minutes may well be, everything picks up once the kids get to show off their ingenuity.",The Sandlot

19,Anonymous_Maxine,"`Smalls, you're killin' me!'",9,18 June 2002,"Normally when I write reviews, I really try to make an effort to stay away from cheesy lines that come off as little more than weak efforts to be witty, such as starting my review off with a memorable quote from a film, but in this case, I just couldn't resist. The quote above (which, on watching the movie again, seems not to be even in it, but rather the line `You're killin' me, Smalls!,' but over the years since I had least seen the movie, the first one seems to have stuck with me more) is such a classic line of preteen comedy that I simply could not leave it out of my review. Granted, starting my review out with it is only slightly less cheesy than starting out a review of Star Wars with the line, `May the force be with you,' but I think that The Sandlot is a much more overlooked film than Star Wars (all of which are ANYTHING but overlooked). It almost always seems true that, in films like this (and most light-hearted comedies, now that I think about it), everyone seems to love the fat kid. Consider Stand By Me, in which Vern Tessio is the clumsy but lovable fat kid. Completely devoid of any kind of grace, but we love him anyway. In The Goonies, Chunk was arguably the most charming and lovable kid in the entire film, permanently imprinting our memories with such things as the Truffle Shuffle, his hilarious love of even the most obscure flavors of ice cream, and his clumsiness involving such things as ceramic statues and glass water cooler bottles (`Hope it's not a deposit bottle!'). In The Sandlot, we get yet another lovable character who fits in perfectly even with the very memorable ones mentioned above, as Patrick Renna gives a hilarious first film performance as the charmingly named Ham Porter, a red-headed fat kid with conflicting loves of food and baseball. The thing that really makes The Sandlot such a good film is that these kids childhoods are so effectively captured. There are some digressions of reality presented throughout the story, such as the sheer magnitude of Hercules as well as the kids very ability to create and use some of the huge and complex devices that they used to try to get the signed ball back, but that's because this is childhood. We are seeing the world through the eyes of a bunch of 12-year-olds, and these heroic things are just the kinds of things that they see as necessary to get their ball back from the fearsome beast. There are several other scenes, as well, that reflect the idea that much of this film is not made up of things that happen in every young boy's life, but things that every young boy WISHES would happen in his life. Consider, for example, the scene where these kids kick the hell out of an older and presumably more skilled group of players, who enter the film just long enough to be taunted and then badly beaten by them, as well as the scene where Squints manages to make out with the much older blonde lifeguard, and then is then lucky enough to get a bemused wave out of her afterwards rather than an endless series of dirty looks (and, MUCH later, he also manages to get NINE kids out of her). (spoilers) However far the film goes into childhood fantasy, it can be forgiven at the end because the deceptive simplicity of reality comes crashing in at the end of the film, as Mr. Myrtle (James Earl Jones) asks them why they didn't just knock on his front door and ask for the ball, he would have gladly gone to get it for them. This not only causes them all to slap their foreheads, but also reminds the audience of one of the film's themes, that the world is not as scary as it seems when you're a kid. It remains at least slightly questionable about why baseballs disappeared in such sheer numbers into the beast's yard and not a single kid went to the door to ask for his ball back, but consider the fact that, even as adults, we expected to find an owner who hates kids and would scream at them if they even came close to his front door. He lives in scary looking house, has this monstrous dog in the backyard, and no one seems to have ever seen him. Where the films seems to go a little wrong is in the actual character of Mr. Myrtle, who is so polite and generous and happy and charming that it seems impossible that he has not become more involved in the social atmosphere of his neighborhood and town, regardless of whether or not he can see. It's just a little too convenient that he happens to have been a personal friend of Babe Ruth (not to mention actually PLAYED with him), and that he would so easily give these kids (who have just destroyed his back fence) a baseball signed by the entirety of the 1927 Yankees. However, even though the film seems to go too far in this respect, it is such a satisfying ending to see that these kids have made new friends (in Mr. Myrtle as well as in Hercules), met a baseball legend, solved their conflict, AND learned a lesson about life, that we are willing and able to forgive any exaggerations in Mr. Myrtle's character. The character that would seem to be even more bothersome in an exaggerated respect is the impossibly charismatic and talented Benny, whose desperate efforts to include everyone and to be helpful and positive when the clumsy and talentless Scotty Smalls attempts to join their game suggest that his character was written by an adult (or adults) who are either trying to push across a message about not making fun of the new kid, or who were made fun of as children themselves (and believe me, I know what that's like).
Regardless, however, of any characters that may not fit in perfectly with what real life is like, these alterations in reality are to be expected in this film given the fact that the vast majority of it is seen through the eyes of young boys, and what we ultimately get is another exciting childhood adventure tale that delivers morals without us even really realizing it. It's so refreshing to see such an entertaining film deliver so many good messages without stopping to spell them out or to be too blunt about them. The Sandlot is a great story that fits in well with it's other classic counterparts, such as The Goonies and Stand By Me, mentioned above, and it carries the rare distinction of being one of the few films that will remain as fun and entertaining for generations to come as it was for it's first generation (mine) back in 1993.",The Sandlot
20,hellraiser7,Baseball Legends,10,15 April 2016,"Baseball has always been one of my favorite sports, there was always something so thrilling about hitting that baseball and running as fast as you can to certain points all to lead back to where you started. But also just simply the beautiful outdoor enviorment and company you played with.This film is one of my favorite films of all time and another childhood gem of mine. It's also my favorite sports film of all time if you can believe that. This really is a truly unique sports film because it's not one that is centered around a team on a journey to a championship, a single underdog player rising, or any other cliché format your familiar with.The film was simply a slice of life movie just about a group of kids playing a game and having a good time which to me is what the essence of sports is. Watching this film now as an adult makes the film even better to me because it's sort of like looking at a passage in a journal, helping me remember the good times I played baseball as a kid.I really like the Sandlot kids they all have good chemistry and I really like the fact that they all look like ordinary kids, there not some people from the damn CW but the kind of people you pass by and see everyday which really gave the film a relatable feel to it. They look like the kind of friends I've had as a kid as each of them are unique, their not the kind of people that are popular in school nor are each of them (except for Bennie) likely destined to be Baseball stars in the future. But it didn't matter nor did they care they just care about having fun and being together which is the basis of every sport.Even the location of where it takes place adds to it, the worn out Baseball field they play in ""The Sandlot"" adds to the feel, because I remember playing in fields like this in the park or school playground.My favorite character has always been Ham. His character is just great, he has a lot of attitude but just some of the best lines my favorite line ""Your killing me Smalls!"" Another that I like is Squints whom is pretty much a nerd, but he's a character I can sort of relate to a bit as he's highly imaginative when he tells that story about the Beast which I find hilarious as it is clearly just an urban legend blown out of proportion; I have an active imagination too and like to make stories. But also how he harbors a crush on that unattainable girl Wendy, yeah I've been there too.The film is just made up of lots of scenes in the first and second half of the film which is pretty much just summer days and times.From that pool scene which always cracks me up as we see Squints engineer a scheme to get Wendy's lips to his, what makes this even funnier is what we hear about the two in the end. The game against some jerk baseball team and just hearing Ham just psyche each of the members batting. Or even the infamous amusement park scene which I found hilarious because it's true as we all might have done a really dumb thing or two as a kid and learned our lesson the hard way.Then of course there is the third half which is getting the lost Babe Ruth ball from the Beast. It's just funny and interesting seeing how the Sandlot kids are just finding all these inventive ways to retrieve the ball, surprised they haven't though of participating in the science fair. But it comes down to one of my favorite chase scenes ever which is awesome as it's a foot chase and it just goes on to different locations, it's practically like a Marathon.The film I also feel is somewhat of a tribute to both Babe Ruth and the sport Baseball. The Babe is constantly mentioned in this film and of course there is the ball itself. And the film is also a period piece as it takes place in the 60's which makes perfect sense since that was a time when the game was still young and growing. The fact these are just ordinary kids playing the game without affiliations to major teams really shows the roots of where Baseball originated before it became a major business it was simply just an ordinary game for people to enjoy anytime they want and it still is.The Sandlot is a home run.Rating: 4 stars",The Sandlot

The young cast here is exceptional. I don't know that I've ever seen better; and that includes Stand by Me and Goonies.It probably helps if you've ever stood in the outfield on a bright warm Summer day with your cap pulled down just above your eyes, a well worn glove and a mouthful of Bazooka Joe, but really all you need is to have been a kid once.",The Sandlot

When Smalls becomes curious with a group of kids (Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Marty York, Brandon Quintin Adams, Grant Gelt, Shane Obedzinski and Victor DiMattia), who plays Baseball all day long in a old baseball field. Smalls is hoping to play with them but he knows nothing about the game. When he tries to play, he's quite bad at all. He can't even throw a ball to the catchers. When he becomes friend with the leader of the game and Smalls starting to like the game. But when his stepfather goes away for business, Smalls take a baseball from his stepfather trophy room. Which without realizing that the ball, he took from the room is actually signed by the Baseball Legend ""Babe Ruth"". Smalls hits his first home run, the ball went over the fence of a old house. But that old house, it has an mean-spirited junkyard dog. Which the kids called him ""The Beast"". Now the kids have to help Smalls to get the ball back before his stepfather comes back from the business trip.Directed by David M. Evans (First Kid) made an likable family comedy that plenty of funny moments, a good cast and a lot of imagination. The narration of the film will certainly make you remember of the late Bob Clark film ""A Christmas Story"", although the narration of ""The Sandlot"" is sightly heavy-handed at times. This film has a surprise hit, when it was release in the spring of 1993. Fox had another fantasy film about Baseball, which it was ""Rookie of the Year"". James Earl Jones, Art LaFleur and a young Marley Shelton have memorable bit parts in this pleasant comedy as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an featurette, trailer and TV spots. This film went on to be an modest classic over the year. All the kids have their moments, especially Renna and Leopardi have their comedic moments. The movie slows down a bit during the second act. But it's well made and this picture pleases everyone as well. It's one of the better family movies of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Co-Written by the director. Arliss Howard appears Unbilled.

24,TOMNEL,"Fun for kids, entertaining for adults, excellent for baseball enthusiasts.",7,31 May 2008,"""The Sandlot"" is a charming kids film that over the last 15 years has gained somewhat of a cult following, making this a nostalgic joy for 25 year old's who remember seeing this at age 10 and laughing their heads off. To me, this is not a perfect family film, but unlike many movies that claim to be family films, this actually is a ""FAMILY FILM"". Kids like it for the relate able situations and amusing dialogue between the kids, adults will find it's very easy to get wrapped up in this, even though it is just a silly kiddie movie and anyone in between will probably enjoy this too.Scotty has just moved to a new neighborhood, and isn't accepted by the other children. Eventually, he begins playing baseball with them at the local sandlot, and several adventures come from this. The main story is Scotty losing his step dad's (Dennis Leary) signed Babe Ruth baseball in the backyard with an evil dog the kids refer to as ""The Beast"".This movie has some genuinely amusing scenes, and some scenes so campy, they're hilarious. One scene involves a young boys plan to make out with the attractive older girl lifeguard at the public pool, and this scene is kind of a classic, which may be seen in movies after or even before this, but it was just done so great here. Any scene involving ""The Beast"" is hilarious. Depending on the scene, this dog changes shape and size, and can be anything from a large dog to some kind of mutated super monster. This dog puts the shark in Jaws to shame. It's good the kids each have their own distinct personalities, and aren't entirely run on stereotypes. One small problem is the lack of any emotional conflict, which may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view. I would have liked something to tug at the audiences' heart strings, but nothing does. It's still a good movie however.Overall, this is a fun movie for all...not great, but good enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG for language, tobacco use.",The Sandlot
25,Agent10,Great baseball movie or great kid's movie: you decide,7,24 June 2002,"This film proved to be one of the few kid-based stories which I still watch today. Films about growing up always make me misty, simply because of the moments of innocence which most seek to display. One of the funniest moments in film history is the guys using chew for the first time, then proceeding to through up on themselves and everyone else. Sure, it was a bit crass, but that's what happens when one tries chew for the first time. I especially loved the attitudes of the players, all defining themselves in some shape or fashion, modeling themselves after the common baseball player. Great fun, and the cameo performance with James Earl Jones was awesome.",The Sandlot
26,vertigo_14,Who's the Great Bambino?,8,17 March 2004,"The Sandlot is one of the greatest kids movies ever. It is a refreshing break from the family movies of today that mostly concentrate on stories in that upperclass Reiner-esque suburbanite setting of husband and wife and two and a half obnoxious kids. Instead, The Sandlot falls into a line of memorable adventures like 'House Arrest' and 'The Wizard.'Flashback to the 1960s. Scotty Smalls, newcomer to the neighborhood, narrates (in a Wonder Years way) the hilarious adventure of how he got he and his baseball playing buddies into the biggest pickle ever. Smalls is the shy brainy kid who makes friends with a bunch of baseball fanatics. While learning the sport of baseball, he learns of an exaggerated legend of something called 'The Beast,' otherwise known as Old Mr. Myrtle's junkyard dog, which is chained up in the fence just behind the ballpark. The kids like to play baseball. And the Beast likes to eat them. Not to give too much away, but, ""the pickle"" that Scotty gets his friends into, involves a pretty valuable baseball, one slobbering beast, and kids who try to do anything they can to save their buddy from being grounded for an eternity. The mess they get into and the junk they try to get themselves out is simply hilarious. That, and the subplots of a clever move on a lifeguard and the determination to show up some very obnoxious rival baseball players.
It's a funny, fantastic film that most kids will likely enjoy--the boys for baseball and the girls for those noteable teen stars like Mike Vitar, Tom Guiry, Chauncey Leopardi, and Will Horneff. It's loaded with laughs and good time adolescents, despite Tom Guiry hamming it up only slightly. Plus, it's got a good theme about friendship and drive and determination to do what you want to do. I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then the part where Squints tells the story about the history of the beast.
I can see from the message boards as well as other viewer's comments that it still has a rather memorable following, despite it's age. Definitely a must see!",The Sandlot
27,gazzo-2,Enjoyed this.,7,18 April 2010,"Never'd watched it 'til today. It's kinda 'Stand By Me' but baseball-centered and w/out all that melancholy 'end of era' stuff that permeates that one from '86.Here you have: disparate, recognizably normal type kids playing baseball in the early sixties in southern California, doing normal kid things. You know- bonding, fighting, being scared of the Monster Dog next door, ogling the lifeguard, insulting each other, making things up about themselves that they've never done, trying tobacco, getting sick.The Monster dog turns out to be a rather large, aggressive mastiff, the owner is a blind James Earl Jones, the McGuffin of the Ruth signed baseball the device that brings all of this together.I liked the kids-Smalls, Benny, the Twins, Nunez, Squints, Hamilton esp. I thought their reactions to each other and the world around them to be refreshingly normal. We all did these sorts of things at that age and saw other kids doing them later on. The movie is nostalgic w/out drowning you inside it-the soundtrack does toss in 'Finger Popping Time', a couple of Drifters tunes and Wipeout, but it's all kinda well timed and doesn't feel forced.You get to see Karen Allen and Denis Leary as the parents twice in the movie ala Charlie Brown's adults--which makes sense, really, this is the kids' world, not that of the folks'. I thought both were okay if somewhat under-used.It all wraps up rather entertainingly though you do need to put your mind on hold a bit during the varied Rube Goldberg attempts at getting the ball back(thing pulleys, erector sets, long sticks, vaccuum cleaners, etc) and that marathon chase thru the cinema, fair and what not.Check it out, you will like it and so will your kids. *** outta ****",The Sandlot
28,bkrauser-81-311064,Steeped in Nostalgia,7,28 August 2017,"By the time I got around to watching The Sandlot, I was already in high school. I don't know why that is exactly – It's considered an early nineties touchstone in much the way Pogs, Game Boys and The Mighty Ducks (1992) were back in the day. By the time it was widely available on VHS, the movie was laser-focused on kids my age. To whit snippet of dialogue like ""you're killing me Smalls,"" had actually managed to sneak into my vocabulary without me even realizing it. So by the time I sat down to watch this ode to summer and eye-fluttering nostalgia, I was already at a point in my life where I was knee-jerkingly against everything that everyone else liked.That is the legacy of The Sandlot that in my mind before setting out for a redemption re-watch. A clichéd, cloying, and unrelentingly sweet kid's movie that had neither the sense of wonder that E.T. (1982) had nor the propensity to revel in its silliness the way something like The Little Giants (1994) did. To top it off it was about baseball, a sport I had failed miserably in, two years in a row. I even had the distinction of being the only kid on my team to never hit the ball when up to bat. Hearing the collective sighs of parents in the stands and seeing the encroaching outfielders strolling closer as I came to the plate was excruciating.Now that I am older, The Sandlot is more of a silly, good-natured summer movie than a vessel for childhood frustration. It's cute and quotable, liable to give anyone who watches it the same warm feeling when watching A Christmas Story (1983). It's a kid's film from the perspective of kids. Not exactly a rarity but by taking place in 1962, a lack of grounding could've turned out as un-engaging as Newsies (1992).This doesn't stop the film from loading up the plot with a gaggle of stock characters. There's the leader (Vitar), the fat kid (Renna), the ham (Leopardi), the nerd (Gelt) et al. with Tom Guiry rounding out the cast as our fish-out-of-water and de facto narrator. The fact that Sandlot didn't see fit to add ""the girl"" is unfortunate but then Renna's ""you throw like a girl,"" line wouldn't have been as funny and Leopardi's graft at the pool would have actually had consequence.What strikes me the most about The Sandlot the third time around (I think) is it's not really about baseball. In fact, other than a late junkyard dog inspired action boost, the movie basically sits there like a summer heat wave. It's not really about anything other than chasing that feeling of no school, no work. None of the characters really change all that much, and inclusion of James Earl Jones feels like a lesson falling on deaf ears at best. At worst, it's a non-sequitur. If we're honest the only thing holding this thing together are a couple of loosely chronological hijinks.But the hijinks are arguably the best part of the movie and coincidentally what everyone remembers so fondly. The whirlybird scene, the rival team standoff, the extended chase through the neighborhood, it's all so effective in a broad, shameless kind of way. It's during these moments our patience is rewarded with light-hearted, un-cynical entertainment in what otherwise feels like a Skippy's Peanut Butter commercial.Nevertheless, The Sandlot appeal remains hidden under oh so many layers of quaintness. Even a casual observer will notice the camera-work is sloppy, the acting amateurish and the story lacks urgency. If you grew up with it, watching it a second time isn't likely to change your mind on its merits. Since I technically didn't grow up with it, I can't really see anything other than nostalgia propping it up.",The Sandlot

30,blumdeluxe,A family film,7,21 July 2018,"""The Sandlot"" tells the story of a young boy, whose family moves to a new town, leaving him under pressure to make new friends. While he learns to play Baseball with a few of the neighborhood boys, he learns about a frightening yard, where a huge dog is watching the balls that missed their goal.What you get here is pretty much your typical family movie but it is produced with a lot of heart and warmth. Some of the events might seem exaggarated and a bit stereotypical but in the end childhood is also about exaggeration and I really enjoyed the way that the narrator tells the story. I think most of the kids will be able to find themselves in one of the boys one way or another and the movie even delivers a decent moral, even when it misses out on more radical plot twists or decisions.All in all I would recommend giving this film a try, especially when you have kids around and want to spend an evening together as a family.

Vitar has presence as the local star, hard to believe he hasn't done a lot since then. Complaints include: the narration was often annoying, I didn't have to hear every 5 minutes about the ""pickle"" Scotty was going to get into (particularly when you could work out all the intimate details of the ""pickle"" not long into the movie); and the language is much too harsh for small children, who are otherwise the best audience for this.

Told in flashback for the whole film, you get to see how a new kid's future is changed by a summer baseball team who befriends him, playing on a field called ""the sandlot"". The children are for the most part believable in their roles, which is hard to do since children are more difficult to direct than actors.

It is a comedy as much as it is a film about baseball, with conflict taking part in the mystery surrounding the house with the angry beast. The film is mainly told through the story of one of the new boys whose parents are divorced and who is having an awkward relationship with the stepfather.Baseball, girls, comedy, and mystery all endure in this tale.

44,Ddey65,For baseball fans and dog-lovers of all ages.,6,4 September 2011,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS!*** Somebody on this board wondered if there has been anything else said about it that hasn't been said before. To their surprise, I can. I've actually thought of this as a dog-loving movie, as well as a baseball movie or a movie that's nostalgic for baby-boomer childhoods. The only dog-loving move that tops this one is the remake of ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" from the same year, but then again, the presence of Sassy also makes this a cat-loving movie.Tom Guiry plays ""Scotty"" Smalls, a somewhat nerdy kid who just moved into a suburb of Los Angeles with his mother and stepfather(Karen Allen and Denis Leary, respectively). His mother isn't so pleased with the idea of Scotty spending so much of his summertime indoors, so she sends him out into the neighborhood hoping he'll make friends. Along the way, he sees these kids playing baseball in some cheap old sandlot. They need another kid, so the leader of this gang, Benjamin Franklin ""The Jet"" Rodriguez invites him over. Most of the kids reject him, but not Benny.The movie show the kid's antics throughout their neighborhood, and surprisingly very few of them are baseball related. Though they do defeat a junior-high team, it's not treated as the big deal most baseball-related movies tend to be. Other antics include Squints' lust for teenage lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, a huge mishap with chewing tobacco and carnival rides, and most importantly a local junkyard dog on the other side of the fence hyped up as a monster. This dog has a habit of stealing any ball that comes near his yard. After running out of balls, Smalls borrows his step-father's autographed Babe Ruth baseball, and you guessed it; The Beast grabs that one too. From then on, it's an endless montage of failed attempts to get the ball back, until Benny has a dream where he's visited by the ghost of Babe Ruth(Art LaFleur), who encourages him to go take the ball back himself. And once he does, you can be sure that chaos is inevitable throughout the neighborhood.When ""The Beast"" is finally defeated. it's a bittersweet victory, like the sinking of the Bismarck, or the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Unlike those three events, there are no casualties, unless you count the death of a local urban legend, which is further solidified when the kids finally confront the dog's owner(James Earl Jones), and explain what they've been doing.Having said all that, it's not without flaws. The flashback scenes where Squints hypes up the legend of The Beast were supposed to take place 20 years earlier, but feature cars made as late as 1966. There's also the issue of how an African-American like Mr. Mertle would've been allowed to play baseball with the greats of 30 years earlier at a time when Major League Baseball was all-white. Nitpicks like this though shouldn't keep anybody from enjoying what can now be called a classic.",The Sandlot

Was it the time you played together with friends without the worry of schoolwork? This movie perfectly captures the spirit of American summertime with baseball being the theme of the movie. Unlike other sports movies which follows a cliche (losers slowly becoming champions), this one is in a class in and of itself. At least one of us can relate to Scotty Smalls story of how he gets to find friends after moving from another town. It's hard at first, but soon he connects with the coolest kids on the block and go on many adventures, many involve swimming in the pool, dealing with some rivals, fireworks, dealing with rivals, a day at the carnival, and the biggest challenge yet to come. The cherry on top? Plenty of messages about what's important in life. I watched this movie many times as a kid and now as an adult, even now, the power of this movie has never lost its touch. You can be an adult and reflect about your summer with friends as you watch this by yourself or with people you know and love. It's a movie to remember forever. One of my favorite movies!",The Sandlot
52,joshuafagan-64214,"I'm Sorry Guys, This Just Isn't Good",3,8 November 2015,"Oh... I'm almost afraid to do a review like this because so many people like this movie. But on my integrity as a film reviewer, here I go. Please try to remember that the opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone. If you don't agree with them... so be it.I... do not like this movie. I do not like it at all. I would not have liked it as a kid and I certainly do not like it now. I get why some people like it. If you were a kid when this film came out, or you are just a sucker for cheesy coming-of-age movies, or you just really want a movie like this and you have not watched Stand By Me, I can understand it. I, on the other hand, are none of these things, and I hate this film.It is not cute or sweet or relatable or well-acted or well-paced or smart or funny or clever. Instead, it is clichéd and crude and energyless and boring and lifeless and limp and pandering. Pretty much everything about this film is pretty much everything I hate about movie. At times, it feels like it was designed to anger me and me alone.Some people have called this film a kid's version of Stand By Me, which is wrong for two reasons. First, it is impossible to have 'a kid's version' of Stand By Me; that movie works because the audience is reliving their childhoods along with the narrator. Making it for kids makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. But I could forgive that except for reason two; all of Stand By Me's energy and realness is nowhere to be found.That movie worked because the characters had real hopes and dreams and highs and lows and flaws. They seemed like real kids; not the corporate movie versions of kids. That movie reminded me how much I hated the kids around me when I was in elementary school. This movie reminds me how much I hated the kids in the movies they made us watch in elementary school. It is as manufactured as films get.The cinematography is terrible. I, someone who has never shot a movie in my whole life, would probably not be that much worse at it than the group who made this film. It is minor grip, yes, but it represents how little effort went into making this movie artistic. There are a few shots of California. That is all. Stand By Me is a gorgeous movie, with its sweeping shots and careful framing. It envelops you and takes you on a journey. This film just stays put.The characters don't go on much of a journey either. Stand By Me was a coming of age film, and an effective one at that. This film tries to do that, but it forgot to actually do the coming of age. Not much changes from the beginning of the film to the end. Don't let the ending monologue and its sweeping music fool you; not much of importance happened during the duration of the film. Even a film like Kiki's Delivery Service, where next to nothing happened plotwise, made the viewer feel like the characters had grown, like the hour and a half that they put into the film were actually worthwhile. This film? I'm terrible at baseball and my time would still be better spent on an actual sandlot.There are so many holes in the plot. What if Smalls didn't drop the ball when he was dropping down from above? You'd be out of the last twenty minutes of the story. Normally, plot holes do not bother me at all, certainly not on a first viewing. But when the world fails to draw you in, everything falls apart; the veil of artistry is lifted.I could go on ranting and raving for way too long. So I'll just issue one last complaint- the characterization is nonexistent. How hard is it to make the characters in a film interesting on at least a banal level; seriously? Make them stereotypes or overgeneralizations; just do something. How trite everything feels could be somewhat excused if you were actually seeing the film through the characters' eyes. But the characters are so two-dimensional that you can't.Overall, everything in the film falls apart. It is as if someone took Stand By Me and hired some random joe to make something like it; and the random joe had no clue why SBM was great in the first place. I will never understand why this movie is so beloved. Nothing stands out; it is bad and boring. Except for the music, which is exceptional.Again, I do not care if you like this movie. Everyone has their own opinion. But I have the right to voice mine. So there it is.",The Sandlot
53,mwcrunner,The ultimate baseball movie,10,30 May 2016,"Great comedy about baseball here. This film takes place in 1962 and Scott Smalls becomes part of a neighborhood team and is able to fit in with them. They also get in the biggest pickle of their lives. Scott has the gang play with a ball from his step dad that was signed by the Great Bambino also known as Babe Ruth. The greatest baseball player that ever lived. As they play with it, it goes into an old mans backyard who owned a mean vicious dog that was a beast of a dog. Of course I think the dog in this movie was a bassit hound. You also know that dogs can't really grow up to be the size of a monster, also they can't grow up to be as big as Clifford. lol. As the gang tries many ways of getting the ball back the beast always gets the best of them. Then Rodriguez had a dream about meeting Babe Ruth and Babe Ruth gives him great advice and that he must get the ball out of that backyard. The next morning Rodriguez goes over the fence and grabs the ball and the beast starts chasing him. When he gets chased back to the sandlot and over the fence again the fence falls onto the beast and is hurt. The kids decide to help the hurt dog and then the dog turns out to be nice. Then the kids knock on Mr. Mertle's door who of course was blind and a retired player of the Negro League. He is played by the great James Earl Jones another fine roll in his career. Scott tells him about the ball and that he was in deep trouble. Then Mr. Mertle gives him another autograph baseball signed by Babe Ruth and all the other 1927 Yankees. When Scott tells his step dad about the ball and shows him the one Mr. Mertle gave him, his step dad only grounds him for a week instead of the rest of his life. Since then he and his step dad became very close. Also the beast also known as Hercules becomes the Sandlot kids mascot and they played ball until they grew up and went on to have different careers. Scott Smalls becomes a baseball announcer and his friend Rodriguez becomes a baseball player for the Yankees. Great film here and still a classic.",The Sandlot

You don't have to be nostalgic about the time period to enjoy it.  It is not only a great baseball film, but a great comedy as well.

Later, after Smalls is pulled down from the fence, the boys try to knock some sense into him, with Squints telling him, ""If you were thinking, you wouldn't've thought that."" Even moreover, Smalls had already gotten intimated by the wonderment of what's on the other side of the fence multiple times, so when Porter knocks one over, why would he suddenly not know what everybody's problem is? Also, why the opposite reactions to different boys knocking one over? Porter gets loaded with grief, then Smalls gets compliments all around. How is Porter an ""idiot"", anyway, for hitting it over?

57,joncheskin,Satire and Nostalgia in One,8,21 June 2016,"The Sandlot is a clever movie about a boy, Scottie, who moves to a new neighborhood and meets a bunch of new friends on a baseball sandlot. He is really bad at baseball, but Benny, the neighborhood baseball god, takes him under his wing and incorporates him into the group. The team has a bunch of misadventures at a swimming pool and city park, and then things get dicey when Scottie accidentally hits his stepfather's ball, signed by Babe Ruth, into a yard with ""the beast"" a really large dog. There is a bunch of hilarious slapstick as they try to get the ball back.The Sandlot is interesting because it seems to reside in a bunch of genres at once. On the one hand, it is a baseball movie for sure, although something of a satire of movies like Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. You almost get the sense that they have translated the minor league antics of Bull Durham into a kids' movie and the result is really funny. A scene involving chewing tobacco and a park ride is especially effective.On the other hand, The Sandlot is also plainly a kids movie, in the sense that it is a real attempt to see the world from a kid's point of view. In that sense, it owes its conception to movies like To Kill a Mockingbird, which try to see the world through a child's eye so as to illuminate it to grownups.Also, the movie is clearly a nostalgia movie, attempting to recreate in some measure the world of the early 1960s. It is a loving and effective tribute, taking us back to a suburban world of that era which contained a real capacity for joy.Finally, the movie is a physical comedy, and a good one. There are bunch of really funny slapstick scenes in this, mostly inspired by the fantasy aspect of the movie. The world is something of a Calvin and Hobbes sort of world of imagination, and in that world there are plenty of opportunities to laugh at what might be imagined.Thus, the Sandlot is a multi-faceted winner, a movie that appears shallow on the surface but actually works on a bunch of levels. Perhaps most importantly, it is hilarious and fun, and this is perhaps the best reason to see the movie.",The Sandlot

Simply because the movie relates to situations that everyone has at some time in their life; problems making friends, and accidentally getting yourself in a big trouble situation.This is beautiful proof that the quality of a movie doesn't depend on how many celebrities star in the movie, but how good the story really is. Because ""The Sandlot"" came out around the same time as the movie ""Rookie of the Year"". While ""Rookie of the Year"" got all of the media hype and had all of the big celebrities staring in it, but after you saw both of the movies, you realized that ""Rookie of the Year"" was nothing but the lame over-hyped move, and ""The Sandlot"" was the worthwhile movie.As far as I'm concerned, this movie will most likely remain in the #1 spot of kids movies for all eternity.",The Sandlot

I saw it when it premered on cable back in '93. I loved it because of the simplicity of the premise. It captures the era perfectly of 60s California baseball fever (aside the from the fact it was filmed in Utah lol). The character of Benny was a suprise since he has that 'cool jock' look, but doesn't act like that at all. He doesn't make fun of Scotty (our main character and narrator) because of his lack of athletic ability. Instead, he gives Scotty some simple advice: Have fun. With that (and a pop up from Benny), he is accepted as part of the team. I can mention many moments I like from the film that range from the guys defeating the school team to Squints lusting after his dreamgirl to the final fates of the two main characters (which makes me smile). The small parts of Denis Leary, Karen Allen, and especially, James Earl Jones are nice too. Just a fun film, period.",The Sandlot

Anyway, even though when I saw this film I didn't understand Baseball, I still loved it because I loved the characters in it and the way they acted as I behaved in similar ways to them at that age. When I watch it now, I remember being like that when I was younger and being out playing Football (Soccer) and challenging rival teams and calling each other names etc. Thats what it was like and most people were like at that age and it really is an enjoyable feel-good film and I'm not surprised it has many fans although maybe not as many over here.I still watch it every now and then and its still very enjoyable and I can still see it being well-known in the future.A classic 10/10",The Sandlot

66,chimera3,One of the Best Childhood Classics Ever,10,14 October 2017,"I think I was in grade school when I was introduced to this work of art. Since then, it has become a cult classic in more ways than one. I can find myself quoting this movie so much that sometimes I don't even remember doing it. For those of you who have not seen this movie (and I do mean ever), whether you weren't born when it was made or haven't even heard of it, I highly recommend that you do so. This is a movie that many of us kids who were born in the 80's grew up with and I would recommend it to anyone.It all begins with Scott Smalls, a newcomer in a town in the Southwest. Doesn't have any idea what he's doing, makes a complete idiot out of himself without any help. It is at that point that he comes across one Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez, avid baseball player. Scotty (as he is called by everyone else) is then invited to go to the sandlot to play some baseball with some other boys.Of course, his first game is nothing to write home about. The boys make fun of him and razz him to where he doesn't know if he wants to play anymore. By the second game, he's ready to go. As time wears on, the boys become friends and they start to have some fun. One day comes a rival neighborhood team that invades the sandlot and taunts the boys, exchanging insults at the drop of a hat.Back in the day, ""You play ball like a girl"" was a serious insult because nobody believed that girls could play baseball. Following that heated exchange, the boys then go to the rival team's field and make sport of them without even trying. To celebrate, the boys then go to a carnival...where they make the biggest mistake ever: take chewing tobacco and then go on a fast ride, where they quickly lose the contents of their stomachs.Then comes the biggest pickle to ever come their way: Benny (as he is called) destroys one of their baseballs with a powerful swing of the bat, forcing them to get another ball. Scotty, thinking he's done the right thing, swipes his stepdad's baseball signed by Babe Ruth and then plays with it. Unfortunately, he then hits the ball over the fence of Mr. Merle, to which it became property of the notorious ""Beast.""True to form, the guys then figure out ways to try and get the ball back, only to fail miserably each time. Having had enough of the madness, Benny engages the Beast in a run around the neighborhood and wins, rewarding them with more baseballs than they know what to do with. Mr. Merle (James Earl Jones) comes out and introduces himself, telling the boys that they could've easily knocked on the door and he would've gotten the ball for them, making Squints the object of ridicule.""The Great Bambino!"" ""You play ball like a girl."" And let's not forget the obvious one: ""You're killing me, Smalls!"" I dare anyone say (at least those who are very familiar with this movie) that they don't know these lines. They will stay with you until you remember no more. Watch this gem over and over.

It will keep you laughing and entertained, and it comes with a great assortment of hilarious characters. A group of nine kids accidentally bat a Babe Ruth baseball into a yard with a demonic Saint Bernard and they try several attempts to get it back. This isn't an award winning movie, but it has a good storyline and it's a nice family get together thing.

68,sublime501,Very enjoyable feel-good movie.,8,23 June 2004,"THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best ""family films"" ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.But one day, Scotty foolishly takes his stepfather's baseball autographed by Babe Ruth and knocks it into the adjacent backyard. This backyard, as Scotty is informed, is home to The Beast, a monstrous dog that, as legend has it, ate the only other boy who was daring enough to go after a baseball in that yard. The boys devise a plan to get the ball back, one way or another.I watched THE SANDLOT several times growing up, and remember always loving it. When I watched it again recently, I realized exactly why--it's a great movie. Just the right balance of childhood innocence and experience is captured, and this movie is bound to make any adult remember his childhood and all the different aspects of it. The summertime atmosphere and almost all of the scenes are terrifically nostalgic. Some of the scenes involving The Beast are hilarious, and everything has a nice familiar feel to it. It's a wonderful feel-good film.All of the actors put in at least average performances. Most of the child actors are just okay, with a few exceptions. Tom Guiry is good as the awkward and naive Scotty, as is Patrick Renna as the outspoken and witty Hamilton. I think the real standout of the actors, though, is Mike Vitar as Benny. He was excellent as the kindhearted, but still very cool hero of the neighborhood, the guy that everyone loved. He showed real promise, and it's a shame that he didn't continue with his acting career. The cameos from James Earl Jones and Denis Leary are also nice.I always loved watching THE SANDLOT growing up, and now I remember why. It's a great family film that is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again years from now and remember just why I loved it. 8/10.",The Sandlot

72,deadkerouac,One of the finest baseball films of all time,8,21 August 2000,"Sure, this isn't the conventional baseball film. In fact, baseball doesn't really have to be a part of it. This film is about growing up. It's about finding yourself alone in a new town and hoping to make friends. Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) is a young boy most of us can identify with. Even if we'll never picture ourselves as Smalls, we can at least say we've met a naive kid like him.Scotty moves to the Valley with his mother and stepdad (Karen Allen and Denis Leary, who are little seen in the film but who are the primary adults here) and plans to spend his summer alone in his room reading and toying with his erector set. When Mom pushes Scotty to go out and make friends, Scotty listens. Reluctantly. He stumbles upon the sandlot one day and finds eight young boys just like him. They never play a real game, just one long never ending practice. These will be his friends for the summer, and one will be there for the rest of his life.Of course, this film works better with baseball. It's America's pastime and one of our country's creations, something the US will forever be associated with. Even if you never grew up playing or even liking baseball, you'll love this movie. There are exceptional performances by our young players, from the portly Hamilton Porter (Patrick Renna) to the handsome Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). These boys aren't ballplayers, they're kids just like we are or once were. We grew up with Squints (Chauncey Leopardi) and Smalls. Like its predecessor ""The Bad News Bears,"" there isn't enough time to flesh out each youngster, but the focus here is on the two main characters, Scotty the narrator and Benny his older and wiser friend.Benny's a big brother to Scotty. He teaches Scotty how to throw and field, gives him a new mitt and cap, and even casually tells his new friend to toss Scotty's trademark puke-colored fish cap into the fireplace. This friendship is the one we all know will last throughout the film.Sure, this isn't ""Field of Dreams"" or ""The Natural"" or even ""Major League,"" but it's an adequate portrayal of growing up in the sixties, having to tell little white lies to fit in, and sticking up for one another whenever possible. In all, there is only one game against an opposing team, a ""real"" ballclub complete with uniforms, stirrups, quality equipment (batting helmets, for one), and a field and scoreboard. This scene is great in that it shows that it doesn't take a lot of $$$ to make a quality ballteam.James Earl Jones makes a memorable cameo in an otherwise ""kid flick."" The narration is fine (reminiscent of TV's ""The Wonder Years""), the performances by the young actors promising, and the story/plotline, from beginning to end, is adequate to keep your interest. Most of my friends who have seen this film have said that the most memorable scene is the poolside scene, with lovely actress Marley Shelton portraying Wendy Peppercorn, the object of Squints' affections and resident lifeguard. Though this scene is memorable (in all its possible ways), the true baseball game occurs on the only night game, the Fourth of July game, where the fireworks in the sky light up the sky so much that it's possible to play a game in the sandlot.",The Sandlot

Don't be.What's great about this movie is that it takes 'little' events that any one of us have experienced and turns them into the full-fledged awesome adventures they seemed to be when we were that age.  A visit to the local public pool, a challenge from the local snobby kids, and the retrieval of a baseball are typical unexciting sounding events any of us have experienced. However, when you add to the story,""I remember this one time when me and my friends..."" a flood of emotion and memories are sure to follow.Child actors take note: Whether its good direction, good writing or good acting, this wouldn't have worked if the kids weren't believable.  The greatest honour they could ever give this great movie is never attempting a sequel.""You're killing me, Smalls!""da_flipboy",The Sandlot
74,jkylebennett,A Truly Iconic Movie if Ever there was One.,10,24 June 2019,A genuine telling of what it meant to be a kid before technology completely took over our ways of life. This is one of the best movies to watch at summer time and to show what it means to truly be a kid and how to just enjoy life while you've got it to enjoy. It's the iconic summer all wrapped up in an hour and a half.,The Sandlot
75,avsroxbronxfan,Really glad I saw it,10,18 March 2013,"I wasn't sure if I ever saw this film before recently, and luckily, my friend invited me over to see it, and I was not disappointed. This film has a lot of things I like to see: Comedy, smart characters, unpredictable things happening, and a great story. I'll get to these aspects of it later though.The story is about some kids who love to hang out, and do many activities, but playing baseball together is their favorite thing to do. They eventually run out of baseballs to use when playing outside once, until one of the kids, played by Tom Guiry, borrows his dad's autographed ball (Babe Ruth signed it) and he ends up hitting it over his neighbor's fence, where they think a huge beast lives, but turns out that it's a dog with quite an appetite. So the kids need to find a way to get the ball back before the dad notices it's gone.What I love most about this film is how unpredictable it is. For example, when the kids are trying to get the ball back, they use a catapult. They try to fling the ball back, and the clip suddenly slows down. I thought the ball wouldn't get over the fence and would be just short. I was wrong. The dog actually jumps really high in the air, and he looks like he swallowed the ball. That was very unexpected and hilarious. I like to see things like that. There's also this one part where one of the kids is able to jump over the fence and get the ball, outrun the dog, and jump over. You think he outsmarted the dog, right? Wrong. The dog then jumps over the fence and starts chasing him. How one can predict this, I have no idea.The energy in this movie is outstanding. Not just from the good acting by the kids, but from the comedy as well. There's this scene when one of the kids pretends to drown so he can make out with the very attractive lifeguard. I knew that was going to happen, but I still laughed hard at it because the energy and timing of that joke.I'll knock the film slightly for two things, and one is that there isn't a lot to the story. Basically, the first half of it is just the kids playing baseball and hanging out, and the second half is them trying to get the ball back. That's all there is to it, but for what we got, I still enjoy it, and this is more of a nitpick. My second problem is that if the kids didn't have enough money to buy baseballs, where did they get all that equipment, like the vacuum or catapult, from? I do see that part of it is child made, like one of them seeing through a box of Wheaties, but it's still impressive technology, and I have no idea where they got it from.For what we got, I really enjoyed The Sandlot, and I am really glad I saw it. I consider it one of my favorite comedies now, and that is quite an accomplishment, since I can be quite picky with films like that. I'd say to go see it, but since it got a sequel, and I guess a third one, I'd assume you already did see it.",The Sandlot
76,EricVierthaler92,Grew up watching it and never have gotten tired of it and never will! Movie gold!,10,8 July 2009,A classic! A masterpiece! Great movie in every single aspect. I have seen it so many times but I have never gotten tired of it. It's one of my favorite movies EVER! The dog in this movie used to scare the crap out of me when I was little! The dog in this movie kinda reminds me of Cujo The killer dog from the Stephen King novel and movie. just the idea about a killer dog has always sounded creepy to me. And great acting! Great script. Great directing. Great everything. The characters you can actually fall in love with. This movie when I was a kid made me want to play baseball. But I don't play baseball anymore. I love every second of this movie. It could never be out done. A remake should never ever be made. The sequels where horrible and should have never even of been made. I loved every single character in this movie. I loved it when they tried to get there ball back from the dog. The best baseball movie ever made. And one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of the hole entire race of human kind. No joke. No joke at all. I don't know why I haven't bought the DVD of this movie yet?! I think I might still have it on VHS. My mom loves this movie. Everybody does. If you don't like this movie then go jump off of a cliff! An instant 5 out of 5 stars! A movie I have grew up watching!,The Sandlot

78,thomascapital,Great Americana,10,22 June 2004,"The movie emobidies all that is and was great about 1950's and early 1960's America.We have the straight ""A"" student who is befriended by the most poplular boy in the neighborhood.Benny ""The Jet"" Rodriguez is the boy that everyone wants to be friends with and who sticks up for the little guy.The movie could not be better written, directed or cast.  An absolutely perfect movie that shows the best of America through the innocent eyes of our forgotten youth.The narration is done by the now grown-up nerdy kid that is adopted by the cool baseball playing neighborhood kids.  He learns about the most important part of being a 12 year old kid, baseball and the pure joy that playing with your best friends brings.Through trial and error, they grow and mature, eventually moving on in their lives.  Yet, Smalls and The Jet remain close, as Smalls, still the intellect, is a sports announcer and The Jet is the great Major League player.If you don't love this film, you have no heart and love for America and baseball.",The Sandlot
79,pjames10,"If you think The Sandlot is good, go watch the far superior Stand By Me.",5,28 March 2018,"I rarely feel the urge to comment on movies but after scanning the other reviews, I have to say Im kind of embarrassed for them. This movie is cute but poorly written/directed. It had all the elements for being a wonderful and nostalgic look back at childhood but became a hallmark card schmaltz fest of corny behaviors and dialogue that barely sounded like 12 year old friends. Very few films capture this dynamic but Stand By Me was much closer to the truth of childhood (I also want to include 400 Blows, but I haven't seen that in a while).On your next rainy day, do a triple feature run and get back to me.",The Sandlot
80,bensentl,Oh to be a kid again!,10,17 August 2006,"I loved this movie. I saw it with my son when he was about two at the theater. We went back to see it again two days later. In addition, we watch this movie at least once a year. Anyone who grew up playing baseball knows a kid who matches each character in this film. It is an excellent story, clean for kids, and enjoyable for adults. The main character is named Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new neighborhood, and is not very athletic. He quickly meets the guys and receives a less than warm welcome. However, Benny the Jet Rodriguez takes Smalls under his wing, teaches him about baseball and helps Scotty overcome some of his issues. Benny tackles some of his own fears, and the sandlot gang has several crazy adventures. I recommend you go rent it today, even if you have seen it before.",The Sandlot
81,suspiria77,Childhood summers in 90 mins.,9,10 April 2018,"So many writers and filmmakers have attempted to get the feel of a childhood summer right to varying degrees of success, but not have felt quite as authentic as this one. The pace of the film feels like those languid long days where you go from playing baseball to the swimming pool to making s'mores in a tree house, where time seems to stand still and school is so far off it's barely in your mind.This movie nails it and does so sweetly and with great nostalgia. The kids are all spot on in their acting, something that must have been difficult to wrangle, and it still manages to make me laugh all these years later. I loved sharing it with my kids and they love it as much as I do.",The Sandlot
82,samhendersonthemovieman,One of the funniest movies ever made!,9,20 May 2020,"What I can say about The Sandlot is that it's full of fun and really funny. The first time I watched it is when I was 19 years old. So, I didn't watch this when I was little because I thought it would be kind of boring. When I first watched it, I was really surprised and laughing a lot almost throughout the movie, especially the scenes with the boys throwing up while chewing tobacco and riding a carnival ride, when Ham says ""You're killing me, Smalls!"", which was my favorite line throughout the movie, when Squints syncs ""forever"", and when Squints kisses his crush. Very good humor throughout the movie. All in all, The Sandlot might be one of the best sports of all time and one of the funniest family comedies.",The Sandlot
83,alex1432,i love it,10,7 February 2021,"I love this movie so much. it's just so fun and lighthearted and funny. i've been watching it since i was a little kid and it's still one of my favorites. i feel like it's for all ages, although kids may enjoy it more. i don't even like baseball and i love this movie.",The Sandlot
84,Zaptharo,A great film that you'll enjoy again and again...,8,17 February 2009,"If you ask me, the Sandlot is one of the better sport films that concentrates not only on friendship, but also on teamwork, determination, and believing in yourself. I have seen this movie on many occasions, and it never fails to amaze me. The kids shown in this movie are just what they should be; not sugar-coated, obnoxious, whiny or arrogant. The movie is family-friendly, and not in a bad way either.The setting takes place in the early 1960s. A kid named Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood and soon gets involved with a group of baseball buddies in some hilarious, memorable moments. Throughout the movie, he narrates how he got into the biggest pickle, and how it was one of the biggest summers of his early life. Benny Rodriguez, the neighborhood hero, accepts him into the Sandlot, and he soon learns of the sport of baseball. Then, he hears the tale of 'The Beast', who the kids fear that he might eat them and take their beloved sport away. At first, Smalls doesn't believe the story, but soon realizes that he fears 'The Beast' just as much as they do. In a string of hilarious scenes, the boys will do anything to save their pals and the Sandlot.A turning point in the movie is when Smalls takes his stepfather's autographed Babe Ruth baseball to continue on with the game. After he whacks the ball into the yard of 'The Beast', he soon fears that the ball may be history. The boys devise a plan to bring the ball back, even if it means being inside the territory of 'The Beast'.Because I don't want to spoil too much, the movie in itself is one that you'll come back for again and again. It captures that childhood innocence almost perfectly, and it contains that feeling that is rarely felt in other childhood films. Anyone who grew up in Southern California during the 1950s and 1960s should feel right at home when they watch this film. Even though the film wasn't actually filmed there, it still depicts the era in which it was cast.The Sandlot also reminds us of the days when kids would play outside during the long summer days, before the world became indulged in video games, text messaging, and surfing the Web. The actors in here all give a solid performance, at the very least above average. They aren't really well known, but just as with everything else, not all famous actors are good and not all child actors are bad. To make a long story short, the Sandlot is a well made film that will entertain kids and adults alike.Despite seeing the movie several times, I still enjoy it for what it is. Although it's not perfect (what movie is?), I highly recommend this movie for those nostalgic of simpler times and those obsessed with baseball.8 out of 10.",The Sandlot

But memories of little league notwithstanding, this simply is not a good film. It's obvious, and cliche, and stretches belief beyond the breaking point. If you want to see a reminiscence-type film well done, rent Bronx Tale sometime. Even the television-based Wonder Years was better, on probably 1/10 the budget.

He wouldn't tell me what it was about so I to watch it and figure it out.When I first saw it I liked it and now watching it over the years I love it! It is such a simple plot but it has powerful meaning. It is very realistic and it doesn't try to hard to be funny, it just is naturally funny.Scottie Smalls is the new kid in town who is very smart but a bit awkward. A kid named Benny asks him to start playing baseball with him and his friends. The other kids don't like him at first since he is a little geeky, but he eventually is accepted by the group once he learns to play baseball. Benny tells him that it is not too hard. Scottie now has new friends and begins to have an action packed summer with them,like having camp outs, fearing the beast behind the fence, going to the pool, talking about Babe Ruth, and of course playing baseball. Scottie also gets them in ""one of the biggest pickles ever.""It's a great kids movie, very funny, and quotable. 9 out of 10",The Sandlot

I saw it during summer and after watching it I felt the energy for new adventures! The best thing is, years after that I saw the movie again during another summer and it reminded me so hard on the good times one can have as a youngster outside... I went for adventures again.As many other reviewers have noticed, this movie reminds us of what it was like to be a kid, and when dogs were dangerous monsters, and playing outside was just a huge adventure. Everybody of us felt like an Indiana Jones. It felt damn good.This is one of the movies I will carefully hold on and keep it, lets say to watch it all couple of 6 years just to remind me how cool life can be. The movie captures all our youth so well and packs it in one huge summer so watch and love this one.An absolute 10/10 for being THE kid movie of my life and guess what? I am an adult but I love watching this one. Your turn now.",The Sandlot

I was feeling blue.  He and I got hamburgers and went to see this movie.  We camped out in the Family Room afterwards and he thanked me so profusely and genuinely and affectionately for the wonderful evening.  The movie made me think.  The ONLY way to overcome a problem is to confront it straight on -- that's how they got the ball back in the movie.  It got me out of my blueness that night.  The movie was also hilarious.  Great music. Great message.  Great fun.  Great evening.  It's underrated in the TV Guide. I give it 9 out of 10.,The Sandlot

98,lostanddelirious85,"Fun for kids, but holds more significance for the adults.",10,18 December 2010,"This is just one of those movies that makes you feel good, no matter what age you are. If you're a kid, you'll love it for the fun characters and the humor. If you're an adult, it will bring back fond memories of childhood that will make you wistful to go back to those days again.I first saw this movie on HBO when I was a kid and found it to be a pretty entertaining/funny movie with some animated characters and an amusing sub-plot about a killer dog. It was fun for what it was. But I have to say, I think the adult audience has the bigger end of the stick here. Re-watching it as an adult brings a perspective to it that most kids are too young to grasp: experience and time. This film romanticizes childhood and does a pretty damn good job of it, too. You will be hard-pressed to not find yourself thinking about how you were at that age and remembering old friends that you probably haven't seen or heard from in many years. This film stirred up so many memories I had forgotten and even made me quite sad.This movie and ""Stand By Me"" are probably two of the greatest movies about adolescence you can watch. The feelings and emotions are timeless and representative of a time in our lives that is gone way too soon but never forgotten.If you're having a hard time or maybe even just a bad day, put this film on and go back to the days when everything was much simpler, the biggest problem in life was what to do on a Saturday afternoon, and your friends were the most important thing in the world. If only we could capture these memories in a bottle and relive them any time we wanted. But since we can't, this film will have to do.",The Sandlot

102,bobbadger-1,dreaming,10,8 April 2007,"I've read all the comments that preceded this one. Some folks liked the movie and some folks panned it. However, only one or two posts touched on what I thought was the most adult theme of the movie. After many comedic attempts to outwit The Beast, Scotty Small dreams about a giant baseball pile-driving him into the ground. However, Benny has a dream featuring the ""great Bambino."" When Babe Ruth visited Benny in his dream, he imparted the advice that Benny had to decide if he were going to face his fear or not. Benny could hardly wait. He was up early, urging Scotty to get dressed and get to the ""sandlot."" When the gang gathered, all the boys were trying to dissuade Benny from going into the Beast's yard to retrieve the autographed ball, but Benny looked at Scotty and said ""I have to,"" whereupon he attempted and succeeded.Don't' we all at some point in our lives have to make the decision to try or to give up? I thought the writers and directors made good use of conflict and resolution throughout the movie from Benny's rescue of Scotty Small's angst from being the nerdy ""new kid"" to the rescue of the Beast from beneath the fence.We all had friends in our youth who are represented in part by the movie's characters.

My wife and I both thought this was possibly one of the worst movies we have ever seen.  The boys acting was wooden and terrible. The story was ridiculous. Maybe if you were 6 or 7 years old it might be believable, but any adult should find this movie barely watchable.The main character can't throw a baseball to save his life, until his new friend tells him to throw it like when he delivered newspapers, then he throws like a pro. COME ON! The ragtag group easily defeats an organized little league team? HUH?  Babe Ruth appears in the friends dream, but looks like and talks like George Burns? Wasn't Joe Don Baker available?

105,JMoviebuff0001,Great Baseball Film,10,23 August 2005,"The Sandlot is a great baseball film, even though throughout the film the games take place at a Sandlot and not any major league stadiums *spoiler* until the end of the film with the adult Benny playing for the LA Dodgers.This is a great family film showing the love for America's past time game of Baseball. The film is about a new kid, Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new town where he knows nobody. He follows Benny to the Sandlot, looking to fit in, of course his hopes of fitting in are quickly shattered after an embarrassing attempt to throw the ball back to the infield.However despite the team's disliking of Scotty, Benny decides to convince Scotty to come back and be apart of the team since they are a player short of having a complete team. The result, Scotty becomes more liked by the team as Benny helps him learn how to play.The rest of the film is entertainment and fun from Squints infamous drowning act to the boys first experience with Chewing Tobacco to the final showdown with ""The Beast"".The side story of ""the beast"" is good, a very interesting way of showing why the boys cannot retrieve their baseballs after each is hit into Mr.Mertle's yard. Its something that most kids face, hitting their baseballs into someone else's yard, hearing bad stories about the person that lives in that house and fearing that person. But as Mr.Mertle says in the movie ""Why didn't you just knock on the door? I'da gotten it for ya."" Which shows that not all people won't be mean and release ""the beast"" on you, some could be a jolly fun spirited person like Mr.Mertle.Oh, and you gotta have that other team that thinks they are better than your team. A showdown of a real team and the Sandlot kids ensues at one point in the movie, just to prove that the Sandlot kids can kick butt even if they are not a real team.The movie was well done, very enjoyable for people of all ages. There should never have been a sequel however fans of this movie are let down.

Sure, it sounds like a harmless family comedy, but there was nothing funny about it at all, and I sure wouldn't want to put my family through the torture of watching this painfully unfunny movie.There was very little to like in this movie. First of all, ""The Sandlot"" isn't quite the brightest idea in the first place. It's just a bunch of kids playing baseball and getting into trouble. How could that be funny? How could that even be a movie worth watching? I know that when the idea first comes to mind it sounds brilliant, but simply toying with it one realizes that it has no entertainment value at all. Second of all, the actors who portrayed the kids had no experience (and in some cases no talent) with acting whatsoever. I understand that maybe there were not a lot of great child actors back in 1993, but the characters and the actors who played them were trying too hard to portray themselves as dim-witted and silly but strangely likable, and as a result they come off as just plain dumb and unlikeable. James Earl Jones was the only person who did a good job in this movie, but he loses credibility for being in such a disastrous film in the first place. The third thing that makes this such a bad movie was the poorness of the script. All of the jokes fell so flat on their faces that thinking about them now makes me wonder if they were intended to be funny in the first place.""The Sandlot"" could have been somewhat likable if the script wasn't poorly written and filled with dumb jokes about vomiting on fair rides and rival baseball teams throwing worthless insults at each other, but yet for some strange reason the director and writer went against logic and made the movie as unwatchable as possible.Some of the baseball scenes weren't dreadful, but they were not exactly enjoyable either. It was almost like watching a little league game at times. But, it was a pointless, kind of annoying little league game, with irritating players who weren't as good as they could be. This movie is like taking such excellent family movies as ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and combining them in a blender with such boring and unfunny films as ""The Scout"" and the movie adaptation of ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"", and in the end it all adds up to one huge headache of a family movie. I highly recommend avoiding ""The Sandlot"", for it is a terrible family film and a bad movie altogether. If you feel the need to view this anyway, just be warned that not even the slightly watchable baseball games and the brief appearance by James Earl Jones can save this horrid film from being one of the worst family movies ever made. 2 stars out of 10 is all I can give this appalling film, and yet somehow I feel I'm being extremely generous.",The Sandlot
110,hudsondeal,The Stepfather,8,5 July 2021,"This is a delightful movie, but it contains a large hole in its center, the role of the stepather played by Denis Leary. Practically nothing is made of the tension between the son and his stepfather. The scene where they first throw the ball stretches credulity to the breaking point: why would the stepfather keep throw overhand to his son who obviously knows neither how to throw or catch? The second scene, after the return of the baseball, a better one, is perfunctory. For a film with so much authentic childhood feeling, the stepfather, and even the mother, are made of cardboard. James Earl Jones functions as a wise and amiable deus ex machina.",The Sandlot

Its also the movie that has sequels that it really shouldn't have. The main factors that had made the Sandlot a great film were both the characters and the storyline. Even as a child this stood out to me. The character development from the beginning to the end of the movie is just outstanding and just one of the best I've ever witnessed. You literally see these kids grow up in just one summer. Which could be why all the other movies couldn't stand out like the original. And the ending leaves you hanging asking yourself questions which in my opinion is a great way to end a film.This movie is almost responsible for my childhood.",The Sandlot

You will find out about her in the movie.This movie is based around 1962 and shows a lot of baseball and learning how to play.This is one of my most favorite movies of all time, plus ""James Earl Jones"" makes a perfect Mr. Mertle.

What I find scary about this statement is not just that he didn't like the flick but that he knows other people with such crappy taste. It is a simple fact of nature that Sandlot kicks much ass. Sorry man I didn't write the rules.The truth is that even tho I was the age of the kids in the movie when I first saw it The Sandlot still holds up today, some 15 years later. For me The Sandlot falls in the Goonies, Princess Bride, Back to the Future, Time Bandits etc... category of PG rated movies I watched and loved as a kid that I still love just as much if not more today. The kids are all truly good actors but none of them have ""made"" it as adults. That sucks for them, but for us, the viewer it makes it easier to watch. It makes it a bit difficult to watch movies with cute innocent kids when all you can think about is there legendary tolerance to cat tranquilizers. So if you have kids it is nothing short of your duty to show them this flick. But even if you don't have kids, and didn't see it when you were a kid you will still dig it.

If you like baseball it's hard not to like the movie, it's about a group of teenage boys that are all neighborhood friends and play baseball together and have a ton of fun. The movie is centered around Smalls who is a kid who has never played baseball before, Benny who is the best player of them all, and Hercules (aka the beast) who is the huge dog that everyone fears that lives behind the sandlot. There are so many good parts to the movie the main one being where Smalls hits a baseball that was signed by babe Ruth over the fence into the yard where Hercules lives. And the boys try so many creative ideas to try and get the ball back. What I liked most about the Sandlot is that it is really funny and has lots of great scenes and I really enjoyed the movie because I grew up playing baseball.",The Sandlot

The best memory is when the story of 'The Beast' is made known.  Indeed, when I went camping that summer, I told the story to my tent-mates, and they believed every word of it.  (Of course, I changed it a little to make it seem as if 'The Beast' was situated next door to me.)Memorable Line: YOU PLAY BALL LIKE A GIRL!!  *Gasp!!*....(Silence)...All I have to say is, bar Blade, this is the greatest movie I have EVER seen.

No, it is not a great theatrical masterpiece or a stunning and thought-provoking commentary, so if you're looking for that, change the channel.What it is, is simply a glimpse of our country, and our world in the time before political correctness, reality TV and our fast food way of life. A time when all a kid needed for fun was a group of friends, a ball and a space to play in.Many of the changes of the past few decades have been wonderful, but I must admit I do miss certain aspects of the past; The Sandlot epitomizes all of them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

125,alyssa-nail,"""You're Killin' me Smalls!""",9,29 July 2009,"Every child dreams of having that classic 'storybook summer,' spending everyday out in the sun with best friends having unforgettable adventures. In the movie The Sandlot, Scotty Smalls is able to live this dream.Scotty Smalls narrates the story of his perfect summer. In 1962, Scotty moves with his mom and step-dad to a new town where he does not know anyone. One afternoon, he follows some of the neighborhood kids to 'the sandlot' where they play baseball. He finds himself in left center field, even though he does not know how to play. The ball comes his way and instead of catching the ball, Scotty is knocked to the ground after the ball bounces off his head. All of the kids except for one, start making fun of him. Benny Rodriguez, the best player of the bunch, stands up for him and teaches him the ways of baseball. Scotty becomes part of the group and they all share countless good times and misadventures. They continue to play baseball at the sandlot every day. Just beyond the walls of the sandlot lives 'The Beast', an old junkyard dog that, according to the legend, eats anything and anyone that enters that yard. When Benny hits a home-run over the wall, the boys are forced to end the game. Scotty saves the day when he goes home and gets a baseball, which happens to be signed by Babe Ruth, out of his step-dad's trophy room. Not knowing the importance of Babe Ruth's autograph, Scotty brings it to the sandlot. He goes up to bat and hits it over the wall. The boys try anything to get the ball back from The Beast. When they are about to give up hope, Benny has a dream in which he speaks to Babe Ruth. He tells Benny to use his speed to retrieve the ball and escape. The next morning, Benny puts on his PF Flyers, hops the fence, grabs the ball, and escapes. As he is running, The Beast's chain breaks and he chases Benny around town. When Benny and The Beast make it back to the sandlot, the fence falls onto The Beast. They tell the owner, Mr. Mertle, who they find out used to play ball with Babe Ruth, about everything and he invites them into his home where he replaces the Babe Ruth autographed ball with one signed by some of the best Yankees hitters in the late 1920s. The film ends with present day Scotty in the press box of an LA Dodgers game, where he is doing a radio commentary. One of the star players, Benny 'The Jet' Rodriguez steals home and flashes a thumbs-up to Scotty.'The Sandlot' is not all about baseball. It is not all about winning or losing, but the friendship and adventures behind the game. Movies are often about winning the big game, or defeating the rivals, but The Sandlot takes a different side of the story, showing that it is not always about how well the game is played.",The Sandlot
126,pennilessp0et,Nostalgia,9,21 October 2007,"I rate my films in terms of context. This film never aspired to be an Oscar nominated movie of a lifetime. But it did aspire to be a good family film, and that it is. For me, I'll admit nostalgia has a lot to do with it. This is a movie from my childhood, and yes as a girl I had a huge crush on Mike Vitar. But at the same time this reminds me of my childhood because my brother played baseball with all the neighborhood kids in our side yard and we always spent our summers outside or at the neighborhood pool just as the kids in the movie did.Besides, the nostalgia I'd say this movie is right up there with ""A Christmas Story"" or ""Ferris Buller's Day Off"" as far as extremely recognizable quotes go. Nearly anyone will know what movie you're talking about when you say them.""You're Killing me Smalls!"" --- ""FOR-EV-ER"" --- ""THE BEAST"" --- ""The great Bambino? Oh, I thought you said the great... Bambi."" --- ""You play ball like a GIRL"" --- ""Yeah-Yeah the kids a square"" --- ""Benny 'THE JET' Rodriguez"" I could go on, but I won't.

This strictly applies to live action children's movies. This movie falls perfectly into this category. When you see it as a young kid it mystifies you completely. As a child it almost has a supernatural feel. With ""The Beast"" taking the stage as the element of supernatural feel. The characters in the movie keep talking about the beast as though he is a mythological monster. It brings back memories of your childhood when you used to talk about those monsters and things that go bump in the night.

136,tubbe-83216,sandlot review,9,13 March 2019,"When I saw this movie for the first time I was around 7 and i loved it because at the time I just wanted to be baseball player of course when i was that age i just thought it was a cool movie but now that i'm older i understand that it's actually a very good movie with a great storyline and it has good character growth.
It's about a scrawny new kid in the neighborhood Scotty Smalls who just moved from a different state right as summer break starts he has no friends and he is very introverted and unathletic. He then stumbles across an old baseball field called the sandlot. Over the next couple of weeks he becomes friends with the neighborhood kids and and get himself into the biggest pickle known to mankind he stole his step dads babe ruth signed baseball and hit it over the fence into the old man's yard where the beast lives and where they have lost over one hundred balls so with the power of teamwork and determination they work together they try to get out of the biggest pickle known to mankind and get that baseball back.
In this film the storyline is based in the 1960s and isn't like most baseball movies where there's a bad team that get some kind of magic and wins the championship or something like that, no it's about a group of friends who just like playing baseball, while they make the most of their summer. But as most movies it has plot twist because scottie smalls grabs his step dads babe ruth signed baseball after Hamilton 'Ham' porter the funny big kid who plays catcher on their team hits their last ball over the fence into the beast yard the place of hundreds of lost baseballs. I find that this turn of bad choices is the tipping point of all the funny parts of the movies as for the rest of the movie they try to find different ways to get the ball from the beast and as they say get out of the biggest pickle known to man.
Throughout this movie you just feel more and more involved in the movie as if you were there that's in part because of the character growth throughout the movie especially scottie small as in the beginning of the movie he not athletic at all he introverted he just likes to stay inside and he has no confidence but as the movie progresses he meets the other sandlot boys like benjamin rodriguez the only really good player of the bunch and all he wants to do is play baseball and of course the one and only Ham porter then the less important characters like yeah yeah and squints and they all grow together after they really didn't want scottie on the baseball team because he was terrible but benjamin insisted on giving him a chance because they needed a ninth player. With the help of benjamin scottie actually become decent and the thing that separates this movie and other movies is it really focuses on character growth and you can tell that they become family in the movie the true friendship everyone wants i have three true friends so i can relate because what would this world be without friends.
The sandlot isn't the best movie out their but it definitely deserves to be recognized as a great movie because i've never seen another movie like it. With its storyline and character growth it's just a great movie.",The Sandlot

142,s-55162,"""You're Killin' Me Smalls""",9,24 January 2020,"The director and narrator David Mickey Evans created the classic film, The Sandlot, put him on the map, and can bring any family together on a Friday night. Released in 1993, this family-friendly movie is still present in 2020 homes across America, teaching kids important life lessons for all their baseball and non-baseball needs. With this film, Evans presents a character that all its viewers can relate to, Scotty Smalls: the underdog. Everyone is the underdog in their own story and Smalls is no different, he can struggle with his friendships, finds it hard to face his fears, and many other issues that lots of kids deal with; however, The Sandlot shows audiences how to deal with being an underdog.
Set in the 1960s, this film is all about fitting in, and when Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to San Fernando Valley, that's all he wants. Most famous for his role in The Black Donnellys, Guiry plays a young boy who knows nothing about baseball. When moving into a new neighborhood, he meets Benny Rodriguez (Michael Anthony Vitar), his whole life changes from a kid who sits inside all day fidgety with science projects to one of the boys who plays down at the sandlot.
Awkward Scotty Smalls finds his group of friends down at the neighborhood baseball field. Squints (Chauncey Leopardi), yeah-yeah (Marty York), and Ham (Patrick Renna) are unwelcoming to their 9th player on the team, but Benny is the reason for saving Smalls' summer and keeping him on the field. The amateur team is out every day playing ball, (coincidentally) next to the neighbor with the scary dog, Hercules. The boys' imaginations run wild as they describe The Beast to Smalls when their ball is hit over the fence, in the clutches of this giant english mastiff. Smalls, not wanting to end his summer fun, offers to grab the baseball he has at home. Little did he know, it was signed by Babe Ruth, or as the boys say ""The Great Bambino"". Smalls, not knowing the significance of this autographed ball, is shocked when his friends freak out when the ball is, again, hit into The Beast's yard (you would think they would have seen that coming).
Evans uses eerie music, similar to the music in Jaws (Steven Spielberg) when the shark finds his prey, creating suspense. The extreme amounts of dust and amplification of the growls the dog makes, almost like Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise, shows how the imagination of the boys' made the dog appear dangerous and scary, leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. The face-off between Benny and Hercules is almost comedic when the music changes from a dramatic score to a wild west square-off to a light and heroic score as baseball is returned to the sandlot. This scene, one might say, is anti-climatic, as the dog simply drops the ball. Throughout this movie, the boys have hyped-up this dog to be this ferocious beast that would harm them if they tried to take their ball back; however, the dog just drops it. The dropping of the ball coupled with the comedic wild west stand-off whistle creates the anticlimactic feel. This scene demonstrates the power of a child's imagination.
Overall, The Sandlot teaches kids across many generations to use their imagination, confront their fears, and above all, keep trying. Whether you're the underdog or the leader of the pack, this movie shows you that everyone has their own story. Smalls is the character that audience members can connect to and feel like they're going to be okay, no matter the problem they're faced with. Whether you're a fan a baseball or not, The Sandlot is a great movie to watch, even decades later.",The Sandlot

Simple times that don't seem possible in these times. Pink houses. Walking over to the park and just knowing kids would be there. Discovery. Being awkward, and going back the next day to try again.

144,jnbmoore,My nine year old's opinion,8,22 May 2007,My opinion is that it is a somewhat funny somewhat serious and somewhat weird movie. The most funny part is when I realized that all the comments about the beast and the blind guy were false. the most serious part was when smalls find out that the ball his dad has can not be replaced. the weirdest part is when Babe Ruth was in Benny's dream and could sit down in Benny's room. So that is my opinion.Mom's opinionThere is a bit of language that you may not want children to repeat but it is a cult favorite. I first saw the movie when I was subbing and it was being shown to a junior high math class. Many of the students (especially boys) were repeating lines.It is a good tween slapstick movie which does touch on the areas of responsibility and friendship. There is also a good anti-tobacco message.,The Sandlot

An incredible atmosphere is created within this movie that details childhood summer days in suburbia. This movie displays such respect for the game of baseball, and reminds me of all the reasons it's the greatest sport in the world. Everything about this movie is perfect. The music, characters, plot, and overall presentation is some of the best I've come across in a movie. This movie was a huge part of my childhood. And I've come to appreciate even more now that I've grown up. It's one of those films that makes you wanna jump into your t.v. to become apart of it. Yes it's that good.",The Sandlot

There, if you go up to someone and say ""you're killin' me Smalls!"" or call someone an ""L 7 WEENIE,"" and tell someone that it will take ""FOR-E-VER,"" the person will more than likely start laughing and know exactly what you're talking about.  It's one of the movies that I, and many other teenagers in my school, will never forget. Its one of the best parts of our childhood.

Even when someone is terrible at something. Don't leave the new guy out, just because he is different, etc. I could go into the whole plot like some, but you can read that in other reviews. Mine is targeted to public viewing. I REALLY wanted to show this at our elementary school's family movie night, but after watching it to make sure it was appropriate, I decided it wasn't. Just a heads up, these kids cuss quite a bit. I don't personally mind. My kids know 'bad' words from good, but other parents feel differently. As an example they use the words crap, s****, and b****ing. That is the only reason I gave it 9 out of 10.",The Sandlot

It truly is a classic, and I know that because every time I mention the name ""The Sandlot"", people constantly rave about it. Also, when it first came out it was my favorite movie, and then I never saw it again until I bought it 2 weeks ago and have watched it approx. 7 times since I got it!!! ""The Sandlot"" is a movie I will never get tired of and can literally watch over and over again for sure!!!! This movie keeps me laughing every time and the more you watch it, the more you'll love it!! Definitely one to see!!",The Sandlot
150,Shleeee,Do you love it?,9,16 May 2005,"I certainly do! This is one of the first movies I saw when I was younger. My Dad was crazy about it and would always watch it with me. I remember when I was seven years old and fell down the stair and broke my arm. My Dad rented it for me everyday until eventually he made it a ""keeper"" (he purchased a copy for me). Benny ""The Jet"" Rodriguez was definitely my first crush. His handsome dark features are outstanding. Even when I watch the movie now I get a weird squishy feeling in my tummy when I see him! This movie is about a bunch of really good friends that have a passion for the sport baseball. Every summer they would go down to an old sandy baseball field that they the named ""The Sandlot"". One summer this new kid moves to the neighborhood and desperately tries to become friends with Benny and the gang. This kid's name is Scotty Smalls or just ""Smalls"". Benny is the only one who is willing to let the poor kid play baseball with them. Benny and Smalls become quite close. Benny teaches Smalls how to play baseball. One day Smalls is up to bat and he hits a baseball signed by Babe Ruth over the wall. The gang knows of ""The Beast"", an enormous and vicious dog. All of the boys are too afraid to just hop over the fence and retrieve the ball, so they begin to try and get the ball from the other side of the wall. The boys come up with some pretty whacky stuff. If you want to know what happens in the end, I sincerely urge you to go to your local Blockbuster and rent a copy of ""The Sandlot""! Over all rating: 9/10",The Sandlot

152,atlanta-44834,The journey from boy to manhood.,8,4 December 2015,"The Sandlot; The American DreamThe Sandlot employs the conventions of the sports genre in order to connect its audience with a hilarious backdrop aside from the athletics of the film. Although not the best representation of sports in general this film excels in its genre for presenting the prefect American Dream. This film illustrates the reality of baseball in the day to day life of a mid 1960's neighborhood. A summary before you, describing how and why this American iconic film presents baseball in the best way possible. ​The Sandlot is based on a mid 1960's neighborhood. What started out as 8 troublesome boys living the American dream, playing baseball all summer long. Soon turns to 9 as Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to town. He isn't the most popular, or the most athletic. But dyer circumstances require the other 8 boys to allow him to play. There is however one boy on the team, Benny 'The Jet' Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) who believes that Smalls (Guiry) has potential to become one of the team greats. It wasn't an easy road for Smalls (Guiry). Coming to a new town, with his mother and recently married stepfather. He now has the task of finding new friends, not easy for a boy of his nature. He soon takes his plastic glove to the ballpark to see all the boys playing ball. He eases his way into right field for some practice. Only to find out he has no business on the field. Everyone ridicules him, or in the words of Squints (Chauncey Leopardi) ""A square Benny, the kid's a square!"" However, Benny (Vitar) sees the diamond in the rough. He gives Smalls (Guiry) some real gear, a real ball cap and a broken in glove. ​ Just as Smalls (Guiry) begins to feel welcome and a part of the crew. He learns of the challenges that await all of them. Life, or death 'The Beast' a giant gorilla dog on the other side off the fence. If you hit the ball out, it is gone forever. Because nobody messes with 'The Beast' One boy tried it once before but never returned. Once a ball crosses that fence, you can kiss it goodbye. Until Smalls (Guiry) brings his stepfathers autographed Babe Ruth baseball to the field to play. Little did he know about the significance of that ball, until it was too late Once the ball had been surrendered to 'The Beast' the boys must figure out a way to retrieve this ball from 'The Beast' before Smalls' (Guiry) step father returns home from a business trip to kill him. Many failed attempts, from the simple minds of 9 young boys. All lead to the moment when Benny (Vitar) must ""pickle The Beast""​If you love baseball then this is the movie for you. If you want to be sitting in your chair, all business and never crack a smile then don't even bother pushing play. It very well could pass under the comedy genre more than it could pass as the sports genre. As this movie will have you hysterically rolling on the ground as you see these 9 adolescent children running around with no parent supervision, trying to defeat 'The Beast' And if all of that fails to keep your attention, just wait until Wendy Prefercorn (Marley Shelton) the local lifeguard comes along You won't be bored for long; you'll be very jealous of Squints (Leopardi) as he drowns to receive mouth to mouth from his dream woman.​Though this film may not have top notch athletic action, it is an excellent example of the sports genre. It shows that baseball is so much more than just a game. ""Baseball is life"" the diamond is where lessons are learned and lifetime friends are made. Take the journey with Smalls (Guiry) as he tries to save his life and discovers the joy of life and friendship. Be prepared to laugh, and you might want to take notes. To remember all the quotes that you yourself will draw from in the future. Remember; don't play baseball with your stepfather's autographed ball. Or you too, might have to pickle the beast",The Sandlot
153,mkh-25370,Sandlot review,10,4 October 2016,"If your remember the Little Rascals, you really enjoyed the movie, but wished it had less romance and more laughs than it already did, David Mickey Evan's ""The Sandlot"" is an unforgettable, cliché, adorable, and nostalgic film that your just can't help but love. Despite the hyperbolic nature of, The Sandlot, this coming-of-age comedy leaves the watcher with a life-affirming message, and at the same times does not take itself too seriously, making it the perfect movie for adults and children alike. ""The Sandlot"" follows Scotty Smalls, played by Tom Guiry, and his summer adventures with his baseball team mates as they improve their baseball skills, get into trouble, and frequently spew out adorably cringe worthy insults including, ""you play ball like a girl, you mix your Wheaties with your mama's toe jam,"" and the classic, ""L7 weenie."" All cringe worthy moments are easily forgiven as the supporting cast, Ham (Patrick Renna) and Squints Paradores (Chauncey Leopardi), an more, fit into their roles so beautifully, you eat up very word, action, and glacé they throw at you. 70 percent of the movies plot line is completely unnecessary, but if any part was not in it, the movie would almost feel incomplete. The humorous inserts make this movie, ""classic."" Sure it might be cliché and a compilation of funny scenes trying to fill that hour and a half time space, but the way the movie flows, develops the characters, and sets you up to fall in love with the entire baseball team, makes this movie extremely compelling and fun to watch over and over again. Though the actual story doesn't begin until about half the way into the movie, when the movie finishes, you are left with not only the urge to time travel back to the 60's, but a realization that life is going to be okay if you follow your dreams and face your fears; cliché, but somehow amazing. The short comings of ""Sandlot"" are not easily missed by the viewer. Adult narration of grown-up Scott Smalls is not only unnecessary but extremely repetitive. ""The biggest pickle we had ever been in"" is repeated three or more times, and though important for younger children to keep track of the story, from the eyes of an adult, it makes the movie feel like it is stuck in a loop, never really starting. In 2016, children not born anywhere near this time era (1960's) or who lack understanding of this time era, will be completely lost. The freedom, independence, and adventurers that this baseball team of twelve year old children goes on, are extremely different from the lifestyle of twelve year old children today who are born into: a more non confrontational, sheltered, and technology savvy environment. However, this leads right back into the beauty of the film, it's ability to make children see how much fun running around with your friends can be, going on adventures, and learning from all your foolish mistakes.",The Sandlot
154,tykyle,"The Sandlot is a story that follows a group of boys playing baseball all summer, and together they use teamwork to solve a problem",10,2 November 2016,"The Sandlot is an all-time classic. Kids and fans of baseball all over the country watched this movie for years. From the very beginning of the movie to the end, people have always had a good laugh each and every time they watch it. I would recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't seen it yet.Baseball fans and kids have always loved to watch this movie ever since it came out. But this movie isn't just meant for kids or baseball fans, it is a great movie for everybody because of the messages it was sending us to stand up to our fear. The kids in the movie all stood up to their fear ""The Beast"" in order to retrieve their lost autographed baseball from over the fence. They used teamwork and perseverance to get an opportunity to get the ball, only to come up short of getting the ball. All good movies have some good humor in them, and this movie blends it well with the story. With famous quotes like ""You're killing me Smalls."" With this quote, this movie is also unforgettable. It's a classic warmhearted movie, that you do not even need to be a fan of baseball to enjoy this movie. It has some funny parts in it but it's mostly about kids bonding in the summer.Teamwork was used by the boys in order to get the lost autographed ball, and to avoid getting attacked by ""The Beast"". When they lost their final baseball over the fence, they got together and started building contraptions. They stayed on one side of the fence to be safe. The Beast was in sight of the ball and they slowly tried to get the ball back. All the boys worked together as a team in order to accomplish their goal.The Sandlot is a great movie for people of all ages. This movie showed great perseverance and that teamwork will help you accomplish a goal. I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody that has, or even hasn't seen it.",The Sandlot

156,wednesdayjones,"outside of the ORIGINAL The Bad News Bears, this is the best summer film EVER",10,26 December 2006,"This is easily one of the BEST films of all time. This movie reminded me of when I was a girl playing baseball with the boys in our own sandlot growing up in Alaska. The writing is not only funny but captures what life is like for kids who grow up playing the best game ever, and the measures a kid will take to get out of a pickle.***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS Every movie seems to have a chase scene, and this movie is no different. When Hercules (aka The Beast) chases Benny through town I nearly wet myself with laughter. I was crying and my sides were killing me. You get caught up in the moment with these guys and their overactive imaginations. The contraptions they make in their attempts to retrieve the ball are genius and goes to show that kids are a lot smarter than adults give them credit for. Their perspective of that dog's just killed me and I thought it was on the money cause when you're a kid, everything looks about 50 times bigger. Even the DOG gets his own P.O.V...i mean, come on. that's PURE GENIUS. I can even remember swapping urban legend stories about kids being eaten by dogs, exploding from eating pop rocks and drinking soda, etc.If you didn't find yourself getting caught up in the moment with these boys, then you have no soul. or never played ball as a kid...either way, it's pretty sad.I recommend a double feature of The Bad News Bears (with Walter Matthau) and The Sandlot. I guarantee that your sides and face will be sore from laughing, and you'll pee just a little.It's in my top 10 of the greatest films of all time.",The Sandlot

It doesn't matter if you are a action lover or a drama watcher or a horror flick buff, you will relate to this movie. Unless you never had a childhood at all.

Basically its a movie about a bunch of kids playing baseball over there school summer break. They play and hang out at there own field called 'The Sandlot'. Well, what i enjoyed the most was watching a good mix of young actors really just enjoying them selves, it was if there weren't any cameras filming to them in their eyes, they were kids being kids, the normal banter you see with boys their ages. It really hit home how much i missed being that age and that care free watching this movie, but it also gave me a great sense of happiness just to see these boys being the way i was with my friends back in the day.

Tells the true meaning for the values of friendship, loyalty, and comraderie.I can truly relate to this film. I grew up in south Florida (during the '50s) and was among a group of neighborhood ball-players who ALSO played in a vacant lot (something you seldom see in today's era). Adjacent to the lot was an old house trailer (nestled among the Palmetto trees). Outside, they kept a chained up Pit Bull named ""Pedro"" (feared by all). Each time we sent a ball into ""the trees"" NO ONE would try to recover it for fear of being eaten alive by Pedro.

It was so inspiring because I remember watching this film the night before a big game and I saw Benny "" The Jet"" Rodriguez hit the ball so hard and the skin came off. That was inspirational to me because I hit the baseball at the most critical part of the game and I got a home run to win the game. This movie is the pure example of friendship, young love and bravery which was a huge impact on my life and back then it was a simpler time where the only thing that mattered was baseball and playing on a team with your friends living your life to the fullest.",The Sandlot
