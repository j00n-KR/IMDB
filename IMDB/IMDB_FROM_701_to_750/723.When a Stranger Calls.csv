0,Leofwine_draca,The perfect cure for insomnia,1,1 December 2016,"Now, I'm all for a good slasher flick, and I don't even mind the modern day ones that flooded the market since the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM in 1996, even though a lot of them are poor. Okay, so I usually wait until they show up on television rather than spend money to see them, but I'm the first person willing to give a film a chance despite negative reviews and the like. I was the perfect demographic for this film: I'm young, I haven't seen the original '70s movie on which this film is based, and I'm easily pleased when it comes to horror. Sadly, I was in for a shock: this is one of the all-time worst movies I've ever sat through, on a par with the similarly execrable BOOGEYMAN.For starters, WHEN A STRANGER CALLS has NO story, no plot line. A girl spends a night babysitting, gets a few phone calls, then is chased by an unknown killer. The end. There's no set up, no characterisation – other than a few grating teen stereotypes – no motivation. Is that supposed to make the killer more frightening? It doesn't. You just end up not caring. One of the many problems with this film is British director Simon West, whose only other credit of note is the action flick CON AIR, about a million times better than this. West is the master of over-direction. His creepy music starts almost straight away, even when nothing remotely frightening or suspenseful is happening. Girl goes for a car ride – creepy music. Girl is given babysitting job – creepy music. Girl visits the john – creepy music. Okay, so I made the last one up, but you get the idea.The film is jam packed with false scares to pad out the running time. It's in essence a one-room drama, with a few minor embellishments, so straight away you know that a professional is required to make things work. Heck, PHONE BOOTH is one of my favourites from the last few years. This movie is just boredom, boredom, boredom. Every false scare and cliché is present, from the jumping cat scene to characters suddenly appearing out of nowhere. The lighting is poor and the film has no suspense or atmosphere; a dull-witted script only serves to sink things further. Camilla Belle plays, badly, one of the most unappealing 'scream queen' characters I've ever witnessed, one of those ones you're praying will end up dead. The killer, played by Scot Tommy Flanagan, is supposed to be scary because his face is scarred. That's the only characterisation he gets – a scarred face and Michael Myers-type stance. The killer's telephone voice, played by Lance Henriksen (!) only has about two lines. Towards the end, the whole phone call thing is so overdone (really, the lead gets at least twenty or thirty calls) that I was shouting in anger each time they did it. In all, there's absolutely no point in watching this appalling movie unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia.",When a Stranger Calls
1,SnoopyStyle,Needs much more tension,5,17 July 2014,"It's Fernhill, Colorado and the teens are having a big bonfire party. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is forced to babysit for the Mandrakis after exceeding her phone minutes. The Mandrakis live in a big house. There are two sleeping kids (Madeline Carroll, Arthur Young), and housekeeper Rosa at the house. Jill starts getting weird phone calls. She's angry at her boyfriend Bobby (Brian Geraghty) and friend Tiffany (Katie Cassidy) for kissing. Tiffany crashes her babysitting gig and then disappears. The calls keep coming and Jill calls the police.Camilla Belle is really pretty but rather bland as an actress. It doesn't help that the movie relies so heavily on her being alone. Quite frankly, nothing happens for most of the movie. They don't even introduce the kids until late in the movie. It doesn't take advantage of the girl alone scenario with better atmosphere. It never gets to a scary place. It's a lot of phone calls and missed connections. The whole movie feels like a missed connection. The final section is filled with action but it's too late.",When a Stranger Calls
2,claudio_carvalho,Weak Remake of a Scary Thriller  Prefer the Original 1979 Version,5,15 September 2006,"Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is babysitting two children in a fancy isolated house, when a stranger insists calling her in the phone. She decides to telephone to the police, to trace the phone call. When the officer on duty tells her that the call is being made from inside the house, Jill freaks out and tries to leave the place with the children.The beginning of the 1979 ""When a Stranger Calls"" is one of the scariest and most realistic thrillers I have ever seen. The story is excellent, and the performances are stunning. In my opinion, the famous 'Scream' ripped-off the introduction of this film. This 2006 remake is watchable, but director Simon West spoiled an excellent story with a typical Saturday night broadcast predicable movie. The secret of the original film was the claustrophobic environment associated to a realistic plot. The option of this director was to use a huge house, with people coming and going (or vanishing), breaking the tension. Camilla Belle has a pretty face but she is very weak in this dramatic role. Further, her character has the most unreasonable attitudes, for example leaving a house protected by a security system to move to the guest house, or calling the hidden children to escape with her. My advice: see Carol Kane in the original version. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Quando um Estranho Chama"" (""When a Stranger Calls"")",When a Stranger Calls
3,kosmasp,Stranger than reality,5,26 April 2007,"I haven't seen the original (I thought it was a short, but IMDb stats the running time of the 1979 movie at 97 minutes), but the concept worked better back then. I don't mean that it's not scary getting ... scary phone calls! It just doesn't work that well with the technology nowadays (and one of the ""major"" scares or revelations is just plain stupid)! That's not to say that this movie is a complete mess. You have great production values and teenagers will surely get excited about this movie. But there is not enough scare/story to keep you on your toes or that justifies the running time! So while it's nice to watch, there is not much to it!",When a Stranger Calls
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Subtle horror.,7,22 August 2018,"So it's not a horror that will have hardened horror addicts quaking in their boots, but it is a good example of how effective subtlety in horror can be put to good use. It's true that nothing actually really happens for about three quarters of the film, but I'm sure that's where the success lays, it's built up gradually, and when Jill finally hears the terrifying news, the film takes on a different vibe, bursting into life. I've not seen the original so can't compare, so I'm judging the film purely on the ninety minutes I watched. It's well acted, Camilla Belle is great, the visuals are great, the house, water feature etc, but it's the visuals I thought most impressive, it's a really stylish film, with some stylish scenes, the best of all being the moment the intruder stares through the glass.Simple, subtle, yet effective. If they'd upped the scare factor I think it would have worked a whole lot better. 7/10",When a Stranger Calls
5,gavin6942,Surprisingly Suspenseful Piece of Film,6,25 June 2006,"First, let's get the obvious out of the way: Camilla Belle is hot. If you're a teenage or twenty-something male and you do not think she's hot, you are not going to enjoy this film. Her hotness really carries the film.I really dislike horror remakes. The original film is a classic and did not need this. But I will give this one some credit, it was not as cheap of a knock-off as certain other remakes. The plot was revised, the use of better film technology was employed, and the film is actually quite suspenseful.How do you make a suspenseful film when the entire plot revolves around a girl sitting on a couch getting prank calls? You get great mood lighting, some great horror music (listen to the music rather than let it be background -- this composer is a genius). Also, you need an attractive woman in the ""final girl"" cliché mold. Jill Johnson the Babysitter is this girl. I would not complain about watching her run around for another hour in a remake of ""When a Stranger Calls Back"".I also dislike PG-13 movies, but I will say this one pushed the limits on PG-13 by making it purely psychological. For me, it worked. The film opens with some imagery of a carnival, some religious stuff and a few garbage bags full of mutilated girls that were torn apart with nothing more than the madman's teeth and fingers. After this first five minutes giving you an idea of the threat, you worry for Jill that the same could happen to her at any time (if it weren't for her being the heroine of this film).As much as I want to tell you to avoid this film, it's not that bad. I would rather you watch something else, but this film is much better than other PG-13 films like ""Darkness Falls"" and is far superior to recent films like ""Dark Water"". On a personal level, I even found it a more enjoyable film than ""Hostel"" despite my love for Eli Roth. So I guess you can do worse than ""When a Stranger Calls"".",When a Stranger Calls
6,jboothmillard,When a Stranger Calls,2,5 February 2012,"From director Simon West (Con Air, The General's Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), from the clips or trailer I saw I thought like it sounded like a good concept, and obviously I didn't know it was a remake, I was curious as well to see if I'd agree with the critics opinions. Basically Jill Johnson (10,000 BC's Camilla Belle) is the freshman student and track team running teenager, and she is being forced to be a babysitter for the rich Mandrakis family, as punishment for going over cell phone minutes that her father Ben (Clark Gregg) pays for. The family's large mansion house is located almost in the middle of nowhere next to a lake, the parents Dr. Mandrakis (Derek De Lint) and Kelly (Kate Jennings Grant) show her most of the place and say she can help herself to food, and they say they won't be back until midnight, the two children are asleep upstairs, and there is maid there as well. Jill decides to go exploring in the very big house and is fascinated by the lighting system, and the nice jewelry she finds and tries on, and soon she starts receiving some strange phone calls, possibly prank, from someone not speaking but clearly there and breathing heavily. She is joined briefly by her friend Tiffany (Katie Cassidy), but she leaves, and during the incoming storm she is worried by trees coming down, and then of course she is killed by an unknown figure in her car. The strange phone calls continue, and Jill is getting increasingly alarmed as they sound more disturbing, and then of course the voice (Lance Henriksen) really gets her with the threatening words ""Have you checked the children?"" She goes to check the children, they are fine, but then she gets another call from the Stranger asking ""How were the children?"", and she is sure that she is being watched by this person on the phone. Jill phones the police in her panic, and the officer talking to her says that they can trace the call if she gets the Stranger to stay on the phone for at least one minute, so she just has to wait for him to call again. She notices a light coming from the guest house, and inside there is a phone ringing, it is the Stranger, but he is calling from the wrong phone line, so she rushes back to the house to wait for another call. Jill finally manages to keep the caller on the phone for one minute, and seconds later the police officer alarmingly informs the calls are coming from inside the house and that she must run for her life, and as she starts to make her way out she sees the dead body of Tiffany. The Stranger (Tommy Flanagan, who is scarred in real life) finally comes out in person to try and attack her, but she manages to get hold of the kids from their beds, and trying to escape they also find the dead body of the maid. While the children run out of the house, the Stranger has Jill pinned down, but she manages to stab him in the hand with a fireplace poker, before running out into the arms of a police officer, and the villain is caught and driven away. The end sees Jill recuperating in hospital, and it is there that she gets another phone call, and after seeing the psycho in the mirror and him trying to attack her we see that she is fact dreaming, making us wonder if she has become insane after all the chaos. Also starring Tessa Thompson as Scarlet, Brian Geraghty as Bobby and David Denman as Officer Burroughs. Belle makes an okay lead actress and victim, but she can be bland at times, the concept is certainly good, mixing elements of Scream and stuff, but it could have been done much better than this, is just feels far too familiar, there are jumps but they feel wasted, and the only slight boost is the appearance of the killer near the end, apart from that the whole thing is a silly and hardly worthwhile horror thriller. Pretty poor!",When a Stranger Calls
7,BA_Harrison,Deserves a higher rating than it hascheck it out!,7,21 July 2006,"Any horror fan worth their salt knows the pay-off line from the original movie'it's coming from INSIDE the house!'so it comes as no surprise when the line is eventually delivered in this reasonable remake of the '79 classic. However, to his credit, Director Simon West doesn't let this hold him back from making an effective thriller which still manages to deliver its fair share of thrills and chills.Gorgeous Camilla Belle stars as Jill Johnson, a babysitter who has to do battle against a homicidal psycho, whilst looking after two kids in a remote country house. Belle does a magnificent job; she practically carries the entire film on her shoulders, with minimal support from a few barely-seen minor characters, and gives a convincing performance throughout. West carefully wrings maximum tension from his minimal plot, utilising the remote location to great effect, and building the suspense slowly but carefully.Sure, the plot has a few hokey moments and couple of minor plot holes, but I am willing to forgive these because 'When A Stranger Calls' was a breath of fresh air after the recent spate of weak 'grindhouse' horror films; I'd rather watch this than Saw, Wolf Creek or Hostel (and I love a bit of splatter in my movies!!). It just goes to show that a creepy, suspenseful, gore-free thriller can be more terrifying than an out-and-out splatter-fest.",When a Stranger Calls
8,edwagreen,When A Stranger Calls...Hang Up on this One 0*,1,29 July 2012,"Jill Johnson, a teenager, got grounded by her parents for going over the number of minutes on her cell phone. No parties or the use of the car for a month. This doesn't include a baby-sitting job that her father drives her to. Believe me, she would come to wish he had grounded her for that as well. The problem is that the viewers should have been grounded as well.The prank phone calls start coming and the housekeeper disappears. Her rival for her boyfriend pays a surprise visit and pays with her life.No one knows what's going on and that includes the local police department. Help should have been sent immediately-just to ride around and check out the place. I bet the police there wouldn't even believe in stop and frisk.The viewers are in store for an absolute night of terror. Just too bad it even means nothing. This experience had some affect on Jill and those who saw this mess.",When a Stranger Calls
9,Coventry,"""What's your favorite scary movie?"" Definitely not this one!",2,22 December 2007,"I usually make it a personal rule never to watch a remake before having seen the original version but, in my defense, I needed a free fourth title after already renting three movies and this was the only one that was still available. And now I definitely have to find and watch the original 1979-version, if only to see for myself that it can't possibly be as BORING and insignificant as Simon West's remake! What a dull, redundant & lame film, this is! We all know not to expect too much from a PG13-rated ""thriller"", but this is absolutely ridiculous! There's no action, no identifiable or amiable characters, the supposedly unsettling phone conversations are endlessly stretched just to increase the running time a bit and the whole psychopathic murderer denouement is totally implausible and retarded. The first five minutes, just for as long as the opening credits run over the screen, are undeniably the best and only atmospheric moments in the entire film. Whilst witnessing images of a small town carnival, we overhear someone with a deep masculine voice harassing a young woman over the telephone. Moments later, her lifeless body is dragged out of the house and an elderly frustrated police officer looks into the distance. Naturally you expect him to fanatically hunt down the killer, but hell no! He doesn't even reappear again. Instead, the story swifts to an entirely different town-setting and the first hour exclusively revolves on typically irritating high-school characters and soporific romance sub plots. Cute, easy-on-the-eyes Jill Johnson is punished by her father for spending too much time on the phone with her cheating boyfriend, and so she has to baby-sit instead of attending her friends' party. The house is gigantic and luxurious, but poor little Jill then receives alarming phone calls from someone who appears to observe every move she makes inside the house. There's very little to say about ""When a Stranger Calls"", actually. The plot is painfully predictable and unsurprising; the slow-moving attempts to build up tension are continuously interrupted with false scares (the house cat popping up every now and then, for example) and there's a total shortage of carnage and excitement. The rudimentary script is still full of holes and illogicalness (the girl's father can hardly find the address of the isolated villa but her bimbo friend can?) and Simon West doesn't even grab the opportunity to make the phone conversations obscene or creepy. At least the notorious opening sequence in Wes Craven's ""Scream"", featuring Drew Barrymore, offered some neat dialogs. Camilla Belle is a pretty girl but nearly not talented enough to build up a further career as talented scream-queen and none of the supportive cast members are even worth mentioning. ""When a Stranger Calls"" perfectly embodies why remakes are gradually ruining the great genre of horror. Avoid at all costs.",When a Stranger Calls
10,michaelRokeefe,Have you checked on the kids lately?,8,16 May 2006,"All you need is great house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Jill Johnson(Camilla Belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis(Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. Secluded and peaceful. The kids are already in bed, the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. The phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.Belle is great as the innocent, smart and strong teen babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.",When a Stranger Calls
11,bevo-13678,Wow and wow,10,1 April 2020,Stunning remake. Every bit as good as the original,When a Stranger Calls
12,hitchcockthelegend,Poor modern remake as Simon West and his team fail miserably.,4,10 October 2010,"When A Stranger Calls is a remake of a 1979 horror film of the same name. It's directed by Simon West and stars Camilla Belle & Tommy Flanagan. Plot finds Belle forced to babysit for the rich Mandrakis family as part of a punishment by her parents. Already feeling blue because her boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend, things are about to get much worse as she starts to get menacing phone calls once alone in the house with the children.Fred Walton's When A Stranger Calls from 79 is an effective thriller, neither good or bad it works on a decent enough level without being gory. Whilst some old horror/thrillers are deemed as sacred art that on no account should be remade, When A Stranger Calls is not one of them. A safe premise to work from, a good old urban legend and a budget that should have delivered genuine chills and surprise. What we actually get is a crash bang whallop pile of unscary junk that is devoid of invention.It's a fact that home invasion is horrific, in any age. Be it some old creaky house or a plush modern apartment, a maniac can strike any where. But the house used here is easily the most unscary house used in horrorville. OK, so we can just about accept the use of cellphones in the screenplay, tho it's still kind of yawny. But setting it in a massive millionaires glass house, resplendent with gadgets galore and featuring a fish pond in the lounge, is arguably the only shock in the piece. Did West convince himself that because it's 2006 he simply had to have an MTV wet dream of a house? Then there's the formula, of which it is straight forward stock. Young sweetie Belle receives husky phone calls, is it someone larking about? Then it's stalk and chase time. The end. There's no deviation, no daring, just basic run around shrieking and quick-hide the children.We as movie fans constantly moan about remakes of old film's showing Hollywood to be lacking ideas. Yet something like this anaemic fluff was supported with a profit on its opening weekend. Until folk realise that supporting rubbish like this will only produce more sanitised remakes, then we are in for more of the same. One has to wonder where West is going. After directing on debut one of the most fun and balls to the wall actioners of the 90s in Con Air, he has steadily produced a load of drivel. The signs were there with Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, god knows he should have been banned from working after that one, When A Stranger Calls continued his downward spiral. Next year sees his remake of The Mechanic hit the screens, that surely must be last chance saloon for the Brit director. 4/10",When a Stranger Calls
13,jotix100,The baby sitter,3,27 November 2006,"One wonders about the wisdom of the people behind this project. Why bother to remake a a superior film? This makes a plea for leaving things the way they were and concentrate in making original movies with better screen plays and leave alone the originals.The problem with this version of Simon West's version is the screen play of Jake Wade Hall. The original was co-written by Steve Feke and the director of the 1979 movie, Fred Walton. The premise in which the film is based doesn't make sense from the start. We are given a sort of prologue in which the carnival-like area is juxtaposed with the lonely house next to it in which a phone rings but there is no one at the other end and we hear screams and then see the police arriving at the scene of the crime.Jill Johnson, the young heroine of this tale, is a girl that appears not to be savvy in ways of dealing with the pervert that is obviously calling the Mandrakis residence. That brings another point, if the Mandrakis have a live-in housekeeper, why bother to engage a young girl to take care of the two children she doesn't even see until half way through the film? Things get sillier with the arrival of Tiffany, the girl that supposedly stole Jill's love interest away from her. Oh well, the only interest in the movie is the beautiful house.We have liked Camilla Belle in other films, especially ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"", but she has nothing to do in this misconceived film. Better luck next time, Ms. Belle.",When a Stranger Calls
14,preppy-3,"Another dull pointless PG-13 ""horror"" movie",1,8 June 2007,"A remake of the 1979 hit. Jill Johnson (Camille Belle) is hired to babysit two kids in a beautiful, very elaborate house in the middle of nowhere. There's also a live in maid (Rosa) and a college age son who lives in a small house nearby. Things are fine for a while...but then Jill starts getting crank phone calls. She answers the phone, she knows someone is there...but they don't say anything. The calls increase, there's a storm brewing outside and the police are far away. Then the caller asks ""Have you checked the children?"" OK--the first was no masterpiece but it had a GREAT opening 20 minutes and a great ending. It also had some good acting. This has none of that. It's a solid HOUR before anything happens! The rest of the film has Belle wandering around the house from room to room (with a couple of annoying ""jump"" scares) until you could scream. I fast forwarded through virtually half the film. There's no blood or violence at all--we don't even see the two murders in this (both of which are pointless) and the bodies don't have a bruise or drop of blood on them (gotta get that all important PG-13 rating). This film duplicates the two famous lines from the original--""Have you checked..."" and ""Your blood all over me""--but they're not even remotely scary here.It's hard to rate Belle's performance--the poor woman is given nothing to do! She is certainly good-looking and screams and runs around with conviction...but that's about it. The script she's given has her doing nothing at all.Also--the rating. The original was R rated, more violent and was a big hit. But studios today refuse to release R rated horror films. They just churn out these dull, pointless remakes of the original, make sure it has a PG-13 rating (it it doesn't they'll cut it down to one) and star unknowns. These aren't movies--they're screen tests for young actors or actresses. I don't blame them--I blame the producers, writers and directors who get this junk made and released. Really pretty sad.Seriously--watching paint dry would be more exciting than this. Skip it. Bottom of the barrel.",When a Stranger Calls
15,poolandrews,I quite liked this.,5,29 October 2008,"When a Stranger Calls starts as teenager Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has been told by her father (Clark Gregg) she has to babysit two children instead of being allowed to go to a big party after running up an enormous cell-phone bill, he drives her to the home of the Mandrakis' who are rich & their house is very nice if nothing else. Left alone in the hi-tech house with the two kids asleep in bed the phone rings & Jill answers it only to hear heavy breathing on the other end. The calls continue & become increasingly scary as Jill is trapped inside the house alone. Or is she alone?Directed by Simon West this was probably made because of a spate of successful remakes of 70's & 80's horror films, a remake of When a Stranger Calls (1979) this updated modern version is actually quite good & I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. First off I have to admit that I haven't seen the original When a Stranger Calls (although I do actually have it on VHS that has been sitting around for year's & I just haven't been bothered to watch it yet) so I can't in all honestly compare the two but I wouldn't be surprised if this remake is slightly better than the original but without seeing it I can't be sure. Anyway, I think this remake has a nice tight, taught script that pares the story down to the bare minimum & the majority of the film sees Jill in the house on her own getting more & more worried before the twist kicks in about two thirds through & the tone goes from edgy thriller to teen slasher. The film moves along at a really good pace, I was surprised to see that it lasted for 90 odd minutes because it felt much shorter, I liked Jill as a character & I didn't mind that we didn't find out much about the killer. On the negative side the film can get a bit repetitive, it's very tame without any proper violence or pay-off & it can be a bit predictable as well as the twist used is a well known one.The most striking difference between this remake & the original is the setting, the original saw a fairly mundane family home whereas here the production team has gone to town in creating a fabulously sumptuous & visually interesting house for the sinister events to unfold in. This is the sort of modern, hi-tech home so full of toys & gadgets most of us mere mortals dream of owning. Unfortunately this was made with a teen audience in mind & therefore there's no blood or gore or violence or nudity. Not good although there is a brief shot of a cat eating a bird. The film actually has a fair amount of tension & suspense which I didn't expect & there's a terrific jump scare moment right at the end which genuinely did make me jump (a bit) & I can't remember the last time a film did that.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this has slick production values although it's set in mostly the same house. The acting is OK & the cast are suitably attractive while it's always nice to see genre favourite Lance Henriksen involved.When a Stranger Calls impressed me, I am not saying it's the best psycho thriller ever but as a teen horror remake I thought it would be rubbish & basically to my surprise it wasn't. That's just about as much as I could have hoped for really.",When a Stranger Calls

17,anaconda-40658,When a Stranger Calls...Recommend the Original!,3,5 May 2015,"When a Stranger Calls (2006): Dir: Simon West / Cast: Camilla Belle, Katie Cassidy, Brian Geraghty, Clark Gregg, Tessa Thompson: Horror film remake about fear that comes nowhere near close to the shocking effect of the original 1979 version where Carol Kane played the terrorized babysitter. Plot seems to stretch the effective first fifteen minutes of the original into the entire running time. A babysitter receives threatening calls and realizes that she may be being watched. Starts out fine with edge of your seat chills throughout but the third act bombs when the killer becomes nothing more than an object. He is a faceless villain whereas the original film it examines a frail individual with a tormented mind whom a detective struggles to bring down. None of that is present here because the goal of this farce is the lowest common denominator. Director Simon West who previously made the effective The General's Daughter as well as junk such as Con Air and Laura Croft: Tomb Raider focuses on the ominous features of the house, which is nice but the plot is greatly reduced to idiocy. Camilla Belle holds her own as the paranoid babysitter but he co-stars as as lively as blowup dolls. Katie Cassidy plays a school friend who drops by and dies. Brian Geraghty, Tessa Thompson and Clark Gregg are flat. Potential remake with a stranger with no motive other than to up the phone bill. Score: 3 ½ / 10",When a Stranger Calls
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Uninspiring teen horror,5,14 October 2015,"Agreeing to take a baby-sitting job, a teen alone in a dark, isolated house gradually learns the harassing phone-calls towards her are coming from inside the house and must get away from the stranger before it's too late.Overall this one was pretty bland but certainly had some good points here. One of the film's few good points here is the gradual building tension with the phone calls, as this one gets these going along really well. From the pranks by her friends and the initially harmless joke-calls to the growing realization that there's something more to the calls, the incessant ringing and shallow perverted breathing merely add to this and their frantic nature becomes all the more apparent and well-deserved so that the tracing attempts that come up delivers really well here. As these are really serviceable scenes, these here all set the stage for what is undoubtedly the best and most worthwhile part of this, the actual stalking and brawling in the house. From the first confrontation, where he comes through an open-air part of the ceiling towards her, escaping to an underwater pond inside the aquarium to the struggle on-and-off the open staircase, with her trying to run away and he repeatedly grabs her legs and pulls her toward him each time she tries to escape, it's all good with plenty of action and smarts as she tries to escape the confrontation inside and tries to find the missing kids. It's a really decent showing and deserves some special mention. Still, beyond these points there are some really troubling parts to this that really hold this down. The biggest point here is in how the main half to this one is just endlessly repeating itself, continually blaring the phone calls on end that's quite aggravating since this results in endless scenes of her fidgeting around the house while the clumsily-conceived investigations into the possible party she thinks is behind the joke until the next phone-call appears to continue the aggravation. That this goes on for as long as it does before getting to the main attacks is the real reason why this sinks down by making it drag out replaying it over-and-over again. As well, another big factor here in the inherent tame-ness of the entire thing, as the rating here means that the entire effort is tease without delivering, effectively rendering most of what happens here moot as it won't go as far as it really should here with this kind of plot line and action, and that includes what happens to the kills here with such a small amount of kills done off-screen and never show how they truly died as the tell- tale wounds are completely missing when they're stumbled upon later. The last flaw here is the rather over-the-top and utterly unrealistic house that never looks livable and instead feels purposefully designed to showcase the chasing at the end instead of doing anything worthwhile. These here really hold this one back.Rated PG-13: Language and Mild Violence.",When a Stranger Calls
19,gradyharp,High Adrenaline in a Nifty House,6,25 June 2006,"Director Simon West (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, The General's Daughter, Con Air) seems bent on settling for an unrelenting stream of tension and terror in this little film WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. He selected a cast of actors who, while they are not big box office names, each arrives with a fine resume of work before the camera. The production matters in this film take focus and for those who enjoy the 'terror in the night' genre of movies, this one will probably satisfy.Camilla Belle is Jill Johnson, a high school girl on parental probation for over use of her cell phone, etc. who is forced to accept a last minute baby sitting job instead of attending her High School Bonfire party. Driven by her father to the palatial, designer home on the lake of the Mandrakis family, she is amazed at the high tech status of the home - lights that turn on when you enter a room, pools of Koi with intermittent artificial rain piped in, security system and multiple phones. Her assigned children are asleep and she makes herself at home - until the telephone rings. This opens the story of a stranger who calls, says little, but terrifies Jill and eventually is revealed as a serial killer. The rest is easily predictable.Relying far too heavily on the absurdly moody music score by James Dooley for effect, the film doesn't give us enough character development to make it too involving. But that probably isn't the point here. There is a vast audience for the constant flow of scary movies, and as far as movies of that ilk goes, this one is well done. The cast, again, won't ring bells as far as name recognition, but they are a strong group. Grady Harp",When a Stranger Calls
20,The_Void,So many squandered opportunities for a good film,3,26 December 2006,"Here we are then with yet another lacklustre remake of a 'classic' horror film. Quite why the powers that be decided to remake the 1979 slasher 'When a Stranger Calls' is anyone's guess as it's not exactly well known and respected. However, initially this remake doesn't sound like such a bad idea as it takes the interesting part from the original film and makes the entire film focus on that. I'd heard nothing but bad things about this remake, but as it happens; the film is not just bad, it's just hugely disappointing also as the location, lead actress and plot base are interesting - but the execution is poor in the extreme. The plot focuses on Jill Johnson; a young lady grounded on the night of a big school bonfire and hired to baby-sit for a rich couple's kids inside a huge sprawling mansion house. Nothing happens for a short while, and then the peace is disturbed by a series of increasingly inane events that seem to be hinting that there's a killer on the loose, and he's probably 'already in the house'.It's amazing just how badly director Simon West has squandered this opportunity for an atmospheric and terrifying horror film. His reasons for doing so and the reason why just about every horror film coming out of the mainstream these days is rubbish are the same - Hollywood is always striving to make horror appeal to the young cookie cutter audience, and as a result - it's not really horror any more. You can't say that there isn't enough plot for the film to remain interesting as several films have worked with a lot less than this, and the fact that something pops up every couple of minutes rather than letting the tension build is proof that the film and everyone involved (including it's target audience) are garbage. Camilla Belle looks tasty in the lead and provides a suitably lustful target for the killer. Her relationship with the killer is yet another disappointment, however, as it turns out that he's just some guy (as it's obvious he would, due to the complete lack of mystery surrounding his identity), which leaves the audience feeling cold. I'm adamant that there's a good film in here somewhere; the base plot could even have given way to a Giallo - but it's been squandered here, and that actually is a shame.",When a Stranger Calls
21,mm-39,4.2 What? More like 7 or 8!,8,5 March 2006,"4.2 What? What is with a 4.2? Too hard on the film. The movie is not a Scream type film. I was surprised. The movie makers did a film in a way that could actually happen. I like the concept! Not a fantasy Scream style film. A nice break in the horror movie filming. The over the top stunts, and blood is replaced with the sick mind and tension of a predator. A slow burn. The story has many little extras. I would watch the movie again. I guess the urban legend has killed the plot twists. If one does not know the story the better the film will unravel. The Colorado back drop is lovely but spooky at the same time. The woods and the cabin feel of the house give a wild and unsafe what is in the woods lurking atmosphere. 7 or 8 out of 10. Worth cheap night. A Friday night date movie. I would buy the movie for 9.99 at Wal-Mart.",When a Stranger Calls
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: When a Stranger Calls,4,6 May 2006,"When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it isn't), or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey.Clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes, it's primarily made up of two acts. The first, which takes a full one hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. To pay off her debt, she works part time as a babysitter, and looking after the wealthy Mandrakis' kids, is her first stint.The huge Mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment, as it is where all the action will take place. Plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond (to get wet in, for the wet T-shirt treatment), and check this out - motion detector lights, which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows. Naturally, prank calls, red herrings are aplenty, which chalks up this act's runtime, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department.There's a minor trend emerging, with actors being the unseen, providing and acting through their voice instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven, and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honours for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. Why? The script doesn't give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which I felt was a waste - they could have also casted some unknown instead, and the job will still get done.The second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. And the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. Those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed, as basically it's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed), and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time, ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Don't expect any form of character development, nor subplots that will engage.The ending tried to be too smart for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to end the movie. There's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares, no thrills, no enigmatic villain, and plenty of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing it's good for, is to provide a number for 4D.",When a Stranger Calls
23,StevePulaski,When a stranger gets a voicemail...,6,24 October 2011,"The thought of being in a very large house, being responsible for two young children, and receiving prank phone calls from an unsettling voice is a babysitter's worst nightmare. And that's what Camilla Belle has to go through in When a Stranger Calls, the remake from the 1979 film. Theoretically, since the 1979 film is such a forgotten film this could've not advertised itself as a remake and probably still have gotten away with it.Camilla Belle is Jill Johnson, a high school student who looks just a bit too old for even a Senior. She is grounded, and forbidden from a car and a phone. Not to mention she can't go to a bonfire, held by her friends. So this film already starts out as a teenage girl's worst nightmare.So, Jill is stuck babysitting the night of the bonfire and is now one of the few occupants in a house that is inhabited by two sleeping youngsters and a silent housekeeper. The house itself is ginormous. It has an indoor pond, numerous windows, and is built off a sizable lake. I can imagine the night time and the chilling feeling one would get sleeping in it for the first time.Jill begins receiving a ton of phone calls. You know, sometimes, where movies have something repetitive that spawns some sort of cockamamie drinking game? I've heard of taking a shot every time Woody Harrelson is shown at the Academy Awards, and taking a shot if a Stephen King cliché appears frequently in a film. I think I've got one for When a Stranger Calls; take a shot every time a phone rings in this film. By the second half of the film you'll be drunk out of your mind.If you wanted a simple explanation of the film, all you need to know is numerous phones ring and the same girl picks it up every time. Sometimes we see the caller ID, and sometimes we don't. Why this girl continues to pick up the phone numerous times without looking at the caller ID is beyond me. Her friend tells her not to, but she says she is expecting a call from her dirt-bag ex-boyfriend. So look at the number and if it isn't him, the homeowner, or her father don't pick up. Then the film would be call something like The Persistent Stranger, or maybe Jill should've rented the film Don't Answer the Phone to give her some much needed advice.Anyhow, When a Stranger Calls seems like a cheap little horror film, but the fatal flaw is that, for one, it's PG-13. No horror film now can go without a PG-13 stamp. Because of certain paranormal things not being gruesome and other little psychological horror films, it seems many get the PG-13 shoulder instead of rightfully being rated R. This is extremely tame for PG-13, and could've passed for a very, very low PG in 1983. The second problem stems from the trailer. It reveals the big twist. Another unnecessary element that begs the question; do people who publish the trailers even know what they are editing? There are a handful of positives that make this PG-13, jump scare-fest slightly worth seeing. I can't deny, this has some of the best cinematography in a long time. The eerie pans over the lake, the haunting footsteps on the hardwood floor in the house. And even some of the expressions on the character's face say it all.My favorite scene comes very early in the film where Jill is running on the second level of her gym. She is running extremely fast, but can't stop staring at her boyfriend down on the court. We hear the electrifying bounces of the ball, the repetition of her footsteps hitting the floor, and even small things like the press of a stopwatch are all magnified to greatness. This is one case where if aspiring filmmakers want to learn how cinematography can practically save a film this is rightfully it. I've never been so immersed by a film solely by its location.Camilla Belle is also very charming as our lead, but the ending begs an explanation and stretches believability as far as possible. With that, concludes When a Stranger Calls - a mixed bag of a horror film. I very rarely recommend a film for something as moderate as cinematography, but this time, it does nothing but the film justice. It truly is a creepy flick, if you can look past a few minor things. But still, it is victim by a spoiler and a rating, which can't result in a full recommendation.Starring: Camilla Belle. Directed by: Simon West.",When a Stranger Calls

27,sddavis63,An Excellent Thriller That Manages To Scare You Without Any Blood And Gore,9,24 September 2009,"It's really hard to see what you would want from a movie like this that wasn't already here. I thought that after a weak beginning (featuring a sort of ""Tim Burton-esquire"" neighbourhood with a huge amusement park at the end of the street) this movie turned out to be everything I could have wanted in a movie. That beginning seemed to be for the purpose of setting the stage for what would come, so we're introduced to a baby- sitter receiving mysterious phone calls who ends up being killed in what was apparently a rather grotesque (but not shown) fashion. It was totally unnecessary to the rest of the movie. Fortunately, though, that beginning lasted only a few minutes. From that point on, no time is wasted on story development - we're thrown right into things as Jill begins receiving mysterious phone calls while baby-sitting, only to gradually come to the realization that the calls are coming from inside the house. It's sort of a combination of ""Black Christmas"" (the killer inside the house) with ""Halloween"" (the teenage baby sitter being stalked angle) - and it's very well done.The setting (the huge and mysterious house - mysterious not for any frightening or supernatural reason but only because it's so big, leaving all sorts of opportunity for surprises) is perfect, the acting is pretty good, and this really is frightening without being bloody or graphic. I found there were quite a few ""on the edge of your seat moments"" in this. I wasn't sure why there was a need for Jill's friend Tiffany to get involved in this - that was a weak decision on the part of the writers - but it was one of the few weak decisions that was made here in what was basically a thoroughly enjoyable and truly frightening movie. Hard to understand its low rating here, except that perhaps we're so conditioned to expect blood and gore in this kind of movie that when those things don't appear we feel a bit let down. Personally, I had a lot of fun with this, and have no hesitation in giving it 9/10.",When a Stranger Calls
28,Robert_duder,We may have a new Horror Franchise on our hands!!,8,22 February 2006,"I almost thought in the first half of this movie that I had picked a dud. It wasn't the actors, characters, or direction but rather the story that seemed to be dragging something awful. It took them nearly 3/4 of the film to get off the ground but once they did...look out!! There is absolutely no doubt that this film was made with young teens in mind for their demographic. Especially for a young teen girl this film would be terrifying and that's what the original was too (which I have not yet seen.) In the beginning it was such a long, drawn out setup with the phone ringing more often than a Bell Operators, sometimes the Stranger, sometimes not. The film was also wrought with the cheap scares that make you jump but also had some genuine creepy moments as well. Director Simon West somehow made every moment in the film, every event, every inanimate object fear filled and the teens in the film must be the most paranoid, group of kids on the planet. Before anything creepy actually happens they are all scared to death.Camilla Belle takes the lead role as Jill Johnson. Could this film make her a scream queen?? Absolutely!! She does a stand up job in every way and although the script makes her far too fearful in the beginning she's also feisty, strong, soft spoken and hot at that. She fills the lead role nicely. She is really the only lead role in the film except maybe for the stranger who doesn't actually make a physical appearance till nearly the end of the film. So Belle has a lot of time where it's just her holding up the entire story and in that she does well. The few members of the supporting cast are okay but nothing stand out because they don't have enough screen time to do so. The film is definitely done with the key demographic in mind. The teenage drama going on in the back ground, her getting grounded by her parents, her very real teenage concerns and the idea of being isolated and alone babysitting is terrifying to young teens. For the guys it seems to me that Simon West made sure to film Belle in the tightest fitted clothing, also seemed to shoot her from curvaceous angles and such...it's a ploy but it likely works. Fortunately so does the film.In the last half hour of the film the action breaks from the moment the Police Officer on the phone tells Jill the call is from inside the house. It immediately felt more like a remake of Halloween then it did the original film. Either way it was wickedly scary and heart thumping as she is terrorized through the house with the children in front of her the whole way. The sheer idea of how much they could serialize this and turn it into the newest and greatest Horror Movie franchise is amazing and I hope they do because I love a good Horror Franchise. I would say that the only mistake they made was actually revealing The Strangers face in the end. I would have definitely waited till later on in the series because I am sure they plan on it. The ending was also well done and fantastic and leaves so many doors open for sequel upon sequel. Here's to a great Horror Film out there right now, definitely worth seeing. 8/10",When a Stranger Calls

It's about a baby sitter in a large house who starts getting weird phone calls. I was scared for her and had to watch it all the way through without stopping the tape to find out what happens. You don't need a lot of story for such a simple concept. But for me, it works. I thought all the ""jump"" scenes worked even the ones with the cat.And finally we have a teen girl who uses her brain at the end to escape a killer instead of doing something totally stupid.FINAL VERDICT: Good, scary.

I'm wondering, if this was not a remake, would critics have felt the same about the movie, not having an original to compare it with?'When a stranger calls' is a remake of the 1979 film of the same title, starring Carol Kane. I loved the remote setting in the modern, impressive home. The film has a creepy and rather disturbing introduction of what the killer is capable off. This ensures enhanced suspense once babysitter Jill (Camilla Belle) is being stalked. The motion activated lighting also significantly adds to the suspense.Every opportunity is utilized to show off the amazing house, and I loved the idea of the garden house as well. The film never gets boring, and there's always something happening. It's all about the phone. There's hardly a moment without suspense. I've seen 'When a stranger calls' a few times already and find it entertaining every time.The only downside (for me) is that I didn't always find Camilla Belle believable enough. Think Neve Campbell in the first 'Scream'. She was awesome and I could literally feel her fear. I didn't get that same feeling with Belle. Maybe she just tried too hard...With a film set almost entirely in the confines of a house, well crafted suspense and excellent sound effects, I enjoy 'When a stranger calls' every time, regardless of what critics might think.",When a Stranger Calls
31,zkonedog,Not Enough Real Suspense,4,5 March 2017,"There are some movies that, when you move past a certain age, you really struggle getting into the drama/suspense of the plot and characters. ""When A Stranger Calls"" is exactly that kind of movie.For a basic plot summary, this film sees babysitter Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) terrorized by a mysterious caller who won't seem to leave her alone. As the calls keep coming in, Jill gets progressively creeped out and decides to take action.Like I said in the opening, the trouble with this movie is that once you are over about 15-16 years of age, the suspense themes of the film will no longer truly creep you out. Simply put, this is a ""tween"" flick through and through, as there really isn't enough ""real"" suspense to suck in those who have seen these types of efforts before.The other dramatic problem with ""Stranger"" is how they deal with Jill's antagonist. Instead of leaving anything to mystery, pretty much the whole scenario of what will happen is laid out in the film's opening scene. A bit more mystery might have been the way to suck in those viewers who aren't necessarily enraptured by the ""babysitter in peril"" angle.Overall, then, ""When A Stranger Calls"" is a below-average effort in the suspense genre, doing just enough to avoid a dismal rating.

At first everything is all right and groovy for Jill until she gets these strange phone calls followed up by heavy breathing and what sounds like someone blowing his nose that starts to unnerve her. It's not long after that Jill realizes that whoever is calling is at the same time watching her every move from outside the house. The problem for Jill is how to keep the heavy breathing phone caller from breaking in before the police come to rescue her and the Mandrakis children!We've seen it all before in the 1979 movie of the same title but this time around-in 2006- the action and tension just doesn't keep together like it did in the previous and far better version. Jill for her part is so ridicules in her actions in trying to prevent the stranger in doing her and the kids in she by leaving the door open and taking a walk outside in what looks like a major hurricane in fact makes it that much more easier for him to do it. The stranger is ironically played by two people one on the screen and actor Lance Henriksen, no stranger in playing movie psychos, as his voice which has to be a first, having two people play one character at the same time, in movie history.****SPOILERS**** Thowards the end the policeman whom Jill got in contact by phone Officer Burroughs, David Denman, finally was able to trace down the stranger by her keeping him on the phone long enough to put a trace on.

Jill in the end survives all the carnage but she's now a mental case in what she went through and seems descant to be institutionalized for the rest of her life.P.S I don't know if it was the real deal in making the film or I saw a defective version of it on TV but all the scenes in it seemed to have been filmed as if it was done backwards, as if shot through the reflection of a mirror, making whenever there was any text to be read, like the opening and closing credits, by watching it seem as if you were dyslectic!",When a Stranger Calls
34,insomniac_rod,When PG-13 Horror Flicks call back...,2,30 April 2006,"The original WASC isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre. In fact, if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it. The remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen Horror flick. Now, I don't have anything against PG-13 Horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame. When you see the PG-13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used for several times. Don't even ask for gore or violence. I know that it's not correct to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original. The tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake. Not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning. No tension, suspense, thrills...nothing. The movie goes too slow before it gets a little ""interesting"", and that's when the stranger appears. The chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of ""what will happen next?"". But that's it. The situations that set up for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack of suspense. The original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie. Now, I understand that this is a PG-13 Horror movie but, if you pay respect to the original. Why change it's most important situation? The children are not supposed to survive! After the ending I felt like this movie was pointless. So the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko...that's it?. Then, the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid. And worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. Camila Belle is the best thing about the movie. She delivers a cute, believable performance. She needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans. Please, don't watch this movie. Some people say that in order to support the Horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. I don't necessary agree. If we ignore movies like WASC then the producers of Horror movies will understand that we won't accept CRAP. We want good Horror movies, not lame flicks filled with false scares.

37,kevin_robbins,This is a disappointing remake that didn't need to be made,2,1 November 2021,"When A Stranger Calls (2006) is a movie I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a grounded teenager whose parents get her a job babysitting instead of hanging out with her friends as part of her punishment. The estate she working at is beautiful and remote. As her night begins she starts receiving strange calls and noticing eerie things around the house. As the night progresses things get worse.... This movie is directed by Simon West (Con Air) and stars Camilla Belle (Practical Magic), Tommy Flanagan (Gladiator), Katie Cassidy (Click), Brian Geraghty (The Hurt Locker), Clark Gregg (Agents of SHIELD) and Tessa Thompson (Creed). The storyline for this remake had the potential to be good based on the premise, setup, circumstances and storyline...unfortunately this isn't executed as well as the original. The phone calls in this aren't as troubling as the original. The details and backstory also aren't as intense as the first film. The main actress is fairly annoying and the horror elements are lacking. I also felt like the killer wasn't trying hard enough to kill her the entire movie which was frustrating. This is a disappointing remake that didn't need to be made. I'd score this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it.",When a Stranger Calls
38,atinder,had it moment,4,1 June 2013,"Well, What I find odd that, It took me 3 times to see the original in full but this remake, watched in one full sitting.So the start of original movie as expected for most of the movie, we also get little story of murder before and then Girl ends up baby sitting we also get she little bit about hrrself before she goes into thehouse.While she was house for first 15 mins with walking around with some noise here and there, I thought there were some decent suspense moment there but then when friends end ups breaking in, with out her even knowing. After that movie kind of lost suspense it had and just got little boring until the latter part of the movie.When things start to happen and I do think muisc should not have been added to those scenes, It kinda took the edge of those scenes away. Well the last scenes from the movie were really pointless and didn't really add anything to the movie, only one lame scare scene was not even real.The acting was not great but it more then watch -able, so it not really bad. I had some mixed feeling the original, I didn't think was great but still better then remake which also had it moment here and there. 4 out of 10",When a Stranger Calls

There are basically 'three' main characters in this thrilling film . # 1 Actress 'Camilla Belle' . # 2 'The House' were the film is taking place .They built the house from the ground up it is modern 70s style and is outstanding architecture worth watching this film for is element alone. # 3 'The Telephone'
Once this film get going I was on the edge of my seat . The tension is very well thought out and the set design 'The House'. The lighting like a neo-noir. Camilla Belle acting through facial and body movement there is limited dialog. OK so this is not Hitchcock but a pretty damn good thriller In its own right .

40,drownnnsoda,Mediocre But Entertaining.,5,16 May 2006,"""When A Stranger Calls"" is a remake of a 1979 horror film that involved a babysitter who was harassed by a strange caller while babysitting and then years later is plagued by the strange caller again. This film is similar, but focuses on one evening rather than a span of years. Jill Johnson is your average teenager - she's having boy trouble, fighting with her best friend, and going over her minutes on her cell phone - which ends up getting her grounded for a month. So, instead of joining her friends at a bonfire, she gets to go to a house in the middle of nowhere to babysit for a wealthy family. After arriving, the Mendrakases show her around their magnificent and unique home, with glass walls and all kinds of extraordinary features. Jill makes herself at home while the kids are upstairs asleep with the flu... until she begins to get strange phone calls that become increasingly odd. Jill phones the police, who tell her to call back if the stranger directly threatens her. But as the night goes on, the stranger continues to terrorize her, and seems to have more in mind than just prank calls - perhaps, murder.I'd have to say this movie is half and half. It is far from perfect, but it's not extremely terrible either. It kind of sits on the fence for me. Camilla Belle's performance in this movie became annoying to me, and her character made some dumb moves. The supporting cast didn't add much to the film either. The main problem with this movie is that we've seen it all done before - ""jump"" scares involving a cat, eerie shadows, things jumping around corners. It's nothing new, I've seen these things happen a million times, and this film doesn't even try to make them unique. It doesn't have much of anything new to offer, and it became a tedious and boring at times. On the other hand, for the most part it's decent at what it does, and that is primarily to keep you on the edge of your seat. It may get a bit boring at times, but overall it kept you in suspense.Although ""When A Stranger Calls"" isn't exactly a breath of fresh air, it was an entertaining movie, even though it has it's flaws and is a bit clichéd. Overall it is your average teenage stalker horror movie, don't expect anything brilliant, but it was entertaining at least. Could've been better though. 5/10.",When a Stranger Calls

44,fertilecelluloid,"Bland, unsatisfying remake",4,23 January 2007,"So, from the director of ""Con Air"", Simon West, comes ""When A Stranger Calls"", right? It's a remake of Fred Walton's '79 feature version of his own, award-winning short, right? Now that we've got that straight, my delayed reaction to the film. It's not total rubbish, and it takes the original feature's first act and expands it into an entire feature with no other acts (unless you count the rotten epilogue). We get the ""Have you checked the children?"" line and, of course, the psycho is making harassing, PG-13-rated phone calls from inside the house. In this instance, the house looks like something a Hollywood movie exec might live in. The film was shot at Culver Studios, so the house is clearly a set. West, who has a stack of rock vids and commercials under his belt, does his level best to make the house interesting. He has his lighting man working overtime with the shimmering shadows and reflections and he shoots a lot of the material through glass. The lead gal looks sexy in tight, low cut jeans, and she keeps herself fit running away from the nutjob and answering his irritating phone calls. Since this is aimed at squeamish teenyboppers, there is next to no blood and guts and there's no attempted rape or misogyny, either. The sexy friend of the lead is a welcome addition to the slaughter roster and the action-packed finale, which involves moppets in jeopardy, has a predictability to it that sucks the life out of the narrative. West tries hard, though, and maintains a reasonable tension across the film's first hour. The psycho, a murderer of fifteen other people, is a truly bland cipher who will offend nobody but the folks he's stalking. These PG-13-rated horrors have got to go. What do schoolgirls want with horror, anyway? Shouldn't they be at the mall trying on make-up for Chrissakes?",When a Stranger Calls
45,MarieGabrielle,Glad I didn't pay $9.00 in a NYC movie theatre...,1,25 February 2006,"I have to agree with many of the critics on this one. Simply bad. No other way to put it.When I saw the recent remake of ""Amityville Horror"", I was incensed at the lack of acting, and its cheap imitation of ""The Ring"". This movie is worse, far worse.The original film,(circa 1979) with Carol Kane, Colleen Dewhurst and Tony Beckley was a masterpiece when contrasted with this dreck.There is no plot, the house is the only interesting character, and the suspense is equivalent to the trepidation you may feel walking several blocks home alone, on a dark night in NYC. I seriously question where the director and writer have lived their lives, on a beach in Malibu, no doubt.This film is so flaccid and dimensionless that I cannot even subject the reader to further torture. Do not waste your money. Rent the 1979 film. At least Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Beckley know how to act.",When a Stranger Calls
46,Samiam3,"Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring",6,24 August 2010,"Simon West's remake of the 1979 film (of the same title, ha ha) is the product of a director who clearly likes horror movies but doesn't know how to make one. In an attempt to make the film as epic as possible, West and his screenwriter resort to ripping off a lot of the movie's predecessors. It is a well shot piece, with bits of suspense here and there, but on the whole, When a Stranger Calls is ineffective because it is generic, overdone, and clumsy written.In order to compensate her father for paying her cell phone minutes, senior high sweetheart Jill Johnson takes a job as a babysitter. She will be working a month at the residence of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis. The couple have a gorgeous Scandanavian style, maple wood lake house, which turns into a hell whole within minutes once Jill starts getting pranks calls from a stranger with deep laboured breathing. Soon she is convinced that she is being watched, and she is a long way from town.The movie's sole effective quality is that it can generate some claustrophobia. West and his DP Peter Menzies Jr. rely heavily on making the house have a life of its own. there is always something mobile within it, from the shadows on the wall, to the pet cat (who from the moment you see it you know what is coming). Unfortunately West's problem is not knowing the importance of subtly. The music and sound score are over dramatized and draw way too much attention. , the editing is atrocious, and because West seems so unsure of where best to put a boo moment, he puts them all over the place: The phone rings, someone shows up, the phone rings again, Jill checks out a corridor, the phone rings again, the wind whistles. It feels repetitive and annoying.When all is said and done, this motion picture becomes a classic case of a premise far superior to its execution. It could have been worse, but its occasional eeriness alone is not enough to make When a Stranger Calls recommendable.",When a Stranger Calls
47,Sherazade,"Nicely shot, poor written and poorly acted!",4,1 September 2006,"Based on the ever popular urban legend (or is it) of the babysitter who is home alone with the kids when she begins to get a series of harassing phone calls that are ultimately traced back to the house she is in. In this movie, you will practically be begging this sitting duck of a teenager to call the police because she literally becomes a phone service the minute she arrives at the mansion where she is to babysit two sleeping kids (whom she never bothers to check up on until the last minute). Oh no and I'm not talking about a phone service for her own cell phone or walkie talkie but it is the phone of the home owners whose children she is babysitting that she keeps answering like its her or something. What ever happened to let it go to voice mail or the machine will get it? I mean... Okay, so she is home alone in this huge mansion and a serial killer keeps taunting her with eerie phone calls that turn her into a makeshift Nancy Drew before she actually decides to hand the investigating job over to the police when she grows tired and too scared to continue her suspenseful snooping around. If you're like me, the only thing you'll enjoy is the visual (as it is stunningly shot in HD) but everything else is bad, from the kids INABLITY TO ACT, to the cliché slutty best friend. It all just screams overdone, poorly written and poorly executed.",When a Stranger Calls
48,Matt_Layden,"""You Don't Need To See Original To Know This Remake Sucks""",3,25 April 2007,"Jill is a young teen who decides to baby-sit for a wealthy family one night...big mistake. She soon receives threatening phone calls and is harassed to no end. She quickly discovers that she is not alone in the house, the phone calls are coming from inside. Can she escape this madman's mind game? Or fall victim to it.I for one have never seen the original film, but am a big enough horror fan to know what it's about, how the scares work and if I would enjoy it or not. I think it was a mistake on my part to watch the remake before seeing the original because everything is so by the book it hurts. I realize it's a remake of the same clichéd horror stereotypes but this is post 2005, don't you think we could add a bit more flavour to the mix? A Good looking young female as the main character just doesn't cut it anymore. Also for this remake, neither do the scares.Simon West should stick to action films, Con Air is a great film and Tomb Raider (for a video game film) is decent. His stab at the horror genre fails to send any chills down our spines, instead lets us roll our eyes in disbelief at some of the actions these characters do. I understand that it is indeed a remake of something that was made when the horror genre was big and they people behind this probably thought that they should play it exactly the same way, but this formula really needs to change. Having the main character go outside to investigate something, after being threatened by an unknown caller is not something a normal person would do. Alas, I guess in order to get the running time a tad bit longer they had to pull something out of their ass, this thing comes and goes quicker then diarrhea after Mexican night.Camilla Belle is young and good looking sure, but her style is not in the horror genre. Instead she deserves to be in the next Paul Walker film. You are in trouble from the start when your lead actress has to take lessons to learn how to run. You read that right ladies and gents, how to run. The Stranger does what is expected, stand around the corner and tilt head to the side in order to look creepy. West does a good job of hiding the Strangers face the entire film and keeping his image in the darkness. There's one compliment you'll see pop up in this review.There is no real suspense. Either the people have seen this before and know what to expect, or are just flat out laughing and the garbage on the screen, either or, there is no suspense filled scenes. One scene comes to mind when our babysitter is hiding in the pond under a walkway as the stranger walks above her. Will she be found? Will the kids be found? Will she escape? We should be asking ourselves these questions, but instead I found myself asking when will we get to see her emerge from the water so we can see her all wet. Rude, I know, but it's the truth.When I speak of clichés I really mean that. From the fake scares to the killer appearing at every corner, everyone is used here. With the film's short running time it all hits you scene after scene making for an extremely boring watch. There are some remakes out there that can work, The Hills Have Eyes managed to pull of a fun and brutal experience. West and co. should have taken a lesson from that film. When A Stranger Calls is a weak and forgettable entry in a long list of remade horror films that really didn't need to be remade. Do yourself a favour and skip this one, pick up the original instead, I know I will.",When a Stranger Calls

Another thing is that Jill has made a big phone bill so her parents grounded her and makes her babysit a house to pay for the bills. During her babysitting, Jill is harassed by an increasingly threatening prank caller.So much horror films these days are being released as hard R rated horror films with so much gore, violence, and sex that I'm afraid horror films will fall yet this movie came to save the day!This is a very good film for one reason and one reason only: This film in not rated R or has violence, gore, or nudity to satisfy or even scare the audience. Instead, this film uses unfamiliar spaces and a sense of the unknown to keep audiences scared. Using modern-day luxuries like caller ID, security alarm systems, and motion-sensor lights to its advantage, the film plays with themes of technology and wealth, pondering how much protection they actually provide.That's why this film is actually good. But soon, here and then, they start to use ""cheap scares"" and some clichés but still, this is a pretty effective suspense thriller, NOT horror. This film also uses a thing I call ""insignificant objects"". Why? Well, I'm not going to go too far into it but it's basically a good tool, in my opinion, when making a movie.About the score, this film uses many suspenseful music, which is also another reason why the movie keeps up so much suspense. In fact, this is one of the most suspenseful movies in years! This film did not scare me but I certainly had some tension. Another reason why this movie is good is that it's believable. It can happen in real life so that actually enhance the scariness of the film.The acting by Camilla Belle is very well done. She will become a great actress and has a lot of potential. Her character is even smart in the film rather than the dumb heroine. Another good thing is the cinematography and the great production design. The house is beautifully designed. This whole film looks great.Nothing pretty much happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. The film pretty much sets up everything until the ending, which makes the movie much more scarier instead of starting it off with kills and gore. Give it a chance, at least.Although critics and people literally panned this film, I liked the film. It's a really great film to enjoy or even have a midnight scare party. So if you actually want an effective thriller rather than the violent and gory horror film, this film will please you. Go see it!",When a Stranger Calls
50,Luigi Di Pilla,Predictable Thriller,4,11 June 2006,"I noted this movie in the trailer charts and then I saw that it made a remarkable gross amount at the US Box Office. Before I bought it I read some critics on this site so I was prepared on the low rating of actually 4.3 but I thought it can't be so bad. The director executed the film well and reached no doubt a very high suspense level accompanied by a chilling music. That's really all. The story therefore is poor, predictable and harmless. It begins very promisingly but what I saw then was always predictable and I found the scenery of the house too cartoonish. The story has some holes and it doesn't contain enough twists, plots and surprises. Fortunately the running time was not too long because I get bored more and more at the end. Perhaps I didn't like it also cause it's playing nearly all the time in the same great house. If you can digest all that it could work for you or for the teenager audience. Otherwise I recommend to stay away. My final verdict and of my wife: 4/10. See instead JOY RIDE, I KNOW BUT WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER or CELLULAR.",When a Stranger Calls

Starring Camilla Belle, Katie Cassidy, Brian Geraghty, Tessa Thompson, Kate Jennings Grant, Derek de Lint, Clark Gregg, David Denman, Tommy Flanagan, (voice) Lance Henriksen. (PG-13)Here's a swell idea: take the first fifteen minutes of the 1979 cult horror film, ""When a Stranger Calls"" (the only part of the movie anyone remembers anyway), expand it to an hour-and-a-half, then hope that most of the audience has never seen a motion picture before so maybe they'll get fooled into being surprised and entertained. One of those PG-13 ""fright flicks"" that were all the rage in its day, sanitized and lobotomized and lacking any semblance of suspense or terror. Crashing close-ups and obnoxious sound effects abound, without a character to care about in sight; as for Belle's performance as the babysitter protagonist, most cadavers are livelier. Director West, better known for dopey action films like ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" seems completely lost while trying to generate atmosphere and tension.

Let's face aside from the first 20 minutes the original was pretty unwatchable it was followed by a Superior showtime sequel and now remade into it's best form. Taking the originals opening and stretching it out for 90 minutes makes for a simplistic, edge of your seat, achingly suspenseful nightmare. Similar to Halloween in its form and ambitions. Camilla Belle is awesome as the young babysitter forced to work at a gorgeous house in the middle of nowhere to pay for her cell phone bill. Upon arriving she's told the children are asleep but as the night goes on there are strange occurrences and creepy phone calls with the voice of a disturbing Lance Henriksen.

55,xredgarnetx,Bad business,4,13 May 2006,"Could any remake today be worse than that of HOUSE OF WAX or THE FOG? Well, yes. And it goes by the name of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. Jill goes babysitting in the country and immediately is hounded by menacing phone calls and odd noises. She does not have the sense to let the calls go to the answering machine, although she does call the cops early on. While this is not a scene for scene remake of the slim and sleek original, it plays out pretty similarly but at far greater length and is padded out with scenes involving a visting girlfriend and a trip to a boathouse. The actress playing Jill is terrified pretty much from the outset, so any tension that might have been built is automatically drained. The occasional odd sounds around the house don't amount too much, and the hugely overdone ominous music that runs the entire length of the movie only makes matters worse. You know you're in trouble when the second-billed is a guy we don't see until the closing moments, and then only in shadow. The ending is a direct lift from CARRIE, for those who follow such things. It worked in CARRIE; it doesn't here. See the original for a much scarier rendition. The director of this remake made LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER. Tell you anything?",When a Stranger Calls
56,BrandtSponseller,"Clinically competent, but lacks verve",5,13 August 2006,"Do you like your horror to be gore-free and have low body counts? Are you easily scared watching scenes of protagonists creeping around dark, deserted houses as they hear strange noises and overreact to shadows? If so, When A Stranger Calls might be just the ticket for you, because more than 80 percent of this short film is one such extended scene.It didn't work very well for me. It's not because I care about gore and body counts--although I certainly don't mind that stuff, but I just mentioned that for fans who do care, pro or con, about it. No, it's that for better or worse--I figure it's worse, but there's not much I can do about it--fright is not an emotion that I ever have in response to films. It's been that way ever since I can remember--even as a kid I don't remember ever being frightened by horror. Instead, I usually wanted the monsters to win. I often identified with the monsters. I'd dress up as Dracula for Halloween, not because I thought it was scary, but because it was a chance to literalize a beguiling fantasy--to be yourself, whatever that was--to be very different from norms--and still be accepted for it. So I do love the horror genre, but fear has nothing to do with why I love it.Director Simon West has a different idea, and he banks his first horror film, a remake of a 1979 film of the same name, on a bet that he can scare you. West also apparently subscribes to the theory that we'll be more frightened by what we imagine than what we can actually see. So for about an hour (When A Stranger Calls is only about 80 minutes long, not counting the credits), we're treated to Camilla Belle trying to act frightened of things that she imagines, and we're supposed to empathize with her. I think Belle is gorgeous. She's been great in other films, like 2005's The Chumbscrubber, and she's not exactly bad here, but her horror chops need some work. It's usually difficult to buy that she's scared or alarmed. In fact a couple times she came across as caring more that she looked good, or that the camera wasn't catching her in unladylike positions.Making matters worse, West seems to care a lot more about setting up potential scares than he does about objects and people within his fictional world behaving in a non-puzzling way. Anyone who knows my views knows that I don't expect films to cohere with what we know or believe to be true about the actual world. But when, say, remote-controlled living room fireplaces belch out roiling torrents of billowing flames fit for Hades in a film that's not otherwise fantastical; or when characters show up out of the blue, inside a putatively alarmed home because the garage just happened to be left open--even though we have no reason to believe that they knew where the house was located; or when the same character goes from being a bit belligerent and carefree to scared out of their wits just because they dropped their car keys and it's windy outside, then it's unjustified to expect audience members to not become distracted, in a bewildered way, by such occurrences.West displays him film literacy a bit. For just a couple examples, the beginning makes a strong reference to Fritz Lang's M (1931), M serves as a parallel for the modus operandi of the antagonist, and both the setting and a later, important scene in a bathroom are taken are taken right out of the play-by-play book of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980). The premise of the film is based on an overused urban legend, while the creeping-through-a-dark-and-lonely-house idea, as well as the mysterious objects that shouldn't be left behind, the red herrings, the clothes on hangers being mistaken for bogeymen, and later, the unexpected bodies popping up, are all taken from horror films almost as old as the genre itself. Beyond that, West doesn't give us much.I wasn't always disappointed while watching When A Stranger Calls, and it's not just because I like looking at Belle. This may be overly trodden territory, but West and crew have their mechanics down in an academic--or maybe clinical--way. It was enough to keep me watching. However, that's not enough to make When A Stranger Calls recommendable. Once you learn technique, it's your responsibility as an artist to do something more interesting with it. I can't say it something more interesting was done here.",When a Stranger Calls
57,Vomitron_G,A 20 minutes short stretched into an 80 minutes film,5,24 October 2011,"This film has been bashed on quite a bit for being the PG-13 re-make that it is. A bit unfair, since it's not all that bad. It just left me indifferent. What this film does, is simply taking the first 20 minutes of the original and stretching it out into 80 minutes. And that's basically where things went wrong: there's just not much of a story and not much character development. Alright, pretty much nothing of those two things is present in this film. But it still kept me watching and I liked some of the choices that were made, like for instance not showing any of the killings. It helped set some mood in which the viewer just doesn't know what's going on. It's not until the bodies start popping up later, that you know the threat is for real. But by then, it's too late for protagonist cutie Camilla Belle already. Only in the last 15 minutes or so things get suspenseful, when the killer is established and the chase begins. Before that, it's just setting the mood and building tension. Unfortunately, it seems to take ages just doing that. The film is well-made, but the whole thing would have worked much better as some 42-minutes episode for some horror/thriller TV-series. Now, half of the film is just a waste of time. I did love the house, though. Nice villa, great set design.However, there is something this 2006 re-make did good: keeping the stalker unseen for most part of the movie. Still, with stretching those 20 opening minutes of the original film to a full feature without doing much else with it, we really have some missed potential here... For instance, in the beginning of the film it is established that the father has a son from a previous marriage. He's in college most of the time, but lives in the guest house outside. They could have done something with that character. Have him show up at some point, but keep his intentions & motivations vague, thereby serving him as a possible antagonist (making it seem like it might be him harassing the babysitter with the calls and all). Perhaps have him come & go or make him disappear at some point, only to have his dead body found later in the movie and then present us the real killer. Also, the lake setting was wonderful, but it was never used for anything. It's a well-crafted film, but with little substance. Everything about it is so thin and underdeveloped. So we are left with a great setting (the lake and the wonderful house), some good mood & atmosphere and a bit of well-executed suspense during the climax. But that's about it, really. Missed potential, I tell you, always a sad thing.",When a Stranger Calls
58,hnt_dnl,Mock me if you want...but I like this film A LOT!,9,25 January 2011,"Wow, was I surprised at the extremely low IMDb rating of this movie remake WHEN A STRANGER CALLS (2006) This is actually one of the few horror movies that thoroughly entertained and involved me from beginning to end in a long time! For me, I really liked the isolated location, that lakeside house in the middle of seemingly nowhere. And the movie has real atmosphere thanks to a very creepy score. Plus, the cinematography is way better than most you'd see in a movie like this. But the main draw of the film is it's dedication to SLOW, methodical building suspense! And yet it never gets boring.Another HUGE plus working in the film's favor is that the main character Jill Johnson (authentically portrayed by ingénue beauty Camilla Belle) seems like a real CHARACTER! A major key to the reason why this film works is that we get a snippet of the current trials of Jill, just enough for us to want to identify with, empathize with, and finally root for her character to succeed in the end. The filmmakers definitely put good thought into this one. I'm surprised at so many negative reviews of Belle's acting. Actually, she was pretty good and carries the movie very well. It's refreshing to have the female lead of a horror flick not be just any random, nondescript, dime-a-dozen, blonde bimbo that we've seen THOUSANDS of examples in horror flicks! Jill is a relatable, normal teenager that has a few minor problems (cheating boyfriend, dubious best girlfriend, semi-stern dad) and this makes her much more identifiable to the viewer. WE could see ourselves going through this, too! But the main thing is that Belle's demeanor mimics the trajectory of the film...Jill went from blissful ignorance and nonchalance early on to slow-building tension at the midway point to all-out terrified at the end! She performed her part very well.Although a remake to a more famous movie, this 2006 version of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS succeeds where most modern horrors fail in that it is no-nonsense, old-fashioned stylish suspense that slowly builds to a tense, exciting crescendo. It is an immensely re-watchable flick...Trust me!",When a Stranger Calls
59,Fernando-Rodrigues,ALMOST,5,1 March 2021,"It does exactly what the 1979 original should've done, but weakly. This one is not so tense as its antecessors and has a lot of clichés.",When a Stranger Calls
60,cultfilmfan,When A Stranger Calls,5,4 February 2006,"When A Stranger Calls is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name. Set in the present the film is about a teenage girl named Jill Johnson who has to baby sit in a large expensive house. During the night she gets many different prank phone calls and after awhile it starts to scare her and soon she can tell that these aren't just prank phone calls, but rather someone who actually wants her and the children upstairs dead. The remainder of the film includes Jill trying to keep him on the phone long enough to be traced by the police and at the end there is a big chase sequence. I saw the original When A Stranger Calls and I wasn't that crazy about it, so I thought maybe a remake would be an OK thing. This is odd for me seeing as I' am usually against remakes. But after seeing this remake I now know that this film should not have been made. For one thing aren't remakes supposed to be fairly accurate accounts of the original movies that they are based on? Well this one just took the basic storyline of the first film and stretched it out into one whole movie. And even though the film has a short running time the story and the things going on in it got old fast. The film has a lot of the usual horror clichés including loud noises and things popping up around corners to scare the audience. This film is also really watered down for a young teen audience and I don't even think that this movie will be enjoyable for young teens because of how bad it is. Everything about this movie is bad and anyone who has seen any classic horror films can tell how much this movie rips off old material and ideas. I' am personally getting sick of all these horror remakes. Even though I didn't like the original When A Stranger Calls (which is still probably better than this film) I now see that it didn't need to be remade at all. I also get tired of seeing these watered down horror films for teens. I think that they are really dumb and that teenagers are way too smart for them. So in the future be aware of PG and PG-13 rated horror films. From reading this review you can probably tell how much I disliked the remake of When A Stranger Calls and that couldn't be further from the truth.",When a Stranger Calls
61,jamesraeburn2003,"""Unsuspenseful and ultimately pointless remake.""",1,22 May 2006,"An American high school student called Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is forced to babysit the two children of Dr Mandrakis (Derek De Lint) and his young wife Alison (Madeleine Carroll) in their luxury house as punishment for running up a huge bill on her mobile phone. Jill is expecting it to be plain sailing as the two children are already asleep and she will be able to explore the place. However, a hoax caller is forever phoning her up and asking sinister questions like ""Have you checked the children?"". Initially, she thinks that its all one big joke but in the end she becomes terrified and phones the police. They put a track on the line and it soon transpires that the caller is inside the house. In addition, the maid Rosa has vanished so she and the kids are all alone with the madman. Jill tries to escort the children and herself safely outside the house. Unfortunately, her tormentor (played by Tommy Flanagan) has seen them go and he attempts to kill her. In the process of trying to elude him, Jill discovers the bodies of the maid and her best friend Tiffany (Katie Cassidy), both of whom the madman has killed. The struggle ends back inside the house when the stranger attempts to strangle her and she manages to impale his hand with a poker. The police arrive and in her bad state of shock she learns from the cops that she encountered a madman who has been responsible for the harassment and murders of fifteen other women. The film ends with Jill in hospital being treated for shock and she has a nightmare in which her attacker is back to get her in the guise of one of the doctors.This remake of the 1979 horror film, When A Stranger Calls, will probably be the most lacklustre genre offering you will see this summer. The plotting is so wafer thin and the trailer ruined the only twist that there is by revealing to the audience that the caller will be in the house with her. So if you've seen the trailer there is really no point in seeing the film. Director Simon West lays on all the atmosphere of the spooky little house with shadowy photography and sound effects, but the suspense rapidly plummets and the climax is utterly pointless as there is no real sting in the tail, only what we knew all along. The script really needed a lot more work on it to make it more than a routine shocker. As another reviewer pointed out, When A Stranger Calls, will most likely end up being in the bargain bin at your local DVD video store.",When a Stranger Calls
62,Falconeer,hypnotically bad..,1,26 September 2010,"This film has not one redeeming quality; ugly and unimaginative cinematography, poor acting, boring as hell characters, and nothing happens. So uninspired and lazy this is supposedly a remake of a classic horror film, but actually this is just covering the FIRST HALF HOUR of that film. So basically, the half hour opening of the original, when the babysitter is in the house getting the phone calls, is streeeeeetched over a 90 minute runtime! Want to spend one and a half hours watching a dumb girl get phone calls? Look no further than this film. She gets a creepy phone call, she walks around the house and acts nervous. She calls her high school friends for support, then...SHE GETS ANOTHER PHONE CALL. This goes on for 90 minutes. The dumbest thing about this miscarriage of a film; she believes that the guy making the calls is outside in the bushes, watching her through the windows. she is safe inside a multi million dollar home with a million dollar security system, and what does she do? she RUNS outside into the woods, looking for a friend!

63,Son_of_Mansfield,When a Screenwriter Chokes.,4,28 June 2006,"You would think that even a first time screenwriter would know not to build a movie around a cliché that everyone knows and expect us to like it. I have never seen the original and I still knew what was going to happen, because I have seen other movies. What is worse is that the main character has no dimension at all and the lead up to her going to the house to babysit is superfluous. The beginning has bearing on what comes after, it tells us nothing. I expected that the killer was going to make her boyfriend and her girl friend kiss and she would have to run up and stop them in just twenty-four seconds, because her coach knows she can do it. But the boyfriend disappears and the girl dies. Shame.The second half of the film is spent watching the girl as she checks out various noises. The slightest noise sends her down hallways with weapons. Yet, when the alarm goes off, it must be nothing at all. She is calm as can be. Also, she turns on two loud devices, with one button, and shuts them off quickly so as to not wake the kids. Then, at every other noise, she yells random names down the hallways. Halloween without an interesting antagonist, supporting cast, plot, theme, or ending.",When a Stranger Calls
64,acidburn-10,A shoddy remake of an already not very good film,4,20 March 2009,"Okay the original version of ""When A Stranger Calls"" wasn't very good, only the opening 15 minutes, and the ending were decent in that movie, the middle was stupid and pointless.This version sees the opening 15 minutes of the original version and stretches it into a boring hour and half, could have worked if they didn't reveal terrifying phone calls were coming from inside the house just like in the original version. I mean that was just stupid advertising on they're part and they also make it obvious as well about 20 minutes into the film when her friend shows up and gets killed.This version had absolutely no scares or tension because you already know what's coming, at least in the original version you didn't see that coming. I mean the idea was good though a young girl babysitting 2 kids while in the meantime getting creepy phone calls. The house they used in this remake is ridiculously high-tech and quite futuristic, They should have used a normal house which would have created more of an creepy atmosphere, but sadly this doesn't have any of that. The young actress Camille Belle does what she can with the rubbish material that she has been given but she's just doesn't have the star quality that this movie needed, she just didn't do it for me.And the final climax between the killer and the heroine just wasn't up to the usual classic horror movie chase scenes, I mean the killer just wasn't scary at all and the climax was just boring and unsatisfying.All in all if you've seem the trailer then you've seen the entire movie.",When a Stranger Calls

66,LoneWolfAndCub,Predictable slew of scares leading up to a fairly good finale,3,31 March 2006,"This movie is a very slight remake of the 1979 horror, When A Stranger Calls. To be more precise, the first 30 minutes is remade and extended. There are many haters of this film, I don't really HATE it, but I Definitely wouldn't call a very good film.Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is grounded, and is forced to babysit two young children. She is taken to a huge and very beautiful mansion (which is isolated, of course) on a lake. Thinking this will be a normal babysitting job, she relaxes, until the phone calls start..............There have been a huge amount of horror remakes released in the past few years, a few good ones (Dawn of the Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ring), a few appalling ones (Psycho, Dark Water) and many still to come (The Omen 666, The Hills Have Eyes, Day of the Dead, Friday the 13th, The Evil Dead). When A Stranger Calls was bound to be remade.This movie has a few good points going for it, but a lot of bad ones.This movie looks great, the house is amazing and the look of everything is just perfect. The opening credits are very good and effective, which makes it seem that this movie could be a real shocker. Camilla Belle holds out well enough, considering she almost always has the camera on her. And the character she plays, Jill Johnson, is for once, a smart person. She fights back and uses stuff around her to defend herself.But for all the good points, there's more bad ones outweighing them. There are way to many predictable scares. Note to Simon West, black cats are not very scary, loud music isn't very scary. There are way too many 'jump' scares, than actual scares. The supporting cast are fairly average and were only there for either story, or body count. The music is fairly repetitious, but not awful. The script is, well, terrible. The first 30 minutes or so are fairly boring. Even when she starts to get the phone calls, its really just her roaming around the house and getting scared by cats or noises. It's only when we discover that 'the calls are coming from inside the house' that it gets fairly exciting.I would only recommend this for mindless entertainment, since this is not a single bit scary.1½/5.",When a Stranger Calls
67,apryla-58795,Loved it!,10,16 December 2018,This was really well done. Even though you know what's coming the suspense keeps you glued to the screen. The music is really great. There were times when it got so intense I had to mute the sound.I love Camilla Belle. I have always thought she was extremely beautiful and I feel she is underrated as an actress. She went up against Daniel Day Lewis when she was just a young girl in The Ballad of Jack and Rose and I think she outshone him in that by far.Belle plays the part of a young high school girl perfectly in this movie. All of her reactions look genuine - not like she's acting at all. She carried this film on her own and pulled it off perfectly.A few critiques of the film-what kind of parents leave a babysitter they've never met with their children WITHOUT introducing them first. I get that the kids were put to bed before she got there due to the flu but c'mon! First of all who leaves their kids at home with a stranger when they are ill?! Secondly let's just assume they are like most parents today...self-centered and view their kids as accessories or lives to be lived through...hence going out while their children are sick...ok still! When the kids wake up don't you think it'd be a bit scary to wake up to a stranger and not your parents?! Ridiculous! It's not like these parents had an event they had to be at-they were just going to dinner and seeing a movie! They could've postponed their selfish plans until the kids got better. Idiots!Also how the heck was the girl not able to reach ANYONE she knew?! She's calling everyone and no one is available?! Ok again the parents (the kid's parents AND HER parents both) should have had their cell phones turned on and been checking them every minute they were out. Also they should have called more than once to check in.Another thing-it looked like the family had a gate so how did her girlfriend get into the driveway?Also how'd the killer kill Tiffany and then drag her all the way up to the maid's room? How did this guy even get in the house with it being locked up like Fort Knox?! We know nothing about him and don't even see his face until the very last seconds of the film.Lastly how the H did these kids not wake up with the phone ringing off the d*mn hook?! She's turning on loud music and yelling out to the maid and talking on the phone. With the house being as open as it was the sound would have carried very clearly. I guess we are to assume that the Mom drugged the kids up on flu meds or something thus the reason for them being passed out like they were in comas.Also this family is clearly rich...why the H are the kids (a boy and a girl) sharing a room?! That's just not realistic. At that age they'd want their own rooms.Even with all those critiques I still loved it because Camilla Belle carried the film flawlessly.I do recommend this but don't answer the house phone while you're watching it.,When a Stranger Calls
68,Nightman85,This stranger shouldn't have called again.,3,4 March 2009,"While babysitting at an isolated Colorado house, a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone.Remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span! So it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. There's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. There's a lot of Camilla Belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares. It all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills. It certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it wimps-out and changes one important plot point from the original. I guess we have the PG-13 rating to thank for that.On the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub-par. Belle's performance is pretty mediocre too.It's just another unimpressive remake.* 1/2 out of ****",When a Stranger Calls
69,HEFILM,"Watch the trailer, see the original, stay away or watch something else",2,4 February 2006,"The trailers giveaway the two twists in the story and there is nothing else left. Slickly made, gutless, bloodless,remake. The original film is almost an anthology film, with each act being almost a different kind of film and with a memorable villain both as acted and written. This film just pads out the first section. The only real victim of the piece is a character you want to die, and not even the cat dies. The cat actually has the best moment in the film and is only slightly more hairy than the forearms of the bland new lead actress. A few inside references to other films and real life murders show that the screenwriter or director knows of real life scary murders or movies of them, too bad they can't make this one seem real or exciting. The house which is the central location is something that only exists in movies, nobody lives in a place like this unless they are in a James Bond film. After the film I overhead a couple of black guys say, ""If that had been a black movie it would have been over in five minutes."" They went on to say how the lead could have ended the movie in so many ways even in the first five minutes that the story would be over. I agree with them, though I'd say if it had been any kind of a good movie it'd be over. After lots of trendy jump cutting early on the film settles down into a less obnoxious style that makes me give it two stars instead of one, that plus the cat eating something scene. The film is not scary and the ""twists"" you'll know from the first film or from the trailer to this one, or you'll just figure out on your own. Tedious, for a one character stuck in a place movie there is no reality or claustrophobia to it and without some brilliant performance in the lead there is nothing that can redeem it.The villain has sort of pointy devil ears like Robert Patrick did in Terminator 2. That's probably why they hired him, but they give him nothing to do.",When a Stranger Calls

Even though I enjoyed this film more back then, I couldn't help but feel disappointed after a second viewing. The writers were really trying hard to make this installment just as suspenseful as the first, but the monotonous scenes of safety alarms going off and pointless phone calls that aren't the killer dragged this movie horribly. Also, the killer really does not even say much of anything on the phone, so what's scary about phone calls if you don't hear vulgar language, threats or even a creepy voice. The viewers see no deaths and the film starts off with a very lousy plot. One thing I do admit, the casting of Camille Belle was a smash. She had solid character development and looked like a girl who you want to play this role. Overall, I still found myself consistently bored right up until the last couple of minutes of the movie.",When a Stranger Calls
71,christian123,It makes the original look like The Godfather,1,11 February 2006,"What should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker, while trying to stay one step ahead of him.The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. The remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film. That's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress, better director, writer etc. There's no suspense, everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens. At least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes.If this premise were to work, then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen and throughout the whole movie, she seemed to be reading her lines. You get a lead role in a Hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! Why did they hire this girl? Sure, she's pretty but she can't act at all yet I suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.This movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film Boogeyman. That movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. This type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. He has to be one of the lamest killers ever. He carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. The ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up suspense. He was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good. The house was amazing and I'll give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. In the end, if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10",When a Stranger Calls

Jill is have problems with her boyfriend Bobby, who kissed her best friend Tiffany. To pay off her bill and get away from the relationship problems, Jill for the night is babysitting Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis children. The ultra modern house, which is more of a work of art than a house, is isolated in the hills with no neighbours in sight. Not to long into the night, the phone calls start to pile up. Between calls from her friends, a mysterious stranger repeatedly calls; heavily breathing through the line. With the police unable to do anything, all Jill can do is sit tight. As the calls keep coming, Jill soon finds that this mysterious person is inside the house, lock in with her.When a Stranger Calls, isn't really a complete remake of the original film; only taking the first part of the original and extending it to feature length. As there has been a lot of remakes in current time; with more to come, When a Stranger Calls doesn't take itself to seriously, more in essence paying homage to the great horror films of the 70's. It streaks back to the faceless killer with only murder on their mind, with no motive ever revealed, praying on the tormented teen. A lot of horror/thriller films of late have more concern about the body count, snuffing one person after the other. When a Stranger Calls strips back to bare essentials, with our heroin babysitter and unknown stranger always in focus, with the odd minor character added in.The surprise that the calling stranger is inside the house is no surprise; even the trailer tells us. It's the mind games that the stranger plays with his unsuspecting victim. The house is used to great lengths by director Simon West, with dark corners and corridors. James Michael Dooley's subtle music score adds a great, taut atmosphere, though does over blows itself at times.As the babysitter in trouble, Camilla Belle isn't just a pretty face, presenting a solid performance, though Camilla does lack that strong exterior of the heroin for this type of movie, underplaying to much of the time. Supporting cast also underplay their roles, yet doesn't really matter as they don't make much of an appearance. Lance Henriksen as the voice of the stranger is greatly eerie; with some creepy heavy breathing.When a Stranger Calls is no great thriller, yet is a such welcome step away from all the current ones.",When a Stranger Calls

76,PoisonKeyblade,Exactly why People seem to Hate Remakes so Much,1,17 August 2007,"This movie was dreadful for a number of reasons. For one, Camilla Belle shows nothing here that proves she can act (but shows differently in the incredibly underrated thriller The Quiet). She is, however, the best actor in the film, and that alone should tell you something right there. Also, the original is much more efficient in dealing with its length; the phone call and the police arriving happen within the first ten minutes, and it is completely terrifying. It finished things off with one of the most frightening conclusions I've ever seen. Other than that, the original was essentially a film about a detective tracking down a killer. In this remake, that detective storyline is completely absent. Instead, they work on expanding the first ten minutes of the original into an hour and a half, and they fail miserably. There was almost no tension or fear the entire time, and the movie was mostly just a huge letdown. At times, it was so awful that it was funny. The conclusion leaves something to be desired, although it is probably the best twenty minutes of the movie. Every time there is a phone call, it's not terrifying like it was in the original, but it simply seems like we've been there, done that. Nothing is terrifying about a girl who can't act and doesn't know when to just go up, take the kids, and leave.

After a while she has been in the house for hours and the same things happen again and again, and it doesn't really make any sense. None of the characters make sense. It just doesn't make sense what happens. Besides that, it is likely the viewer all ready knows the story so there's little suspense. After a while so many strange and absurd things have happened inside the house that nothing really makes sense anymore. The original movie is one of the scariest movies of all time, but this remake seems little more than an attempt to cash in on the success of the original movie.

I don't like the original i think is really overrated 6.5 is too me really higher score. It is not that good of a movie. It is not a classic or scary movie it is not. I tried manny times with the original to like it, I never could get in to it, because that movie sucked in my opinion! The sequel was alright better than the original but not better than remake.I like this film, it is not a great movie It dosen't deserve 10/10 because the film does have a mistakes and flaws that i don't like. In the beginning we never found out how the killer killed young babysitter. Why does the main heroine wears shoes in the house? They shouldn't show the killer's face it would have better if he wear a mask he would be more scary.The acting is 10 Camilla Belle is a bad-ass heroine I love her character she is miles way better than Carol Kane. Carol Kane did do nothing in the end of the film, Camilla Belle protected the children, she fight off her assailant. The movie is terrifying and scary as hell. It is not a slasher, but deserves in to horror genre. I enjoy it more than the original Halloween. Katie Cassidy is fabulous and fantastic as Tiffany, Jill's best friend, I love Katie Cassidiy I love her in A Nightmare on Elm Street remake I love her in Arrow and I loved her in Supernatural Season 3 and I love her in here. I love Katie Cassidy to death Hughe fan of the actress.When a Stranger Calls remake is scary and it is the only movie of three I like, it is a decent horror film that I like. I hate the original film cause it sucks and is not good. I don't know why it got 10/10 by users? It is not a 10 that movie. The remake is also not 10 but get 7 cause I have enjoy the film and I like it a lot.",When a Stranger Calls

The characters are shallow, the motivations for Jill's babysitting are shallow, the situations are contrived (the stupid behavior of the police being an example) the dialogue is painful, e.g. ""I'm a b i t c h, Jill. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it."", there is NO SUSPENSE WHATSOEVER, the scares are of the 'Oh My God, the Killer!... Oh, wait, it's just the cat' variety (and the 'cat' scare is actually used twice), every single clichè in the book is used and the main actress is as expressive as a dead fish.In short, a stinker.

80,bababear,"Great Side Dishes, but No Meat",3,25 June 2007,"There are elements to this film that are so good that you wish the effort had been applied to a better movie. The camera work and set design are excellent. But that's about all that's outstanding here.The project was doomed when whoever decided to film just the first of the three acts of the original film and s-t-r-e-t-c-h it out from some twenty minutes to almost an hour and a half. The dramatic high point- Jill's being told that the calls are coming from inside the house- comes two thirds of the way through. It's an hour and fifteen minutes into the story before the maniac is close enough to actually touch her.Then because they spent so much money on the sets that they hired actors who I hope worked for minimum wage.The leading lady (I've blocked her name and don't feel like going back) speaks in a whiny monotone. Her delivery is as flat as a pancake, but she is resilient. Half of her hair is pulled out by the roots but her hairdo is still perfect.Worse yet, the ending is a cheat. When she pins the madman's hand to the floor and cranks up the fireplace (it works by a remote control, and she's doused him with what I think was vodka) there's a nice burst of flames and he could have died a slow, agonizing death by flames while Jill passively watches.Instead he's arrested and carted off in a police car. Jill wakes up in the hospital and there's nobody there (this part looked as if it were going into HALLOWEEN II territory) and then sees the maniac in a mirror. Then she wakes up in the hospital bed screaming- that was all a dream- and we are to assume that she'll never be free until the sequel, when she can finally whip some psycho butt and get closure.Watching this was like going to dinner and being served a salad, a baked potato, and a piece of pie. Hey! Where's the beef?",When a Stranger Calls
81,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Camilla Belle is too hot for words. Oh, and the movie was...meh.",4,27 June 2006,"'When a Stranger Calls' was not as bad as I thought it would be, in fact, it was way above expectations. But this doesn't make it a great film. It does have it's moments, and these tend to be towards the climax of the film (which is basically the same as the 1979 version). The climax unfortunately does leave a lot to be desired.Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle, 'The Balad of Jack and Rose') has gone over her cell phone minutes and is forced to babysit to cover the debt. Enter a wealthy doctor and his family, along with their famous and massive mansion, a forgiveness demanding boyfriend, a backstabbing best friend, 2 sleeping children, and one seriously demented prankster, and you've got 'WaSC'. Jill starts receiving phone calls from a man only known as 'The Stranger', and begins to get worried, only to find the true terror later on in the night.Camilla Belle is in fine form, more in looks than acting. She is the right actress for the part however, as she does the 'what the hell's going on' look really well. She does well with what the writers give her, but to be honest, the writing could have been much better. Had the writing been better, Belle and director Simon West would have been able to make the film a lot better. West does well with a somewhat limited story, and handles the suspense very well. One weak point is that the film does get off to a slow start, but once the suspense gets going, it doesn't stop, literally not until the credits start. My big reason for liking the movie was the music. James Dooley does an excellent job composing music that keeps you on the edge, especially at the end of the film. There are a few foreshadowing elements early on in the movie, for example, the bottle of alcohol one character puts out. This is a good film to rent, but I don't recommend purchasing it. It's a good film to watch by yourself, so have a good 87 minutes with it. Teenage boys should love Camilla Belle, just as I did....she's unbelievably hot when she's scared (laughs).4/10 --spy",When a Stranger Calls

84,Toronto85,When a Stranger Calls,7,29 July 2013,"This remake of 'When a Stranger Calls' attempts to take the intense and terrifying first fifteen minutes of the original, and makes a full length film of it. It's the classic story of the babysitter alone at night getting harassing calls, soon to find out that the caller is inside of the house all along. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is the young teenage girl who has the responsibility of taking care of the Mandrakis' two kids. Once she gets to the house, which is practically an estate, she begins receiving harassing phone calls from someone asking her ""have you checked the children"". It's eventually revealed to Jill that the calls are coming from inside the house, and it's up to her to get herself and the children out alive. This house is HUGE! It's got an indoor pond, at least a dozen rooms, and lights that turn on and off when you enter and exit each area of the house. I am so happy that the people who made this film actually used their large location to their advantage! Jill runs through almost every inch of the place, being stalked by the crazed caller. We actually get some very tense moments in this one when Jill discovers the caller is in the house, very well done. Acting was really good from Camilla Belle, you can feel her fear. The film is basically surrounding her and her character, so it's good that she put in a good performance. Katie Cassidy who is a scream queen herself put in a good job in the supporting role of Jill's friend/enemy Tiffany. I am definitely in the minority when it comes to this remake, I thought it was pretty well done. It was not near as good as the original and the first 15 minutes of tension in that one, but I like that this remake focused ENTIRELY on the babysitter being stalked by the serial killer which is something the original failed to do. 7/10",When a Stranger Calls
85,TheMovieMark,"If and when a stranger calls, just hang up",2,4 February 2006,"Heaping ridicule upon the frail shoulders of When a Stranger Calls is almost too simple. It's similar to beating your grandmother in arm wrestling. But I'd like to start my review on a different note. I want to take a break from all the negativity and issue a hearty ""thank you"" to everybody involved in this production.I'd like to start off by thanking the screenwriter - Jake Wade Wall. I don't know how you did it, but you found a way to get hired to write the screenplay, effectively giving hope to any and all aspiring screenwriters. One can't help but leave this moving thinking, ""Man, if that guy can get a job in Hollywood then I surely can!"" You presumably made a nice chunk of change for what couldn't have amounted to more than five minutes of work, and honestly, how many of us wouldn't want that gig? If you readers are familiar with writing a résumé then you're aware that experts recommend you limit it to one page. One can't help but think Mr. Wall mistakenly thought the same rule applied to screenplays.Here's what I can imagine the screenplay might have looked like:**********FADE IN: INT. BIG HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM Lights flicker, shadows dance, the phone rings constantly. Eerie music plays.JILL JOHNSON, ~17, answers the phone. She stares blankly into the distance and struggles through her lines with all of the emotion of Paul Walker hooked to a morphine drip.JILL (showing no emotion) Who. is. this? Why. do. you. keep. calling?REPEAT FOR 90 MINUTES********** Since I'm such a nice guy I would like to help out and recommend a book that would greatly benefit Mr. Wall: How Not to Write a ScreenplayThe book covers 101 common mistakes that most screenwriters make, and Mr. Wall made just about every one of them. No need to thank me, Jake. If the book teaches you just one thing (preferably that true tension involves more than music building to a crescendo only to have a cat jump out) then that will be thanks enough.I'm not sure if the book discusses the importance of avoiding clichés, but since it's clear that you don't know what the word means, the dictionary can help you there. An example would include a girl dropping her car keys outside in the dark and then not being able to start her car. We've seen that in approximately 473 other bad horror movies, so something original would be appreciated your next time around.I would also like to thank Camilla Belle for giving hope to all aspiring actresses. Lay off the sedatives the next time you're spitting out your lines, sweetie. Not once did I ever believe that you were scared or in any sort of peril. It takes an extreme amount of incompetence to go an entire movie without a single change in emotion, but you managed to pull it off. Bravo.And finally, thank you, Hollywood. Without you and your deep pockets, this movie would have never been made and I'd still be on the lookout for an addition to my ""Worst of 2006"" list. You know how easy it is to make a bad horror movie on a low budget, and you know that enough teenagers will go to see it to make you a profit. But you also make it easier for me to make poignant points on exactly what is wrong with the industry these days. For that, I thank you.That's enough thanks for one review. Well, except for the thanks you moviegoers will want to shower upon me for helping to convince you to save your time and money on this one. Don't believe me? Just wait and find a friend who gets suckered into seeing the movie. When said friend reiterates my words of wisdom then you'll get back to me.",When a Stranger Calls
86,GirishGowda,"I know I am supposed to hate this. But honestly, I Love It.",8,20 May 2010,"Well I was 16 when this released and I saw it without knowing anything about the plot and I had a crush on the very pretty and cute Camilla Belle after seeing the movie. So, this is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures and I will always love this film. This was coming on TV the other night and I just saw it again for the 6th time without a second thought. I hope you will watch it without any preconceived bad false notions about it.Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is a high school girl who is on the track team and one of her best friend has kissed her boyfriend. So, she breaks up with him and refuses to talk to her friend. She has also talked too much on the phone, like 800 extra minutes, and her dad makes her to babysit to earn her money so she can pay off her own bills. She has to babysit Dr and Mrs. Mandrakis's (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant) kids and they live in a huge lakeside house. Things start to get a bit creepy when a stranger (Tommy Flanagan) keeps on calling Jill and seems to be spying on her. She can't find the house maid and the police don't give much thought to her predicament.Though there are many films of this kind out there, the studios just keep on churning them out every year. Do you know why? It is because every year new kids step into their teens and they would not see old movies of this kind. So, this will be new for them and a babysitter who is stalked by a psycho killer is pretty horrifying if you have ever babysat in a house which makes some creepy noises. Almost every kid will connect with that. Camilla was good in her role, though many have complained that she didn't portray her fear very well. Well, what do I know; maybe some girls don't like to show they are afraid of the killer (ring a bell?) I am a guy, so don't think only girls or young boys will be afraid of this film. The first time I saw the film, I was horrified and wanted Jill to get out of the house, away from the killer. Now, its more like a pleasure to see her and the beautiful mansion once again. That house is huge with all the modern securities and gadgets within it.The opening scene is very chilling and the director tries very hard to give us false jump scares which were quite annoying with repeated viewings actually. The decor of the house was magnificent, with the bird sanctuary or something within the house and a beautiful lake outside. The atmosphere is very eerie because of the magnitude of this house. I have to say, Jill is a very lax babysitter. She doesn't even check on the kids until the prank caller asks her about them. The adults in the film are not given much scope for acting. Even the stranger, Tommy Flanagan is just a caricature. They could have at least given him some kind of weapon to show us how he killed his victims. That's the only slight flaw I found in my first few viewings. Jill's friends are dumb and boring, at best. I wanted them to finish their scenes more quickly so that Jill had more screen time, without their distractions. The kids were not used properly in the film, though. This film doesn't have an ounce of sexual tension, which was quite surprising and I was happy with that (Many pg-13 movies make the actresses run around in their underwear). Don't let the rating on IMDb fool you. This is quite a good suspense thriller for us youngsters.8/10",When a Stranger Calls

90,Rathko,More Generic PG-13 Horror,4,13 February 2006,"I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent. Get a first-time screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings, but is still completely by-the-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clichés.The story is unbelievably simplistic. The slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend. The killer is devoid of even the token motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie's killer, and as a result is never particularly frightening. The police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with Lara Croft, but his style of directing is decidedly generic, possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. The performances are routine, dark hallways replace genuine horror, and the scares are of the tired cat-in-the-closet variety.The cinematography and production design, however, are above average for this kind of film. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments that are of visual interest.Though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality, it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller, and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk.",When a Stranger Calls

However, people who want a ""smart"" thriller won't want to answer this phone",6,4 February 2006,"Today, February 4th, is my birthday. So, in celebration, my mother and I saw the re-make of ""When a Stranger Calls."" I had already seen the original. I really wanted to see it because it was number 28 on the ""100 Scariest Movie Moments"" and the phrase: ""Have you checked the children yet?"" was an inside joke between my online friend and I.But, it got 25 out of 100 on metacritic.com and 0 out of 5 stars on ign.com. So, that lessened my hopes. But, I was still ready for something entertaining.This re-make was way different then the original ""When a Stranger Calls."" This is good because I didn't want anything similar to the pointless 1998 ""Psycho"" re-make. This way, people who have seen the original won't be disappointed because they have already seen the same thing.The first scene in the original is what made it so famous. Jill Johnson receives numerous calls from a stranger asking ""Have you checked the children yet?"" Wes Craven copied this part for ""Scream.""Then, it becomes a chase movie. I enjoyed the chase scenes, even if they were never as creepy as the beginning. But, nobody else seemed to enjoy them. So, the director of this version decided to make the ""Have you checked the children yet?"" scene into the entire movie.Jill Johnson in this version of ""When a Stranger Calls"" seems to be one of the shallow, undeveloped characters that stars in numerous chick flicks. All her friends are at some high school party. When the movie finally takes off, it slowly builds up with creepy music and sounds probably unavailable in 1979. She baby-sits in a larger house than the original that is equipped with a security system. Soon, she starts receiving calls that are say nothing at all, until later in the film.I believe this film is a major improvement to the original. It seems to be more atmospheric and tense. The story takes some shocking twists and turns. There are moments when the audience will jump.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR BOTH ORIGINAL AND RE-MAKE)Another good point was that the killers motive was revealed...well kind of. We learn a bit of history about him due to the voice-overs of the news crew. The original supplied no motive at all.(END OF SPOILERS)When we finally get to the famous twist in the movie, it becomes really thrilling and scary. I do believe it becomes a chase movie, but a great chase movie.If you remember, earlier in the review, I referenced ""Scream."" Well, despite the telephone scenes, this film reminded me a lot of ""Scream."" Why? The shallow, stupid and undeveloped teenage characters. I think the entire part where Jill runs to the Guest House was only meant to create another shock. If there is a killer out there, you don't go outside! I think that there was also something wrong with the Security System.Well, ""When a Stranger Calls"" may only be good for a couple thrills and scares, but you will have a great time with those scares and thrills. My mother complained that we didn't watch a chick flick instead, and that her heart was still pounding. Many of the scares are just a jump-out-and-say-""Boo!"" kind of scares, but they are very effective.Get a couple friends and travel to the theaters at night to watch ""When a Stranger Calls."" It may only be good for a good scare, just like some movies are only good for comedy, but it is a really good scare. It might not be a ""smart"" horror film, but there are certainly comedies that aren't too ""smart"" either. (And some of them are pretty popular.) Perhaps I liked it because I expected worse.Good: Scary, shocking, plenty of twists, tense, cool house, much different then the original Bad: Shallow, stupid and undeveloped characters.

Well the main problem, is the story. The original covered this entire story in 20 minutes. This stretches it out over 90 minutes, which means for long periods nothing happens. And I mean nothing!! As an alleged 'horror movie', it simply is not scary, and that is unforgivable! When a supporting character shows up for no reason in particular, you may as well stamp 'victim' on her forehead!! The actors try their best, but it's a story that can't sustain itself, specially when the big plot twist, which I think everyone saw coming after 5 minutes anyway, was giving away in the trailer!!

I'm not a major fan of the original but that was at least a decent film. I was looking for something good in this film as well but i guess i was wrong. Even when some remakes get bad ratings, i'm always up for this a chance, but you know, once again, it proves that original stands strong, the remakes falls flat but i mean this one really falls flat on the ground, with a phone shoved up it's ass.The story is still the same with a girl being harassed by an anonymous phone caller who later comes in for the kill. I don't want to be hasty and say it was all bad, i mean it sucked hard but I will say i liked three things. The music in this film is very promising and it sets a very dark and gloomy tone for the film. I meant the setting for the house. There was no gore and hardly any blood at all in which i like for a horror film and i was very surprised with this remake having done that. So cheers to them on that one. Lastly, i think the killer's on screen time was good. It built up some creepiness not having him on there. No the bad stuff guys.The random scene at the start was pointless, the acting was quite poor, the fast movements to try and make it scary don't work and the constant calls by friends and stuff was irritating. The killer and the cop only calling would have been better, i mean having others call, was that supposed to be scary, no did nothing for me. The look of the house was stupid, once again some horror films have to always use the bloody camp setting. The original house was much more frighting. One thing i hate that they didn't have was the whole 15 years later or so like the original, no instead here, we have kill, next day kill. The other thing that annoyed me a lot was the pointless 20-30 minutes of the girl walking around the house, picking up the phone, going through the fridge, whatever. Really pointless.Overall this recent remake that i have watched brings nothing new to the table of horror and it really lacks depth, creativity and most of all scares. If people thought this was suspenseful, they are silly cause I see the issues this film is having.

95,tex-42,Don't pick up the phone,5,3 June 2007,"When a Stranger Calls is essentially a remake of the first 20 or so minutes of the 1979 film. Where that film only used the premise of ""the calls are coming from inside the house"" for only the first quarter of the film, that is all this film is.The plot is paper thin. Jill has exceeded her minutes on her cell phone, so her father has arranged for her to babysit in order to pay off the bill. While she babysits, she begins to receive phone calls that are both annoying and creepy. The caller seems to be watching Jill, and she becomes more and more frightened. She then calls the police, but they remain ridiculously inept telling her they cannot do anything until she is directly threatened, but they will trace the calls for her. Eventually she gets the infamous phone call from the police that the calls are coming from inside the house, and she must flee immediately.The house is appropriately arty looking, mysterious and isolated. There are the typical false scares before the real ones begin. There is also a sub-plot involving a cheating boyfriend of Jill's and an apologetic friend, but they really have very little to do with the movie.While this movie is not bad, do not watch it expecting a classic. There are some nice tense moments and some real scares, but, as with a lot of horror movies, the plot tends to fall apart when logic is applied. So while this is worth a watch, wait for it to come on television, so you won't have to pay anything for it.",When a Stranger Calls
96,rcavellero,By the numbers with a scream,8,3 February 2006,"The first 20 minutes of the classic 70's shocker When a stranger calls was among the most terrifying ever filmed. But the film quickly fell into putrid nonsense only to pick up some slight fear factor once again in the last ten minutes. The sequel follow in it's predecessor's footsteps it had a killer beginning and than just became a bore afterwards only to end with a bang. So it's safe to say that my expectations weren't very high add that to the fact that Simon West director of the horrid Lara Croft: Tomb Raider was in charge and I pretty much gave up. However, I'm happy to report I was wrong. This new version of ""stranger"" manages to elaborate on the originals fear. Sure it's not the best movie and it's chock full of standard horror clichés and sound effects but the film certainly delivers. From the moment it horrifyingly begins when a babysitter and her children are brutally murdered next to a carnival it mounts the dread. We than meet Jill Johnson played confidantly by beautiful Camilla Belle. She has just broken up with her boyfriend for kissing her best friend and is grounded because she went way over the minutes on her cell phone. Her punishment is simple to babysit in the middle of nowhere so that she can begin to make some money to pay off the cell phone bill. It starts out scary enough as she circles the huge stylish house and than the phone calls begin asking her if she's checked the children. At first she takes it light hearted enough assuming it's a prank. But than the terror begins to escalate with strange sounds, unexpected visits and more phone calls leading up to a terrifying revelation and some standard issue thriller cat and mouse chasing. Now although not totally successful in it's effect the film cleverly takes the originals terrifying 20 minutes and stretches them out for an hour and 23 minutes. It's short , sweet and terrifying. The film doesn't offer anything new to witness but it offers the standard with zest and confidance and the standard horror house clichés work so well when executed properly.

97,RCWjr,Middle of the road at best,5,15 June 2006,"This is middle of the road fare. More like a network movie of the week than one which had a theatrical run. The acting is sub par, not that one would expect major thespians here. But you like to have a little something to believe in and it just isn't here. Our teen in distress is more worried about her best friend putting the move on her boyfriend than the kids she is in charge of. She violates every babysitting code of conduct possible, of course to help move along the plot, but it is done so to the harm of the movie.I will say one thing for the film, it does try hard to earn its PG13 rating. There is minimal gore and cussing, which is commendable. But the film just doesn't make you care one bit about anyone in it, to include our babysitter. The immediate use of ""scary"" music from minute one doesn't build any kind of suspense. When things do get scary, or try to anyway, you are so accustomed to the cheap scare tactics that it doesn't cause you to feel any fear.DVD rental at best, for the 13yr old bunking party. Otherwise, if you are looking for more of a real scare, buy/rent the original Halloween, a film this one TRIES to emulate but misses big time.",When a Stranger Calls
98,jaddison383,Actually Good,7,22 December 2006,"I don't understand you people. What exactly did you find so ""absolutely horrible"" about this movie. There has been hardly any good commentors at all. I watched the film and thoroughly enjoyed it, though I will admit it was slow at first. But, it had real jumps, real edge-of-your-seat moments, and was fun to watch.But, then again, I know why none of the commentors are liking it- every single one of them is probably a high school age kid, and at that age, the only acceptable kind of horror film is the kind where you have to not eat for fear of being sick for two days afterward. Blood and guts spewing, evil demons running amuck and destroying pretty actor's appearances. That is what a horror movie should be, right? Wrong. In my opinion, this film exemplifies exactly what a horror film should be: fun to watch. And this movie definitely was. It had the entire audience in my theater screaming and gasping together. EVERYONE WAS ENJOYING THEMSELVES- rather than getting sick to their stomach. And that is how a horror film should be- enjoyable. Like I said, if you're looking for blood, guts, and stomach sickness, this film's not your best bet. If you want to have a good time watch a movie that will make you jump, then grab this one right away. 7/10 Stars...Jay Addison",When a Stranger Calls

Tired out scare-free PG-13 remake,1,4 February 2006,"1/2* Camilla Belle, Tomy Flanagan, Tessa Thompson, Brian Geraghty, Clark Gregg, David Denman, Derek De Lint. Directed by Simon West Another terrible PG-13 remake of an 80's classic of near it like last year's ""The Fog"". Hollywood again makes a mockery of the great scary (gasp) horror genre with this travesty of a movie. ""When a Stranger Calls"" replays the same scenario over and over and still tries to make it seem new but tires itself out with disorganized direction by Simon West.Teenage girl Jill Johnson (Belle) forced to babysit to pay for her cellphone bill. While on the job she receives numerous scary (?) phone calls from a stranger. The movie to sum it up involves Jill inspecting each room for an hour every time she hears something go BUMP and finally some near-minded action for 10 minutes at the end. But is nowhere near close enough to support this movie emotionally and physically. West tried, maybe, to give the actors a reason to try but fails miserably and drowns the movie in a pitiful display of un-scary situations. My final rating 1/10.",When a Stranger Calls
100,SeminolePhenom,A long boring conversation...,4,18 March 2006,"Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is a high school student who has just recently broke up with her boyfriend and in an attempt to pay back her parents for cell phone bills, must watch over a doctor's kids in his gigantic house. While keeping herself entertained as the kids sleep, she is greeted with a phone call from a stranger who won't stop calling. What she finds out next is a bigger surprise- the stranger is calling from inside the house.This is another horror remake and not a very entertaining one at that. The movie dragged along with the phone tag and then just spat out action all at once in an UN-impressive fashion. It was extremely UN-realistic just as you might expect. Jill Johnson is wonder woman compared to the serial killer who has killed a huge amount of young girls with his bare hands! All of this could have been predicted and the film did not surprise me in any way other than wonderful cinematography. I could never have imagined that such a film as this could ever have great cinematography but it did. But things like that don't make a movie! There needs to be a lot more. Overall, the film was just another disappointing teenager horror film and their will be more like it because teenagers love to see crappy PG-13 films. When will it end?

102,cdelacroix1,"BEST Scary Movie in a Long, Long Time",9,5 February 2006,"I saw this movie yesterday and walked out of the theater with my heart beating a mile a minute. To me, this is the *best* scary movie in a long, long time. I was thinking about what made it such a good movie from my angle and I think honestly it's a combination of several things that made the movie both scary and maintained my interest and engagement from the first through the last moment.First, the visuals were splendid, lush, full of fine contrasts of the kind that make a really good scary movie really, really scary. The contrasts in what we are seeing start from the opening sequence (which was excellent) and continue relentlessly throughout the movie. I won't go into detail, don't want to give anything away. But there was almost no scene at all that wasn't simply full of rich, interesting imagery and simultaneously full of disturbing contrasts between the normal, the mundane, the comfortable, and the abnormal, the threatening, the discomforting. The music and sound effects were wonderful. The score was rich and evocative throughout. You know, I just can't think of the last time we had such a prominent musical scoring in a movie. A really rich musical composition that moves with the scenes and helps to heighten the contrasts throughout is so unusual, isn't it? Yet it didn't overwhelm the story at all, but supported it every step of the way. I thought it was great.The plotting and pacework were to me simply perfect. Again, contrasts were the core of the whole sweeping movement of story from start to finish. The plot twisted this way and that with an emotional deftness that led me to feel first safe and then unsafe and then safe and then unsafe again and again and again. The dominant feelings conveyed throughout were fear and anxiety, in classic fright flick style. Yet the storyline provided just enough relief here and there to allow a slight drop in anxiety to be pushed to the brink once again within seconds. And with an even, dangerous, progressive pace that was just to me simply perfect. One of the tension-heighteners embedded in the story line is the style of misdirection and indirection and redirection that conveyed so vivid a sense of threat and fear without direct depiction. Maybe this reflects the influence of the ""Japanese"" style in horror flicks. You know, I wonder if there was any blood in this movie at all? Almost none. And yet the suggestiveness of bloodshed throughout is tremendously effective, or it was for me, anyway. Starting with the initial sequence ... providing a very effective setting for what is to come.The acting and characterizations were crisp and served the story well. Starting with the initial sequence, in which we experience the horror of the bloody scene not from any direct visuals of the scene, but from the conversation among the law enforcement personnel, and the cop's facial reaction to what he sees.Camilla Belle's Jill takes up this method of indirectly prompting feelings in the audience and she does a truly spot-on performance. She plays an attractive teen and provides the traditional American side sense of teen sexuality in contemporary scary movies that does (in some sense) heighten the tension, but she doesn't overplay this feature at all. And fortunately (from my angle) there was a complete absence of the ""campy"" that is so popular in scary flicks these days. We have just enough depiction of teen ""issues"" to provide a sense of realism without dwelling on what can (in so many contemporary scary flicks) overwhelm the ""scariness"" at all. Instead, Belle acts out the contrasts of the movie and plot line in a very believable, very un-ironic manner, to engender within us the fear and anxiety of this movie are (simply) perfect as far as I can see. We see her face reacting to everything; and we are led to react with her to everything.Step by step the unseen, the inchoate fear associated with the telephone becomes concrete and real and yet this transition is made so deftly that the horrible fear to me stays intense and the threat is heightened rather than dissipated as we see the face of the Killer in the penultimate sequence.OK I won't say anymore, I don't want to give anything away because the overall story needs to be experienced just as it unfolds ...If you haven't seen it .... and like really scary movies ... hey check this out, I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end ...!",When a Stranger Calls
103,Movieguy_blogs_com,I thought this was a bad rip off of the original 'Halloween' without the cool music.,4,21 February 2006,"In 'When a Stranger Calls' Camilla Belle plays Jill Johnson, a high school student recently grounded for her misuse of her cell phone. In order to pay off the bill she has to do some babysitting. So instead of going to the big school bonfire, she has to baby sit for Dr. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint). Ironically, she gets harassed over the phone from some stranger, what could he possibly want? I thought this was a bad rip off of the original 'Halloween' without the cool music. Babysitter being staked by some crazed killer. There is no one around to help while she finds dead bodies lying around the house. I believe this is a remake of the 1979 'When a Stranger Calls', but I hope the original was better.To its credit, it did have some suspense. But it is very predictable and not very believable.

104,sinncross,Babysitting like you've never seen it...,6,26 July 2006,"One of my favourite genres of the cinematic text is horror. However, I am yet to cross a horror, which is can qualify as being scary. The best effort, was The Grudge, which honestly freaked me out, but scary? Not a chance. So when hearing about When a Stranger Calls, and watching its trailer, which gives most of the movie away, I decided to give it a look, and the end result was something that was not scary, or even freaky, but it was a good attempt nonetheless. The story for When a Stranger Calls sounds interesting, yet lame all at the same time. A good-looking teenage girl (aren't they all), Jill Johnson, suffers from the normal problems facing all teens: boyfriend troubles, friend issues, overuse of her cell phone, and prank calls? While on a routine babysitting job, Jill becomes the target of a prank caller, who only appears to breathe on the line. Coupled with a grand, yet dark house, Jill starts to become nervous. This is, when everything begins to spiral, and the prank calls becomes more then just a joke.The strongest aspect of When a Stranger Calls is definitely the build of tension the movie generates. Throughout the film you begin feeling uneasy, which helps relate you to Jill's current situation. The mixture of some good music, dark lighting, and camera work, is well portrayed, that is of course, until towards the end, where everything becomes somewhat shallow. All the generated tension leads to a half-developed scare scene, which is a big let down. I was really expecting more of the killer, who appears to be rather useless in his scheme of work.Surprisingly, acting is very decent from all characters. Granted, acting like a teenager can't be hard for teenagers, but credit must be given to Camilla Belle, who acts, for the most part, quite well. While not entirely convincing, she does the scare scenes pretty well. This is a welcome addition, as virtually all the teen horrors that Hollywood churns out, involve actresses who just never look scared. However, when Belle is expected to be at her most scared, she doesn't quite deliver, but luckily that particular scene doesn't last long for the viewer to really notice. There is one scene which sticks out as a sore thumb, as it's the only scene which involved, quite literally, corny dialogue. Also, there are one or two inconsistencies, but they never detract from the overall flow of the story.When a Stranger Calls changes the horror teen genre to a degree, yet its nothing amazingly special. The absence of blood and gore is a strange deletion, yet goes to show that such effects are not needed to make a nerve racking film. While the film does an excellent task in building upon tension, it tends to do nothing about it, except letting it all go for nothing. Still, the ending is clever in all respects and is a redeemable quality. This all goes to show that When a Stranger Calls is definitely one of the better teen horror films around. While Jill will still be wandering why she ever went to the house, you will definitely not have any negative feelings, on going to the cinema, to catch this one.",When a Stranger Calls
105,zombiefan89,I loved this movie! It helps me sleep at night.,3,24 November 2009,"The one thing I liked most about this movie was the music. That somber little tune they played over and over. Something about it reminded me of Resident Evil. The character Jill(same first name as a Resident Evil character!) seemed very realistic,though not very bright. Here's why: First time the alarm went off,and she brushed it off as the ""I think the maid set off the alarm."" Did anyone see the maid after this happened? No. If that really happened,Rosa should've been by the alarm control waiting for Jill or trying to shut it off herself or going to where Jill is and apologizing for tripping it. Next,the garage door was open right after the alarm went off. That's probably how the psycho got in. Then,the psycho calls from her best friend's cell phone who just left the house. That screams,""I just killed your friend and took her cell phone!"" Next scene,the psycho calls and asks,""Have you checked the children?"" She checks on them,then returns. The psycho calls back,and then asks,""How were the children?"" Now this part actually made me laugh. She assumes he can see her because of those questions,but he didn't have to know she went upstairs to ask that second question,the odds are even a neglectful baby sitter like her will check on the children if someone asks. All he had to do was wait ten minutes and call back. Now if he said,""That pink shirt looks really good on you."" THAT would mean he could see her! (Side note:Was that REALLY the first time she checked on the children all night??)Now here's where she gets really stupid. A reasonable intelligent person would've put all the pieces together by now. 1)The alarm mysteriously goes off. 2)The garage door was left open. 3)The maid is not there,but her keys and purse were still in the house. 4)The psycho calls her from her friend's cell phone.Next scene she sees someone in the guest house and(Oh,my God!) she goes out to take a look!! Before,she was afraid to go in the kitchen,where the heck did he find the courage to go outside to the guest house?? I would've kept watching the guest house from the window,if the psycho was really in there he was bound to come out eventually.Next scene,this is where it actually goes from being a cheap suspense movie to a horror movie. She's back in the house. At this point,She should have realized he's been leading her around. Each of the actions the psycho has taken were to lead her to a certain place;turning on the light in the guest house,walking in front of the window,leaving the shower on in the bathroom. He wanted her to find her friend's body. Also,he's been listening in on everyone of her phone calls. This becomes really obvious when he shuts off the power right after the line,""The phone call is coming from inside the house!!"" (Side note:How do you tell if a call is coming from inside a house,and not right outside of it?)",When a Stranger Calls
106,TerminalMadness,"A safe dumb film, for safe dumb audiences...",1,17 May 2006,"Do you know how your little brother or cousin would always pop out from a corner with a mask and yell ""boo!"" and then you'd be scared. And then amused, he'd continue doing so. Again, and again, and again, until you started to get angry. But he continued doing it until you tore the mask off and kicked him in the nuts? Well, that's what my experience was like with Simon West's remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"". Now, I haven't seen the original film just yet, but I imagine it won't make me want to kick the director in the nuts. Imagine this: I took a camera and filmed myself around the house. You would see me drinking water, taking a dump, cleaning my ears, walking around the hallway I know you're saying ""That's stupid, I'd never see that"". Well, then you may want to stay away from this.West's idea of telling a story is doing just that. You can literally feel the writer sweating looking for ways to stretch the story, while he has the character doing literally nothing but walking around the house for a whole hour. And that's not an exaggeration either. West's storytelling abilities are centered on having the main character walking around the huge house she's supposed to be in for literally the entire film. Save for some loud bumps, thumps, creaks, and slamming of doors. Ooh, scary, scary! There's even one scene where a black cat bursts from a closet with a humongous thunderous thump, and a water fall goes off that has the sound of a truck backfiring. Can someone tell me how this is scary? Who thought West including these tired devices would be a good idea? At one point there's a loud bang going off beside her, and she opens the refrigerator and ice is conveniently falling on to the tray. Audiences can not be stupid enough to find this scary. Everything from the fire place to a remote makes a very loud noise just so West can make us jump and help us forget that the movie just isn't scary And the funny aspect of ""Stranger"" is that the main character Jill never really acts like a teenager. If I were her, as soon as the calls would start I'd immediately let loose like Lenny Bruce after stubbing a toe. But no, she begins with ""You jerk! Stop calling me! You're such a meanie!"" That last one was false, but I bet someone suggested that at some point. But the lame-brained script relies on a series of plot holes, lapses in logic, and ridiculous plot devices all of which pile up to this heap of crap. For no reason we learn of another babysitter who was stalked and killed before the film through phone calls, for no reason we learn there's a circus near the house, for no reason we learn she's a runner. Neither of these plot points ever comes into play during the film.Jill's father says he doesn't want her working so far, yet he doesn't mind her taking a job so far away in the middle of nowhere. Jill baby sits instead of doing chores or getting a summer job? She baby sits when it's stated that the kids in the house have a nanny? How did the killer know the parents would have a babysitter? Wouldn't rich people naturally have a digital phone line which would mean better reception even during a storm?! Why would anyone buy a house with so many windows? Beyond that though, Belle's acting is brutally stiff. Hey Camilla you've grown in to quite a scrumptious girl, but try some acting lessons next time. Belle is incredibly unconvincing as the heroine Jill giving a very wooden and over the top performance. But much of that suffers because the character of Jill is such a moron. She commits all the wrong moves, and basically deserves what she gets after ninety minutes of her doing nothing but running around and crying. West tops off this crap-o-rama with one of the most brain dead endings I've seen in a while that clues us to an inevitable sequel. West should be stopped.I don't want to ruin it for you, butthe calls are coming from inside the house. I'm an asshole, right? I bet that Carol Kane version is not looking so bad now, eh? While it's true that the original version may not have been a masterpiece, I would gladly place thirty dollars to bet that it was much better than this piece of dog crap. Basically, when all is said and done, it's a safe dumb film for safe dumb audiences.",When a Stranger Calls
107,cmovies-99674,"When you get a movie with a great idea matched with bad execution, you get a confusing review",5,18 September 2017,"PROS: The best part about the movie would, hands down, be how scary it is. You really get taken aback by how frightening of an event this would be if it happened to you. The direct flawlessly sets up for a movie filled with paranoia and fear. From beginning to end you were delivered a film that grabs you and makes your skin crawl. Another thing that I really liked would have to be the character development. Although the acting wasn't super good, the way the main character was portrayed was nice. She was smart, and alert, and very capable which I like.CONS: The biggest thing to point out would be the acting. This movie gave off a very teen scream vibe, which isn't always bad, but it didn't work for this movie in particular. There was times where I felt the 911 operator was more realistic than the girl. The final thing that was really irksome was the ending. This ending did a crap job at everything an ending should do good at. It didn't clarify anything, it didn't leave me guessing or asking questions, and it certainly didn't have any relevance to the plot or story AT ALL. The whole premise of the ending was lacking and it certainly didn't help me develop the movie.www.chorror.com",When a Stranger Calls
108,Phantasm01,Slightly better the original...though thats not saying much,6,26 June 2006,"When A Stranger Calls got a bit of a critical bashing when it was released back in February. I guess it was to be expected since most critics are a little hard on the horror genre in general but I was a bit surprised by the bashing it got from regular movie goers like you and I. It has a rather low 4.2 rating at IMDb and if you go to the message board on the site for this film the comments aren't too pretty. Despite this bashing it didn't stop the film from opening at number one and grossing almost 50 million dollars.I may be the minority, but I really think that most people were wrong about this one. It is by no means a perfect film but as a remake to an already flawed production i think it succeeds by being better than the original. Again I may be in the minority on that statement but after watching the original film the night before I saw this, I had a fresh perspective.The original When A Stranger Calls was released in 1979 ( a year after the superior Halloween) and was a moderate success based on its heart pounding opening 20 minutes. We've all heard the babysitter alone in the house while a madman calls her from inside the house urban legend and the film's opening toyed with our knowledge of this and did a good job of generating tension.The problem with the original is that once the 20 minute opening has passed, the film slows to a snail's pace. The middle of the film doesn't provide any thrills and you have to wait until the last 10 minutes for things to pick up again. If there was any film that needed to be plucked out of the remake box it was this film.The new version takes the opening 20 minutes and turns it into a 90 minute motion picture. This does present some problems because things get tedious after awhile but the best moments of the original translate well here and I for one thought it was a decent improvement.A babysitter, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), arrives at the lakeside Colorado home of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant), to care for their two children while they do the ""dinner and a movie"" thing. Almost immediately, Jill begins to get ominous prank calls: heavy breathing and messages wondering if she has checked the children. Eventually, freaked out and unable to reach anyone by phone (her parents are at a concert and everyone from her high school is attending a bonfire party in a location that conveniently does not have cell service), she contacts the police. They trace the call and determine it's coming from within the house.This is a set-up that I don't think can get old. Both guys and girls know what it's like to be in the house alone sometimes and get suitably creeped out by every noise, creek, and motion of our home. the film toys with those fears but generating some decent tension early on. Some might get bored by the numerous scenes of Jill just walking around the house but I for one found them necessary to lead up the slam-bang final 20 minutes. It does get a little repetitive after awhile but for the most part it works.The house is also a character in and of itself. Glass houses tend to be creepy to me in general but since this home is in the middle of nowhere and is grand in stature, it tends to be even more frightening. The production designer should be proud of this creation because it's truly something.The final 20 minutes are also noteworthy. After all the build up we're rewarded with a nice game of cat and mouse between the Stranger and Jill. It helps that we see very little of him since he's mostly shown in shadow, thus making him truly more creepy. You can tell the original concept of Michael Myers from the first Halloween is a model for this stalker and if you're going to imitate someone, it might as well be the best of the bunch.The film truly falters on one major level and it's enough for me to bring the grade down to something just slightly above average. The performance of Camille Belle really drags the film down. I haven't seen her other films but she seems out of place here. Her interpretation of Jill is too juvenile and she cannot carry the film on her little shoulders. She seemed amateur throughout most of the film. She redeems herself a bit during the final 20 minutes but by that point it's too late to truly save her performance. Since we're left alone with her for much of the running time she has to win our sympathy and she doesn't. I got into the film merely because i kept wondering what i would do in that situation and not because I particularly cared about her.Despite this When A Stranger Calls is suitable entertainment. It's not the new horror de jour and it certainly won't go down as a classic by any means but it is better than the source material and for that reason alone I think you should give this film a bit of a chance before you dismiss it.",When a Stranger Calls
109,DogFilmCritic,Underrated Film,7,4 March 2015,"First time i saw it i really liked it felt it was well done, it has they key elements of a psychological-thriller.Suspense, tension, raising of stakes for the protagonist,as the story progresses the tension in the character rises you clearly see it when Jill enters the house everything is OK but as night falls she gets constantly taunted by the stranger as he calls her playing mind games on her, making her more uncomfortable in her surroundings as she starts to feel more insecure, besides the kids she is watching over she is alone in the house and paranoia starts rising,to me in this movie it works perfectly its focused in her reactions towards being alone and vulnerable and more important we are interested in what is going to happen, to me is one of those films that one sees more enjoyable when home alone.Camilla Belle gives a believable performance as she has to carry out most of the story by herself,i was very impressed by her acting in this film.",When a Stranger Calls
110,andell,"A Dark House and Sharp, Harrowing Music only go so far",1,5 February 2006,"The concept of experience, and how it works for and against us is something of a misnomer. By logic, having the foresight to see how a course of action works, we are able to improve upon the decision making which led up to it, ultimately culminating in a better decision.Or at least, that is the way these types of things are supposed to work. Indeed, in the realm of theater and movies, that concept has never functioned on a consistent basis to produce better movies that work in more effective ways. The next example of this is 2006's ""When a Stranger Calls,"" which itself is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name that, according to the IMDb page, was originally planned to be a sequel to Black Christmas.Like the original, we meet a young woman (the very lovely Camilla Belle) who will be babysitting the children of the wealthy Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (the same names used for the parents of the 1979 original) whilst they are away to dinner and a movie. And like the original, throughout the course of the night, the young babysitter is bombarded with phone calls from a malevolent stranger who is planning to do more than just scare her over the course of this evening.Unlike the original however, this film is loaded in back story. Take the first scenes as an example of how this back story functions differently. In the original, we start with the baby sitter arriving at the Mandrakis' home; in this remake we start with an allegedly grisly multiple murder apparently perpetrated by the same man trying to do the baby sitter harm. The creators of the film may have included it in the hope of creating a more dynamic story, but in fact this works against the film.In the original, for instance, we get the sense that this very disturbed individual (with a creepy, spastic English accent that seems to make your skin crawl with its perversity) has in fact been stalking this girl. Without the back story, it makes sense that the intruder knows that the girl was in the house alone, that her calls didn't alert the police of the impending doom, and so on. The absence of the back story asks the viewer to fill in the gaps.In this remake however, the presence of the back story makes no sense. In the conversation with Mrs. Mandrakis, we learn that Jill was retained at the last minute (""we were so thrilled to find a babysitter at the last minute,"" or something to that effect), albeit while we are marveling at this isolated house. So, why is the psycho stalking Jill? How did he come to know that she was babysitting? How did he gain access to a secured house (no doubt ADT would happily dis-spell the absurd failings of this beautiful home's security system if one were interested enough to call them and ask), the phone number, the son's phone number (the son who doesn't always live in the guest house), and knock off the housekeeper without being spotted? Is it silly to ask this question? Well then, how about the other questions- how is it that Jill's best friend gets through the main gate when it would seem logical that the Mandrakis' would've shut the gate when they left? In the age of voice mail, why is Jill answering the phone at all? In the opening scene, when the policeman says there wasn't a murder weapon, then what was used to kill the woman and her child(ren)? I mean, lets consider this logically- if someone used their bare hands, then there is still a murder weapon, right? So much of this movie depends on the viewer to ignore the contradictions and the nonsense and focus merely on atmosphere, sound and the dialogue between the killer and Jill- however this only works so far. The opening scene, where a detective opens the door and looks horrified while piercing music works so poorly that no one in the theater could even understand how to feel when I was watching the film. Less than ten seconds later, he's still visibly shaken whilst the coroners cart out the body bags- by mere logical presumption the only thing he could've been looking at were body bags from the doorway of the room. Perhaps terrifying for a private citizen, but for a detective whose job it is to track down killers? C'mon.Everyone in this film is cute except the killer, and whilst I originally thought that this was a curious coincidence, later I began to ponder the message. This film is not intended for adult audiences- its cast and its very slight levels of violence seem to indicate its meant much more for a young teen audience. And this is exactly what teens these days need: a movie sending the message that the beautiful people are always good and wholesome, and the not so beautiful people are evil psychos.In the course of writing this review, I have even rethought the score and reduced it sharply. If you're looking for scares, may I suggest renting the original, or better yet, rent ""Black Christmas""- a film much better than either the original or the remake.",When a Stranger Calls
111,walken_on_sunshine,When A Stranger Calls (2006):The Doc's Review,7,29 November 2006,"First and foremost i must say it is absolutely unfair to judge a remake on originality considering it is in fact a REMAKE however many overly critical critics don't take that into consideration well The Doc does.When A Stranger Calls succeeds as a horror film for one major reason...atmosphere.No it is not packed with jump scares or an everyday gore fest,it is psychological horror at it's finest.People will claim that last statement is absurd but allow me to explain how When A Stranger Calls is great psychological horror.Like i said this movie is all about atmosphere the eerie music,the dark visuals,the big house,the misty windows it really makes you feel uneasy and creeped out.The way the film is written is very clichéd and very tame for horror but the way it is acted out and portrayed on screen is magnificent.This is one of those horror films where you imagine yourself in the situation that the victim is in.Almost everyone has babysat at one point or another or been home alone so this is a very realistic situation.Also contributing to the realism is the fact that what's pursuing this victim isn't a ghost,goblin,or ghoul but another human being.A sixteen year old girl is alone in an enormous house being called every fifteen minutes by a perverted killer the very idea is disturbing.A remake's purpose is to take an old story and retell it in a way that appeals to a new generation or audience.When A Stranger Calls successfully does that and it also succeeds due to it's psychological way of making you feel like this could all happened to you.Overall this was a pleasant surprise.",When a Stranger Calls
112,henrymadman,Original was better,7,18 July 2007,"Not bad but not enough suspense like what the original gave. Apart from that though it isn't really that bad. It has the same story line as the original but the thing I can't get my head around is the fact the after the 1979 one why wasn't there a sequel? You would think that it would because Halloween had sequels, Friday the 13th had sequels and almost every classic horror has a sequel, so why not this one? There was a bit that reminded me of ""Black Christmas"" the fact that the killer was phoning the babysitter and soon the police phones up and say "" Jill we traced the call and it is coming from inside the house..."" also the original does that too.7/10",When a Stranger Calls

We know when a house has been built around a nature conservatory in its center, one complete with automatic monsoon and a mixture of multi climate species, there just has to be a decent security system. Well maybe. I stress the astounding house because it's probably the most entertaining part of the film for me. It's not a terrible horror film. It's right in line with the original 70's production except less 70's. Less funny too. Watch it with low expectations and no disappointments. Better still in my opinion watch the original follow-up to the original- ""when a stranger calls back"" if you really want nightmares and some truly original creepiness. There's a few scenes in that 1980-something ""part 2"" that are terrific and the acting by the lead understated yes but far superior if we're supposed to care about what happens to her anyway.",When a Stranger Calls

I told my wife she's not a teenager and she shouldn't artificially adjust her attention span. It think this movie really had potential because the bad guy was done well, it's just that everything else was not. Tiffany should have been found dead sooner, and the other people as well.

I am sorry but I thought it was good, especially for a re-make. Camilla did a sterling job as the awake and aware babysitter. She was never a victim all the way through. Venturing through dark hallways with poker at the ready. I thought she did a great job of young babysitter, in peril. And what a place gimme gimme gimme. I must admit that some of the art work would give a kiddie nightmares though. I felt that we didn't see the bodie(s)to early and the hide and go seek around the house was tense and intriguing. I, for one, can understand her venturing toward the guesthouse as she never shirked her responsibility to find saviours. A very gutsy yet frightened young woman who tried to do what was right. If I could find fault it was that ""Tiffany"" was willing to escape and leave her ""friend"" to it. Whereas I would have attempted to return to the house. (She was gonna die anyway). And the cops. When are we going to have a police force who thinks, ""Lets tackle this problem before it becomes a catastrophe."" Other than that I thought it was a good remake and worth watching.

With the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in, she locks the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she ""check the children,"" Jill panics. Fear to terror when she has the calls traced. And what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. There aren't any other lead actors in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face. The day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her.If I were in a house like the one Jill was in. I would explore everything that is around. The fridge would be the first person I would looks at, but I'm a male and I don't babysit. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house with a massive size.Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this, the lead actress needs someone with experience. I found Camilla not that good. I don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role. I do like her, she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it.This movie wasn't scary. I also found this movie more like a ""chick flick"". I think the only reason this was released during the SuperBowl Weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this. It also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys. But I did like this movie but for how it is. Girls just like tog et scared or scream.

Shes got the keys in her pocket and thats all you need.

She's irritated that she has to miss the big school bonfire party, but at least is content that the job seems easy. The setting is a lake house, and so what if it looks like the creepiest place ever? Its dark hallways and off-putting human-size sculptures are only there for decoration. The place is laden with high-tech amenities, and the kids are sick and already have gone to bed. There's even an alarm system, all the better to protect young ladies from psycho killer stalkers. All Jill has to do is wait out the night. And all we have to do is wait with her, our hearts jumping along with hers at every potential sign that she's being watched and marked for murder. Every creak of the house, every muffled disturbance from outside and, yes, every ring of the telephone brings its own series of chills. Is it Rosa the housekeeper? Or maybe the couple's college kid who might have dropped in for the weekend? Jill scours her mind for the possibilities as she fingers the fireplace poker, hoping she'll have no reason to use it. All Jill can do is wait. And wait. And wait. Director Simon West's calling cards are the explosion-a-minute ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" which means he's not exactly known as a paragon of restraint.

In turning the screw, West dispenses with the mega powered cordless drill in favor of the rusty flathead from the bottom of the toolbox. Belle, a scream queen in training for excellence, is easy to get behind, because her character is so wise and resourceful. When she sees a dark, scary closet, she doesn't go in there.

But the ""action"" was not that intense until the last 15 minutes I guess.I want to mention that I watched this film about 5 times, of whom the first time was when I was a lot younger than now.Back then, I really liked the film. It was intense for my then standards and creepy as well, because I could imagine how scary could be If I would live a similar situation. It really touched my naïve psychology.Now, being a little bit older, and of course watching it for the fifth time, I can tell for sure that it's a little bit boring. This argument is not fair, because since I've watched it so many times, I knew every detail of the film, so definitely it wouldn't surprise me.I also want to mention that this is a remake of a 1970s film that I've not watched yet, so obviously I can not compare these two films.(+) Pros*Very beautiful photography and directing.*The house was big, isolated and lost in the mist. Absolutely perfect for these type of films, although it can be some times a little bit cliché.*The protagonist was not perfect, but cute.*The reveal 20 minutes before the ending, at least the first time I watched this, was very cool and scary as well and since I haven't been watching horror films back then, it wasn't predictable to me at least.Note: By today's standards, and with all the horror films that keep releasing one after another, maybe for a person that has not watched the film, can be again predictable. I'm not sure anyways.*Although it's a remake and its plot isn't original (there is no parthenogenesis in art), I personally like these type of films. When it has to do with a stalker that suffer from psychological problems, and harrasses a girl. Very typical plot, but still, I'm into it.*I like that this story actually, with the babysitter, is an urban legend, and it is portrayed pretty good.*I liked the scene in the greenhouse. Maybe the second most intense scene in the whole film.*I personally liked the fact that there wasn't so much talking. I mean, of course there is talking, but I enjoyed more the silent scenes. It gave an alternative creepy tone.(-) Cons*I would prefer to not see the face of the killer.*I think that the part with protagonist's friend was a little bit unnecessary. I know that there was a background, but the conclusion was not important I think. I feel that they just wanted to put something extra. This is not neccessarily bad, but I was kinda thinking of it. I do not consider it bad, technically.*In the beginning the flow of the plot was very slow, and I had in my mind that ""It builds tension"". In reality, the tension would come and go.*There were a lot of jump scares that made on purpose. They were very cliché. The one with fire, the one with music, the one with mannequin... they were very basic jump scares, that they felt that they had to put them into the film, so it could be labelled ""horror"" by force. Basically, there wasn't creativity...*Conclusion*To be honest, it's not a bad film, and I feel that it is very misunderstood. I think that my rating and my review are basically of my thoughts now. Good or not, I've watched it a lot of times, like I cited, so there wasn't surprise to me. If I would watch today the film for the first time, it could get a 7/10.

The cinematography follows ""suspense 101"" by creating a tapestry of shadows and gloom. It's not terribly original, but it works.Also, the casting isn't entirely off-center. Camilla Belle (from The Ballad of Jack and Rose and The Chumscrubber) has credentials to show that she has some talent lurking within, although here it is completely wasted. Not for a single moment does she really portray any true emotions of fear, anxiety, or even mere nervousness.Of course, a terrible script helps nothing. Looking for twists? Shocks? A deeper meaning beyond the carnage? Yeah, try looking elsewhere.Oh, right, did I mention carnage? There's not a whole lot of that, either. In fact, there's not a whole lot of anything.Still, the single worst element about this dull remake is the choice of director: Simon West.Here is a man best known for his bombastic action films, such as the admittedly decent Con Air and the unforgettably forgettable Tomb Raider: Lara Croft.Too bad action and suspense are two very different concepts. Though it is technically possible to have subtlety in an action film, usually throwing a bunch of pretty colors on screen is enough to make passable fair.However, a good suspense thriller requires much more; it requires finesse, and pacing, and a use of the more invisible properties of film.Mr. West of course knows nothing of this, and his clunky, dead directing erases any sense of immediacy or threat. Mood and atmosphere dissolve into nothingness as tension becomes tedium.This, mixed with wooden performances by nearly all the major players, leads to a suspense thriller without (you guessed it) suspense or thrills.I beg you, please don't see this movie. The lack of ambition behind every element of this production is staggering. Passionless and mechanical as a whole, even the trailer holds the majority of the narrative within a short, two minute time span.Sadly the more money a film like this earns the more encouragement the producers find, accepting lower and lower standards of quality as they continually shove their C-grade ""horror"" down our throats.If you don't believe me, just wait until March when The Hills Have Eyes comes out. Of course, anything would be a step up considering how low the bar has now been set.Remember, When a Stranger Calls, don't pick-up.Critic's Conclusion: This is a bad, bad movie that is best forgotten. Nothing else witty or clever to say, just avoid this film. Save your money, your time, and those oh so precious brain cells that can be burnt in many other, infinitely more interesting ways.",When a Stranger Calls
142,samtko-04675,Suffers from the same issues as the original,5,25 November 2019,"Remember the opening 20 minutes of When a Stranger Calls? Remember how haunting it is, well the remake decided to make that the entire premise, seems like a amazing idea since the middle of the original drags, so why am I giving it a 5, because this film also suffers from dragging, the opening is decent, the setup is good and we settle in for an hour of what we hope is nail biting suspense that could be akin to a reverse Disturbia type film, instead the film pedals along without much to do until the third act.Thankfully Camilla Belle isn't annoying even if her acting is wooden.Overall it is slightly weaker than the original but the original wasn't a high art classic either so it's not that bad",When a Stranger Calls

'nuff said.our heroine (Belle) is refreshingly intelligent and makes good decisions. she's strong and she's a fighter, unusual in this genre. she reminds me of Curtis in Halloween (another favorite). they're both measured and competent. they keep it together; they prevail.it's not torture porn and it's not a gore-fest but if you like movies that provide a moody atmosphere, good acting, and a creepy vibe from beginning to end with a few good jump scares then give this a look. it's intelligently done and it stays with you.8/10",When a Stranger Calls

I doubt that it is better than the original (that I haven't seen yet), but this new version is well for spending a short while. Jill Johnson is a punished teenager who must go to a house on a hill in which she must take care of children for a night while their parents are outside. The girl becomes bored, and while she does what she wants in the house, she begins continuously receiving calls from a mysterious man. But she doesn't know that those received calls come from inside the house. The film has bad critics, but I consider it acceptable. It has much intrigues and there are many scares. What I liked a lot of this film was its protagonist, Camilla Belle. I enjoyed a lot with her, and she is a good actress.And, if you haven't seen the original, see that one first than this.",When a Stranger Calls

147,annablair-19191,A Decent Film In Search Of A Better Star,7,30 June 2019,"The original When A Stranger Calls became known as one of the scariest movies of all time simply for it's brilliant opening 20 minutes. People forget that the rest of the film (besides an almost equally effective closing 20 minutes) is sort of a drag. A remake wasn't the worst idea in the world, especially since the original film's sequel, When A Stranger Calls Back, already improved upon the original.This remake gets a lot of things right. The location/set is stunning and not a bad place to be trapped for 90 minutes. There are all sorts of interesting hallways and staircases to get one's imagination going. The music is appropriately eerie and the sound mix does a great job of adding tension. The titular stranger is kept in the shadows for most of the film and we have no idea who he is or what his motivations are.Where the film fails is the casting of its lead. Camilla Belle is a beautiful girl, but she's dramatically limited and not terribly charming. She's certainly not interesting enough to watch by herself for 90 minutes. When the set is more interesting than your leading lady, you know you have issues. This is a shame, too, because the screenplay itself isn't terrible. It extends the original's opening sequence to the breaking point at times and has to keep everything a little bit too safe so that it can keep its PG-13 rating (for example, the children Jill is watching are never in any real jeopardy, which is kind of a downer since the urban legend it's based off of always has them falling victim to the killer), but it's a surprisingly effective little chiller.",When a Stranger Calls
148,pfogertyca,Nice House,2,4 June 2007,"That's pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle. Camilla Belle isn't much of an actress, and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller.But if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she's providing her sitting services, searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going ""bump"" in the night. As she lurks around corners and peers down hallways, we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like Roman tubs, a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving, and the piece de resistance, a self-contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self-watering system.Because the movie isn't compelling enough to draw us into Jill's fear, we're distracted by the grandeur of the house, which isn't something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller. Even as Jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we cringe because she's breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond, not because she's about to get murdered.The movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies, and the ending is anything but original. By the time it was over, I just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real. Never mind Jill and the kids she was babysitting.2 stars - both for the house.",When a Stranger Calls
149,avalonjoyous,Whatever you do HANG UP!,1,20 November 2017,"Incredibly boring the worst horror remake by far.Camilla Belle was horrible,the killer wasn't scary,not even the ""suspense"" was executed well.Absolute garbage the original movie up until the second half that is maintained this subtle creepy and unsettling momentum it was truly spine tingling and what the babysitter found was absolutely horrific and truly disturbing .Even that film failed though because it never was able to maintain the momentum of the beginning of the film and the terrifying ""twist"" implemented at one point.It didn't help that the original jolted viewers out of the suspense immediately after it happened devolving into a cop vs killer story.That movie did however have wonderful acting especially Durning and Kane as the babysitter.All that being said though even through the originals clear flaws stood out it still didn't completely destroy the film.Unlike this horrifically boring and embarrassing ""remake"" which fell apart immediately.",When a Stranger Calls

When i first saw the commercials, i was automatically in to it. My first thoughts were that it was going to be disturbing and creepy thriller, i was satisfied! the beginning was stylish and unsettling, the middle was somewhat slow but it gives you time to appreciate the modern mansion and the beauty of Camilla belle, who plays Jill Johnson, the climax was intense and suspenseful, and the ending was well, thats really up to you to decide once you've rented it.",When a Stranger Calls

153,QuadeC2010,"Thin and Stupid, but I Still Love It",7,8 May 2020,"I remember going to see this in theaters as it was all the talk of the friend group in high school. We went and saw it and it seemed no one really cared for it but me. I still like it to this day, though. I actually found it for $5 on iTunes and thought it was definitely worth the purchase.I hadn't seen the movie in quite sometime but I remember buying we physical DVD when it first came out. There's some sense of nostalgia embedded in this movie I guess, because there aren't really any redeeming qualities. Or maybe it's just the cool house setting; I could look at it all day.Simply put, though, the female lead is not a very good actress and the characters are all horribly underdeveloped. We see her with her best friend at the beginning of the movie, yet we have no reason to care for her. She says like 3 lines. What's the use? We see her later with her friend Tiffany (surprised I remembered her name), and she's a horrible actress and she is killed off. Obviously she was added just for the body count because we are led to believe they were prior best friends but recently went through a fight. But there was no connection there.The Mandrakuses (is that spelled right? I can't seem to find the name anywhere on the internet) are good people, I suppose, but we're really just left seeing them for the first little while then they disappear. The kids literally don't say a single word. They just cry. The first several minutes of the movie have no connection to the actual movie itself. It felt like it was thrown in and was going to be part of the movie but then someone changed their mind at the last minute.I guess all of these flaws is probably due to the source material. It's a full movie based off the first 20 minutes of the original movie. And yes the movie is stupid and the plot sucks, but for some reason, I always enjoy watching it. I've watched it probably 4 times since I bought it last week after losing my original DVD. Maybe it's just one of those movies that's so bad that it's good. That's the only way to explain how I feel about it.",When a Stranger Calls

Then I saw the original When A Stranger Calls staring the magnificent Carol Kane and I felt the fear all over again. Now, this film. What can I say? I was impressed, because I was expecting a repeat of The Fog remake. The movie does it's job. It entertains. The only bad things the film has going for it are it's pace and the very spoiler filled trailer. Had the trailer been cut down a a bit to add more mystery, I can guarantee that it would have made several more millions at the B.O.The film's other flaw is it's pace. The movie simply takes TOO long to get going and the atrocious teenage drama stuff really doesn't help. Do teenagers really think these are problems? If your boyfriend kissed your friend, dump him and find a new friend, Jill! I also wish the children had died. It's not cause I'm blood thirsty, but it's part of the legend. The fact that the killer has no weapon is also silly and implausible. No one is THAT strong in a realistic thriller.All in all, I was surprised by how much fun the movie was.

What happened and what did I miss? Why ruin such a great story made from the beginning with an ending familiar to 10 other horror movies done the last 10 years. Honestly, if you are to make a remake of something brilliant, then make sure you make it a better version then the original one.

157,ja-191-280465,Was a remake necessary ?,5,28 July 2016,"Based on the 1979 film, ""When a Stranger Calls"" stars Camilla Belle as an innocent teen who becomes the next target of an unknown serial killer. Jill Johnson is a talented track runner. She feels bummed after catching her boyfriend kissing one of her best friends played by Katie Cassidy (in a very pointless role). After going over her minutes, she's forced to take a babysitting job for a wealthy couple. After being dropped off by her dad, she meets the suave, charming couple and is soon left alone to tend to the kids. Jill eventually explores the luxurious home and as the evening progresses, she starts to receive frightening calls from a threatening stranger. The phone calls continue and Jill becomes consumed with fear. When the killer makes his way inside the house, he causes her to fear for her life.For starters, the plot is mediocre. And the acting and directing are the same. Most of the scenes seem very fast paced and as a result, we're not given the chance to really get to know the characters. In addition to the weak dialogue, there's just not much to see in this bland, little flick. This so called thriller doesn't produce much thrill at all, especially in the climatic part of the film.Overall, this film could've been avoided as a remake. It's a highly forgettable, low grade thriller with not much to see or look forward to. Watch only if you have nothing better to do.",When a Stranger Calls

An unexpressive lead performance by Camilla Belle doesn't help things much, especially considering that we're stuck with her for just about every shot of the movie.

Lets face it, this film is no where near as good as the original. Even if you do take this film by itself, it is terrible. The acting is crap you can tell they chose ""good looking"" actors to appeal to mindless teens who don't care about good horror. This film is not even scary, in fact it is utterly boring.

Why doesn't the lead call the police right away? Why does she just keep answering the phone if it's frightening her so much? Why does she TURN OFF the SECURITY SYSTEM? Why did they hire a babysitter at all if the maid was still at the home? And who is the stalker that is finally caught by the police -- this is never explained.

162,ajbo,Not as bad as one would think...,4,4 February 2006,"When the ""When A Stranger Calls"" remake was first announced, I found it to be a breath of fresh air: Finally, a remake of a film, which is outdated and deserves a remake. Let's face it, the original film needed to be improved upon. Other than the first fifteen minutes (which was first done in next horror film to be remade: Black Christmas, which just so happens to star Katie Cassidy...) it was nothing special, actually, it was downright boring.However, when the first trailer appeared, I feared the worst for this remake: The acting looked abysmal. People thought it was, at first, a joke. How horrible can that look to the makers of the film, knowing that the people they're trying to target this film to, think it's supposed to be some new ""Geico Commercial""?! Suffice to say, I ended up seeing it last night; opening night. To a packed theater. Seems as though the TV spots won more than just a few people over.The film starts with an opening murder (no, not the way ""Scream"" did it. You never see the victim, you just hear the harassing phone calls and get various shots of the carnival next door.) which in itself, was frightening. Yes, frightening. The one shot, where the light turns on and the intruder's standing right at the window, made me jump.Move 125 miles West, and you're now in a small Colorado town, with Jill Johnson. She's a track star, with a cheating boyfriend, and a phone bill that would make the Hilton Fortune, look minuscule. Jill's been forced to babysit the Mandrakis' kids, as to pay her parents back for the dent she's now left in their cash flow. After a rather sour confrontation between Jill and her best friend Tiffany, (who, Jill's boyfriend was seen kissing, one day after school) Jill drives away with her father, into the middle of nowhere, where upon a small lake, the Mandrakis' house... well, mansion, sits. After the Mandrakis' leave, all is well, Rosa (the live-in housekeeper) is doing her chores, the children are asleep after just beginning to get over the flu and Jill gets right to her studies... only after she explores the rooms of this magnificent house.Things begin to go awry however, when Jill begins receiving prank phone calls from an unknown caller, Rosa disappears, and strange noises are heard from every niche within this house's construction. It's not until the once ""heavy breather"" begins to talk to Jill, asking her things such as, ""Have you checked the children"" and giving her morbid answers to questions such as, ""What do you want?!"" ""Your blood, all over me..."" that Jill realizes, this is no prank caller, and she'll have to fight for her life to survive this night.""When A Stranger Calls"" is pretty basic psychological thriller. Many people confuse these films, with slasher films, which they're so obviously not. ""When A Stranger Calls"" has it all, a great (and updated!) story, an amazing location, some good suspense sequences (I was all about Tiffany's stalk sequence!!) and amazing direction. The film has it's flaws, like every film, but they're easily surpassed.This film, is one of the many in the long line of remakes. It's also in a long line of Hollywood trends: PG-13. Which means, no vulgar language, no nudity, no gore and next to no blood. However, in this film, it's not a bad thing. We, the audience, shouldn't need to rely on blood and gore and sex to make it good and scary. This film has tension, which some films of today, lack. You end up feeling for the characters in the end, you want everything to turn out fine, and just when you thought you knew something would pop out, they throw it at you in a different light, and you're given a scare which is even worse than the last.This film was great; but only in the sense, if you go in expecting less. I did, and I had a great time watching it. Camilla Belle's acting is not as bad as the TV Spots make it out to be, she's pretty good, to be honest. Katie Cassidy is also a very good actress (although it's not hard to play a rich twit, but the girl can play dead like a pro!) and I look forward to seeing her play the lead in the ""Black Christmas"" remake.If you're looking for a hardcore slasher film, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a tension filled, character driven, psychological thriller, ""When A Stranger Calls"" is your film.",When a Stranger Calls

I know what to expect, and I know how to enjoy them -- a liter of vodka and some company.Sadly, given even these prime conditions -- a total absence of expectations, excessive amounts of alcohol, and attractive company to boot -- ""When a stranger calls"" doesn't deliver. Or rather it does deliver, but instead of cheap thrills and a clever line or two, it serves up a tortuously vapid and physically abrasive experience.For scares, there's a black cat, and a horribly dim serial killer that looks as though he'd have trouble euthanizing a paraplegic ferret. Then there's a phone that keeps ringing and ringing as though the telemarketer from hell is on the other end -- and of course the girl keeps picking it up and spitting out the same three lines again and again as though mercilessly beating the audience into submission.The score for this film, like everything, feels like a key got stuck somewhere in the production facility. For the entirety of the running length, the same stock ""spooky"" music loops endlessly. Cue the trip to the refrigerator -- the trip to the laundry room -- the long shot of the lake. Everything sounds the same.But of course the writing is what takes the cake... in the face mind you. There's not one clever line in the movie. The characters are boring paper cutouts that haven't even been colored in. The plot contains no less than a dozen obvious holes, and the supposed ""climax"" is so bad that it verges on farce.This film is so bad it's practically weaponized.

I thought the original When A Stranger Calls was okay until the police discovered the bodies and I suddenly realized there was a lot of time left in the movie. Yes, it was boring, but at least there was a story. This version has even removed the SINGLE thing that made the original even remotely disturbing: the fact that the killer murdered the children and they had been dead the entire time! Yes, this time the oh-so-clever teenager not only rescues them, but seems to think with all the on-the-spot decisiveness of a military super-soldier. I suspect the makers were trying to create a Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees-type mythology here, but there was NO foundation, and their ""killer"" comes off more like a peeping Tom (oh yes, I guess he DID stuff the maid under the water in the pond - uh, sure, very terrifying and nothing we don't see each night on television). As he is being driven away in a police car we hear the radio announcer telling of his murderous past, but how scary is that? A note to storytellers: You must create the basis/motivation.history of your character in advance, to some degree, in order for your viewers to feel enticed to invest themselves in watching with any interest.Dear God,this film truly reveals how truly EMPTY Hollywood's reserves of good scripts are. I could care less of this film was made or not, but what makes me really angry is that again a ""new"" movie has stolen a couple hours of my life away. I keep watching the crap spewed out for me and coming back for more like dog who loves a good kick.

So horror movies really don't work for me.That being said, When a Stranger Calls fell completely flat. It was hardly scary at all, and it was entirely predictable. Every ""shocking moment"" was formulaic and not impressive at all. Yet the young audience collectively screamed as if they had just seen the most disgusting thing in their life.One of the problems with the plot was that it had interesting points, but these were all small side stories that had nothing to do with the stranger calling the babysitter. We see very little of Jill's dad or her two friends, and they are really the only interesting people in the whole movie. The beginning of the movie plays more like a romantic comedy with some interesting characters, but it instead drifts off into the main and boring story about the ""creepy caller."" I'm not the best judge of horror, but this is one that any smart person would skip. Fortunately for the producers of this movie and unfortunately for society, the target audience has a collective IQ of 7.",When a Stranger Calls

The lead wasn't the best actress but when I consider a 16 year old high school girl, it's probably realistic enough. There were a few plot points that seemed to be pointless, and I can't believe she didn't check on the kids for 2-3 hours but overall I found it a super satisfying date night movie to hold each other with as you prepare for the inevitable third act.

Not the case with this mess... No sense of timing or suspense, no surprises, awful music and a stupid illogical plot: at one point **SPOILER**, the babysitter gets a call from another phone line in the guest house. She asks the stalker ""How did you get that number"" and manages to keep him online long enough for the cops to trace the call. After he hangs up, she says ""I'm on another line"" and figures out the cops are not monitoring that phone even if she KNEW she was using another line when she asked the guy how he got the number).You can see **SPOILERS** the ""Carrie"" ending coming a mile away.

170,Bello-4,What a Great Bloodless Movie!!!,8,27 February 2006,"Exactly what the summary says folks.... I'll be the first to admit that there'll always be an audience for every type of movie, and I'm meaning the blood and gore set here. But as I sat and watched the trailers that fit with this movie play by I realized something, that the over whelming number of horror genre films out there are just that, blood and gore and general over indulgence. Now maybe I'm older than my years, but whatever happened to the bloodless horror movie? The movie that you didn't know who the villain was? What was around the corner? Where the protagonist(s) did more than run around in situations that were going to certainly end in their deaths? In When a Stranger Calls, they did a very nice job of paying attention to the details and you can tell. I mean what teenage girl now-a-days is all that athletic (in the movies)? Our girl Jill appears physically in shape and in fact she runs track. That conveys reality when she has to fight for her life and those she's sitting for. And show me an attractive teen girl who's going to be sitting around on a weekend night also. Again the attention to detail. Boyfriend, relationship trouble no less, equals abnormally high cell phone bill. She generally doesn't want to be around him. And because of her cell bill is grounded. Grounding gets our girl alone. Her father making her pay her own cell phone bill forces our girl Jill to find a quickie job. And her boyfriend being at the school bon-fire means he can't conveniently be there to save her and the day (old horror movie cliché)...And the villain is just that. A villain. No big grandiose history linking Jill to our villain. No master plan. Anyone who's been a victim of a random crime can testify that bad people do bad things to others with or without cause and they don't necessarily care who you are.When a Stranger Calls can be appreciated for its beautiful scenery and its attention to detail. It can be appreciated that for once in an otherwise typical genre the girl is the fighter (which seems to be the in thing now). And she looks the part of an average girl to, not someone whom should be walking the catwalks in Milan or Paris but rather the casual friend you'd hang out with.Camilla Belle as Jill is an extremely talented up and coming star. A fan of hers, she's why I went to see this movie and I'm glad I did. She's believable in her fighter and victim role as Jill Johnson, and deftly carries the film through its entire run. Camilla Belle is one of a type of actresses that you want in your movie not necessarily because she's known and will thusly sell seats, but because she's the right actress for the role your looking for. And it's rare to find that and even rarer that Hollywood casts it. I should know, reading up on this movie I learned that the people behind When a Stranger Calls had to really work to get Camilla to join them. They felt that strongly about her.When a Stranger Calls could be a little more suspenseful, I'll grant you that. While still very much enjoying the movie I thought that it did drag just a bit in places and the last second in the hospital was out of place. But in the absence of so much blood and gore that you need a poncho, and in the absence of the need of a multi-volume set of books to keep up with the backstory. This is a very simple and enjoyable movie.KB",When a Stranger Calls
171,dokha,Very good movie for what it is,6,11 November 2012,"OK, iv known this movie froma long time ago this review is based on my 3rd time watching this film. if it wasn't a good thriller i wouldn't have watched it 3 times. That being said, the movie, and probably the story book itself is extremely narrow angled, meaning that we only see what is happening only to the girls perspective. and i understand movies this kind but it doesn't give it excuse to not explain everything that happens around her. the movie is good at that but u cant help but ask questions, and in the end it leaves you unsatisfied and uncomfortable. why was the criminal there? what did he want? if you weren't having fun with the suspense, while watching the movie and saw the big picture instead of only her perspective, the movie really begins to be incredibly stupid and dumb.the movie's attraction is soley based on the criminal's creepines towards her, there is no reason for him to be creepy it just seems that he was put in the movie only for that purpose, and the movie doesn't explain this attitude in the end, so for this reason this movie was incredibly unrealistic. even in the action scenes only happening in the end, after all the build up we don't see his face, this is how much this movie is narrow scoped. its just dumb. while watching i told myself that probably these questions will be answerd on the end but it didn't, and thats when this movie falls flat on its face. the movie is under an hour and a half but it really really should have been 2 hours long; i never felt bored with it. there are small holes in the story which don't really bother me but as i said it should have been 2 hours, like how Bobby got the house number? and i heard that the older movie was better; saw some clips on youtube and comments saying the movie is a masterpiece, well all that doesn't intrigue me a bit because after watching the clips i don't relate to it one bit. and those old moves always have those BORING scenes that just don't contribute to the plot in any way, like we have all day to care about fictional characters in a movie. i mean there's a fine line between putting pointless scenes and putting just enough to be realistic ;Peter Jackson and Spielberg are good at that example.",When a Stranger Calls

It all starts with simple phonecalls, then during one of these calls the stranger leaves hints that he's near by. To be honest the first part was quite chilling. the viewer is quite scared for the heroine. the is stupid parts where she goes out of the house to check to guest house and if it was me I would have called the cops way before and demanded they come straight away, never mind waiting till they track a call. It was enjoyable none the less. Then the killer is revealed hiding in the roofs rafters. He is not the least bit scary and even in the end gets beaten up by the babysitter.

174,hollywoodgirl-1,"Personally, I was scared out of my mind",8,5 February 2006,"I'm probably going to get a lot of grief for this, but I was personally scared witless. Right from the get-go, from the terrifying opening I wasn't expecting to the chilling ending, the suspense kicks in and doesn't let up. Though it was fairly easy to predict who was going to die and who wasn't, it didn't make the deaths any less scarier or shocking. The story is simple enough: Jill Johnson is your every-day, average sixteen-year-old girl going through a rough time with her friend and boyfriend which caused her to go so far over her cell phone minutes that her parents grounded her for a month, taking away her cell phone and her car. She must pay them back by babysitting for Dr. Mandrakis and his wife at their enormous hill-set home. When she arrives it's obvious that it will be an easy night: the kids are already asleep and she has access to everything that the house has to offer, including a well-stocked fridge, TV and stereo, and a koi pond/aviary in the middle of the house. However, it isn't long before the phone calls start. Sometimes it's just heavy breathing, sometimes it's a little talking, but they don't last for more than a few seconds. Jill finally gets exasperated and calls the police, but calms down when she realizes that the family's maid is still in the house. However, when the caller asks, ""Have you checked the children?"" Jill gets annoyed and treks upstairs to find the kids safe in their bed. It's not until two seconds later that the phone rings asking, ""How were the children?"" that Jill really starts to freak out. The twist about the caller is revealed in the trailer, but it doesn't take from the suspense at all. A feature that the house has is motion-sensitive lights, which turn on upon entry in the room. I thought this would take away from the suspense because you'd know where someone was at all times, but it doesn't at all, and is in fact used in one extremely suspenseful scene very masterfully. All in all, I thought the movie was very well made, and I will definitely go see it again. I highly recommend it, if you can let go of the improbable premise, which maybe isn't so improbable after all...",When a Stranger Calls

That's why horror movies are the best. This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen, next to 'Halloween' and 'Halloween 2'. My face completely turned white. One of the best horror movies ever made. The ending was insane. You actually yell at the screen telling the main character not to do something. You never expect the scares. This movie deserves better ratings! Why so much hate? Is it because it's a remake? I have never even heard of the original movie until this came out, that's what remakes do. What else can I say? Great suspense, great memories from this, Camilla Bell was hot in this movie, everything about this movie is perfect you wouldn't wanna change anything about it. I never babysat after I saw this.

Yes, it is all around a poorly produced movie, but I think people didn't like it because it did not have a lot of violence or gore. You have to put yourself in her situation, and when you do, you realize it is very disturbing.

It was basically 90 minutes of listening to a phone ring over and over again. I thought the calls could have been creepier if they actually made the guy say more stuff instead of ""have you checked the children?"" or just breathing heavily. This movie was also so0o0 predictable!! I guess most horror movies are these days...but with this movie you can pretty much tell whats going to happen all the way through. Oh yeah, and I thought they used way too many of those lame ""cat"" scares and the ""turn around and there's a coat behind you"" scares that only make you jump the first or second time and then it's like, ""ok...how many more times is this going to happen?!"" Another thing I didn't get was when they showed the captured creepy guy in the police car after they captured him it kind of seemed like he was going to be somebody we'd seen previously in the movie. People behind me were saying stuff like ""It's her dad"" and ""it's Dr mandrakis!"" which it wasn't of course, but from the way they showed a dark shadowy figure of him at first and then lit up his face it kind of seemed like it. Overall, not one of the best horror movies I've seen...When the movie began there were only about 20 people in the theater, even on opening night...I guess now I know why. 5/10",When a Stranger Calls

My favorite genre is horror and she honestly is the worst I've seen. I can't imagine who her parents are or who she slept with to get this role but it's definitely a one or the other situation.

Well the plot is a good premise, it's based off ""The Babysitter"" urban legend which I was very much interested in. But everything went wrong with this movie.The characters are pretty underdeveloped. We don't know very much about them other than they're just fighting about boys. The dialogue was just horrible. But where the movie really sucks is it fails to stimulate fear. I wasn't scared at all in this movie. I was more laughing at the fact at how stupid the lead girl was. Actually, I was even a little bored during the movie. It totally failed to keep my attention.Even the camera shots were cheesy. And the buildup was just horrible. Why do we need to see the girl putting on a necklace for 3 minutes? And the phone calls should have been done better and scarier. The phone ringing and then you hear a mysterious breathing on the other line is pretty scary, but not when it's done 10 times in a row! It was so repetitive and she just kept answering the phone was extremely stupid.How about the acting? Bad, as you can imagine. The lead girl, Camilla Belle, is a cute girl, maybe could go into modeling or even some type of makeup or skin commercial, but lets face it, acting isn't her thing. The other characters don't do much for the mopier, but from what little we saw of them, they were pretty bad.The movie was also extremely predictable. I could point out who was going to live and who was going to die from the start and what was going to happen. The ending was just horrible.

The movie has failed in all aspects but most profoundly in its lacking of the real story line. The story line is somehow a replica to very common horror movie (you got bad man out there and start running around with not clear idea: WHY? WHY?

187,elispaul,A Duller Shade of Lame.....,3,3 February 2006,"I have a confession. As a kid, I was a sucker for scary campfire stories. Ghost stories, monster stories, psycho stories, I got creeped out by them all. And of all the stories and all the clichés, the most classic and repeated was ""THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE!!!"" So logic and better instinct be hanged, I saw the remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"". So instead of going through the plot (the above line pretty much sums it up), I will just start by listing the major problems with the execution of this telling of the story.Problem #1: Acting. Aside from a couple of the adults (I still think Clark Gregg has a lot of potential), the acting is sub-high school production. Every teenage actor in this movie looks like they're reading from a cue card. And unfortunately Camilla Belle's (the babysitter) acting talents can be described thusly: She can effectively look scared. Really scared. Really, really scared. For a very, very long time.Problem #2: Script. ""What?"", you may ask, ""There was a script?"". Well, apparently, because there is a screen writing credit, but the ending result still makes me wonder. It's sort of like they took the first ten minutes of ""Scream"", drained it of humor and lengthened it to an hour-and-a-half. You can almost hear the conversation inside the screenwriter's head: ""Well, she's a babysitter, so what do babysitters do? Um, study........and go through the bathroom of the house owners.....oh, and they raid the fridge! Hmmm, that's not really scary.....but it will be if we put it in the dark with scary music!"" So, instead of genuine scares, we get the babysitter studying calculus...to scary music, trying on the moms jewelry...to scary music and searching the fridge for orange juice, but if we're to believe the soundtrack, it's somehow ""scary"" orange juice.Problem #3: The ending. So, we finally, after a full hour, get to ""THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE!!!"". The movie finally starts to move a little. Kids screaming, lights turning off and on, mass pandemonium. Unfortunately, the stranger is channeling Michael Myers and moves...very...slowly. However he's not as imposing as Michael Myers so I'm thinking, ""the sick little girl could kick this guys butt"". Granted, just the concept of a psychopath stalking you is not pleasant, but we've finally gotten to what's supposed to be the payoff and we still get the same bored feeling we've had through the whole movie, it's just faster.Now for a small concession. I saw this movie sitting behind five 11-year-old girls. They screamed every time the cat jumped out. They held on to each other for dear life. As they left the theater they were shaking and making comments like ""Oh my gosh, you guys! That movie was SOOOOO scary!!!"". Apparently, it would seem that devotees of Raven-Symone finally have a horror movie to call their own. So if you're a girl between the ages of 11 and 13 and have never seen anything remotely scary in a movie, this little number may do the trick. To all others...let the tweens answer this call.",When a Stranger Calls

I mean i really enjoy some of the remakes that have come out (house of wax, the Texas chainsaw massacre, dawn of the dead), and i guess some part of me wanted it to be a bit better. I don't know what the hell possessed me, because the trailer was horrible! First the acting, i mean it was OK for most of the movie, but at times it was so bad *Spoilers* (like the scene where Jill finds her best friend dead, So bad. Then the movie had no plot at all! It dragged for so long, some scenes should've been cut out. And plus it had so many unscary cheap scares, and it lacked tension. The characters, most of them we're just there to be there, some just to die. That's another thing i didn't like, i mean if your gonna make a crappy movie, the at least make it gory! But no, it had to be Pg-13. The editing was too tight, and that is something i hate so much, it just ruins the experience. I mean if your gonna cut everything that quick, then don't show anything at all. The design of the house was interesting though, the house was beautiful. And i think the movie managed to get the feeling of what it's like to feel that isolated.

190,amacmillen,Ugh.....,2,4 February 2006,"Yes, folks, I'd have to say this movie beats out King Kong for my all-time WORST movie that I've ever seen. Actually, to be completely fair, I saw ""When a Stranger Calls"" in the middle of the day, then went out to dinner and to a dance, and then came home and saw ""Crash"" on Pay-per-view, and seeing such a good movie as that made me realize just how bad ""WASC"" was. Here's how the movie failed: 1) None of the ""suspects"" (or very few of them) were actually ever introduced to us, for example Todd the son, and Rosa got about 10 seconds of air time. When we find out who the stranger is, it's just some random dude who no one knows - he's never been introduced. Kind of a ripoff. 2) This movie was too formulaic. Basically it consisted of Jill going into a room, getting creeped out by a cat or the sprinkler system or something, and then going into the next room, etc. And it stays that way for the whole film...SO boring. 3) Really, the only character in the whole movie was Jill. There was a little backstory with her best friend, another friend, and her ex, but none of those characters had any real bearing on the story, so they just took up screen time. Only the best friend had any sort of role, coming up to the house and getting killed. (Only the scene where she drops her keys and can't start the car is so clichéd). 4) The movie reveals its one big shocker in the trailer: the police calling and saying, ""We traced the call...It's coming from inside the house!"". That would have been the only time I would have gotten minorly scared. And what was up with the cat eating the canaries...? 5) Chester, the cat, annoyed me. We were supposed to be scared when he jumped out, and yet, most people in the theater just laughed. But since I've already pointed out all the bad things about the movie, what about the few good things? Here they are: 1) When she finds Rosa. That was a good shocker. It would have been nicer though if she had actually got to know Rosa and have maybe 10 minutes with her, then we'd be more surprised. 2) The very initial scene at the carnival. After seeing that, I had pretty high expectations for this movie...but of course THAT didn't turn out too well. Although the carnival angle is a little overplayed, it was still very well done. And now, the weirdest thing of all: The end. She's in the hospital, and she has a dream where the hospital is empty and the guy calls and then she starts spazzing and wakes up. What a strange and unsatisfying way to end an overall poor film. Anyway, don't waste your $8 or whatever it is they charge now on such a film. Go see ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" instead.",When a Stranger Calls

192,JokerSwan,Hello..? Is something gonna happen soon? Hello??,3,17 June 2006,"-SPOILERS, but really, if you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie- I haven't seen the original, but if it's even half this bad, I don't see why this version was even made. Maybe this was scary to some people in 1979, but this is 27 years later and we've seen better by now. If you're going to do a remake, at least add something original. This had a K-15 rating in Finland, so 13-year-olds can see it with an adult, but it's still a pretty high age limit (Silent Hill, among others, has the same one). I think most 11-year-olds have seen scarier movies than this. The whole premise - for what it's worth - rests on creating suspense, but it's never there. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it didn't until the very end. The beginning seems promising with its carnival imagery and scary sounds; the idea of there not being a murder weapon, as well as the policeman being appalled, seems to bode well for the story. But these elements are never brought back. It takes a while before anything starts happening, and all the jump moments before the killer appears are really just fake: a cat jumps out of the shadows; a scary human form turns out to be a coat. It's called cheating the viewers, not creating suspense. If there's no threat, why should we feel fear? The attacks, when they finally come, fall flat because of no suspense in beforehand. The only cool visual image were the yellow birds indicating the glass of the indoors garden had been broken. But it didn't make me scared, exactly.Now, at the end of the movie, you can hear TV reporters voice-over about the murderer. They claim he plays an ""elaborate game of cat and mouse"". Well, not so much. Making threatening phone calls is pretty standard. He only really makes about five of them, in most of which he says nothing. As soon as he's discovered as being in the house, he makes straightforward attacks at Jill and the children, and there's nothing clever about it. There are scenes that indicate he might be somehow supernatural - for example the scene where he bangs on the door and then there's no one there when Jill goes to answer it (cliché, I know). But then he's caught and tranquilized by the police, and even Jill could fight him physically. So is he really a supernatural evil or just a crazy guy killing young beautiful women? If it's the latter, I'd rather watch CSI for free and with just as much suspense, if not more. If the former, then why isn't he given anything exciting to do? The only supernatural part is how he gets into the house, which isn't enough. Some people are saying it wasn't supposed to be horror, but a psychological thriller. I think that would require more from it. A psychological thriller is something like Silence of the Lambs. This genre requires a back story, well-thought out characters who are relatable, and a villain whose motives and personality are discussed in some way. It's not enough for a psychological thriller to relate the story of a teenager who gets scared, so scared she loses her mind. And if that is the only story, you want to do it well and make the viewer feel her fear, which the director and writer have failed to do here. There's not back story to speak of. The protagonist is a stereotypical teenager whose boyfriend cheats on him with her best friend, so now she's mad at them. She has no personality other than ""generic teen girl in horror flick"". The murderer is given even less of a description. Who is he? Why does he kill? Is he even human? The writer obviously didn't care. The TV reporter's dramatic voice saying his identity ""remains a mystery"" seems to indicate that it's somehow more exciting that his identity isn't revealed. Well, it's not really. If he acts like the generic movie bad guy and isn't given any depth, he isn't interesting in any way. So the question is: Why should we watch yet another movie about a young attractive girl being haunted by a male stalker? My answer: we shouldn't. There are plenty of better movies out there, so avoid this one.",When a Stranger Calls

195,rachelrachel-33431,Good Remake,7,13 October 2021,"As remakes go, When A Stranger Calls has all the right ingredients. Since the original film wasn't exactly a gore fest to begin with, the PG-13 rating doesn't hurt the film and allows it to focus more on mood and atmosphere to make the viewer uneasy. Just seeing the camera track down one of the main location's dark hallways where danger could be lurking behind any open door or dark corner is enough to get the mind racing.If the film has a major flaw, it's unexpressive performance by Camilla Belle as the film's lead. She's got the perfect, all-American girl next door look, but she always seems somewhat bored. That hurts the film, but the production and sound design are so well done that they keep you invested in all the terror happening.",When a Stranger Calls

197,Terminator97C,I hope I'm not there when a stranger calls,1,20 April 2007,"The word remake has to be the most popular word in Hollywood right now. So many films are being released recently that are remakes of previous films, especially in the horror/thriller genre. The worst part is that very few of them are any good. In a quick attempt to make a few dollars, movie studios stick to the same formula. The most important part is do not come up with original idea; instead just redo a movie that was already successful in the past. Second add a handful of inexperienced actors and directors. Finally pump a whole bunch of money into advertising and you are guaranteed to make a bad movie and rake in tons of cash in the process. This film is no different.""When a Stranger Calls"" stays close to the same premise from the original 1979 film of the same name. The sad thing is that even the plot from the first film was fairly bland. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is experiencing the usual high school drama and feels like nothing is going right for her. First her boyfriend ended up kissing one of good friends at a party. Then she went over her cell phone service plan by 800 minutes and now she is grounded for a month.Therefore Jill cannot attend the huge bonfire party that everyone in her high school is going to. Instead she has to baby-sit. When she arrives at the house the kids are already asleep and the parents give her a quick tour of their beautiful house. Once Jill is alone in the house she starts to receive odd phone calls from a person that says nothing. After the caller continues for some time Jill becomes scared and calls the police. The police call back and tell Jill that the calls have been traced and are coming from within the house. That is it. That is the whole plot and somehow they manage to drag it out to an already lacking running time of 1 hour and 23 minutes. Not to mention the first and last scene of the film should be removed because they serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. It seems like the creators just threw the two scenes in the film in order to give it a longer running time.The infamous scene where Jill finds out the call is coming from inside the house was the driving force of the 1979 version, but the modern version uses the scene as its main advertising focus. This then ruins the only good thrill that the movie could have had because everyone already knows it is going to happen.""When a Stranger Calls"" is filled with plot holes, impossibilities, and inconsistencies that make an already poor film even worse. The movie also takes every opportunity to use a cheap scare when Jill goes multiple times to investigate a noise in the house and is startled by everything possible.The only praise that can be given to this film is that it does attempt to build up to a strong climax. ""When a Stranger Calls"" has a very classic thriller feel to it, which can only be praised so much because of the fact is a remake of a classic thriller. Unlike the trend nowadays where films have scares and deaths every few minutes in order to hold the attention of the young teen audience the movies are targeted for.The next thing to look forward to is when ""When a Stranger Calls"" comes out on DVD and the movie studios will resort to their second best money making formula. Release an unrated version that is almost exactly the same as the original.",When a Stranger Calls

That's when the stranger starts calling. And you can tell from the calls, the stranger isn't very nice.What's going to happen to poor Jill? Who is the stranger? What does the stranger want? Is Jill in danger? Is Jill going to die??? Check out the movie, and see for yourself. Yes, the acting is LOUSY. But, do what I did. Accept the fact the acting stinks, and watch it anyway.

Who is grounded and misses the party and now has to babysit in a big house out in the middle of nowhere (not exactly out in the middle but you know). The parents basically told her to not disturb the kids and make herself at home. After the parents leave she basically meets Rosa out in the garden that they have in the house and after that she basically chills. Than the phone starts ringing all over again. And in the one of them towards the middle-end, the killer said that he wants to have her blood all over him. Belle than calls the police to track him down later the police calls her to say that he is in the house. Belle than takes the kids and try to leave, the killer basically blocks them off until the end where Belle puts the knife in his hand and the police come in and takes him away. Cassidy died in this movie also while visiting Belle during the beginning of the movie and got suffocated by the killer in her car outside.Overall, it's decent for what it is but i was a bit disappointed that the killer didn't get involved as much as i would have liked.So if u want to rent it, i'd say go for it at your own risk.",When a Stranger Calls
200,flumpman-1,I want a refund!,2,23 January 2007,"My favourite movie genre is that of the ""horror"" category and as a rule I tend to pay a visit to my local cinema and watch any horror film that has been released regardless of the reviews I have read about it (which, lets face it, are usually bad). However, one horror film that I missed at the cinema was this remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"". I have to admit that I am quite sceptical when it comes to a remake or sequel or prequel of any kind but I still like to see them just to see what they are like, anyway, I missed this one at the cinema and totally forgot about it altogether until I paid a visit to my local Blockbuster and saw they were selling an ex-rental copy for a few quid and quite excitedly grabbed a copy and raced home to watch it. 90 minutes later and I wanted a refund! I have never been so utterly disappointed by a film in general never mind a horror film as this was by far the biggest piece of crap I have ever watched in my entire life. Basically the acting sucked, the storyline sucked and the setting sucked and all it involved was a whole hour of stupid phone calls to a stupid girl in a stupidly big house and then about six minutes of her being chased by the ""stranger"" who is then caught and taken away without any explanation at all as to why he was stalking the girl or why he chose her or what his motive was or anything of that calibre. Seriously, if you want to see a decent horror film I would recommend anything over this - in fact I wouldn't even call this a horror film as it wasn't even scary in the slightest bit and had no blood or gore or anything - I would watch the Care Bears Movie if I was you as that is way way scarier than this absolute waste of money and time that is called ""When A Stranger Calls""!

I really liked it much more. Knowing and understanding what this movie wanted to convey, I got much more out of it. I don't like the fact that this movie was made out and thought of to be a horror movie when it first came out. It's a psychological thriller. THRILLER. So don't expect the gore blood n' guts stuff. It isn't a slasher. Sure, it was Pg-13 and limited but it was still good. There were some deaths and a little bit of blood here and there. A lot of people thought it was stupid because they didn't find out who the killer was. Hence the name it got...when a stranger calls. What the movie was trying to convey was imagination and mind tricks. When we're alone or scared, we imagine things that scare the hell out of us sometimes. Our mind can be the worst at times. This movie is so real and that's what I like. I didn't even know who Camilla was until this movie and she does a good job. She conveys the average teenager very, VERY well. Her expressions were good as well, and heightened the tension in the movie. I thought it was cool what the director/writers did. They expanded the first 20 minutes of the original and made it into a feature film. The film was well shot and the lighting was wonderful. The movie also does something different. The HOUSE is an actual CHARACTER. It's beautiful and safe looking during the day, but at night it's hostile, uninviting, causing uncertainty and tension, not knowing what was coming. The ending could've been better and lasted longer, like maybe him coming after her again after he escapes, but nonetheless I liked the ending, kind of like CARRIE style. Hell, I would be traumatized too!! This was a pretty good movie, just watch it with an open mind and know that it's a THRILLER, and NOT HORROR, even more so, its more like a PSYCHOLOGICAL thriller.

213,jasonpaulcollum,"Decent, but I'll stick with Carol Kane",7,3 February 2006,"Managed to see first show, opening day and the crowd was not all that spectacular. I've seen the original 1979 classic with larger groups of people who yelled and screamed out loud, but alas this was not the case today.While lead actress Bella is very beautiful and does a decent job of being spooked, Carol Kane owned her role and seemed more terrified. To no fault of the actors, the '79 original terrified me, but this 2006 remake only left me a bit spooked out.The set was fantastic, the art direction and secluded locales perfect and there were definitely times, especially during two outdoors sequences, where the white knuckle factor was raised, but even still nothing that left me with fingernail marks in my palms like WASC '79.I think three of the main problems are that #1: The first 15 minutes of the original film is here stretched out to an hour and a half. #2: Because we never actually meet the character of the stranger, we cannot sympathize with him or understand any of his motives. He literally remains a stranger to the audience. #3: The legend of the original film, itself based on an urban myth, is already so widely know by all generations the final SHOCK isn't much of one. We know where he's calling from -- we were even told that in the trailers, and we also know that our new heroine isn't going to face any real danger until that information comes out, so what we're left with is simply waiting for her to get that infamous phone call from the police.The only new aspects to this story are that the house seems to have a life of its own -- an idea with wonderful potential which is only hinted at fleetingly. Also, new characters have been brought into the story, but only to be used as either psycho-fodder or red herrings, and not very good ones. The fate of the children who are being babysat is also a bit of a modern-day Hollywood cop-out.I know this all sounds negative, so I do want to point out that I wasn't bored with the movie, nor did I hate it. I simply found it to be more of an elevated TV movie of the week vs. the scare classic the original film has become.

I do so now because this movie, a teen thriller, actually makes sense! I was fully prepared for a crap-fest extraordinare when I rented this movie, but instead got a very intelligent, fast-paced thriller.In the movie, Jill does all the right things that one would think one would do when faced with such a situation. In all the other films of the same genre that I've seen, I'm constantly yelling at my TV for the characters not to do some really stupid stuff. I found it refreshing not to have to do that in this movie. Jill actually calls the cops, her parents, and her babysitter family when things get creepy. That was smart and realistic. She investigated the house only when it was still unclear that there was anything really wrong. She didn't just run helter skelter around while we all wait for her throat to be cut. In short, it made sense.Jill's portrayal as a smart, responsible young lady won points in my book too. There was not excessive swearing, gore, or graphic violence. I think the movie could do without these things because, well, IT MADE SENSE! While I don't think that this movie will win any awards, yet for the type of film it is, it really is pretty good.

I am not the most hardened of film fans when it comes to horror, so unlike some parts of this film still seemed to make me jump, though I am pretty sure that is down to me being a 'scaredy cat' rather than any the film being very scary. I did like the house that it was set in, I thought it lent itself to this film really well. I quite enjoyed the film, even though there were quite a few gaping holes in the plot. Like when Jilly realised the phone calls were made from inside the house, I think she was the only one who was surprised as the previous half hour or so was made up of strange unaccounted noises coming from within the house. All in all though I still quite enjoyed this film, not always sure why, but I did.",When a Stranger Calls
216,princebuster82,The reason this film was made? Simple: $$$$$$$$$$,1,21 May 2006,"This could have been a TV movie.There just isn't anything original coming out of Hollywood anymore. So by dusting off old movies and contemporizing them it's pretty much accepted that all the ideas coming down the pipeline for the next few years are going to be rehashes. Why are they being made? Well, people are seeing them. Studios are more than happy to turn something out that they know people will flock to for the name alone. They don't have to come up with an original script, just xerox the old one. It's sad.On to this though. Someone had the bright idea of turning the first ten minutes of the original film into a 90 minute cliché fest. I guess they figured todays audience can't be challenged by things like a fleshed out plot that spans years and cities.This is a really moronic film that is respected by teenage girls and people with sub-average intelligence only. A dead dog all the way around.",When a Stranger Calls

TRhe movie turned out excellent. It is about a girl named Jill who has to babysit in a giant mansion in the middle of nowhere. She keeps getting these stranger calls. That is the whole plot of the movie. The plot may seem lame but it kept everyone in the theaters's interest. Some parts people were screaming, clapping, laughing, and cheering. Katie Cassidy also did well as the co-star. I thought it was awesome. Me and my friends all loved it. Oh, and for people who complain about PG-13 horror movies. Stop Complaining! THis movie was awesome, and don't think that people cant die in a pg-13 because they do. I give this movie a 10/10. Go see it !",When a Stranger Calls

SCARY ! 10 minutes from the end the ""killer"" pops up, chases the girl round the house, then the police arrive. BORING.Oh, I almost forgot, they have a dream sequence at the end where the girl thinks the killer is still after her.Whoever made this film should be tortured.There is no reason given why the killer likes to kill people, why on earth has a teenage girl who is babysitting not got a mobile phone and keeps answering the house phone anyway ?How on earth did the killer get into the most impenetrable house in the first place ?Dear director - make better films !",When a Stranger Calls

The creepy thing was that the phone ringed while the movie but it was just my sister calling, scared me tho.Well the movie was about the girl Jill, she was baby sitting and received all the strange phone calls, don't really wanna tell you to much about it, just watch it yourself!

220,richard-gobin,Disappointing,2,28 November 2006,"I actually saw this on cable and glad I didn't go to see it on the big screen. First off I didn't see the original and about a quarter through this remake I realized how lack-luster it really was. The expected scares didn't deliver. The suspense just wasn't there and I've seen quite a few suspense movies. Camilla Belle, ironically, is the only redeeming factor here. However, not for her acting. She came off as if she was really reading from a script, minus any realistic emotions. Particularly when she speaks to the stranger on the phone. Her looks was what made me watch the movie until the end. There wasn't much background on the 'stranger' at all. The atmosphere and settings didn't add much to the suspense either. I'd feel much safer in a modern home than in the middle of a swamp. So, in essence 'When A Stranger Calls' is just a really bad B-Movie with a gorgeous protagonist with less-than-stellar acting abilities, a vacuous antagonist and a budget that could have been better spent. I recommend 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' or the original 'Psycho' for a good suspense movie.",When a Stranger Calls

Not one moment. Just the usual loud music + cat jumps crapola.Logically, the movie makes no sense either.

She is by herself most of the movie, and you never even see the kids that she is babysitting. My dad hated it too. It isn't entertaining stupid, it is plain boring.

And the house she is babysitting at is a deserted mansion in the middle of nowhere.At first the babysitting is a pretty enjoyable experience for Jill - the house is massive and full of fun and impressive gadgets and furniture, plus the children are already asleep in bed when she gets there so she hasn't really got any work to do either. But then the creepy phone calls begin and she cant contact any of her friends for help because they are all at this bonfire-party on the top a hill somewhere in town. At first she dismissed the calls as a sick joke but then she discovers that the caller is watching her and he asks if she's checked the children...This horror movie is more suspenseful than scary because nothing really happens for quite a while apart from her receiving creepy calls, but it's still good. In the last 20 minutes there is some horror and action and the ending is pretty chilling, too.Overall this is quite a good horror movie (especially if you prefer suspense over gore) that I would recommend if you are looking for a good thriller movie.",When a Stranger Calls

If you wanna see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie.Great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. Very well performed by young Camilla Belle who got the lead role. I see in her some great potential to become a good actress. This is more than only a decent thriller, I have no idea why it's so underrated.

225,Victorious_One,An Average Horror Film,5,31 July 2006,"People nowadays expect too much from films, especially when it comes to horror films. When you mention the word ""horror"" film, what's the first thing that probably pops into your mind? Probably some scary images full of blood and gore and frightening music. In other words, we expect some scary, concrete(physical) things to look at. But people are forgetting that that's not what horror is all about. There's also emotional and psychological horror, which is just as scary. And that is what ""When a Stranger Calls"" is based on, and that is what the audience must realize. Now, from my personal experience, this movie didn't scare me much. So was it good? It was an ""allright"" film; it wasn't perfect: meaning the plot can be predictable, and the whole idea of the film was simple (A girl keeps getting some mysterious phone-calls from a guy with bad intentions.) So how scary was the film? It honestly depends on the person watching the movie. If you watch the film with a clear and relaxed mind and try to interact with the movie by listening to the spooky background music and give the movie a chance, you will be entertained and get that creepy, spooky, and frightening feeling. After all, the movie is all psychological and it depends on the audience's imagination to scare themselves out. I also must say that the director made an excellent choice of choosing Camilla Belle, for carrying out the film, and who did an excellent performance.In a word, ""When a Stranger Calls"" was an average horror film that could have done much better. Nevertheless, it will entertain you if you give the movie the chance and realize that the horror is all in the mind and imagination.",When a Stranger Calls
226,laylastepford,"Good Hollywood-stylized take on the now-famous ""babysitter"" urban legend.",7,25 July 2017,"There are two ways this film can be rated: on it's own or compared to the original. Whether you have seen the original version of this film (1979) or not, makes a big difference on the way you see this version of the film. For that reason, I will rank the film in both ways:(1.) On It's Own (If you had never seen the original):Acting: 16/20 Writing: 30/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 34/40Overall: 80/100 B-Review: Almost the entire film revolves around the babysitter, which means Camilla Belle takes the brunt of the acting in this movie. She's not a bad actress nor an outstanding one and did a pretty solid job. She was pretty believable in her role but she didn't do anything special with it. The most important thing I can say about her performance is that while it didn't add anything special to the film, it also didn't take any value or integrity away from it.She did have a supporting cast but I doubt that any other character (aside from the Stranger/Caller) was in the film for more than 5 minutes total. All of the supporting cast had similar performances, credible and loyal to their roles.The plot of the script is very accurate to the most common versions of the legend and does a great job turning that ""short story"" into a full-length movie, without losing any of the suspense. That being said, there wasn't too much creativity in the script, as most of it does come straight from the legend.The flow and pacing of the film go well with the overall suspense in the movie. The soundtrack was like the acting - appropriate but not outstanding.Overall this film was a good Hollywood-stylized take on the now- famous ""babysitter"" urban legend.(2.) Compared To Original:Acting: 14/20 Writing: 13/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 37/40Overall: 64/100 DReview: This version makes A LOT of references to the original - from keeping the same character names for the babysitter and parents of the children being babysat, to the babysitter taking ice cream out of the fridge when checking and ""securing"" the house.In addition, the woman who plays Mrs. Mandrakis physically resembles Carol Kane, the main detective in this film physically resembles the detective in the original and even the Stranger in this film physically resembles Curt Duncan from the original.Camilla Belle does a much better acting job than Carol Kane, undoubtedly.*Spoiler Alert!*This version of the film focuses solely on the legend itself, whereas the legend was only the first 20 minutes of the original film. As a result, this version is not nearly as creative and entertaining as the original. There is really something to be said about the originality in the script and the performance of Tony Beckley as Curt Duncan in the original film; These factors make the original a much more timeless-classic than this newer version, especially by comparison.The writing in this version took no risks, and the result was a more consistent script than the original but less of a long-lasting impression. By comparison to the first 20 minutes of the original film, this version only really improved in the acting department - otherwise it was just a longer version of the same thing with less impact.The Stranger in this version is also a let-down in comparison to the Curt Duncan character in the original. It's understandable that the newer version had a phenomenal performance to contend with, that would likely not be upstaged, but the decision to replace it with a Michael Myers type version instead was a real bummer.After seeing the original, you even miss the detective's performance as it was such a compelling character.*End of Spoiler Alert!*All of that being said, the newer version is definitely an improvement where you'd expect it to be the most, in the directing/editing/producing departments. This newer film is visually done in a much more stylized, Hollywood manner that has a lot of entertainment value. That being said, it loses some of the ""authentic"" look that the older version has, which is a shame as the ""authentic"" look worked better for this kind of scary story and added more of a timeless feel/quality to it.Overall this newer version really lacks in originality of script, characters and performance compared to the original - yet is still watchable as a tribute to the original legend and film. However, if possible, I'd recommend watching the newer version before watching the original version, so as to enjoy both more. (Otherwise watching the original will very likely ruin the newer one for you by comparison.)Overall Score As Original + Remake Together: Acting: 15/20 Writing: 21/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 36/40Overall: 72/100 C-",When a Stranger Calls

But this movie,yes it does not have something else for us.For example,is Jill and Bobby's love story part of the whole thing?No,Bobby didn't appear and help Jill.Then Tiffany,what's her position?To show how cruel the killer is?Maybe.I just can't understand how could she find Jill,when Jill herself hadn't been told the address of that doctor's house? OK,get rid of it.This movie just shows some 'scary' environment,yes,so there won't be any 'logical' thing.We don't know how Rosa died,'cos she's not the leading character.We also don't know how Tiffany died,while she just laid on floor behind Jill,with eye-opened.We can't find the answer about - how could the kids feel the danger and hide themselves?That killer,in this movie,he's nearly incredible,hiding in someplace in that modern house,and tried to kill poor Jill.Of course he failed.I was asleep,when he finally jumped from the celling of the kid's room,and tried to chase them - en...the kids are kids,but Jill ran very fast,that's the first information the movie told us,right?So she could ran away from the killer temporarily.You see the killer caught her,but,don't worry,our Jill did it-she hit his head. Police is amazing,they are always on-time for every crime.When the killer was taken by the police,he looked at Jill,that look,not so scary actually,I just saw a mid-age man's ordinary face,black eyes,black hair,nothing special in his eyes.But that scared our Jill...she had a nightmare when she's in hospital,then all the story stopped here. Let's look back to the beginning of this movie - someone called a woman,then we heard a scream,then in the following day,police arrived,that fat police was scared about what happened to the kids.IS this scene meaningful?

Some people say ""oh well it was okay""...well they probably have never seen a scary movie in their life! The duologue's is shoddy at best, with lines like: ""Have you checked the children...?"", then the main supposedly super smart heroine who is baby sitting says, ""Why?"". What is going on in this movie, the characters are so boring, by the end of the movie you are bored out of your mind! Belle's acting is the most dry out of everyone in the whole movie! Her biggest problem in life is ""My boyfriend like kissed my best friend!"" how many people do you know with that problem and waste a breath thinking about it? So basically the characters are BORING, and have no character development the only thing I think that they were thinking of while filming this was...""How are we gonna get Camilla wet?"" So this is just plain a stupid, bad movie!

230,nilkanth,"""Nice and Tense""",6,15 January 2008,An entertaining watch for a horror fan where this movie sets out in wanting to make the viewer feel alone and tensed up and it gets to that point without messing around too much and it thrives in the uneasiness you will feel while watching it although a good sound system is a must as the movie relies heavily on accurate surround sounds to keep you on the edge of your seat.Take a well known fact like being all alone in a big old house and put a phone that rings quite often into the midst of it all and you'll never want to answer the phone again as you never know who's on the other end of the line. The tension builds up pretty well through out the movie as you'll be trying to figure out whats happening along with Camilla Bell who does a decent job. She does the confused girl role pretty well and making us believe she is well and truly lost in this new environment that she is in and how she's got to adapt to the situation.All in all a thrill-ride that will have you clueless right up to the end.

234,themoviebuff2003,Agree with Phantasm01-better than the original,8,17 July 2006,"No, this is not a perfect movie, but it held my interest for the most part. The reason I say it's better than the original is, it carries the suspense for the entire movie, rather than for only the first 20 minutes or so. The best thing about this one is the house itself, which they actually built just to use in the movie! Totally modern, even somewhat futuristic, and yet, through photography and lighting, it manages to be every bit as creepy and menacing as any old mansion or claustrophobic small old house (think HALLOWEEN or the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series) could be. The killer here seems far more menacing, as in the first one, the killer is strong enough to tear people apart with his hands and teeth, yet later got his ass kicked in a bar. Also, in the original, they made you feel sympathy for the killer (in the tedious middle part), which seemed out of place. Not so here. Neither movie really gives you any background on the killer or exactly why he does what he does, but it isn't needed, as here he really seems menacing/evil. Really has more of the first HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH films (or BLACK Christmas) feel to it than an actual remake of the first version, but actually a more complete and less disjointed film. Better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days.",When a Stranger Calls

I just saw this movie and I was expecting some light popcorn fluff, old fashioned silly horror --- just entertainment to pass the time. What a disappointment. This film had every cliché that horror films have. And guess what? They did not work. Why? Because they came one right after the other, to the point where I had a hard time believing I was sitting there watching this garbage. And then when something horrible really did happen, 1/2 of the movie had passed. And I thought -- yippeeee, something exciting. But even that did not last long. Why? Because the entire sequence of horror turned cliché. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in the past 10 years, at least. The horror is that this film is such a waste of time and money, to the point where I don't even know how it got out of the studio and into the movie theaters. This is not one of those situations where I would say to go see it just to see how bad a film can be. If anyone did that based on bad reviews, I would feel so sorry for him/her.

237,budwheizzah,"Fun little bundle of thrills, but could have been better",5,30 December 2006,"First off, this movie gets my props on a very important aspect: I could stand five minutes in an elevator and meet more people than there are in this movie. For a feature that is based on a girl, a phone and a house, the creators did a pretty damn good job.Additionally, Camilla could have pulled off her role even if the movie had been silent. Her eyes are so expressive they tell everything and her performance just drags you into the thrills. I think she's going to build a career on this one.Being a fan of very intense and senseless horror, I believe this movie could have taken it up a notch or two on the crazy scale (and also on the rating). For one, the killer didn't have enough ""fun"". I believe the children should have gone with the others in the house. While watching, I was hoping the parent's bodies were stuffed somewhere in a closet for Jill to find. Imagine the horror of seeing Jill opening the box the children hide in simply to find them chopped apart in a bloodbath! (I hear that in the original version of this movie, made in 1979, the kids get it bad) ...Then down the hall, swings a door open, poof, the mom's body pops out and falls to the ground. And then the doctor's body stuffed somewhere else like in the fridge. After that, the viewer would have felt like the character Jill: Really alone. Her, the house, and the madman.It was a bit pointless of the creators of this feature to yank down the content to PG13... It won't make a single difference since I don't believe kids will watch this flick, parents or no parents. However, for the younger, horror movie beginner, this one might be an excellent pick! (which may prove that PG13 wasn't THAT a bad idea) A five? Simply because I couldn't give 5.5/10... And why 5.5? Simply because there are a few goofs that at some point made me wonder if there were two bad guys, room for more disturbing thrills and maaaan, when you have such a sick killer in the house preying on the residents, please leave blood puddles around your damn bodies! Overall, I say ""Cool, worth watching, but don't get your hopes TOO high"".Wish the DVD had a choice between PG13 version and R version.

The idea is old, done routinely. Guys pull a prank on some phone in the cellar, and the girl finds out it's IN HER HOUSE'. The entire film is about the main characters being chased.

The house has an alarm system fitted which can sense when somebody is near the house so I am guessing that the 'Stranger' was already inside the house?

I personally liked it much better than the original, because while that was only suspenseful at the beginning and the end, this has chills all the way through. From the beginning scene to the end scene at the hospital, this movie is tense, suspenseful, and frightening. This film has a much better ear for dialogue and more insight to the character Jill. The house is more interesting as well as Jill herself, because in this movie she is up and about and ready for action, whereas in the original she just sits around waiting for the phone to ring. You actually fear for her and with her. Camilla Belle is perfect for the role, because she just portrays the emotion so well. She is expressing horror, despair, and terror. The fear on her face looks completely real, which is rare in horror films. She has the audience spellbound for the whole experience. Belle carries the film beautifully on her own without much help from other characters. Her performance is much more realistic than that of Carol Kane. Her exotic looks are another appealing factor. She has one good career ahead of her. The music is less unique than that of the original, but it's better and creepier. As for the stranger, he is mysterious, mesmerizing, terrifying. Everything a good villain should be. The audience is transfixed when the phone rings and he whispers to Jill in the dark. When the automatic lights mysteriously turn on and off, a chill will run through your spine. The effect of hiding his face without a cheesy mask worked, and when it's finally revealed at the end, it's... well it's scary. The movie ends with a bang, and leaves the audience stunned. So all in all, very creepy, much better than the original. 7/10",When a Stranger Calls
241,Master_Prophet,One of the worst films ever made about nothing...,1,23 June 2006,"Let me first start this off by saying that I have never been compelled to write a review of any film on IMDb, besides maybe Batman Begins, for it's sheer brilliance. But perhaps there comes along a film that is so god-awful, that you just have to comment on it. With that being said, ""When A Stranger Calls"" is a remake of the 1979 movie in which I have never seen. This new remake is probably one of the most boring and pointless movies I have ever seen. It starts off good with a cop investigating a grizzly murder, however, from there it just goes south. Camilla Belle plays Jill Johnson, a high schooler who has just gone over her cell phone minutes (800 over to be exact) and is being punished by no driving or phone privileges. She then gets the babysitting dream job at a very huge mansion in which the children are asleep. Through out the next 85 minutes, she'll be thrown into a cat-and-mouse game with a stranger that is just flat out unscary. The movie trys to build up for a grand finish that, well, disappoints.My biggest problem with this film: there is no ending. It doesn't end. We don't get any closure. There's no explanation as to who the stranger is, why he's calling, what happened to him ,and more importantly, why Jill is in the hospital at the end. She wasn't that banged up.So do yourself a favor and skip this rotten piece of trash.",When a Stranger Calls
242,musicmunki23,Soooooooooo Unrealistic,2,20 May 2006,"I watched this movie last night at a sleepover with my friends. It scared most of them -insert screams of junior high girls here- but I found it completely unrealistic. So maybe these movies aren't usually realistic. This one had wayyyyy to many flaws. I'll get to them in a minute. First I'd like to explain the movie so that the flaws will make since if you haven't seen it.'When A Stranger Calls' is basically the story of a teenage girl (16) named Jill. Her parents force her to babysit to pay off her phone bill since she went way over her minutes. She gets to the house to discover that it is stocked full of EVERYTHING and that the kids are already asleep. It seems like the perfect babysitting job until she starts getting strange calls. She tries calling her parents, with no luck, and gets cut off while talking to her friends. When this guy continues to call, she calls the police. They say that it is going to be okay and then she says something about seeing the maid's car when she thought the maid was gone. A ""friend"" of hers, Tiffany, stops by and they try to talk about how Tiffany kisses Jill's boyfriend. Blah, blah, blah. Tiffany finally leaves (noting to Jill that she got in through the open garage door) and we see her attempting to leave. It takes a little while to get her car to start, and then she finds a tree branch in the driveway, blocking her path. She goes to move it, and stuff moves to make you think it is a trap. The guy keeps calling, and finally he asks 'Have you checked the children?'. Jill goes to check them, and once she gets downstairs the stranger calls again, this time asking 'How are the children?' She goes to close the curtains, and then calls the cops (almost hyperventilating) saying that the caller can see her. They tell her to keep him on the line for at least 50 seconds so they can trace it. She sees someone moving in the guesthouse (she was told that the college-age son often stays there) and tries to call. No answer. She goes over. The stranger calls her there. (different number) Finally after a long boring part with dumb ""scary"" music and her running frantically the police call and say ""We've traced the call. He's inside the house! Get out now! Do you hear-"" She's up in an upstairs bathroom by now and suddenly all of the power goes out. She looks down and sees a cell phone light blinking on and off. By it is the dead body of Tiffany. She runs to the children's room to find them hiding in the toy box. The look up and see the stranger. The rest is just a bunch of ""scary"" music and her and the stranger chasing each other and stuff. In the end he is arrested and she goes insane.Now for the flaws. First off, how did the 'stranger' get the number for that house. You could say that he got it off of Tiffany's phone, except that he calls her before Tiffany arrives. How did he get the number for the guest house? That, I guess, you could write off with the fact that it was on the refrigerator. If he was in the house he could have gotten it there. And in several scenes where she's freaking out you see his shadow outside behind her. How did he get in without setting off the alarm. Yes, the alarm did go off at one point. But he is seen outside after that.Another thing that got me: as her father was dropping her off at first, he said that he didn't want her out alone at midnight. Yet he leaves her out in the middle of nowhere (about 20 minutes away from ppl according to the police on the phone) for 'several' hours. Plus at the start of the movie you see another killing about 125 miles away that leads you to believe that he is doing this several places. (this is verified later in the movie by the cops) If the cops knew that it was going on so close, they would have paid more attention to her first call. She leaves the code to the security system by the security box thing. Any sane person would keep it with them. She also isolates herself in small rooms. If she were that scared she would want to stay where there was space to move around. Also, if you don't want silence alone, go get the kids. Yes, they may not be of much help (waking them up would probably stir stuff up) but at least you'd know where they were. And the kids were hiding in the toybox, as if they knew that there was someone in the room (he was visible) but he didn't kill them like several others.All in all, don't waste your time with this movie. The ending is horrible, it is full of flaws (prolly more then I listed) and the scariest parts are in the trailer. Watch that instead.",When a Stranger Calls

Our lead heroine Jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller. Every cliché in the world is used here from the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime.

244,Jijjin2004,"Not bad, but not really great either....",6,16 September 2007,"When a Stranger Calls, it was a 1979 classic horror movie. Now a remake was made, can it live to it's expectations? Well, that's one problem. This movie passes as a sequel and a movie, but unfortunately not as a true remake of the 1979 classic. The biggest problem, and I'm sure almost everyone knows this one, is that the previews and trailers practically spoil the whole movie. So for those who never watched the classic, you really don't have to watch the movie because of all those previews. The worst thing the previews spoiled was when the officer revealed that the stranger was inside the house. That took away any suspense it had in the beginning of the movie. Plus after watching those previews, you don't have to guess what happens next. The next big problem was the elements to a horror movie. Horror movies and what it takes to scare people are obviously different nowadays, they should've worked more on the suspense, and the actual horror. Unfortunately there won't be a lot of things that are ""scary"", and not a lot to even make you flinch. The acting is okay, and the music in the background was good. The filming was good, and basically the other stuff were okay. I liked how, even though this wasn't the best movie, had those afterthoughts like the Ring. What if you were alone in your house and a stranger calls? ... Lol. Overall, this movie was not bad... but not that great either. This movie is either a rent or if you have a Stars' channel, find it and watch it from there.",When a Stranger Calls
245,lil_m1ss_un1ver5e,Better than the original,9,25 March 2006,"I've seen both movies and I saw without a doubt the re-make is the best, I know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re-make, but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, It was so good I'm going to see it again tonight, the original creeped me out because they kill the children, i mean who does that in movies anyway....but in this one the children have at least half a chance...The only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter (Jill) Walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone, clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting, so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie, and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense, i don't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it, i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original, it would be a better movie for teenagers, as it displays things that most of us are scared of, but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it, and they enjoyed it, if they enjoyed it i think you will to!

246,tylakar,The Super-Stranger,2,7 March 2016,"I just saw this film the other night for the second time. The first time I watched was over 5 years ago. I remember it not being very good, so I wanted to see and confirm if this was the case. It was.*****Spoiler Alert******The film starts off with the baby sitter arriving at the rich peoples houses (I can't be bothered mentioning names) and it goes downhill from there. We do not even see the children until near the end, and the killer; he is super-human, until he gets to the babysitter. Anyway most people have already discussed the story and acting, so I will just get onto what annoyed me most.The house uses a secure alarm system that requires a code for entry. This was activated while the Dr was at home, so how did the killer get inside to kill the Rosa the maid??? And how did he do it so cleanly without being noticed?Then we have her friend, Tiffany, enter the house and surprise her, via an open garage door that connects to the house WTF??? I am sure the alarm system is advanced enough to tell us if one of the main entrances is open.Worst still, when Tiffany leaves the house and gets into her car it suddenly won't start WTF??? She's got a Toyota, the same model I had, and I never had issues starting it. Anyway, there is a branch blocking the entrance, so she has to get out of her car. Then she gets hunted by the killer who moves at super speed, so she never sees it coming. After this the film gets even stupider, if that was even possible.So our babysitter sees the guest house light come on, and decides to leave the relative safety of the main house, go through the creepy forest which has a magical wind blowing through it, to the said house. WTF??? Why would she even want to do this? She was a scared teenager a few seconds ago, and now she's going Rambo??? Needless to say she returns to the house, and the killer is there. Now how did he go from the guest house to the main house completely undetected and enter without the alarm code? More importantly the house is absolutely massive. How did he know all the rooms and locations so well? Did he have psychic powers or study the mansion plans prior to this attack? Obviously that would have been impossible, as there was no way he could be anticipating a babysitter would be there alone. Anyway, I won't waste any more time here. I give it a 2 star only for production value. The rest is simply not worth it, and I will not be watching it a third time. Avoid if you can.",When a Stranger Calls
247,anticaria,extremely-effective suspense!,8,5 March 2006,"before i go any further, let me clarify that, although i have given this movie 8 stars out of 10, i would actually give it 10 stars out of 10 if i were rating the sheer merit of the 'suspense factor' alone. at any rate, after reading the great majority of scathing comments on this movie, i went to see it with extremely low expectations, only to be quite pleasantly surprised. the movie delivered suspense, mood, and atmosphere by the truckload, and, even more surprising of all for this 'teen-aged' type genre, style. from start to finish, the viewer is relentlessly immersed in suspense so thick, rich, and stylish, that you can literally hear your heart beating. i personally found myself nearly gripping the armrest of my seat throughout most of it. yes, the atmosphere is that absorbing and gripping. let's face it, no one went to see this movie for the 'fresh' plot or premise. it's been done before and quite effectively too in the original. this remake merely aims to up the ante and make 'suspense' the real centerpiece of the show. i honestly can't imagine what some of you folks were expecting in panning this film for somehow failing to be the cinematic masterpiece of its genre, the citizen kane of 'baby-sitter' horror, if you will. seriously people, get a grip. it's just a horror flick. besides, this remake is all about the suspense, the suspense, the suspense, ... get it? and in that regard, it delivers beautifully. the acting was perfectly effective as well. the one thing i would've done slightly differently is not center the plot quite so much around the teen-aged leading actor's high school angst, although even that aspect of it wasn't totally overdone and seemed reasonably bearable and non-intrusive in the end. i guess, overall, i prefer a more adult, mature feel to my suspense flicks. however, considering the 'baby-sitter' premise, some teen-age angst seemed inevitable. all in all, i would place this remake in the 'extremely serviceable guilty pleasure' category. i don't know how some of you feel about this, but i would've also done without the 'have you checked the children?' line. it somehow comes off as too much of an 'overt' and distracting borrowing from the original. perhaps a slight paraphrasing would've been more effective. finally, unlike what some of you may feel who have not yet seen this movie, the fact that we know beforehand that the calls are coming from inside the home actually makes the anticipation and suspense all the more unbearable. so please don't let the negative reviews on this site keep you from going to see it at the theater. you'll be quite pleasantly and 'suspensefully' surprised. besides, something this masterfully suspenseful should be appreciated in a theater.",When a Stranger Calls
248,CinemanBear,Wake Up Horror Filmmakers!,3,23 February 2006,"I don't mind remakes at all, but this one was poorly executed! The good news: I do think it was a wonderful idea to remake only the memorable opening scene of the original. The bad news: why did the filmmakers feel the need to distract us with some elaborate high-tech lake house and a bunch of red herrings that never panned out into anything? The answer: because they were trying to make up for the fact that their story had more holes in it than a pasta strainer. Reality check: why does a couple as wealthy as the Mandrakis' feel the need to hire a high school babysitter who isn't even smart enough to make the majority of her cell phone calls past 8pm? Do they have a nanny? Was the nanny on vacation? Why couldn't the maid take time out from feeding the fish to keep an eye on the kids for a couple of hours? In my opinion, Camilla Belle wasn't strong enough an actress to carry a film in which she primarily has to react to everything around her. She seemed to only be capable of delivering one reaction and one emotion. She showed no range in this film. The only actor to show any far-reaching emotion was ""The Stranger"" himself in the final scene when he stares down Jill and you finally get to see his face. That might as well be more attributed to placing yourself in that moment and feeling that chill more than anything. That's all I really have to say about the acting aspect of this film.I really do wish that horror filmmakers will wake up and stop delivering these watered-down PG-13 films to the general public and passing them off as horror films.",When a Stranger Calls

I don't know if what I'm going to say in the next few lines are actually spoilers, but just to be one the safe side, I marked it as one. First of all, when you go to a strange house to baby-sit, you don't open the door if someone starts shaking it like crazy! Second, if the phone rings more than once with no one talking, just breathing like they're a maniac, you don't pick it up every time they call and try to sweet talk them!!! And you don't go to the guest house when there's really strong wind and run though the forest to get there when it's dark and scary and anyone could jump out of the trees and kill you, just because you think the maid is in there! What about the kids? Isn't that the whole point of baby-sitting, to stay with them and watch them when they're parents are away to make sure nothing happens?! You don't go looking for the maid! WTF??!! And this movie is SO predictable!! She's in the aviary and she's see the lights turning on in the rooms and them it's really the cat that is coming down the stairs, but then when she turns around, he's right behind her!!! So there you have it, this movie is retarded and boring, and WAY to predictable! Even Hostel has a better rating than this movie! It has a 5.8, not a 4.3. And people say that movie sucked! No way!

When A Stranger Calls (1979), has all the hallmarks of a dull telefilm. That's the truth. Aside from the opening and closing sequences, not a whole lot happens in the middle, and what does happen really isn't very interesting.When A Stranger Calls (2006) is quite honestly, not that much different to the original in that aside from the opening and closing sequences, not a whole lot happens in the middle. Only this time we have an ultra modern house to give you the willies and some obnoxious teenagers with endless cell phone budgets, and nary a pimple in sight. There was one thing that irked me, like the fact that she never once goes upstairs to check the kids she's supposed to be babysitting. Not once! In total, WASC, 2006 is typical modern horror. PYT TV stars, a reasonable budget, and some thrills and chills without being OTT, after all, we have to cater for the PG-13 crowd, don't we? I like modern horror, and I liked this. It wasn't the best horror film I've seen in years, but it was far from being the worst, and it didn't have to be racist, pornographically violent or misogynistic in achieving it's goals, which it does reasonably well. For that, it is to be commended.",When a Stranger Calls

Unfortunately this movie didn't interest me in the slightest, I felt everything was going to fast, and I you didn't get to know the characters very well, even the main character, Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle. I have to admit, I was wondering what was going to happen next after every scene, and what was going to happen at the end, which was the part I was disappointed in. There were some annoying bits, like why did it take the police so long to get there when they found out the stranger was in the house?, it was very convenient that they turned up at the end. Other than this the movie did have its good points, Camilla Belle is a terrific actress, and the story line was great, I think they just try-ed to finish it off to quickly.

I had almost given up hope till I saw this film. Yes, it is based on an old urban myth, phone ringing, it's a killer etc, still doesn't take away what is good from this film.What I think is best about this film, is the intensity of the suspense. The only person we see on screen for a good portion of the film is the babysitter, which is an amazing experience, as we see things from her perspective and not the killers, giving more suspense as we the audience have no clue where this person is, or who he is. This is not done in other films I have seen, which takes away the effect, seeing the killings and some of the actions of the killer, making it like we are observing the action, not almost being a part of it.There is however this some what irritating back story of the babysitters love life with her ex boyfriend, which is possibly not necessary. That and some of the acting brings a mark down for this film.Besides that, I think that this style of filming horrors and thrillers is the way forward for the genre, directed away from the numerous clichés we have seen before.",When a Stranger Calls

I love being scaredThe feeling of adrenaline as I hold my breath, imagining if it were me, and being thankful that it's not is exhilarating.When the trailer came out for When a Stranger Calls I was intrigued, but I thought it looked a little too hokey for me. The trailer was good, but to me that meant that they made it look that good for a reason. I ignored it when it went to the theater, but the other day I was on Yahoo I'm and some guy began telling me how great it was.According to this guy, it was not super scary, but it was very shock scary. It was one of those movies that made you jump. Okay, he won. We decided to watch it. I wanted to find out what the hype was about, so I rented it from the local Blockbuster, curled up in Dom's arms, and prepared myself for a jumpy flick.About halfway through the opening scenes, I determined that the guy I talked to had no testicles. There were so many problems with this movie I don't know where to begin. The ""scary"" portion of this movie makes no sense. I recommend if you want to see this movie then you stop reading because there are SPOILERS below.------------------------------The killer in the movie targets babysitters and younger women. The house he got into would have cost well over a few million dollars. So, it would stand to reason that on a school night this particular house would have a babysitter, right?Nonot right. What are we supposed to believe that this random guy just happened to pick the right mansion? That is a little too much considering the house was out in the middle of nowhere.Next problem and perhaps the biggest one was the lead character. It seemed a tad unnatural how everything scared her. I don't know if it was overacting on her part or if she was just really in character, but things bothered her.easily. The lights would go on or off (due to automatic lighting) and she'd gasp. She took a poker into the kitchen because she heard a noise. Did I mention she shook with fear the entire way? However, the burglar alarm goes off and she tells people it's cool and they don't need to find out what was going on. Sure, that makes sense.Unlike what I was told, I didn't feel any jumps and the only thing frightening was the movie as a whole, not the plot. I recommend if you want to see something scary that was made around the same time watch The Hills have Eyes, now that was just frightening.Note: This is the 2006 version not the 1979 version which I've heard is good.Originally Published on Monday, July 17, 2006 Copyright 2006: Dominick Evans and Literary Illusions",When a Stranger Calls

With the overuse of ""creepy"" music you just knew that you were watching a really badly written ""B"" movie and that may be giving this movie more credit than it deserves.

Now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany, ""This is so... high school!"" while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time, I was able to appreciate the movie more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. And I must admit, this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary... We all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen. The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most cliché movies I've ever seen. It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc. At the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, I would give it a 7/10. It's definitely worth seeing.By the way, This is my first review, so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers.. But just to be safe...",When a Stranger Calls
262,eeesoeuoa,When a Cliché calls,3,16 April 2007,"This movie is the standard cliché horror movie, as usual I had a good laugh at how stupid the characters were. I am actually starting to kinda like these cliché movies in a weird way. The stupidity of the characters leaves you thinking they deserve much worse.If you are after scary, this isn't it - it's more a suspense/cliché movie really. If you are bored or just like this kind of thing, check it out. I wouldn't pay money for it though.This has the potential to be a reasonable movie but the fact that the characters repeatedly mad obvious, typical horror movie stupid choices does spoil it really.",When a Stranger Calls
263,Drumski89,This movie was not worth the zero i paid to see it.,1,8 January 2007,"This movie is not good. I couldn't believe how truly obvious the entire movie made itself. Most horror movies are a little obvious, and that's part of the fun of watching them, but this takes the cake, and not only does it take the cake, it eats it, and then throws it up all over your lap in the form of cliché after cliché. The whole cheating boyfriend bit was obviously there to add the cheating friend who comes over and gets killed. Not only did she die, it wasn't even cool. The babysitter character was an idiot, and so was the stranger. ""I want your blood all over me"" or whatever it was that he said was so bad, everyone else that watched it with me laughed hysterically for several minutes. He might as well have said ""I want to have a tea party and ride a pony through the forest,"" because that would have sounded about as menacing. When the babysitter talked to people on the phone, everyone that was watching correctly identified who it would be every time, it was so poorly planned, whenever it seemed like a prank call should happen, right in the middle of the ""suspense"", bingo, it happened. At the end we were disappointed when the killer didn't get babysitter, and everyone else, for that matter. If you have a choice between this and any other movie ever made, watch the other movie!",When a Stranger Calls
264,radulovicka,Why such hate?,6,28 May 2014,"I could see on the forums, as well as by the overall rating, that this movie got some real hate. Now, Camilla Belle is no Carol Kane, by any means, and she's no Jamie Lee Curtis to be able to carry out almost an entire movie by herself, but she's not that bad. This version does differ from the original, especially in the last third of the film. Now, if you saw the original - then you know the major spoiler, the one thing that made the original really scary in the first place. And I agree with some of the reviewers that this is a cliché, but since it is rated PG- 13, I would strongly recommend this to younger viewers who are just entering the amazing world of horror movies. It's contemporary and modern and therefore more relate-able to the younger audience. What disappointed me the most were two things. First, even though Camilla Belle is okay, she lacks that true horror-heroine-quality that could've made this movie into a real gem. Decisions her character made in the movie were believable, and in some cases logical, but her acting was just not convincing enough. Second, they really played it safe and by doing so, stripped the movie of its original horror. The line ""Have you checked the children?"" kind of lost its meaning here by not correlating to the ""stranger's"" motives in the original plot, but I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen the original. So, I'm a bit disappointed because this could've been a really serious re-imagining of a classic, worthy to stand by its own. However, since this is not the case, watch it anyway, 'cause it's fun, but do see the original because it's scary.",When a Stranger Calls
265,Ash-lee,That was it?,2,27 April 2020,"Who was the stranger? What was his motivation? Why that house? Was he after the babysitter, the kids, the parents? The majority of the movie is long, panning shots of scenery with a few scenes of less than half-hearted acting - you'd think they at least could've given us some motivation behind him, even if it was just a ""Because you were home"" type of explanation. The stranger could've been terrifying. I babysat enough in my teens that being alone in a dark, unfamiliar house is fertile ground for scary things to happen, but they just took the cliches and ran with them. Even when she was in the water - were we supposed to be scared? He tried to shove her under with one hand, while I'm yelling at her to grab a finger and break it. I have little tolerance for foolish characters in any form, although she mildly redeemed herself with the final action she took. The movie never got off the ground and left more questions than answers with no real scares. I give it two stars because of the great location/sets and the one mild scare of the first time we see the stranger.",When a Stranger Calls
266,revten,Utterly horrible.,1,21 February 2006,"I work at a movie theater and was forced to watch this entire movie because of troublemakers, and i say this only to show that I would never watch this pile of puke willingly. There were only two things scary about this movie; 1.'The Audience' aka ten year olds, Screaming their heads off every time the camera moved. ""Oh my god! AHH! its a new shot! AHH!!!"" 2. 'The Audience' walking out of this movie and going ""Oh my god that was so scary, it was like the like best like thing like like like ever oh my god like holy cow like so scary oh my god!!!"" I knew this was going to be a bad movie, but i didn't expect this level of crapiness. The movie could have been a pg13 episode on TV, but i guess they decided they wanted to listen to the lead actress breathe like a hyperventilating chihuahua and act as smart as one. Honestly, who would stick around, trying to find someone else's kids while a murderer is stalking you through the house for SIX BUCKS AN HOUR?! Any volunteers? Whos the mysterious stalker? No one. Not even her 3rd cousins Sons Step Fathers Best Friends Co Worker. The Big revealing shot where you see who he is in PAINFULLY slow motion, mostly to fill out time, shows hes some random scarred up guy.I understand you need to suspend some disbelief for any movie, but this one seriously asks too much from everyone.

But anyways on with the story.Jill is a six-teen year old girl who has just gotten grounded for going over her minutes on her cell phone and her parents make her baby-sit instead of going to a bon-fire, when she gets to the house she meets the parents who are trying to leave a-s-a-p, but even more interesting is this beautiful house in which Jill gets to watch the children. After awhile Jill starts to receive phone calls, some time their is just a voice breathing, then after a few more calls and a haunting ""Have you checked the children"" Jill decides to call the police.I don't want to give to much away but if you like the movie Phone Booth, Liberty Stands Still, or Rear Window you'll probably like this.6 out of 10 stars",When a Stranger Calls

There are more characters which makes it more interesting. This movie has more chase scenes in it, unlike the original which basically had one. The set is also a lot more likable. Jill's acting in this one isn't superb, but it's pretty good, and also it seems like she actually cares about the children in this one. The stranger's voice isn't half as scary as the original which is the only downfall. But, you don't see the stranger's face until the end, so it makes him even more scary.

269,creepersdelight90210,Horrible Remake of 1979 Semi-Classic,2,3 March 2006,"Review of: When a Stranger Calls (2006) Plot Synopsis: On a dark and stormy night, teenager Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has to miss a big bonfire with her friends and baby-sit the sleeping children of Mr. & Mrs. Doctor Mandrakis. As the night starts, she's concerned with an incident that occurred between her boyfriend and best-friend, but as the night progresses, she starts getting prank calls from a mysterious man with heavy breathing...and the police are a good twenty minutes away! (Remake of 1979 movie with same title) It's the age of remakesthere's no doubt about it. Some are good, some are bad and some are okay. However, ""bad"" would be a compliment for the inevitable remake of the 1979, semi-classic with the same title as the movie being reviewed. The original When a Stranger Calls was well-written, well-acted, well-paced and certainly very creepy and memorably suspenseful, but was far from great and could have been improved on. Instead, they took it, gave it to a rookie writer and an inept director (who will never be able to achieve anything above mediocrity), and completely ruined the tale for the new generations. For the new version, they basically decided to take the first fifteen/twenty minutes of the original and spread it out for a full feature-length film, with hardly anything new added in. So, this means that most of the time the audience is exposed to Camilla Belle (a very mediocre and very annoying actress, who seems like she struggled with just about every line and not once convinced me that she was scared) walking around this big mansion jumping at every shadow and eating popsicles, with nothing substantial ever really happening. In contrast to the original, they used a big, beautiful, lavish mansion instead of a regular suburban house for a good reason  to use it as a gimmick and try and keep peoples' minds off of the fact that this movie is really, really bad. And in between her talking on a phone, walking into dark rooms and, well, chillin', the Stranger calls about every two-and-a-half minutes, each time liberating his deep, horrifying breath, which adds up to about fifty calls from this moron before the end. Basically, the point I'm getting to, is that the great majority of this movie is BLAND and terribly PLODDING with absolutely no build-up of suspense by the time the ""big revelation"" is revealed at the end, and no offense (well, actually, this is meant to be offensive) but if you haven't ever heard someone on TV or somewhere ever say ""We've traced the calls and they're coming inside the house!"" then you are generally a very ignorant person, and even those that saw the movie not knowing anything about the original version or the old urban legend about the babysitter, won't find the ""big revelation"" at all surprising, since director Simon West and writer Jake Wall made it seem that the Stranger was always in very close proximity to Jill the entire time. And, I might also add, that the supposedly terrifying, sick and maniacal killer that I've been referring to as the Stranger, is a complete FAIRY! In the original, he tore the sleeping children apart with his bare handsnow, if you haven't seen the remake, go and see it to see the fates of the children and tell me which is more likely to happen in real-life. I mean, honestly, most junior-high-schoolers would have been able to give this light-weight a good, swift kick to the mid-section and get away without a scratch. To wrap this review up, the 2006 remake of When a Stranger Calls is very dull, very boring, very unrealistic/illogical, completely predictable and un-shocking (excluding a good, but very-brief opening credit sequence). In its defense, I will say that the sound score (although I'm still dumbfounded as to the reasons why they didn't just use the music from the original, unless there was some legal issues) wasn't half-bad, and, also, Simon West actually did a worthy job as for technical aspects, even if much of it was just there for mere distraction. But, honestly, this movie was just plain horrible. If I hadn't have been with someone I would have walked out on this piece of trash...for the first time in my life.",When a Stranger Calls
270,uberprod,Hitchcock would have been proud!,9,10 December 2006,"Wow! This is a highly entertaining, sitting at the edge of your seat type of film. Brilliantly directed, West delivers thrills and scares with confidence and precision. Despite that for most of the time we just see a teenager on the phone in an dark house, both script and direction kept me engaged and scared. I also think the design of the house and all the moving backgrounds added a lot of suspense. Hitch would have been proud. This is really a well made movie. Hats off to the filmmakers.I disagree that the script is dumb. The story is what it is, and I think it was superbly executed. I bought every motivation and really liked how simplistic the plot unfolded. West, like Zemeckis in What Lies Beneath, made the house a character and the design helped create a terrifying and unsettling atmosphere.Great score, great cast, a lot of suspense and thrilling action make this one for the home collection.My only negative comment would be about the climax. I would have wished for something more exciting or surprising. But the end scene almost makes up for that.Enjoy!",When a Stranger Calls
271,hockeyfreak101,I hated every minute of this movie!,1,22 September 2006,"This movie was terrible. The story line seemed quite interesting at first but still it turned out to be pretty bad. Jill (the horribly wooden Camilla Belle) goes over her cell phone minutes and is forced to babysit for a rich family who lives in a beautiful mansion in the middle of nowhere. It's the perfect job. Nice house to explore, children are asleep, fridge is stocked. Until she starts getting calls from a stranger asking ""have you checked the children?"". Of course you all know, the calls are coming from inside the house.First of all, there was no twist ending. The stranger just ended up being some random serial killer, stalking and murdering young babysitters. The killer and the girl were such idiots. A pointless waste of time.Second, this movie had plot holes the size of Texas. For example, when the police trace Jill's call and find out they are coming from inside the house, why did they not catch on and tell her that there is a serial killer? How did the blonde friend know where the house was? The blonde friend was killed outside, how did her body get in the bathroom of the house? Camilla Belle is one of the worst actresses to ever grace the screen. She was just so bad it was unbelievable. Line after line was delivered without emotion and she had this dumb blank stare constantly on her face.She's pretty though, and her all wet in the pool kept me from falling asleep.1/10.",When a Stranger Calls

Girl: ""Who is this! Stop Calling Me!""... {Hang Up} <~ just repeat that for about an hour or so. Then the last half hour was incredible. Lots of suspense, action, thrills. The entire theater screamed a few times, mainly because it was a bunch of girls, but it was fun. I would say wait till it come out on DVD. This movie really isn't worth the money to go see on theaters, and there's no such effects that make it a must see on the big screen. Plus, there are so many clichés it made my head spin! Drop keys, weird noises, disappearing people. The cat is a key actor in this movie also, probably a better actress then Jill (lead actress).

This version for the most part was good but what really lacked and brought the film down was the writing. Jake Wade Wall must be new at writing horror screenplays because this film barely passes on a simple level. The cinematography was great. The colors of the clothing,make-up, backgrounds was really nicely messed together and this film had a good idea but it meet bad writing. The acting was good it wasn't anything amazing, but it was better than just OK. The ending was suspenseful and there were some effective scare techniques and there was some comedic lines. Overall don't go into this movie thinking that it will be amazing, because then you will come out disappointed, but if you go in expecting a remake, which will receive terrible movie reviews, you might have a good time and enjoy this film.

To add to that, the acting is probably some of the worst I've seen in a long time, Camilla Belle, in my opinion, is probably one of the worst actresses Hollywood has to offer right now and I hope to not see her in any serious role again. Then there is the plot, to begin with it's extremely paper-thin with absently no depth, the string of events that are supposed to be ""frightening"" in the movie made me laugh at wow badly the script was written and how even worse it was performed. Oh and not to mention that terrible ending...Overall everything in this movie just crashes & burns. The only reason I gave this 3/10 and not a one is because, 1. I give it credit for being so much more entertaining than the original, which was a total bore - 2. Since I found the movie so hilariously stupid, it was very entertaining!Bad Acting. Bad Script.

The problem was there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming over to be killed. It was obvious they were just killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotion during this movie. She was just there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat.

CONTAINS SPOILERS? (i think)Apparently the premise is the old urban legend where the girl is babysitting and answers the phone, to find the stranger breathing heavy and spying on her. Then he says ""have you checked the children?"" and she calls the police, only to find when they trace the call that the call is coming... from inside the house!

But no, there was nothing more to it than that. They just stretched a lame, trite, overused concept to the length of the movie. It's full of every horror cliché in the book. I thought there was no way a movie like this COULD have been made post-Scream, after someone finally took what we ALL had observed from horror movies, slapped it on the screen, and said, ""Ok, Hollywood.

Lots of tension, moody lighting and good filming made this an enjoyable film to watch. The limited number of cast also helps to close the world in around them particularly the main character so you do start to feel 'uncomfortable' for them in that situation. It's easy to put yourself into the place of the character & you start to experience a real sense of unease!!!

Totally unrealistic, poorly made, and just overall had a bad plot. It was not at all scary. There were some parts that made you jump, only because they were surprising, but it was not at all scary. This is also one of those movies with extended meanings. The ending was totally bogus, only because it is not clear. There are two meanings to the ending and it leaves way too much to the imagination. Don't waste your money, especially if it is your own personal money and not your parent's or something. If you're going to see it, at least have someone else pay for it because it is NOT worth almost ten dollars. I have to admit though, there was some good acting. Not the best I have seen, but under the circumstances, it was well done. I must say though, the dead scenes were almost too poorly made. I also do not like how they try to make it scarier then it was. There were totally pointless scenes in the movie, which they could have replaced with something better. Also, the movie could have been a bit more gory. The sickest part of the movie was probably the end, and that's it. You do not even get to see any of the good stuff, which i think is completely bogus. I mean, if people are going to see a scary movie, they are going to expect blood, but there is hardly any!!!

This alludes to scary music playing in the background and ends with a cat jumping out of a dark room, sprinkler turning on, or clothes on a hanger placed behind a door.

She uses all of her smarts to outwit him at every turn and gets out safely, after a climatic fight scene (of course). The cops arrive at exactly the right moment and the parents arrive home to find their children safe and sound.

In the end of the movie they didn't explain anything about the man, how did he know she would be there alone that specific day, and why couldn't he tear apart the girl if he could do it to the other 15 victims?

The remake of When A Stranger Calls is what you'll get. I don't think I'm overdoing it by saying that, because that's exactly how I felt after seeing this. Talk about an extreme waste of a good idea. I was terrified by the original when I first saw it, but these days, I can see the flaws and I was all for a remake, but not THIS remake. Watch the original if you want some chills and thrills with your horror film. This is nothing but an example of how Hollywood has no clue how to terrify audiences today.",When a Stranger Calls

It had something most modern ""horror"" movies don't have; atmosphere. Instead of torture porn, and gratuitous buckets of blood thrown everywhere, this movie instead scares by what you DON'T see. What's lurking in the shadows, what might be hiding behind the door....this is so much more frightening than cheesy gross-out scenes. With very little gore, this film managed to be terrifying because it seemed like something that could really happen. The only beef I had with it were a few scenes where the Jill character acted in ways I didn't find believable (if she thought there was someone crazy spying on her, would she REALLY leave the house to go investigate the dark and spooky outdoors?) but overall I found it a spooky and highly enjoyable watch.",When a Stranger Calls

There are many parts in the movie that will either have you screaming or on the edge of your seat. In a way, it can make you feel like you're in the house with the killer with the baby sitter. Another good thing is that there isn't any gore. That way people with weak stomachs can watch the movie to. This movie is cleverly made. It makes you think something will happen and then it doesn't. The suspense is there the whole time and never leaves. The ending leaves you with a chill.

292,Slasher_N_Basher,A perfect gateway slasher movie.,6,22 February 2019,"Yes, it lacks many of the things I enjoy when it comes to slasher movies, but the atmosphere and prolonged sense of foreboding were brilliantly crafted. This was like one long continuous cat-and-mouse scene played out over the course of the whole runtime. Which sounds like it could be redundant after the first 30 minutes, but it really wasn't. I think a lot of this has to do with Camilla Belle being perfectly cast here. She was nothing short of amazing in this role, and looked and acted like she was just pulled from a babysitting gig to do this movie. This is essentially a one-man band (one-woman band) riffing some Hendrix for 90 minutes, and it did not disappoint.This is one of those strange movies that gets a pass from me, even though it lacks so much of what makes a slasher a slasher.

Too bad she and her friends didn't have Verizon as none of the cell phones worked well in this movie. 70 minutes into the movie, trying really hard to stay awake, I'm still waiting for something to happen.If you like a lot of shots of an attractive young actress looking scared, this is a great movie.

I wish they would have made that fact that the killer had killed more people more obvious. Thats really it. Not bad, but in no means great. I thought there was an adequate amount of suspense, but you need to go to the movie wanting to be scared. Too many people go to horror movies expecting to be scared and when they aren't they blame the movie. That is a sign of a lazy moviegoer. You have to want to get emotional during some movies for them to work. If you've never done it, try it next time. A hypnotist can't do his/her job unless you want to be hypnotized.

We put the movie on at 11:00 at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it. I screamed five times which is unusual for me as I get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream.All of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason)would get us. I played a mean trick; one everyone was all dozing off once Rat Race was over I hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly ""HAVE YOU CHECKED THE CHILDEN?"" They all SCREAMED like nuts and were so scared. All in all I would rate this movie a 9. The only thing I didn't like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and 2. The kids never woke up during the whole thing until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies.

The cast were labeled as the typical moronic type that the world can do without in the first place. Another idiot teenage girl who gets scared answering a phone?? There was no background into the killer either, so we learned nothing at all about his motives, or even really his method of killing, I presumed it was all done by hand.Goofs: *When the house had the power cut the pump for the fish pond was still working. *When the house had the power cut the cordless phone handset also went dead??? *The house was supposed to be ultra modern and high tech and secure, yet in the children's room there are floor level windows that weren't locked that they can simply crawl through to fall onto the level below??This was a sad development and not worth the time it takes to view.",When a Stranger Calls

300,ArtTalentFairy,Just hang up already ...,3,22 October 2006,"This movie isn't scary, chilling, or spine-tingling. If anything it is a hilarious, and not in a good way. It's nice to finally see a scary movie that doesn't involve a bloodbath, but it doesn't help that the teenager is so freaking stupid, and that the house she happens to be baby-sitting at is some glorious lake house in the middle of nowhere, or that she's dealing with a cheating boyfriend, a backstabbing friend, and being punished for a high cell phone bill. I liked the beginning with that carnival and phone calls because it's a chilling preview of what's going to happen to Jill, but after that it all goes downhill. First off, why would a family with a maid need a babysitter? Why does Jill turn off the alarm and automatically assume that the maid accidentally set it off? Why didn't she have the police check things out? And why after the umpteenth time the stranger calls she finally closes the blinds and/or shades? And why didn't she just hang up?

It's not the acting, but the storyline and the fact that this simple storyline can't really last for that long without getting boring.

No gore, no blood, just absolutely INCREDIBLE directing and sound. Belle is amazing in this movie. The acting is so believable, natural and real. The setting and the light effects are out of this world and create the most ominous scary setting seen in a movie.What I really enjoyed was the amount of time the suspense scenes were dragged on for. Also, the creativity and non main-stream scare techniques that were used, Such as the ""open-fridge-close fridge-killer appears behind fridge door"" technique. This technique was used, and suspension was truly built up, but the killer didn't appear behind the door, which just plain and simply made you're heart drop to you're feet!

304,Jason_LR,not that bad of a movie,6,25 October 2009,"The differences between this movie and it's original are pretty vast. Disregarding which one is best, I don't understand the kind-of low ratings this one has.About the original WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, Of course everyone thinks highly of it because it's the original and everything, but I mean, comparing it to other horror flicks from that time, it's probably one of the worst of the bunch, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good horror movie, but I think that what gives it that tick is the slam-bangin' beginning, which has you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and the ending part which is not as good as the beginning, but it's pretty eerie all the same. That movie started with a great bang, and kinda raises one's expectations for it to be as good as it's beginning, and it's kind of a letdown, the whole detective-searches-for-the-escaped-lunatic part is just boring, with no suspense and no twist what so ever. And, as good as the first part of the movie was, it doesn't compensate for the overall tiredness of the rest of the flick.About this one, Although not having the upside of being an original and failing in having the fall-down-from-your-seat start, this movie grabs you tight (not extremely but enough to make you kind of shiver) and barely lets go. Grant it, it doesn't have much character depth, and the story could use a tune-up, and the acting wasn't the best, but you know what, it kind of worked, for a movie like this. The flaws of this movie consist in many things, the ""stranger"" for one, he is just that, a stranger who harasses girls. He is introduced very poorly in the beginning when we only hear the babysitter and the calls, and his background is never brought up once, (we find out that he is responsible for 15 murders, and stalking women, etc.). The house wasn't that creepy, (it was too modern) and the fact that the action revolved all around that same place, is just tiresome. Also, the family had a housekeeper, why in hell do they need a babysitter? The facts that the kids stayed alive in this one was somewhat ridiculous, I mean, don't get me wrong, but I think that she would be more scarred and didn't know what to do if she entered their room and found it filled with blood from the kids. The phone calls weren't nearly as creepy as the original calls. Also, in this one it's suggested that the killer also murdered his victims with his own hands, but it just seems that he strangles them. In the original he ripped them open, and I think that that worked a lot better.All in all, this movie, although it's flaws and not being as great as the original, I don't get why it only has 4,7 stars of rating here, it was a pretty well constructed flick that doesn't try to be anything else than what it is.",When a Stranger Calls

Not once did she check on the children - until she was convinced a stalker was on the property and was going to flee? Jamie Leigh Curtis that girl is not! Now I know that the mother kept repeating ""their sick, their monsters, don't wake them"" but that shouldn't have stopped her from occasionally opening the door and taking a peek on the kids.

It was based on creepy phone calls (along with other calls to throw the damsel in distress off) and things that go bump in the night (like black cats and sprinklers). I don't think I've ever seen a movie with this many clichés. At least the Freddy and Jason movies could formulate some type of motive. The house would have made a good special on TLC or something, but that was the only redeeming feature of the movie. In the lead-up to the climax of the movie, the girl running reminded me of the naked girl in Scary Movie who frantically runs toward death instead of safety.

The house it is set in is beautiful and I was mad at myself for being sucked into the jump scares. The main character to me wasn't very likable though and I was rooting for her death which unfortunately never came, and I would like to have seen more of the killer and there to have been more than a motive rather than he was just a psycho killer. The ending was garbage and again was upset the the main character didn't die.

313,droogie6655321-1,Plagued by bad choices,3,10 February 2006,"This contains what might be called spoilers, but if you're familiar at all with the story or the movie this remake was based on, then you won't miss out on anything.The movie was just plagued with the bad choices of the filmmakers. The first big mistake, and this is a classic horror movie mistake, they didn't make the lead person interesting. She was just this bland, no-namer with nothing remarkable about her. The only thing she did well was her ""Oh, I can't believe I was scared of THAT"" face, which, believe me, was used a lot.The only other thing she had going for her was that she actually resembled a teenage babysitter, so there was at least good casting that way. I wouldn't have bought Kiera Knightly or Kate Beckinsdale (or however you spell their names) as teenage babysitters.Mistake number 2: Too too many fake-out scares. 90 percent of the scares in this movie were fake-outs. There were so many of them that by the time the real scares came, you were too desensitized to care.I don't like fake-out scares as a rule because they're expected from today's horror movie audiences. It's pretty much guaranteed that the first few scares of any movie (particularly those aimed at the 14- through 18-year-old bracket) will be fakes.You know the ones: ""Oh, oh... I'd better go investigate that scary sound! Uh-oh, I'm almost there, I'm really scared and so is the scary music! ... Oh, look! It was just a cute little puppy!"" These kind of scares are usually followed by a real scare, but not in this movie.Mistake number 3: A ho-hum bad guy. They brought in the guy from that failed Fox Network ""X-Files"" clone ""Millenium"" to do the voice, and it didn't work. Yeah, he sounded old and gravelly, but it didn't feel like a voice she should be scared of. When there's a creepy voice on the other end of the phone, you shouldn't be thinking that it might just be the main character's grandpa calling to check up on her.Mistake number 4: They made this movie PG-13. Yes, I know now may be a weird point to bring this up, but by the time she finally does check on the children, she finds out they're OK! And in a PG-13 movie, they pretty much have to be. You can't kill kids unless you're making an R-rated movie, I think.But the scariest part of the story as it was told to me was that the kids were dead when she went upstairs and probably had been for a long time. But nobody integral to the story died in this movie except a Mexican maid (which are OK to kill in any movie -- I think there was a maid from Guadalahara who was axed in Disney's ""Cinderella"") and the forgettable main character's equally forgettable friend. Oh, and the intro kill, but I think that's everyone.Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's better not to show it. I think they did the right thing by not showing much of the intro kill. Leaves it up to your imagination. But when I saw that they were planning to spare the baby-sat kids -- both of them -- I knew this movie had no hope. Kill the kids, and make the scene hit me really friggin' hard, or this story will not play out to its fullest potential.And the last mistake, the one that really stuck with me (probably the only thing that stuck with me) was the bad-guy reveal. OK, he's being carried away in a cop car (and if you've seen the original, this is not a spoiler), and there's a slow pan past his shadow-covered face. Then, through the glare of someone's headlights, you see.... You see....! No one who will mean anything to you.And they linger on Nobody the Killer's face for about five minutes, allowing the fact that you don't give a rat's ass to really sink in.Unless the killer is someone important, keep his face off the screen! Better yet, keep most of his body off the screen, too. Make him like a shadowy force of nature. An unstoppable cloud of doom that can't be fought back against.Again, this movie is just one more of a long list of movies that makes me realize what a great film ""Black Christmas"" was.

I know that I wouldn't let Jill's character babysit anyone any time soon... She never even met the kids until it's time to save them, and she lets them fend for themselves, time after time. First she leaves the house - and the kids - altogether, in a pointless move to the guest house. Then she has them go in the water - again alone. Then they fend for themselves outside! It's crazy. So much of this movie doesn't make sense. You'll leave confused and angry for paying for boredom.

""I was so bored!"" I've heard that the original 1979 version of ""When a Stranger Calls"" is pretty terrifying... why not see that one instead??",When a Stranger Calls

You think someones gonna jump out, they do. there is no explanation to who the killer is or why he does what he does. Just except it. Waste your money for a hour of your time. Horrable film!!!! Caution! never see this movie load of crap! the main actor is alright, she does an OK job hope to see her again. I hope this movies is a lesson in what not to make films about. The remake business is getting stale. Well it has now for sure. I think this one put a nail in the coffin on remakes. Id rather watch paint dry on a wall then to watch this movie again.

317,hogsmeadeweb,Scary? Pfft.,5,4 March 2006,"I walked into the theater hoping to be scared to death.Boy was I disappointed.I felt the intenseness of the situation at hand, director Wes Craven hits it big again. But the overall plot line was not as scary as I would have hoped. Some things you knew were coming, like Rosa being dead. She obviously hadn't left the house. And there were too many coincidences. Like before Mrs. Mendrakas leaves the house, she tells the girl ""Oh and don't worry if there is any noise upstairs..."". Of coarse not, its a horror movie. This movie, overall, made me expect the unexpected and the overall shock value was not that good. But I liked the movie, especially at the beginning when they first intoduced the creepy stalker. The girl next to the carnival. Classic.",When a Stranger Calls
318,vlada011-1,Excellent!,10,15 July 2006,"I was surprised that this movie is so poorly rated. I think it is excellent and so refreshing in the horror genre. The story itself is old and familiar but the director, leading actress and everybody else who participated in producing of this movie made something new. I certainly wasn't bored although the movie is slow and nobody gets killed every ten minutes like in every other horror movie. The best way to describe it is to compare it to Hitchcock movies. The tension slowly gathers and culminates in the end.I think that most people did not expect that if they were watching trailer, which would be a great mistake to make because you will almost see the ending and it just spoils the fun.Really, who makes this trailers, it is like movie-a-minute.",When a Stranger Calls

Ignoring the reviews and what was posted here, I went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen. This movie has (of course)changed some of the original story to relate to todays teens, such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a babysitting job to pay her bill. However, it sticks to the original story line pretty well. If you can relate to the babysitter, not knowing the house and it's usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful. When the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to ""GET OUT OF THE HOUSE"". If you have never babysat or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it. It's all about understanding her fear.",When a Stranger Calls
320,Becca128,pretty good,9,17 March 2006,this movie wasn't really that bad. i did expect it to be scarier but that doesn't matter to me. i have never seen a movie like this. it starts out explaining the story. but then it gets so much scarier when she gets into the house. even when nothing is happening you still feel scared that something is just gonna pop out or if the phone is going to ring and the guy is going to say something that will that will spook you out. don't believe everyone that giving it 1 star because if they are then they don't know what makes a good movie. you'll be scared the whole time. this movie is super awesome and you wont regret that when you see it.,When a Stranger Calls

The acting is terrible and the plot is SO stupid.A babysitter who did'not check on the kids shes supposed to babysit until after the ""stranger"" told her to? Come on, did the people who made this movie think about watching it before subjecting us to this torture? I almost wanted to shoot myself for actually wasting my time and watching 10 minutes of this movie. To all the people who think other wise, i am really glad we don't' have the same taste in movies. For all the ones who haven't been through the same torment i have, i got 3 words for you:DO NOT WATCH. Actually, make that 5 words: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WATCHING...

323,necronaut666,I wanted to slit my throat i was that angry.,2,1 June 2006,"Pointless. Highly unrecommended film.Contains spoilers? There's nothing to spoil in this film. There's no story, it's not even scary. My wimp of a date hardly reacted to it. A girl's babysitting in a house and she gets a _lot_ of calls. There's a really really long build up, and then finally when the twist (if you can call it that...) occurs it's a massive let down. Nothing unfolds, nothing excites, nothing really makes sense. The killer's after the girl, for what reason? Why did he kill all those people in the house and why doesn't he kill the kids? Why isn't it rated 12 instead of 15? Why didn't the house keeper babysit? One good point is that it had a few nice trivial scenes to give you a sense of reality so i'll give it credit for not being the typical American 'Scream' movie. But all is lost as the story's so stale and mundane. Did i fall asleep during it without realising it, missing out vital parts?",When a Stranger Calls
324,patrickbsae,Worst movie ever!,1,14 June 2006,"At no point did the ""leading lady"" in this film lead. The post above said that this movie was done in a believable kind of way? I found just about every suspenseful situation hard to believe, evaporating the suspense. There are supposed to be questions in horror movies such as ""Now why would that little girl go into that lake by herself at night?"" but there were just too many in this crap fest. The acting sucked, the subplots were stupid and there was about 20 minutes of actual activity. In a horror movie, I believe, you must get in tough with your killer. You have to be very familiar with their motive if there is one, and understand why he/she kills. There was one shot of the killers face in this entire movie.",When a Stranger Calls
325,Phantomhunter11,What did that have to do with anything?,6,22 June 2006,"I thought this movie was decent. I liked how the killer had everything planned and it was all set up to scare the victim perfectly. What I did not like was the opening scene. (I'm pretty sure this doesn't count as a spoiler) I'm pretty sure a boy gets tossed out of a ferris wheel through a window if i remember correctly. Then it moves on to the topic of Jill. What the hell did the ferris wheel have to do with anything? It was so random! I can say however, that I enjoyed this film but thought Jill was kinda stupid. I'm not sure how i would have reacted, but I just thought some of it was dumb. I've yet to see the classic, which is what I want to do next, considering everyone says its so much better. oh, and one last thing.. Have you checked the children..?",When a Stranger Calls
326,mdk210,Crappiest Bad Guy Ever,1,22 November 2006,"I'm stationed overseas so we get all kinds of movies over here. I remember about a month ago I was checking out the movie channels and came across a movie with a girl talking to another one in art class about some boy and I quickly saw the acting was horrible and the girls were not good looking at all so I quickly changed it. I did the exact thing today and told myself I would finish watching it, big mistake. Not only is everything in this movie crappy from opening credits till the end but the bad guy is just some average metro sexual. First off how do you just sit around a house and not meet the house-keeper if she was there the hole time and when the hell did she die. My biggest peeve is the bad guy. WOW!, some regular a$$ dude trying to kill a teenage, what a plot not to mention the line, ""the calls coming from inside the house""! Who gives a s***. So the bad guy was in the movie for about 15 minutes and doesn't do anything scary. ""Watch out for your leg he's going to grab it"". The guy had no weapon at all, what a tool. They need to make a movie where the ""victim"" is an actual man who would walk up to a guy who doesn't have a weapon and beat his a$$. What a waste of time someone should get punished. If you gave this movie any kind of good rating I will fly to your house and you can try to scare me without a weapon and then watch while I break your arm off. I would have at least made the guy some 350lb biker or something then it might have been interesting but not a guy that looks lethargic.",When a Stranger Calls
327,UnforgivenSins,Not Given Enough Credit,8,10 July 2006,"So many reviews I have read on this movie rated it between 1 and 3, which I think is very poor, considering it's about a babysitter being harassed by a stranger.If you were hoping for a real horror movie full of blood and a stalking killer, you will be let down greatly, so don't rate your opinion on that it had hardly any blood, or that it wasn't scary, because how scary can a girl babysitting and getting harassed by a stranger really be? Basically, this movie isn't full of scary parts. It's just full of suspense and creepy music. I originally watched it because I was told it wasn't a normal today horror type movie, full of blood, guts, and lunatic killers with sharp knives.To be fair, the plot was a bit lame. The fact that Jill could have gotten out of the house at any time, and not locked in makes you wonder why she risked her life for some kids when she could have gotten up and left. The cat and the maid showing up instead of the killer also made you think that the killer was never going to make a move. There are also so many glitches in the movie, which shows that they weren't watching details that viewers would notice. And the fact that her friend that she was mad at was the one to die wasn't at all a shocker.If you absolutely hate horror movies with blood and gore, I suggest you watch this one, it's full of suspense, and will have you wondering whats behind every corner.So, don't always listen to how bad people rate movies, because everyone has their own taste, some found it lame because it wasn't scary enough. Some found it stupid because there was not enough murders. If you like movies with a realistic plot, I suggest you watch it.",When a Stranger Calls

329,stevetodd,A genuinely Scary film at last!!,8,24 November 2006,"OK first of i want set some things straight, this is not Scream this is not Saw and its not even I know what you did last summer.In fact what this is, is the closest thing to a genuinely spine chilling movie since halloween. Av read dozens of reviews from people who were brought up in the Scream generation and in the post Saw garbage. Who to be quite frank couldn't give a review about a candy bar let alone a constructive review on a film.So here we go the films opens quickly and explains basically what you are to expect from the entirety. Our young heroin is Jill Johnson played by a fresh faced Camilla Belle and i think she fits the part superbly, she's got a babysitting job on the night the rest of her class mates are all enjoying a bonfire celebration and it soons becomes apparent that this isn't going to be a normal baby sitting job when we see the house.From the moment she steps in the house the film picks up a very eery atmosphere and gets you excited and also scared about what the night holds in store for Jill.There are three main characters in this film and that is Jill, The house and the phone you will know what i mean when you watch the film.The lighting has been used to great effect in this film creating a very creepy atmosphere such as the shadows of the trees outside reflecting of the water it makes you think you can see someone lurking about but most of the time its just your mind playing tricks, this is where the director has done wonders, he puts you in Jill's shoes, every corner she goes round, every shadow she sees, your there thinking, hmm am sure i just seen something then.The use of external shots also adds tension to the scene, such as when Jill looks out the window, you cut to outside where you can here the wind howling and things moving.There are a number of really inventive scares here also that i haven't seen for a long time because of the garbage that has been churned out of Hollywood in recent years.The automatic lights which are linked to a sensor which go on if anything moves is a great touch you can just imagine sitting in the living room and all of a sudden a light comes on just out of view, they only come on if something moves, so straight away you think danger.Also the suspense is used to great effect and you don't see anything really up until the very last minute, even then the violence shown is quite moderate, however just like in Halloween, the less shown means the greater the scare the imagination can scare you ten times more than anything put on screen.In closing if you want to see blood and guts don't watch this film but if you want a phsycological thriller, which will entertain and scare you then see this film.",When a Stranger Calls

Just hearing the title made me want to watch it. Hearing it I new that it would be some type of horror or scary movie. When I first decided to watch this I didn't know what to expect. Its kept me focused first with the noises and then with the constant phone calls. What kind of made this movie bad was that she never met the children until the end. It kept me focused throughout the film and even gave me a chill in some scene's. The ending ruined it, it didn't even explain why the man wanted to kill her, and why he tried so hard pursuing her.I give this film a rating of 7/10 Just watch out when your babysitting...",When a Stranger Calls

I expectations for this one was not that high walking in. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the trailers give away too much of the movie, it still managed to keep my interests. The acting was sub-par, but it was nice to see some fresh faces. Another thing I liked about the movie was the direction. Lets face it, the story is not that complicated. So in order to pull this movie off, there has scenes that makes you jump out your seat. Many will argue that directors put these scenes in because the story lacks substance, but that is the whole point. To go to the movies and watch a pretty girl being chased by a lunatic, never knowing where he is going to pop up. Not a great movie, but a fun time.",When a Stranger Calls

It was hard to know what was more horrifying, the script or the lack of originality.Granted, the film is a remake. Nevertheless, the lack of ambition here is startling. Steven Spielberg once said famously that a film should be capable of being pitched in thirty seconds. That would leave the pitcher of When a Stranger Calls with time on his hands: ""It's like Halloween, but not as good. A young girl is harassed, but we never find out why"".In the U.K, films are often preceded by ads for the Orange company. The joke is always the same; a group of bonehead businessmen get together to contrive lame film ideas with the sole aim of placing Orange 'phones.

335,boydisappearing,Another uninspired remake that fails to deliver,4,4 February 2006,"In short, this reincarnation of the '79 classic doesn't go anywhere. Plot elements are introduced and then ignored with no rhyme or reason whatsoever, and the tension meant to be built by the alienating ultra-modern household is constantly broken by it's spook show style (a black cat literally jumps onto the screen for a couple of appearances). The only elements that make this version worthwhile are the rich cinematography, Camilla Belle's beautiful eyebrows, which deserve an acting credit above that of any of the supporting characters.The creators make little attempt to mask the fact that the star of the film is actually the house itself. The self watering coy pond, live in parakeets, and motion sensor lighting are all utilized (if ineffectively), to construct an environment that will put Jill, and the viewer on the edge of his stadium seat. Instead, these elements come together as more nonsensical plot appendages to a completely off center film. Not to do any spoiling, but there is one glimpse of hope at the end of the picture when Jill appears to have woken up in 28 Days Later, but alas, it turns out that she is dreaming, and she'll be going through these motions again in the unavoidable sequel.",When a Stranger Calls
336,Curb_My_Enthusiasm,I don't walk out of movies and I confidently walked out of When A Stranger Calls....,1,14 February 2006,"Wow. Just... wow.I should start by saying two things: 1) I didn't see the whole film. I saw about 40 minutes of it; and 2) Walking into this movie, I knew it wouldn't be La Strada.But I had no idea it would be THIS.Simon West has managed to create one of the vilest pieces of horror cinema ever created. He wastes no time on the development suspense or interesting characters... He just dives straight into creepy music.Now, the creepy music... There is creepy music playing as the girl is being dropped off to babysit. There is creepy music playing through the whole film. WHY?!?! If you're going to rely on creepy music to make your film *creepy*, why not save it for times that CREEPY THINGS ARE HAPPENING.West falls back on every cliché in the book. Clichés that even the worst directors keep away from. Scary noises are heard, the girl goes off to look for what's causing the scary noise AAAAAAAND... it's a CAT (LOUD NOISE!). Sure, I jumped. But if you come up behind me anywhere and go ""AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"", I'm going to jump. That could happen during The Lion King and it would still probably work.Simon West is not so much a director as much as he's a rapist. He rapes our senses in order to startle us for a millisecond. And he doesn't rape our senses in a Miike-ian, satisfying way. He does it wearing a Michael Bay mask, clutching a sweaty wad of money.This is where I'll stop, because if you don't get the point by now, you're probably the key demographic for this movie.I know that this review has no form and no mention of plot details or characters, but who needs them?

Scream cleverly used all the cliché's that this movie contains as humorous devices, as films of this genre had rinsed them out so much that a modern and hopefully intelligent moviegoer could now only laugh at them. This is Scream without the humour. And anybody with an ounce of intelligence can work out that this equation leaves absolutely nothing. Anyone who ""loved"" this film and ""can't wait to by the DVD"" has obviously delved into the delights of being lobotomised....or they are 13 or under.

340,kezdesign,My Favourite scary film!!!!!!!!!,10,12 May 2013,"READ. i gave it a ten because it is seriously worth it. its smart. it makes you think. and its exciting and great to watch with a friend thats never seen it. the music, the way its always windy and eerie, the tree branch shadows tapping on the windows.. its perfect!Camilla (Jill) is incredible, shes a brilliant actor here and keeps you focused and holds your full attention through the whole film. it starts off showing a bit about jills friends, her school and her father. Jill is a baby sitter and since her phone bill was way over the usual limit she has to pay it off by skipping a huge bonfire party with her boyfriend and friends to go baby sit at a super remote, million dollar, lakehouse in the woods.. full of windows, sensored lights and wooden creeks... perfect. She gets there and thats when it starts to get good, the music starts slow but builds. and its incredible...the movie itself isn't gory or horrific, its suspenseful... leaving you on the edge of your seat and yelling directions to the TV. the bad guys voice is creepy and deep and causes the film be even scarier. I watched this the first time with one of my brothers a while ago and it made me scared for days but I loved it and now that I've seen it a few times it doesn't scare me but still gives me goosebumps and the suspense and tension is as thick as ever. there are not many scary films i watch because they are either too messed up or just don't keep my attention rather they make me turn the TV off because im so scared. but this is a MUST SEE. and the ending is the best part, she kicks his butt. thats another reason why I love this scary film, a lot of scary movies make the endings be completely annoying and never solve the questions you have spinning in your head. oh and you can get creative and think about all the ways he was in the house, and when he wasn't. like how at the very beginning her gets in but you never realise until you think it in your mind. this movie deserves a much higher rating!!!!

If however the viewer is with friends, or feels like they aren't scared by thrillers, it can be totally comical. This is mainly due to the lack of gore. I guess people think that unless a horror movie is loaded with gore and pointless killing and completely satanic, it's horrible. There are many times in the movie where people could find fault because it's repetitive, this however is actually well done. The phone rings a million times, and yet they are able to capture the million different feelings one has when a phone rings. And let's face it, if Alfred Hitchcock were to come back and make another horror thriller, he would not make another ""The Birds"" because frankly, people just wouldn't be able to connect. This film actually pays a great deal of homage to a Hitchcock type thriller, complete with creepy camera angles, dark sets, slow moving actresses, and so on. Overall, if Hitchcock were around today and saw this, I think he'd be more impressed than he would with crap like The Grudge.

I think it's good that the movie built up a lot of suspense, and a lot of the times it was something totally unrelated to the killer. I also like how they fit two other deaths into the movie instead of just making it a girl alone in the house the whole movie. I thought the ending was really good. Well, the part where she finally confronts him at the end. I always like the ending when the girl beats the hell outta the killer. Only thing I didn't like is that a bunch of 12 year olds were there and they did not shut up the whole freaking movie. The whole theater was yellin at them the whole time. Because of that I missed a part. But, I really liked the movie. I'm gunna buy it when it comes out on DVD>",When a Stranger Calls
347,BloodlessMaiden,"Extremely Predictable, but you might have guessed that.",2,8 February 2006,"When a stranger calls: an urban legend that we all have heard at least a million times a piece, one that we all know the end to, or at least a version of the end to. So when I went to see this movie, I already had a pretty low view on how it was going to be. I mean, come on!! If I was going to make a film based off of an urban legend, it wouldn't be one so popular, and certainly not one that can be told in less than a minute and be filled with so little suspense and drama that it isn't even scary to the people in the audience.So when I say that this movie really isn't worth watching unless you have been living under a rock your whole life and have never heard of the legend (or didn't watch the trailers, which basically give away the whole movie), I really mean it. The acting is mediocre, though the kids are kind of cute, and there is literally NO GORE, not even in the crime scenes other 'victims' of this caller. Even some of the worst slasher flicks of all time were better than this, just because they had some blood play. But the writers of the particular script decided to take the high and mighty edge and make the story as uninteresting as possible.The only priceless moment I got was when the guy next to me screeched, and that was only because Barney's a little intense for him.So don't see it unless you REALLY REALLY like predictable movies.",When a Stranger Calls

If you want to pay 10 dollars for a few light jumps or scares then go for it, but I'm telling you right now, it is not even close to being worth it. You want to see the movie, watch the commercial. That pretty much sums up everything interesting and shocking in it. The acting - bad. The ending - even worse. The creativity - can't comment, there was none! I saw the commercial and still had faith in this movie. I figured they gave away the parts that people already knew in the old movie, and were going to add creative and new twists on this one which they wouldn't show in the trailer. Boy was I wrong. They might as well have just brought the old version of this back to theaters. The only part I found remotely interesting was the house the movie takes place in-it's SO nice! Anyways, I really have nothing left to say about this crap because the plot was so predictable, repetitive and pointless there's minimal comments to make.

352,jvuno1,"a satisfying, brisk, and solid movie",7,9 June 2006,"While i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it, i still had interest from the preview. I don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what, but i really enjoyed the movie. The I was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie, but even then it wasn't very bad at all. I think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, if a little too coincidental, but it was necessary to move the story along. I think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie, it is beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think that the light arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry, but there was no way to keep them on, so the house stayed dark outside of the small section Jill was in.Speaking of Jill, i thought her part was acted pretty well, at first it wasn't as believable, but after a few phone calls it was fine. In fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly. And, finally, someone got the fire poker right. I can't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most.In regards to the plot holes, the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how he got in..exactly, how long was he watching her? how did he get out to kill her friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall, i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went. It kept my attention, and i wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, other than the ending, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more, to give us a taste of her personality and to give us foreshadowing to how she will handle the situation(for example, the scene where she debates whether to go back for the kids, it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something).",When a Stranger Calls

Constant talking, unnecessary screaming and cell phone games kept us from really enjoying the movie which to my surprise wasn't too bad.

All this buildup, she walks around, tense music plays, a cat jumps out of a closet sounding like a locomotive. All for nothing, really. The final confrontation with the killer last about 10 minutes. He chases her a little, then she stabs him, once. He is pinned to the floor and caught and the movie ends. What happened here? What a waste of time.

Apparently a kid is sitting alone is her house (the killer targets young girls) while the carnival is happening, and the killer keeps on calling her and eventually kills her with his bare hands. Far-fetched I would say... a girl with all of her friends within feet and she's not outside with them? No explanation for that.Then the story magically shifts to a high schooler named Jill, who's on the track team. She's not running fast enough (could this come in later, perhaps?). Then her parents decide to punish her for running up her cell phone bill by forcing her to babysit to pay them back. How often is a girl old enough to work at a REAL job going to babysit? Her dad drives her 120 miles away from any civilization to babysit for a rich family who lives in a HUGE house that's basically all windows.Can you guess how it goes? Well, that won't happen for A LONG TIME. You know why? The movie goes for probably half of the time trying to ""surprise"" you with black cats, coats hanging on the walls, and windows without blinds.

And we both agreed that the director missed the genre if he tried to make a horror movie. This movie is definitely more funny than terrifying.There are two really positive things about the movie. The house most of the story is placed in is really amazing. I'd move in without thinking about. To me it's one of the most impressing creations as well in architecture as in interior design. It's my taste but I'm sure the architect gets some work due to this movie.Second is Camilla Belle. Haven't seen her in any movie so far but she is the lonely light in the dark night of a plot with holes the size of the moon that is sooo predictable that all the moments I'm quite sure the director intended as to be scary turn out to be funny. But back to Camilla Belle. She acts believable and makes the best out of the tremendously flawed script. That she has a really intriguing voice and not to mention last is definitely candy for the eye does the rest.

370,zyphic,Forget the many 'Nay-sayers' this is the most Suspenseful Movie EVER,10,2 June 2006,"I've never written a review before for a movie on IMDb but after reading some of the atrocious reviews this movie got I thought I really owed it to the potential viewing audience to present the opposing argument.Firstly, this movie is NOT a typical new-age horror flick. If that's your mindset when you start out watching this movie than you will certainly be disappointed. I heard other reviews compare it to ""Amityville Horror"" and ""House of Wax."" Chances are if you disliked the previous two movies for their crudity (as I did) you'll love this movie for it's simplicity and power to keep you terrified for a good solid hour. If any of you have ever played ""Clock Tower"" before and enjoyed it, this is the movie that watches like that game played.Take a young girl in a strange environment with nothing to protect herself but the objects in her vicinity. Every step she makes, every corner she takes you're just sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for something... one of those climatically scary moments. But no, not quite. This movie is so very well written that you will never predict the moments that will prove the most terrifying since they are, mostly, strategically placed at moments when you think ""oh good she's safe."" I say mostly because like any good movie you can't let it become predictable and this one doesn't.It's about an hour of solid suspense post-intro so there's really not a dull moment throughout the film. Do not expect gore or long-winded gruesome fight scenes though because this movie doesn't need special effects to terrify. It's not about blood; it's not about violence. It's about the most basic human instinct: FEAR. And if you can feel even somewhat attached to the main character this movie will suck you in and haunt you forever.Oh, and if you have an easily scared girl you want reason to snuggle up with watching this movie with her might just be the ticket. I've watched all the big teen horror flicks. None of them are as suspenseful or memorable as this one. Mind you...

There she finds out that maybe her parents were right, and she shouldn't have made that little mistake. Putting aside the fact that yes, this is a cheesy remake, I don't think it was THAT bad. I mean I think when it came out people thought it was going to be a mini gore-fest. But they were disappointed when they saw it, I know because I thought the same thing, but if you look closely the movie wasn't really about your typical serial killer. It was about a maniac trying to get inside the mind of average teenage babysitter, thinking he could in the end, get what he wanted. Trying to manipulate her almost, make her squirm a little.If you notice, in neither of the scenes where he supposedly kills people, like the house in the beginning, or the ""boyfriend stealing friend"" or the housekeeper, it shows no blood or gore at all. I think it was meant to let the audience make up their own sort of ""story"" about how he killed them and when he killed them. Because putting yourself in the killer's mind thinking about what kind of twisted way he maybe tortured them, or just killed them on the spot, makes you even MORE creeped out about this ""stranger"".

The climax was great and the scenarios were good. the movie involve everything: cops, killer, young kids, romance, arguments, big-empty house, you name it. The Serial Killer had a history. and the house was perfect for the harassment and Chase-built to perfection!The 2 things i did not like that much from the movie were: the way the movie ended, showing Jill in the hospital but not giving any info and that Jill (Belle) was not told the 2 children's names and was forced to say ""Kids!"" and ""Children!"" but then again, it adds suspense. Another thing i liked was how Camilla belle was able to carry the weight of a less-than-standard-length-dialog film almost by herself. one more thing before my short synopsis: people have said that Camilla's acting sucks. Well i want to tell those people to go make a movie, realize how bad they do then come back and correct themselves.SYNOPSIS: Jill babysits for rich family and starts getting weird calls. they become increasingly threatening and scary. she phones the police after a particularly bone-chilling call and is eventually told that the killer's calls are coming from inside the house.

(And I'm not exaggerating!) And the ending is just as bad... I mean, how can they make such a bad movie? It seems that it was badly done on purpose...I don't like when people spoil movies, but there's nothing to spoil here really. The killer is (as the title says) a stranger. He kills for no reason (or at least the movie doesn't provide any explanation) Also, the whole beginning is useless. They mention time and time again that the babysitter's best friend kissed her boyfriend and that the babysitter spent a lot of money in extra minutes for her cellphone but that information doesn't add anything at all to the plot. It seems that the writer constantly tried to mislead without achieving a good result.Just do yourself a favor and don't watch this so-called movie...",When a Stranger Calls

There is no real plot, characters, realism or in fact any actual ""scary"" content or even a backstory to any of it. plus who was the killer? just some random man with a scar oooh what a clever twist. People are supposed to relate to the victims in these teen horror films, but who in this world has ever babysat at a house like that. This film is worse than Oceans 12!

Excellent, a film with a crazed maniac who rips the victims to shreds with his bare hands..................but wait.........it turns out the killer is a prank phone caller who says about 12 words and doesn't even attempt to impersonate Darth Vader when on the blinker, and his method of attacking and killing his victims is nothing more than a feeble attempt at strangulation.................sigh!

I'm a huge fan of scary movies and I'm tired of the same old same old. This movie is practical and unbelievably realistic in all its dimensions, which enables it to really grab your attention and get under your skin. I was huddled up in a ball hiding behind a blanket the entire time practically holding my breath. I've never seen a movie with as much suspense built up as this one. From the actress chosen to the setting to the plot, It was simply mind blowing how well this movie was put together. Simply put, it was a masterpiece.

Maybe worth the $3.00 it would have cost to rent it but even then, we would have been disappointed. The movie DID have a few jumps, some suspenseful moments, but overall it was boring. The movie will probably appeal to the younger teenage generation but for an adult it was just plain dumb. In a positive note, and in all honesty, it was well shot and the house that most of the movie played out in was beautiful. We want that house! The house was the perfect place setting for the movie. Also, the acting seemed to be good for a bunch of unknowns. I predict to see more of the lead character in future movies.

Even though she is in her early 20s, late teens, she really can go back to 16/17 years old. I admit that throughout the movie, I screamed around 4 times and I was scared for an hour or so after watching the movie. Luckily, I watched it around 10:30 am, and not in the night. I would have been twice as scared! My friends and I went to Blockbuster to look for a horror movie and a comedy movie. Our horror choice was ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" (another great movie!), but they didn't have a copy. So, instead, we rented ""When a Stranger Calls"", and quite honestly, I think that it is just a little better than ""Sleeping with the Enemy"".Some people hate it, and like the original. The original is a piece of crap and I hate it. This is much more modern, and you can relate to it, not bore yourself to death like the 1979 version. This one keeps you in suspense and really pulls you in. However, the other one just makes you fall asleep in the middle of the day.And, some people say the acting is horrible. What I say is, let's see YOU go out there, go through all of that work and stress, and come out acting that wonderfully. F*** you idiots who criticize this wonderful, well-done movie.All in all, I give this movie a 1,000,000 out of 10 score. I definitely think that you should see this movie! It's amazing!

The main character plays a good role, and the diversions from the original movie weren't enough to change the overall feel of the movie. Well worth the money I spent on Pay Per View to watch it.

I don't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story.Since Jill has come home late, her father sends her to babysit for the Mandrakis's in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. The kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning, another empty house to the side for their son who's at college. OK.After about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself, she gets a couple of hang ups. Ooh, scary ones.

Uhhh...then the music! DumDumDum..! She fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. Which of course, doesn't start. How cliché'd is that..? So..She disappears =D Jill, alone again. UH.

Who say they cant help her, but call back if she has any more problems.So then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriends friends are calling. They have been but only once.

And off course if you expect to see massive slaughtering, blood all over the place, swearing etc. you'll get disappointed. But the tension did it for me.

But to be quite honest I wasn't impressed, it was basically a slow build up to a weak and disappointing ending. When I watch a horror film I expect some kind of twist to the ending, but I didn't get it with this, it was just so pointless! Stick a girl in a house in the middle of nowhere, guy phones her up, talks to her with not even remotely creepy sentences, chases her for ten minutes or so, police come and save the day.. THE END! However at the very end it shows her in some sort of ward which I'm guessing is a psychiatric hospital of some sort, but I don't think her experience would send you into a state of mentality, it was just a silly way to end a film.

You never knew what would pop out at you during this film. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what'll finally happen. I was surprised that there was really no blood or gore or anything of that such in this movie. The only blood you'll see is in the beginning when a young girl is found slaughtered to death by the killer with his bare hands (No, it does NOT show him tearing her to pieces in this movie, but it does show the police removing her body in separate bags because she was cut up) and at the end when Jill (Camilla Belle) shoves something from the fireplace through the phyco murderers hand. From there she calls the police where they arrest the killer. I really enjoyed this movie, Camille Belle did a very good job acting. Not to mention shes a very pretty young women and I'm sure most of the men who watched this only did to see her run around the house for an hour, screaming. Overall I give this movie a 8/10.

It's one of my favourite thriller movies from the early 2000's and is worth a watch in today's age. However, the phone calls throughout were a little dull and the strangers voice didn't quite match the dark theme.

In no way did it come near to being as scary as the original. Now I admit, the first 30 minutes in the original is when the majority of the scare takes place, but Tony Beckley (Curt Duncan), had a much more creepy tone/feel to the character. You KNEW he was mental, no doubt. And since it's more than just one night, the story lets you into the life of Duncan on how he may appear normal on the outside, but inside he's clearly insane. The remake ""stranger"" didn't even try to scare you and half of the calls he's silent. The constant asking of ""why haven't you checked the children?"" made the original what it was and in this one, if I'm correct, he only asks once, and puts no effort into attempting to sound believable as a psycho killer. He just sounded like a pervert. This wasn't an easy remake either since back in 1979 there was no caller id. The phone rang and you just had to wait to hear who it was. They certainly don't make horror movies like the old days. But that's what makes them original and why no one can think of anything new so they have to attempt with remakes, and this one failed miserably. If you haven't seen the original, you should.

Yet another mass produced horror flick that uses every cliché in the book to get some cheap scares. It manages to stretch out a 15 minute scene from the original to nearly and hour and a half of boring, generic, teen horror.You don't need blood and guts to make a film scary, just take a look at 'The sixth sense' or 'The others' for proof. What you do need is an original script, innovative directing, good acting, and a few surprises thrown in. This film has none of those qualities.There's no need for me to explain to anyone that enjoys good horror films what all the clichés are. Lets just say there is nothing original about this film or the way it tries to scare the audience. It's all been done before, and it's all been done a lot better than in this movie.If you want to see good films in this genre watch 'the others', 'The sixth sense', the original 'haloween', and the blue print for these types of films 'Friday the 13th'.Anyone who thinks this is a good film needs a serious injection of good taste!

The concept, nice.. but it could be so much more if developed right.

Granted like you said, it took place for the first 30 minutes of the movie, but that 30 minutes alone was enough to surpass the suspense and terror found in the remake. Tell me your heart didn't sink when the babysitter in the first movie opened the door. The ""build-ups"" in the second just lacked the magic of the original. There was no real sense of fear. And the fact that this wasn't your average suburban house in Any-town, USA, didn't leave me with the chills that the original did.

The only reason I give it two stars is because the babysitter is a good looking girl and the overall idea is very good, but when it comes to directing, two stars is very VERY generous. I had to give it at least one star. Do not waste your time on watching this or your money on buying it. It is a complete waste of time. If you are looking for a good thriller, go for Disturbia, which is incredible, or some other movie like it that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

While babysitting she receives strange calls from a person. She the relies that the person can see her and starts to panicking. In this movie i could see that the directer tried really hard to incorporate that famous ominous and feeling of Halloween while giving that feeling of Scream the movie into his movie. From the excellent background sounds, to the settings and the camera works that gives you the same feeling when watch Halloween, you get that unknown, ominous feeling that your alone in a big house, with howling winds outside with possibly a stranger inside hiding in every dark corner, waiting for you. But to be frank this movie also has some negative points. Fristly they could have use the stranger allot more in the movie an not just at the latter parts of the movie, and besides the role of the stranger they could have done better with the acting and a better ending and a bit more horror.To round it up, this movie has a great intense ""clasical"" movie theme that will give that ominous feeling.

Was she in a mental hospital at the end or a regular hospital? How did Tiffany get in through the gate without being let in by Jill? Why were Jill's parents not at the scene after the police showed up? Just a few unanswered questions that left me wishing the movie could have been ten minutes longer, just finish off the story properly.",When a Stranger Calls

But the only reason I came here to write this review is because I just watched it again today and IMDb got rid of discussion boards so I can't say it there.

I don't mind seeing it again because I really liked it and it was pretty freaky...not really scary. But, freaky. Almost all of the people in the theater were screaming their heads off..I wasn't though, I don't really get THAT freaked out by movies, i think i'm immune. ha ha.

But the suspense make us hold tense feel till the end of the movie. who is the caller? why is he calling? are not a suspense things, the way the director let us know what the point is Good. The presentation is too good.I'v disappointed with the rating which have given to this movie. I'm giving 7 out of 10. If you'd like to get tense feel i suggest you watch this movie.

The sole purpose of this movie was to make a quick buck in the box office. I could go into why in detail this movie is terrible, but I can do it in one sentence. The plot has no purpose, moral, reason, motive, Nothing! The movie was pointless. Your left asking ""Why was this made!?"" ""why"". The end result leaves you with no substance no value, no ""oh I see thats interesting"" Nothing. And so with complete conviction I can honestly say. That this was the worst movie I have ever seen, in my entire 28 yrs of existence. I was left completely aggravated to the point of wanting to through my TV out the window, Knowing that i was a victim of this nuisance. So to conclude, disregard this movie ever existed, and erase the title from your memory.",When a Stranger Calls

When I went to watch it, I quickly realised it was the remake. I watched anyways, even though I probably never would have recorded it intentionally.All in all, it was pretty good. It certainly isn't one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it was quite entertaining. I also liked the lack of sex/nudity--not that I'm a prude, it's just rare to see a scary film featuring teenagers that doesn't involve someone taking off their clothes.It's fairly suspenseful, even if you know the twist, and the house is really cool. It was also nice to see a female character in a scary movie who is quite resourceful and not completely helpless or pathetic.",When a Stranger Calls

It deals more with the mind then the actual physical fear that most movies do. People may think it has a few dull parts, some over dramatics, or non-reality moments, but over all it is a very well, put together, film. I do recommend it to people who do or don't get scared easily because either way they'll enjoy it.

But I would not call this a 'remake' of the 70s movie, I'd call it a remake of the 20-minute opening of the original, stretched for an hour and 20 minutes (including cheesy dialog about her boyfriend cheating on her with her best friend).Well you see, the story is simple. A babysitter is terrorized by a psycho who continues calling her asking her if she's checked the children. Well, in the original, after 20 minutes the call comes from the police that the call is coming from inside the house and that she should run for her life and right away the cops show up. Then it fast forwards seven years to her and her future with her husband and kids. But the remake just kept the storyline to when she was a teen.The story drags on, and you never eventually see the caller till near the 15-minute chase scene at the end.So I wouldn't call it a ""remake"", I'd call it a semi-remake.3 out of 10 stars.",When a Stranger Calls

418,AndyD1089,When a Stranger Calls,3,3 February 2006,"First off, I'm going to say that this wasn't the train-wreck people have made it out to be. It was a train-wreck.. just a mildly entertaining one. The opening scene is creepy and there is a pile of buildup but none of it actually amounts to anything. The direction is satisfying enough and the acting works but one may leave wondering why the stranger's voice wasn't scarier and why Camilla Belle, while not completely horrible, was chosen over Jena Malone to play the babysitter. There are several things that surprised me, mainly plot points and extra characters, that weren't in the trailer. If you've seen the trailer- sadly, you can write down the entire storyline unless you're a blazing idiot. The majority of the film is Camilla Belle just wandering around the huge house and jumping at every little noise. The other major problem is the dialogue. It suffers from the PG-13 syndrome to the point of being unrealistic and, sadly, some of it comes off as dialogue written for an 80's sitcom. The teen drama was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story. Also, the phone calls were surprisingly dull, minimal, and when they could have been exciting, they were ruined by the stranger's voice which occasionally sounded like the guy from Verizon. Overall, this movie starts off well and slowly turns into a clichéd extremely boring film. With better casting, direction, writing, and timing this could have been much creepier and memorable. It's worth a rental and would probably be a little creepier seen at home alone instead of in a theater with fifty thirteen-year-old's screwing around with their cell phones. In the end it will only come off as a guilty pleasure- if even that.",When a Stranger Calls
419,donb1973,"Not bad, if you haven't seen the first one.",5,20 August 2012,"What made the original one scary is that you had no idea that the caller was inside the house. It was on of the most shocking surprises I'd ever seen in a movie. If someone told you that he was inside the house before the movie even started, how much of the drama would it have taken away? Most of it in my opinion. To ensure that the remake had the same effect, they should have controlled the previews and told everyone who had seen the original to shut up. My guess is that wouldn't have happened. It was an enjoyable flick but I kept waiting for the main character to find out the ""surprise"". Last but not least, she should have let the house alarm continue to go off when she set it off near the end of the movie. The cops would have tried to call and then drive to the house.",When a Stranger Calls

They should have made it scarier by making an ""R"" rating but of course they wouldn't have made as much money that way. However, this movie was decent and I'm glad I saw it. The acting was pretty good but the Lead actress wasn't very good when she showed any kind of emotion. She's good when she is just talking and all that stuff but when she's screaming/crying etc. It surprised me because her I was actually laughing out loud. Thus, I wasn't really into the movie like you get when you feel like you are actually involved. Good movie overall. Recommended:Yes",When a Stranger Calls

Soon enough, she is receiving phone calls, from an anonymous source. Frightening. This is a remake (what a surprise) of a 70s film, however, if like me you haven't seen the original, this modern version is basically that opening scene from Scream...stretched out into to a feature film. I'll talk through the better parts of the movie, simply because there are so many few of them. When A Stranger Calls can actually be rather tense at times. The tight cinematography gives a nice atmosphere and there is some fairly impressive lighting going on here, which will have you distracted from the main character and trying to see what's behind her instead. This is no bad thing, I assure you.Aside from this, it's an incredibly dumb movie. I haven't seen the original, so I can make no fair judgements in that regard, but the film is just poorly written, directed and acted. There's no real sense of actual peril or danger that you feel for this girl. The caller just breathes or asks her questions. It's never particularly intimidating. Or all that sensible in truth, once you find out the stalker is watching her, it's pretty difficult to come to a decent conclusion as to where he is watching her. Regardless, any tension the film does have is completely and utterly lost once he is finally revealed, and the explanation given as to why he was stalking her is that he just kind of...was.It can be fun with a few friends, but other than that this film really isn't worth your time.",When a Stranger Calls

This movie is terrible. The best actress in the entire movie is Rosa, the maid, and she has 1 line. Camille Bell ruined this movie. She just cannot act! I found myself feeling sorry for the director and Cinematographer because a lot of the shots in this movie were really nice. But the script was terrible, acting was terrible and the movie just fell on its face.I realize that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and some people might think that they may like the movie even though I hated it. But, honestly, this is not that kind of movie. It moved slowly, wasn't scary, was HORRIBLY (cant stress that enough) acted and was poorly written.I also read some of the predictions about who the killer would be on the IMDb boards. If it had been any of those predicted people this movie MIGHT have been a little better. But the killer has NO connection to the characters what-so-ever. Quite simply, the writer and director do not even TRY to make you care about these people. Any expectation for this movie, no matter how weak, is too high.All I can say now is that I'm glad some one else paid for my ticket because I would have walked out and asked for a refund. If you still want to see this movie, go ahead, that is your decision. I am normally not such a close minded and angry person, but this movie was just SO BAD. If you want to see When a Stranger Calls just rent/buy the original.

I went into the movie thinking that it would be OK, but it was far better than imagined. The beginning was a little weird but once we got with the main character it was good. When I saw the previews for it the actress playing Jill it just looked and sounded like some whiny teenager, but she was very good and fifty times better than what I thought she would be. It kept me tense for pretty much the whole movie. It is only rated pg-13 because it didn't need to be rated R. Adding more violence or language or even sex would have ruined the movie. I am glad that they did it like they did and it was a great movie. I recommend it to anyone that likes scary movies. This was by far the best pg-13 horror movie I have ever seen.

Camilla Belle did such a good job and can become one of the next teen stars. Even though most of the movie takes place in the house unlike the original, it was still very good. It would have been nice if there were more well-known actors in it to give the movie more hype. The best part of the movie is never knowing where the stranger is.

I'll give it this, the acting wasn't half bad, but the characters were extremely stupid. And that's as nice as I can put it. Leave it up to a desperate teenager to give her boyfriend, who cheated on her with her best friend, the number to a huge, remote house in the mountains that she's babysitting at. Of course, he prank calls her, throwing off the whole ""A scary man is calling me"" idea to most people who just can't seem to grasp that it's not him the whole time! Also, this girl, Jill, was such a dumb person! Like her brilliant idea to go running in hurricane conditions to the guest house to see if the housemaid is over there, leaving the kids in a house where, although she doesn't know it, a psychotic murderer is watching them. Then, when the killer finds them in the kids room, where he's hiding in the ceiling like a bat, they go taking off to the zen room which happens to be in this house. So when they're sneaking around in there, Jill decides to hide in the water. Yea, like he won't find her there. And the whole ""I'm in this hospital by myself, and the killer is there too!"" thing at the end was so obvious that it was a dream. This movie was absolutely dreadful.

But, the 15 mins suspense of the original is extended throughout this film once it gets into it. The house is creepy, the music builds the tension and I think it's refreshing to not have all blood and gore but just get a film that makes you jump and makes you tense. I love it and actually can watch it over again because of how atmospheric the house is. The only downside for me is that I don't really buy Camilla Belle in the role, I don't think the acting was up to par, and as she carries the whole film I think we needed to buy into her fear more.

I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store tends to help) and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think. I do have some criticism though. The final call from the cop was terrible, almost overacted, the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank) and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed hope this helps some people",When a Stranger Calls

When we finally get to see some action, it lasts like 5 minutes. And that didn't make up for the first 80 minutes this movie dragged. I had to keep myself from closing my eyes.

435,forestalpines,"*Spoilers* Building tension 101- Lots of building, none of the tension!",1,24 September 2006,"*Spoilers* Well, what can I say about this movie. I had few expectations going in, just rented it, thinking it may be a bit of a lark. I'd seen the trailers, seen the whole 'urban legend' deal going on with it.. I thought it might be a suspense horror deal.Right now, having watched it not 2 hours ago, I can't think of a single positive thing that stood out for me. I'll start with the basics- The story. There's a murder. Why? I don't know. Apparently it's pretty brutal. Multiple bags of nasty style brutal. Wow, this must be a bit of a mind job then! There must be some real scary motive here, maybe it's a Saw style life lesson. Or maybe it's not. As best as I can surmise, there was no real reason for the killings.Right then.Let's move on.. Characters? Well, there's a teenage girl, a guy who cheated on her (a bit.. sort of.. well..), her friend, the girl the boyfriend cheated with.. No-one I really got to like, respect, or feel anything for, really. All power to them, maybe they're all amazing performers. If they are though, I sure didn't see it.Alright, maybe the story and characters aren't great, but for a suspense-thriller-horror deal, it must have its fair share of shock, thrills, spills, chills, and.. Bills. I don't know. Anyway, I failed to see these as well. Once or twice, a conservative thriller will include a fake out. You know, big build up, and then.. Boom! It's not the killer, it's just a cat.. Or a pheasant or something instead. Now, this movie.. Boy, everything was a fake out! Not in the good 'That really got me going then surprised me!' way.. No, in the 'right.. is there even anything scary?' sort of way. I started to get a bit annoyed really, all the buildup, no payoff.Another thing that started to bug me were the constant phone calls. Now, I know, I sound foolish for saying that. I mean, come on alpines, what do you expect from 'When a Stranger Calls'? But heck.. They were just constant! Again, it's not like they were even scary. Usually it was 'Oh! Scary man! Then boom, it's someone else. Oh it's Mindy or Bobby or the security guys! Who only call the first time the system goes, but not when it might end the story inconveniently! Shh!' Finally, as I'm about ready to stop thinking about this.. Somewhat inferior movie, I'd like to comment on the ending. That is, I would if there was one. Obviously, there is a cut to credits.. But dang, if it didn't feel unfinished. *Spoilers again buddy* Basically, the killer is arrested. After a fairly short chase and fight with the hero chick, he's just bundled into the back of a blue and white. Cue a bit of a shock ending 'Oh no he's still out there!' then boom, dream sequence. Then we see the girl freaking out in a hospital, presumably implying that she's been driven mad by her brush with.. Some guy.Overall, not that it was a bad movie, it just wasn't a good movie.Want suspense? Watch Magnum Force.Want horror? Watch Saw.Want neither? Watch this.",When a Stranger Calls
436,kornfreak2820,Kiddie Horror,1,21 February 2006,"Now, the previews didn't make it look very good, but there was nothing else to go see so I went to see this movie hoping maybe they'll be something good in it.I was dead wrong. You should see this movie if you like watching someone answer the phone a billion times in a row for an hour, and every 5 ring is some killer. Seriously, the phone rings every 5 seconds and half the time it's one of her friends that attempt to give the movie some backdrop but fail.Of course there are the 'scary', long walks down a dark hallway. But, during the billions of these put at random points in the movie (over half of them BEFORE she even knows that there's a killer) They were just long and drawn out.At one point, she grabs a pick for the firepit and walks around in the dark, though the killer called her once and didn't say anything and then her friends called her thirty times after that. What reason does she need a pick? Why is she scared? There's NO THREAT to her yet! The, uh, ""death scenes"" are pretty bad as well. You don't see what happens to people, which i don't particlary mind, but when the death scenes consist of the camera zooming in on someone real fast and then changing to something else, it gets on my nerves.Sure, during the last 15. minutes of the movie the killer comes out (how long was he hiding in that house? it felt like 6 hours....). And we actually get to SEE the kids she babysits for once, and she runs from him in about 4 different rooms of the house before the cops show up.The worst ending ever. After a huge build-up I was hoping for a long chase or having something original happen. But no, she just runs and screams and he slowly walks after her and dosn't say a word. Your not Firday the 13th's Jason, Mr. Stranger, you can speak.The other thing was the character development. ESPECIALLY of the ""Stranger"". We NEVER EVER learn WHY he targetted young girls, this girl, we never even learn his name, who he is, where he comes from, why he calls his victems, what his 'oh so grotesque' killing method is (all the dead people I saw, which wasn't many was just them lying with their eyes open). We never know ANYTHING about him, other than he wants to kill her and likes using phones. And for some reason at the end of the movie, she thinks that four cops guarding him in the hospital wont be enough. When shes been chased by him for 5 minutes.Enough of my ranting. Here's my conclusion: I give this movie an F. I would give it lower if it were possible. If your looking for boring yourself to death, painfully trying to fathom why this girl has no common sense and what we should be afraid of, jumping at a few scenes and watching horribles actors try to act, go see this. Otherwise, stay home, rent 'Scream' and save yourself 10$. No wonder the theater was filled with 12 year old Middle Schoolers when I walked in. It's Kiddie Horror I say!",When a Stranger Calls
437,papasmurf135,Poor acting and weak dialouge don't help this stale remake,4,5 February 2006,"I wasn't expecting much when i went to see When A Stranger Calls. But I wasn't expecting this little either. None of the characters were developed enough for us to care if they were killed. And not seeing anyone get killed doesn't make this any scarier. Most of the scares rely upon cheap thrills. The music shrieks up only to reveal a cat come through the door, or a friend mysteriously appear in the house. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has no memorable lines, and her stupidity is a force to be reckoned with. Every part of this movie could use improving and Simon Wests inexperience as a director is apparent. It reminds me of an old episode of Goosebumps, with a cheesy killer, a man with no name, and a face in hidden in silhouette. Overall this movie isn't worth the price of admission but if your looking for a cheap thrill from Blockbuster, this might not be a bad choice. It won't scare you, but it might scare your girlfriend.",When a Stranger Calls
438,james-1146,I want my money back. (spoilers),1,25 May 2006,"The film intrigued me for the first five minutes and as I had paid five quid to see it, I gave it a fair chance. The film first showed the scene of the killers previous victim, ripped apart with bare hands and carried off in bin liners. Great I thought to myself, maybe this killer would prove more difficult to overcome than a whack on the head from a terrified babysitter with a household object. Unfortunately as I was to later discover, the killer proves to be not only a complete pushover but seemed to prefer chatting on the phone than pulling victims apart. The only character in the film that did some decent hunting was the cat which managed to devour a canary. The final nail in this crappy films coffin was at the end when the killer was simply arrested and driven off in a police car!! I had to laugh at that ending. Oh dear, what a crass barrel load of sh*te this film was! I want my time and money back.James",When a Stranger Calls
439,liquidblue_111,"Good Idea, Bad Movie",3,22 February 2006,"The movie itself was okay, it's based on an urban legend. The plot line is basic, but the movie did a good deal of throwing you off and confusing you, right from the first few minutes. Not only did the plot flow poorly, the characters weren't too believable either. I didn't like the acting at all, it could've been done MUCH better.The big house in the movie is just to distract you and give you something to look at while nothing actually happens. The movie is about 80 minutes of nothing but a guy calling and breathing, with the occasional ""Have you checked on the kids?"" Then the last 7 minutes ends the movie with an anti-climactic, unthrilling, and poorly done action scene. I must admit, I jumped a few times during the movie, but overall I was really unimpressed.Save your money, or see something else.",When a Stranger Calls

443,maythanhtwe,"Should I answer when a Stranger Calls? Hell, no.",1,24 June 2006,"One hour and a half! How could they do this to us? Yes, more than an hour of plotles, pointless, twistless, and emptiness. Mark my words and experience. This movie, 'When a Stranger Calls' is a time-robbing, which is worse than time-stealing, one. Basically, this movie is about a girl who went to a rich family house for babysitting for a night, and ended up fighting for her life with a (psycho) killer. However, she was already well-determined to do something __ to talk on the phone with her friends and family as much as she can. Although her purpose was for baby-sitting, I was wondering whether the children actually exist. As soon as she got there, as her mission, she started making calls, literally to everyone. And she was also called by a stranger. This movie is thus 'he calls, she calls' movie__ not 'he chases, she runs' movie. In this movie, she was running, wandering, and confusing. For what? For nothing. At the same time, like she, we are also boring, yawning and wondering what next. Our excitement and curiosity lessen every single second. A killer eventually showed up though. When her life was at stake, she finally called to the police after talking with her friends and family. Besides, instead of dialing 911, she pressed zero and through the operator, she reached to the police station. Come on. Just press 911. No charge. Police station through operator assistance! You know what happens next. Even a child knows. This is what we call no originality and predictability. One hour passed with absolute nothing. Not only it began with insignificance, it ended in a rush. Seems like the director looks for the escape as well. At least, I thank him for not making this movie more than two hours. If the director doesn't respect us, at least he should respect time. We are not living in the 70's, you know. This movie has no flow, no drama, no screen play, no twist, no meaning at all. By the way, it was extremely windy all the time that it even reminds me of hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Don't take me wrong. I am not a bad critic. Let me (straightly) tell you what I like. The director makes a smart choice though; a beautiful actress (Camilla Belle). She seems smart and sexy, but not that smart really because she cannot make a vital decision in a life and death situation. I hope this remark does not go too far. For your own sake, young lady! This movie is indeed intolerable even by the 70's standards __ the John Travolta era in which we are more forgiving, understanding, dancing, and which also is the age of time inflation. Now we are living in the Intel age, in which time is deflated. In our age, there is no excuse for such movies. After watching this movie, I feel like my life long saved two hours from my Bank of Time account were robbed, with my own expense. I should have fallen asleep while watching this 'she calls, he calls' movie, but unfortunately I did not. A word of advice: reward yourself with a couple hours of sleep rather than watching this movie. because this movie is not seeworthy. It is sleepworthy. And remember. Do not answer when a stranger calls.",When a Stranger Calls

There were way too many cop-outs to be a horror, and obviously not enough gore. The opening scene would have been great if it were followed by sum BLOOD! This was a terrible money-grabbing teen movie, if that. I do not recommend seeing this unless you want to laugh at how bad it was or if you're between the ages of 11-14. The setting of the film was way too exaggerated. The ending was predictable, obviously, can't expect too much out of this genre unless you have a decent brain like the Saw filmmakers had.

I really didn't like the original of how you learned all about the personal life of the ""stranger"" and all that. So, let's see how the remake all plays out.

How did he get back in with the blond girl? The garage door had been shut. How did he kill the maid without Jill noticing? She WAS on the same floor. I just wish more had been explained. It was good as a thriller though. I spent way too much time hiding behind my hands, even when I knew it was too soon in the movie for something real to happen. And it took way too long to get to the real excitement. The ending in the hospital was unnecessary. His face in the car would have been a better ending.

Little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling. The shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films, anything could happen in the film. The acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. The main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her.

I think those two months would have been better spent learning how to act, or doing research on how people actually react in terrifying life or death situations. Learning to run?

And when she went out to the guest house, after the lights have been turning on and off and she saw someone in the guest house and knew the guy was watching her, she goes and leaves the kids alone, no one in there right mind would do that, only an idiot would.

The carnival scene in the first 4 minutes of the movie was scarier than the rest of it... I personally found the movie to be a very bland retelling of the original urban legend (I watched a discovery channel showing of this story for goodness' sake!) and this movie added nothing to the story. The makers of this movie can stand in pride over their creation though: I literally laughed out loud through the whole thing. The cat and the balloon were scarier than the ""Stranger"", whom we never DO learn the identity of. *Spoiler* Sadly, for a moment, the movie reminded me of 'Titanic' when the stranger was moving his thumbs across the steamy window... -sigh- at least we get to hear an attractive girl breathing really hard for an hour and a half...Fortunately, this movie offers a very important life lesson if you are to go see it: Don't answer the *beep* phone, and if this were to happen to you, ask the parents for overtime pay...

There are a lot of crazy and insane people in the world and this movie shows how heartless they are and they will go to the extreme to get what they want. I would give this a better rating if it a better rating if it had a little more (actually a lot more)violence and more scares (no cheap scares).,When a Stranger Calls

The house was in the middle of nowhere with dark corridors, furniture, and certainly statues that would scare you in the dark! There was a lot of suspense, a great build up to when you thought something was going to happen, but it didn't. You never knew where he would appear, which builds up the most tension I think, especially when she got the call saying he was in the house, ARGHHHH, how scary!! I can't believe she ran out the house though to that lodge place, he could of been out there or actually in there!! I don't think anyone would do that, maybe some?? There was certainly a few jumpy moments in it, like when the cat ran out, and she turned around and he was right behind her.

463,Reiau2000,I want my $5 back!!,1,18 February 2006,"I've never posted on IMDb before but I will make an exception for this movie. Almost the entire movie consists of the main character, some girl babysitting who is also the only actor (I use the term ""Act"" loosely as some of her lines just sounded just plain off) shown in the movie for more than 10 minutes, Running around the house getting phone calls. Also it makes no sense that at the beginning of the movie a completely different girl is murdered, the detective comes in to look at the body (Which is not shown) and is obviously deeply disturbed by what he sees as it must be carried out of the house in many body bags. I thought that this must be some trademark of the killer and that I would get to see some seriously screwed up, gruesome deaths but there is not a drop of blood in the whole movie and the people that are killed are not brutally dismembered as the first girl was, not even a cut or anything can be seen on their body. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone (Even though the people who wrote the script ruined it to begin with) but I think that it is important to note that the killer at the end is just some random dude. There is no twist, there is no complex story as to why he just kills all these girls! He is just some loser that decides one day that he wants to kill babysitters. In the end the girl winds up in the hospital for no reason as she acquired no serious injuries during the course of the movie.

Every sentence...exactly the same. Every expression...exactly the same. The real horror of this movie is she is one of the better actors. This movie goes beyond boring and it makes no sense. Her dad apparently got her the babysitting as punishment for going 800 minutes (if I remember correctly) on her cell phone for a boyfriend whom in my opinion was uglier than the actual killer. In fact at one point I thought her boyfriend was the killer. Apparently Jill is the only person who knows how to answer a damn phone because when she fears for her life her father doesn't answer, the people she's babysitting for don't answer, the maid doesn't answer, and even the ""mysterious son"" doesn't answer. Maybe she should take a lesson and not answer. The only person who does answer is the loser police officer who does nothing. Jill also get the award for WORST BABYSITTER EVER since the only time she checked on the kids (whom I was beginning wonder if they really existed)is when the psycho killer told her to. The final glimmer of hope to this mess would be the fact that Simon West somehow got Lance Henrickson to lend his voice as the killer, but apparently didn't want to shell out the extra $100.00 bucks to get him to appear in the movie. On a positive note, this is a good date movie because about 10 minutes in you will stop watching the movie and start making out with your significant other.

The fact that nearly every possible situation was pretty much left open and otherwise unexplained is an amateur move. Cheap scares like the ""coat behind the door"" technique are shamelessly used. Just terrible.External point advantage for the hot chick. Oh and the fact that they used an arbitrary excuse to douse her in water while wearing a sufficiently tightened shirt.",When a Stranger Calls
472,dancincraz112101,Jill is babysitting in a big house while someone is inside tormenting her into near death,5,10 February 2006,I wouldn't say this was the best movie in the world(it didn't scare me but no scary movies do) But it was very suspenseful. Jill is babysitting in a huge house s it would be easy for someone to hide there. Two people get killed in the house the maid person and a friend who stops by to see her. Also the family she is babysitting for has an older son who stays at a guest house. She can see a shadow of someone out there so she calls and nobody answers. So when she goes out there no one is there and the creepy guy who calls her not saying anything calls the guest house which means he must have been inside the house and used the list of emergency #s on the fridge. But it turns out the person was just some random creepy guy trying to kill her. It wasn't the best but I liked it.,When a Stranger Calls
473,kbmzr,Great horror movie that keeps you in suspense!,8,3 February 2006,"The movie was great. It keeps you in suspense the entire time and I will definitely go see it again. The movie was great because you do not get any background information. I think I would have like to have some and that's why I gave it and eight out of ten. But, they do not waste anytime to start the horror. And, they keep you in suspense until the end. This is definitely a must see movie if you like horror films. I also like the way it is rated so that many people will get a chance to see the movie. Finally, a movie like this should be seen with someone else. It gets pretty intense at certain points and unless you really like horrors you might not want to see it alone.",When a Stranger Calls

My expectations went lower when I saw barely any lines, except for teens who are just going into the movie for what they thought would be cheap scares. I'm not scared or put on the edge of my seat easily, but these scares weren't cheap at all. Every single moment was exciting. The movie never slowed down. The characters were well built too, and they're realism was helped by the excellent acting. Regardless of what everyone else has said, I highly enjoyed this movie.Go see it!",When a Stranger Calls

I didn't give this movie much of a chance to begin with considering the Title didn't give it much room to do anything, but I had hoped that like some Pg13 movies there would be some good twists or something but alas there were none. Story of a girl babysitting gone wrong with some prankcalls from a mysterious man (that you never see till he is carted away by the police in a slow mo seen like your actually supposed to know who he is. WHICH YOU Don't) for 30min in of the movie with nothing really happening. Cop calls telling her he is in the house which is prob the scariest thing in the movie. They meet up with a brief struggle but no real violence. Cops come take him away. With the ending being her in the hospital ( Why who Knows??) having a dream of him choking her waking up and screaming that he is in the Hospital. The End, movie Credits here.... You might think I am leaving parts out but they are few and without mentioning anyways. To see this movie is a waste of money and whoever made it I hope this is there last shot at producing.",When a Stranger Calls

Maybe I'm just that type of person, but Jill, the main character, was scared and breathing heavily before the guy even called. And another factor is that every time he called she would be like ""It's you isn't it?"" or ""What do you want?""Oh, And I started cracking up when he said: ""Your Blood."" I'm sorry but it was funny. It was a good movie although, just full of bad actors (Especially the kids) and all of these little scenes where she'd get startled and immediately react with a heavy object, and then a cat would jump out or it would be the housekeeper. The only horrifying part really was when she found the dead Tiffany & Rosa. But That's It.Thanks.",When a Stranger Calls
478,nicole-247,Best Movie Ever,10,4 February 2006,"Last Night I went to see ""When a Stranger Calls"". I usually don't like scary movies because they are so lame and stupid and usually have no point but I must say this movie had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. This Movie is absolutely spine tingling. This movie is great for groups of friends that are looking for a thrill or great for lovers to cuddle and get close. This is a type of movie where you could go with your boyfriend/girlfriend and cuddle. You will end up holding his/her hand so tight you will think that you were holding on for dear life. Soon as this movie comes out to stores I will be the first to buy it. This is a movie that you could watch over and over again. I loved that it left you hanging in parts, and how even at the very begging I was freaked out. The Actors were great and it made you feel like you were right there in the room with them. Camilla Belle (Jill Johnson) was absolutely amazing in this movie, she is a great actor. Simon West is a great director; He did an excellent job with this film. If you have any doubt about this movie I hoped I changed your mind and you go and see this movie as soon as you get time. Soon as I started watching the movie I was waiting for the phone call which said ""Have You Checked the Children"" Soon as this was said I got this cold shiver through my whole body. I am sure that if you go see this movie you will absolutely not regret going to see it. It is totally worth your money. I saw the old and new version and I have to say I liked the newer version much better. I will give you an outline of what the movie is about A young teenage Girl named ""Jill Johnson"" has just broken up with her boy friend Bobby because she saw him kissing her best friend Tiffany. Jill because of this has used up all her minuets on her cell phone and has to go babysitting as discipline. When Jill arrives at where she is babysitting it is a big beautiful house far from other homes on a lake. The Owner's of this home is Will Mandrakis and Allison Mandrakis. They are wealthy people and have two children. Once the Mandrakis leave Jill is home alone only with Rosa the maid and Todd, Mr.Mandrakis son from his first marriage. However Todd lives in the guest across the lawn and Jill doesn't know weather he is home or not. Once the house is quite Jill starts hearing sounds and get scared and decides to investigate, after searching around the house Jill realizes it is only the Rosa. Soon after that Jill proceeds to get these strange phones calls. Jill decided to call the police department and tells them what is happen to her. Jill keeps the stranger on the phone for 1 minuet and then the police tracked the call which was coming from inside the house. The police where sent to the house but because the Mandrakis lived so far away from everything it took them a while to get there. After she gets the call Jill then encounters lots of problem which will have you on the edge of your seat screaming. I will not tell you any more. All I have to tell you is Go See this Movie it is absolutely outstanding. I must add the last five Minuets scared me completely to death and absolutely shocked me.I give this movie an absolute five out of five stars, and recommend this for anyone at or above the age of 13. My overall view of this movie is it's a SCARY, OUTSTANDING; EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THRILLER WHICH Will LEAVE YOUR HEART BEATING SO FAST YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. Get out as soon as you get the time and see this movie it's amazing.",When a Stranger Calls

For all the hype that it got, with MySpace and AIM throwing themselves down at it, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that it was so bad, my friend and I laughed hysterically through the whole thing. The acting was HORRIBLE, and I think it took them about an hour to film, well, the first hour. Don't take small children to see this - they'll be dead asleep in the first 30 minutes. Make sure if you DO go see this monstrosity, bring the most cynical person you know. You'll need the comic relief so your brain stays at least somewhat solid.",When a Stranger Calls
480,moviemusicmorenow,bad movie,1,4 February 2006,"When a Stranger Calls As you may have read before I thought the movie the Exorcism of Emily Rose was a bad movie. It's been a few months and a ton of movies later since then and now I have seen a movie just as bad if not worse. Welcome to the Paul Weber Movie Review! I knew right off hand this movie would be bad. It was the second day of the show being open and I have already read numerous reviews about it being horrible. What movie is it? None other than, When A Stranger Calls. The movie starts out like any other horror movie ware someone is killed and makes the movie seem like its going to be good. Not even showing how the victim is murdered or who the victim even is that was it. Basically a cop walks in and starts to gag at the sight, of a dead body, and what we the audience can't even see. I assume this is why the movie is only rated at a PG-13 level. Next it explains how the girl is a babysitter and then she has to go to a house far, far away from any other form of human contact.I don't want to give away too much but its kind of hard seeing is nothing really happens. This is exactly the only things that happen in this movie. A good looking girl is alone babysitting two kids in a huge house far away from civilization. She gets a phone call from an anonymous caller. That caller hangs up and she puts it off as a prank. She gets another call and this time what happens? The same things only this time guess what!? She is now a little frightened. A few more phone calls later and hey look we are now an hour into the movie and she has finely called the cops. The cops blow it off like a teenage girl in an NBA locker room. Once in awhile she would get her ass up and walk over to the house alarm and enter a code. Every time she entered a code however guess who called? The stranger! Yep this happens a lot in the movie. Walk to the alarm phone rings, answer the phone dude hangs up, walk to the alarm check the outside, phone rings, Etc Finely a within the last fifteen minutes of the movie a killer is revealed! Looks like every other Hollywood made killer black pants, black jacket. Except one thing is missing from this wanted killer who everyone is afraid of so much A weapon! This guy has only his hands and feet and he is scrawny. This hot young babe could have taken this guy easily with a nut shot but decides to run around the house anyway. Finely stuff happens and the criminal is rightfully punished. (I don't want to give the ending away) Speaking of the ending, that was the best part. It almost made me slightly jump. Not quite but almost. You can tell there will be a sequel but this time I know better than to go spend seven bucks watching a phone ring. Hell I can easily do that at a friend's house or at the comfort of my own home.",When a Stranger Calls
481,dwemere36,When A Stranger Calls,7,5 February 2006,"The entire movie is one hour and forty minutes long, and the first hour and ten minutes would probably make you question yourself why you're even there. But once you get through that first 1 hour and 10 minute part, the movie will keep you glued to your seat!! The ending is absolutely incredible. Overall, the movie was just GOOD. The beginning of the movie was so stupid, even a child could have thought of scarier things than that! But it started getting better. A lot better! The girl wasn't to bad looking either!

This movie put me to sleep, (I guess having a rib-eye steak and Shrimp plus two Blue Moon Tall Beers from Chili's) prior to the movie didn't help my situation. But anyhow..this movie just plain bit the BIG one. I should have sneaked across to the other theaters and watched the previews. They were probably a bit more exciting. Keep the Original as originals and don't try to remake them. IT Doesn't WORK! Perhaps if we try to make a movie about phones, the director should stick to movies like Phone Booth or Cellular.

I liked the plot but I thought it could have been a little more gory and where was the leading you to believe it was her Dad or her Boyfriend part? I like a little mystery to my movies, I like there to be a challenge to figuring out how it will end but it but those movies are hard to find, oh well. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to my friends and family, because after all its a good movie to be PG13, I took my little sister to see it, thers no vulgar language, no nudity, no gore!

Given my utter lack of experience, it seems only natural to ask oneself- what is it about this particular movie that could have generated such a response in someone. This move certainly motivated me. I think that it largely has to do with paying twelve dollars (I bought two tickets- cheap theatre thankfully) to watch something that a grade school student could, and possibly did write.. It was the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theatre and I went to a few Tom Greene films (Freddy Got Fingered). I won't discuss the plot, mainly because there wasn't one. The only entertaining element of my experience had to do with a teeny bopper's cell phone ringing at the same time as the phone in the movie- a novelty that Hollywood has already beaten to death. I have a hard time understanding how anybody could like this movie and I am entertained by almost every movie. This one was simply horrible.",When a Stranger Calls

And the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and gore, made it even that much stronger of a film. I had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails off!This film won't win anyone an Oscar, but it is entertaining and worth the matinée price ticket I bought to see it. I think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake...and then determine to never babysit again. All I can say is, I'm glad I'm too old to babysit!

Just because this movie isn't your common nasty, bloody, gory movie, doesn't make it dumb. Also, this movie is actually more real than most horror movies. The reality is that there are scary people out there in the real world and things like this do and can happen. At least its not some dumb gay monster eating the people alive. In the real world, these freaks are the monsters. Monsters aren't just classified as having more arms, legs or eyes then a human being, monsters are just the realities of life. This movie was great. It was realistic, and think it really could happen. Scary.. It wasn't a jumpy movie, it was a scary, creepy movie.

When I saw the preview i thought it was stupid, apparently I was correct out of over 1000 votes only a 4 out of ten rating. I figured this out by a 30 second TV spot. How did enough people for it to make 22 million dollars see the same preview I did and think wow this might be good I want to see this. See the movie studios when they see it made 22 million they might think we need another crappy remake of another classic horror movie. The original movies from the 70's are better. Proof the new Texas Chain Saw Massacre not good original good. See when the original When a Stranger Calls was made there were no cell phones. So when the cop said the call was coming from the house it was better because it really was coming from a phone in the house not a cell phone. Remake of good classic horror movies needs to stop.

I went to the movies yesterday with a couple of my friends. We wanted to go see the ""Pink Panther"", but it was sold out. So, we decided to go see ""When a Stranger Calls."" This was the worst choice out of all the movies that were available. The movie is bad from the very beginning to the very end. The parents punish the girl because she went over her cell-phone minutes. That is how the girl ends up baby-sitting. The movie was described and shown to be very scary. When watching the movie, there was not even a second where I and my friends were scared. Don't get me wrong. There were moment where the audience actually gasped, but the audience consisted mostly of 12 year-olds. No scary movie that is PG-13 is worth watching. There were really great moment in the movie where the director could have used to insert a scary part. The good use of sound was definitely visible in the movie, but should have been accompanied by visual motions to increase believe and awareness of viewers.

If he had got into the house then he would have had to get back out to kill the blonde girl. If Jill had shut the garage door and armed the system and locked everything they're had to be a possible way for the killer to get back in with the body. Also he wasn't in the house when she left he was residing in the guest house which ultimately was locked therefore he couldn't get in This means that during the time between when she saw him in the guest house and the time she went into there he had to have time to leave the house drag the body and place it in the bathroom. Also he would have to have gotten in and killed Rosa who also appeared dead at the bottom of the pond.

On it's own merits this was a pretty enjoyable movie, except for the 'kiddy' horror movie clichés that REALLY bug me! Like the cat jumping out and going REEEOOOOOOOW! when has ANYONE IN THEIR LIFE known a cat to jump out of the dark and screech like it's dying!! NEVER!!ANYWAYS! What REALLY bugged me being a fan of the original was the fact that the children LIVED! If you're going to REMAKE a classic film. DON'T MESS WITH THE STORY! Apart from that it was well acted and had a surprisingly bleak finale which i always like. Camille Belle gives a good performance for an actor that i consider to be unknown. Not a movie i would take children to see which makes me wonder why they gave it a PG rating. If you're going to make a horror movie don't be half-assed about it.

498,ericsean311,The worst movie ever made. I am not kidding.,1,1 March 2006,"I consider myself an avid movie watcher. I can pretty much find something I like out of any movie I've seen in my life. But When a Stranger Calls is a complete waste of film. Whoever wrote or directed this should be banned from Hollywood. Who green lit this? This director is so clueless and tries way too hard to even pretend to know what he's doing. He tries to be an M. Night Shamalan rip off and use sounds to build suspense and get his scares. First off I know I'm not alone in saying the ringing of a phone is an annoying sound. You hear a phone ring like 30 times in this disgrace of a movie. You hear birds wings flapping constantly throughout this terrible waste of time movie. Oh by the way you hear the birds very loud through glass that these sorry excuse for actors can't even break through by throwing chairs at. I have never wrote about any movie on the internet or anywhere else for that matter but I find myself being very resentful towards this movie. I think that everyone who had anything to do with this movie had to know how bad it was before it got released. I think that it's irresponsible for a production company or distributor to try to make any money by tricking the public to seeing a movie that is so obviously flawed. I can't believe that I've written so much about this movie. I hope that you read this and don't see it (obviously.) But I also hope that the people who helped out in any way with this movie read this and feel at least a little bad for knowingly taking the movie goers money for something they knew was unnaceptable for a theatrical release. It isn't even close to being adequacy enough for a straight to video release. I don't blame the actors. They are all no namers who probably would have signed on for anything.(I have seen the bad guy before. He must have been extremely desperate for work.) That girl in the lead has potential but she should never put this movie on her resume'. Just start over sweetheart. And steer clear of anything this sorry excuse for a director does in the future. For all of our sake I hope this director gets a clue and goes and asks for his job back at Wendys and never hi-jacks the publics money again. Please believe every word of this review. Believe me when I say there was no reason to exaggerate.Later, Eric B.",When a Stranger Calls

I was actually nervous about getting too scared. I came in too late to see the beginning, but the middle of the movie is just repeated over and over. Jill explores some part of the dark house, phone rings, no one there, she gets freaked out. Phone rings again, ""have you checked the children?"" she gets freaked out again. We see this for about 40 or so minutes and then we finally start to get some action when the police call and say ""the call is coming from inside the house"". A few moments in the ""climax"" that make you jump, ending is so unrealistic, and the very ending of the movie was horrible. I was so disappointed. I thought this movie would be better.",When a Stranger Calls
