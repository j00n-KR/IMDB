0,Leofwine_draca,"Not altogether bad video game adaptation, but it could have been better",4,30 October 2016,"Films based on computer games have long been the bane of modern cinema and RESIDENT EVIL does little to change the pattern they have fallen into over the years. This is an almost plot less action epic with a few zombies and monsters thrown in as an afterthought; a well-executed exercise in suspense, fear, and frights which goes through the motions without ever being engaging. Every cliché in the book is present here, from the actions of the zombies to the situations our characters find themselves in and the finale, amongst other things. In fact the best bit of the film is the very beginning, the prologue showing the complex spiralling out of control with death and destruction as a result; the feeling of helplessness and despair is overpowering and hard-hitting; personally I connected this with the real-life reactions of victims of disasters such as the World Trade Center bombing and thus found it very powerful stuff.From then on the tired formula follows a bunch of marines infiltrating a spookily deserted base (more than a few nods to ALIENS here) and finding themselves picked off one by one by a number of menaces: genetic mutations, the living dead, a malevolent super computer, and skinless dogs. Having never played the game I can't comment on the connection, although I guess that the ""feel"" is spot on. The film's biggest loss is the gaping hole left by the departure of George Romero, who would have undoubtedly made this something special. Flashy workman Paul W. S. Anderson has little of Romero's skill and expertise in the genre and we're left only wondering what it would have been like with gory George on board.Technically the film is very good, excellent use being made of the budget and some interesting actors giving edgy performances. Lead Milla Jovovich manages to make her character smart AND sexy whilst the supporting male actors give subdued but solid turns. The only turn-off is Michelle Rodriguez, who plays Vasquez from ALIENS again, except without the likability; her character fails to engage on any level, making her plight (she finds herself the victim of a zombie bite) rather uninteresting. On the plus side, special effects are very good indeed (zombies have never looked better), whether makeup or solid CGI work (especially the skinless dogs, which provide a worthwhile menace; unfortunately the genetic mutation which turns up later on looks exactly like what it is, a pretty but hollow computer pattern). The script, however, is pretty shallow and the twists and surprises telegraphed a mile off.This is a film of two halves; the first builds up the suspense whilst the latter provides the payoff, namely the action. I prefer the former, with its gradually building intrigue and growing horror, scenes of genuine nastiness, excellent use of lighting, and a dark, brooding atmosphere. The action is all right but ruined by a loud, irritating and out-of-place soundtrack incorporating the likes of Marilyn Manson. I remember being annoyed when UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN used a similar technique. I don't want to be blown out of my chair by several decibels when watching a film, and such intrusive noise only dispels the realism and takes you out of it. Without the music this would have been a lot better. Thankfully, there are some scenes of gore to take your mind off the flaws, with some nasty laser dissections copied from Canadian indie hit CUBE and some zombie-munching fun, although hardcore gore lovers will be disappointed by the lack of intestine-munching. As a fun, brainless popcorn flick this delivers, but there isn't much to stay in your mind afterwards and it has little re-watchability value. Not bad but could have been a heck of a lot better.",Resident Evil
1,SnoopyStyle,Some good action but not much more,6,10 March 2014,"The Umbrella corporation dominates the world. In an accident at its secret underground facility called ""The Hive"", a dangerous virus is let loose. It has infected the staff turning them into zombies while mutant creatures run free. The computer Red Queen shuts down the complex and kills everybody inside. Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself with amnesia in a house that has a secret entrance to the underground labs. The corporation sends in an elite armed squad (Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez) who finds amnesic Alice and Spence (James Purefoy), and they go in to investigate.Based on the video game, director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson brings some interesting gore into the movie. The characters are two dimensional. But it does what it intends to do and not much more. It's mostly atmosphere in the first half. Then there is shoot them up horror action but nothing terribly scary. And hot Jovovich doing battle with zombies and mutants. The flashbacks as Alice remembers is distracting and usually disrupts the flow. The video game genre doesn't usually get much better.",Resident Evil
2,Horst_In_Translation,Needed better focus in many areas,4,27 October 2015,"""Resident Evil"" is the first of the film series that adapted the popular video game franchise into the world of movies. Milla Jovovich was chosen to lead the franchise after her success on ""The Fifth Element"". I can only speak about this first entry to the series as I have not seen the other ones, but I was not impressed at all. These 100 minutes (with credits) had basically everything you'd expect from a weak action movie that relies on spectacular effects and sacrifices story for it. They included stuff like love relationships, sex, nudity etc. to make this look slightly more interesting, but none of these aspects received a convincing elaboration. It all just felt thrown in for the sake of it.I will not deny that this is a film worth watching for its technical aspects and there are some decent scenes actually, but it's all shallow and unconvincing if the characters are so badly written like it is case here. By the way, the monster humans reminded me a bit of the walkers on ""Walking Dead"". Interesting aspect that they also included the idea that they were dead already despite still moving with the clotted blood reference. But that was one of really not too many smart aspects from this film. Jovovich and Rodriguez may be very attractive, but in terms of acting I'm not too sure if they can carry a franchise like that. Admittedly, you have to say in their favor that their male co-actors were even more forgettable. It is the same like almost any other Bernd Eichinger production and Paul W.S. Anderson film: A lot of style over substance and just not a great story or great writing. Forgettable movie and it's odd to see this has 3 sequels already with number 4 in the making. I really hope the quality gets better, but judging from this one here, I do not have much intention to watch the other films soon. Not recommended.",Resident Evil

Soon the group learns that the staff has turned into zombies and now they are under siege of the zombies. Most of the commando dies and only Alice, Spence, Matt, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Kaplan survive. Now they need to find a way to escape from The Hive since the system will shut down the exits in a short period. Who will survive?""Resident Evil"" is a great sci-fi action horror film by Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and the rest of the cast have good performances and the non-stop action is engaging. The gloomy pessimist conclusion fits perfectly to the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil: O Hóspede Maldito"" (""Resident Evil: The Damned Guest"")",Resident Evil
5,kosmasp,Evil Begins,5,30 December 2010,"When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that. Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero would have done with it.But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you can't help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that haven't (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so herself on the commentary and some other things).All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.",Resident Evil
6,jboothmillard,Resident Evil,6,19 September 2005,"Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race, Pompeii), I had always heard of the popular zombie survival horror video games series, and I had enjoyed the George A. Romero Living Dead films, I was hoping for the same entertainment with this video game based film. Basically the film starts in the secret underground laboratory located beneath Raccoon City, called The Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation, an accident occurs and a deadly chemical called the T-Virus is released into the facility, the artificial intelligence security system, The Red Queen, traps all workers inside to contain the infection. Alice (The Fifth Element's Milla Jovovich) awakens alone in a deserted mansion, she is suffering from short-term amnesia, she is shortly accompanied by police officer Matt Addison (Ugly Betty's Eric Mabius), before he is subdued by a military unit, sent by the Umbrella Corporation. The commandos consist of leader James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon), Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), medic Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D. (Pasquale Aleardi) and two others, they have been assigned to shut down the main computer and quarantine the virus, and along the way also meet fellow amnesiac Spence Parks (A Knight's Tale's James Purefoy), he was in a sham marriage with Alice, to protect the Hive's entrance. To get to the Hive the team must first travel the long underground train system to reach the facility, and pass through the various, and dangerous, security and weapon systems they unintentionally activate, including a laser defence system that slices most of the commandos into pieces. Alice and the remaining members manage to get to the circuit board containing the Red Queen system, it is deactivated and all doors are unlocked, but the team had not counted on the release of a horde of zombified people, these undead creatures were formerly the staff working inside the Hive, they have been infected by the T-Virus. After battling with these flesh hungry mutated people, Alice suggests reactivating the Red Queen who will be able to explain what happened in the Hive, the artificial intelligence explains the infection that spread, that the virus is contagious and reanimates dead bodies with an impulse, they are driven by the basic need to feed, one bite or scratch from a creature and that person will become one themselves, trauma to the head is the only way to kill them. The team try to navigate their way out of the facility and back to the train to reenter Raccoon City, but the zombies are all over the place and blocking their path, as well as mutated dogs, and an experimental beast made from evolution in human flesh, and they must also be careful not to bring the effects of the T-Virus to the surface and spread the infection further. Also starring Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey, Oscar Pearce as Mr. Red, Indra Ové as Ms. Black, Anna Bolt as Dr. Green, Joseph May as Dr. Blue, Heike , Makatsch as Lisa, Jaymes Butler as Clarence, Stephen Billington as Mr. White, Fiona Glascott as Ms. Gold and Jason Isaacs as Dr. William Birkin, also narrating. Jovovich is great being the kick-ass woman who slowly regains her memory and a bunch of martial arts and gun skills, Rodriguez is also feisty, the supporting cast all do well also, the special effects and makeup for the zombies, mutated things and scientific stuff are all cool, and the music by shock rocker Marilyn Mason gives the action edge, it is exciting compared to the rubbish or average sequels that followed, a great science- fiction horror action film. Good!",Resident Evil
7,ccthemovieman-1,Too Macho & Violent.....And That's Just The Women!,1,22 December 2007,"This 21st century science fiction/horror story should have been much better than it wound up. To me, it had a couple of major problems, namely: It had very few likable characters and way overdone violence. Regarding the latter, even with the good special-effects, nonstop violence only serves to become boring after awhile. When are filmmakers going to learn this? Certainly not director-writer Paul Anderson, who was responsible for this after two previous bombs in ""Event Horizon"" and ""Soldier."" If you recall, those movies also were disappointing.The women in here are Hollywood's new type of heroine: tough-looking, tough-talking and overly macho. Whatever happened to nice girls? If you lived on another planet and only watched movies made on Earth, you'd think women were physically tougher than men, and all want to act like men. Michelle Rodriguez played a character (""Rain Ocampo"") who personified this misconception to the hilt. She was annoying, to say the least, as was this film in general which is made to satisfy millions of immature young males. Judging by the amount of reviews here, the filmmakers succeeded.",Resident Evil
8,Tweekums,Solid enough zombie movie based on a video game,7,5 August 2015,"As the film opens we that the film is set in a near future where the Umbrella Corporation is the world's largest business and that some of its activities are distinctly shady. The action then starts in a lab where an unknown thief steals a case containing a biological weapon that we later learn is called the T-Virus. As he fleas he smashes one of the vials releasing the virus into the facility, known as The Hive. As the virus is spread through the air-conditioning The Hive's computer seals the facility and kills everybody inside. We then cut to the sight of a naked woman, Alice, wrapped in a shower curtain; she gets dressed and is surprised first by an unknown man then by a whole squad of commandos! Their leader addresses her as 'Soldier' but she has no idea who she is. The other man identifies himself as a newly transferred police officer. These two are then taken by an underground railway to The Hive where we learn they intend to shut down the computer, known as Red Queen. Red Queen's defences kill many of the commandos and before the others shut it down its avatar informs them that they will all die. It soon becomes apparent that the people in The Hive have come back to life as zombies! Perhaps Red Queen was right; certainly many of them won't make it; some of them will become zombies themselves and not all of the dangers are outside the group.I have not played the computer games this film was inspired by so can't say how the story compares but it didn't feel like there was much unexplained within the film. The fact that Alice has no memory means that we are told everything we need to know as the leader of the commandos tells her. The film opens strongly with the scenes with Red Queen killing everybody in The Hive and after we have been introduced to Alice and her situation the action is pretty good. It is also varied; we have Red Queen's futuristic defences that literally slice and dice some commandos with a laser, hordes of zombies, zombie guard dogs and a mutant creature for our protagonists to battle against. While nobody is going to be winning any Oscars for this the cast do a decent enough job; Milla Jovovich is good as Alice; putting in some good action scenes and Michelle Rodriguez is fun as the hard-core commando Rain Ocampo and Colin Salmon adds some class as the commandos' leader although sadly he doesn't last too long. In many ways this film feels like 'Aliens' with the aliens replaced by zombies; we have an evil corporation, one of the group who is working against their interests and the fact that the protagonist and the toughest soldier are both women... I guess if one is going to borrow ideas from another film one could do a lot worse that take from 'Aliens'. The effects are fairly mixed; the zombies, both human and canine, are impressive but some of the CGI is far too obvious. The Red Queen is delightfully creepy due to the fact that it speaks with the voice of a young girl and prior to shutdown appears to be all-seeing. Overall this film is far from perfect but it is surprisingly fun in a fairly trashy way.",Resident Evil
9,ma-cortes,First and the best rendition based on popular video games in which a virus has escaped into a secret facility,7,26 July 2014,"A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident into a facility called the ¨Hive¨.

This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized , being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This original takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore than subsequent sequels . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen some scenes in previous films , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women , as Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Milla Jovovich did all of her own stunts except the pipe jump in the sewer scene . The main actors were told to prepare for the film by getting copies of the games and playing them through. Some of them didn't know if they could complete them in time so they had to get video copies of other people beating the games and then watch it . One of the most popular scenes in the film - when Alice runs up a wall and flings round to kick a zombie dog in the head - took 3 months of training for Milla Jovovich. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams , shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals and state-of-art FX won the Canadian Screen Award for Achievement in Visual Effects . Professional dancers were cast as zombies . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with destroyed city , with a technological facility totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures and much of it was filmed in unfinished stations of Berlin underground . Cool , luminous cinematography using Steadicam by David Johnson . Haunting , pulsing Techno-musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was professionally directed with startling visual style , though with no originality , by Paul W Anderson . This was he second movie based on a video game directed by Paul W.S.

Titles like Doom (1993), Silent Hill (1999) and Max Payne (2001) were all snapped up. The complete saga is formed by the following films : ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of defensive measures to contain the virus .

10,BA_Harrison,"Alice, what's the matter?",8,7 March 2011,"When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and just a little bit wary.Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the results nonetheless.Nowadays, having seen Romero's last three chapters in his Dead series (Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked (you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson's direction is slick, without being too showy (ie., he doesn't resort to an overkill of trendy editing), there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the screen with their loveliness in the process.",Resident Evil
11,paul_haakonsen,A very enjoyable adaptation of the survival horror games...,7,17 July 2020,"Well, being a long time fan of the ""Resident Evil"" games - been playing those since the original game was released. So having a movie adaptation for the franchise has been good. Well, at least it started out alright, and then as the franchise progressed, the steam just deflated the balloon.I will say that writer and Paul W.S. Anderson actually managed to capture the essence of the ""Resident Evil"" games with this 2002 movie, and at the same time he managed to make the movie action-packed and thrilling, as I doubt a movie as slow paced as the game would prove for less adequate entertainment.I have watched this 2002 ""Resident Evil"" movie about four or five times already over the years since it was released. And I can honestly say that this particular first movie in the franchise keeps being as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it.There is a good storyline to the movie, albeit it is one that is very familiar if you have played the games, for better or worse. But still, regardless of you having played the games or not, there is something in this 2002 movie for just about everyone in the audience.The movie has a very great cast ensemble to portray the various characters and roles, and I think they casted people quite well for ""Resident Evil"". Normally, I am not overly keen on Milla Jovovich, but she carries herself quite well as Alice. Furthermore, the movie also have the likes of Eric Mabius, Martin Crewes and Colin Salmon. And of course then there is also James Purefoy and Michelle Rodriguez, and ""Resident Evil"" really is their movie, because they were really outstanding in the movie and portrayed their characters with such grace and intensity.For a zombie movie, then there is a lot of action in ""Resident Evil"", and it works out well, especially since the movie starts out slow, dropping hints to the fans and slowly builds up the atmosphere and director Paul W.S. Anderson lines up the events quite well and executes them great on the screen. I will say that ""Resident Evil"" is a very intense zombie movie, and it definitely feels like you are right there in The Hive, deep underground with the characters in the movie.Something that should be said worked really well for ""Resident Evil"" was the way that it was filmed, lots of scenes were so true to what you experience in the games, such as long corridors, enclosed spaces, etc. That was just pure candy for us fans of the games.The movie also had good zombie make-up and effects. And of course, this being a ""Resident Evil"" movie based loosely on the first game, then you also have the zombie dogs and the lickers. Now, the zombie dogs were really great. And while the lickers are a crucial part of the ""Resident Evil"" lore, then the CGI here in this 2002 movie really didn't do them full justice, as they looked like what they were; CGI animated. It was a shame.""Resident Evil"" is a movie that can be watched over and over.My rating of Paul W.S. Anderson's 2002 movie is a seven out of ten stars.",Resident Evil
12,Quinoa1984,One of the worst films I've seen so far in 2002,4,15 March 2002,"I remember reading somewhere that George A. Romero, the great horror picture director, was originally slated to write and possibly direct the transformation of the playstation video game of the same name to the screen. Then it was also reported that the studio decided to go with another director on the project which to me indicates 1 of 2 scenarios- 1, Romero had lost his edge as a zombie film artist and did maybe write a bad script, or 2 (which is what I believe), the studios couldn't recognize what was possibly an intelligent script in the tradition of his ""Dead"" trilogy (I can only speculate by the way) and decided to go with something that was a lot more dumbed down for their standards.Whichever is the case, this is the result, a zombie movie where, truth be told, the zombies aren't quite the most ominous and terrorsome threat to the people in attendance in the film- a mega computer system in the form of a semi/mute HAL in a military complex is and that is one of many flaws and miscalculations here.  Another is that the script has the dialogue span that a 10 year old would consider short winded (and this is a rated R movie) and development, yes even in action, that is not really good.  In fact, the only thing keeping me from failing this is that the zombies when they do appear, look OK and the laser death sequence is a bit keen.In short, this is the type of living dead movie where you can see what's on the other side of the spectrum of a movie like Day of the Dead (Romero's least effort) where there was more talk than action which didn't work that well and then this where even the action doesn't help to elevate poor writing (at least Day had a memorable ending).  Hardcore Resident Evil fans should stick to the games and movies.  Grade: Between D- and F+",Resident Evil
13,Coventry,"""Do you wish to save game?"" ...Not really.",5,10 December 2005,"""Resident Evil"" is a LOT better than I ever hoped it would be and, even though it still isn't a very good movie, that's quite a big compliment. It's based on a video game (Capcom's hugely successful video game, to be more specific) and usually that's not a very good sign, since all those game-based horror movies have absolutely no story construction and the special effects as well as the set pieces always look far too hectic. ""Resident Evil"" looks good, very good even, and the story is surprisingly endurable, despite being first-class nonsense of course. The film is also very gory and action-packed but the only thing it totally hasn't got are genuine frights. And I heard that rather disappointed the fans of the game (personally, I never played it) because that is generally acclaimed to be really terrifying with disturbing images and unsettling graphics. The movie opens bustling and to-the-point, with employers of the Umbrella Corporation (a company that pretty much took over the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century) getting trapped after the outbreak of a dangerous virus. The large building complex  referred to as ""the Hive""  is located underground and a team of heavily armed commandos, accompanied by two security guards with amnesia, have to invade it for further investigation. Once inside the Hive, the team encounters many unpleasant surprises like zombie-employers, mutant Dobermans, hi-tech anti-burglary measures and a top-secret army project with a gigantic tongue! After the captivating opening, ""Resident Evil"" rapidly turns into a routine horror/action movie with blunt characters and atrocious dialogues. Paul W.S. Anderson borrows many ideas and style-aspects from other genre films, like ""The Matrix"", ""Aliens"" and George A. Romero's trilogy of the Dead. Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich are tolerable as the tough girls, but they work too hard on their bad-ass-image. Would a smile, if only a little one, have hurt them? The rest of the cast is filled with adequate performers even though they'll most likely never get a star on Hollywood Boulevard. Anderson's directing skills have obviously improved since ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Event Horizon"", as this accomplishment looks a lot more surefooted. ""Resident Evil"" is a very watchable film but I still don't regret having waited patiently to see it until it aired on television. There are a handful of admirable moments (my favorite remains the death-by-laser scene) but overall it remains a boisterous mess.",Resident Evil

The film stars Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy. It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror series Resident Evil that borrowed elements from the video games Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2.The story follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-Virus at a secret underground facility.Resident Evil presents Alice and Rain,two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive.Resident Evil is more a live video game than a movie.Despite of its outstanding visuals and production values,it loud,cheesy and formulaic.Also,its primary purpose is to entertain and astound the viewer with its special effects rather than tell a story.",Resident Evil
16,Theo Robertson,Another Disappointing Movie With Zombies,5,17 January 2005,"What is it about zombie movies ? The Romero movies had good scripts but were let down by the technical aspects while LIFEFORCE and 28 DAYS LATER were brilliantly directed but had woeful scripts . I thought after watching the first ten minutes of RESIDENT EVIL someone had got the balance right with the opening hook featuring some impressive novelty deaths . The problem is after this good start the movie then spends the next forty minutes going nowhere . We know what's going on because most the audience is aware of the computer game so we have to put up with some seriously uneeded exposition about Alice , the combat team and the Red Queen computer system . What makes it all so annoying is that you're left with the impression that the producers wanted the movie to appeal more to a mainstream audience rather than fans of the game then at the very last minute abandoned their initial instinctsThere are a couple of good aspects that stop RESIDENT EVIL being a total flop , it's good to look at on a visual level while a mainly British cast do manage very convincing American accents , and not all the main characters survive ( watch out for those lazers ) which makes the movie unpredictable . But again I have to point out the movie would have worked better still if the producers ignored the fan boys and made a movie with a wider mainstream appeal . As it stands perhaps the 1970 DOCTOR WHO story Inferno is the greatest piece of fiction featuring zombies",Resident Evil
17,preppy-3,Fun,7,25 March 2002,"Director Paul Anderson has done two of my favorite films--""Mortal Kombat"" (I know it's based on a video game but I liked it) and ""Event Horizon"" (one of the most unsettling sci-fi/horror films ever). This movie (also based on a video game) isn't good as the other two. But for what it is, it's great.A virus is mistakenly (?) let loose in a huge underground city run by a corporation. It kills everyone there and a military squad is sent down to deactivate the central computer. But the computer is active, aware...and angry. Soon the squad is dealing with flesh-eating zombies, zombie dogs and a huge, scary, angry mutant.The plot is needlessly complex and convoluted and brings the movie to a screeching halt so characters can explain what's going on. Also this movie goes out of its way to show Milla Jovovich nude more than once. But still, I enjoyed this movie. The acting is OK except for Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez--they're both very attractive but are terrible actors--there blank faces and lousy dialogue readings got annoying. The male members of the cast were, on the other hand, very good. The special effects are stunning and the movie is very loud, very fast, very violent and FUN! The booming music score helps propel the movie along. Also it has more than its share of creepy moments (the voice of the computer spooked me for some reason--it's a little girls voice!). Blood, violence, noise--hey, what more could you ask for? Worth catching.",Resident Evil
18,poolandrews,"Playing the game is more fun than watching the film, having said that it ain't too bad.",5,18 January 2005,"We start with some opening narration (by Jason Isaacs) that goes something like this, 'Confidential Report. Subject: the events leading up to the incident at Racoon City'. The narration continues, 'At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Umbrella corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. 9 out of every 10 homes contain it's products. It's political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public it is the worlds leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, health-care. Unknown even to it's own employees it's massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, viral weaponry'. The film then cuts to a seemingly normal research facility. An unknown person or persons steal a futuristic looking case of vials containing some sort of top secret green and blue substance. Before leaving they smash one of the blue vials and the substance inside is spread throughout the rest of the building through the ventilation system with horrifying results! A beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich, her characters name is never mentioned but it happens to be Alice so that's what I will call her for the rest of my review) wakes up, lying naked in a shower inside a very posh looking bathroom. Alice has no idea who she is or what she is doing there as she has total memory loss. Alice explores her surroundings, she leaves the bathroom and discovers she is in a large, and seemingly deserted mansion. She sees a note that says ""Today all your dreams come true"". Alice finds some rather fetching clothes, a long sexy red dress and a pair of knee high leather boots. A heavily armed elite squad of soldiers, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D Salinas (Pasquale Aleardi) plus two more whose names are never mentioned (Torsten Jerabek and Marc Logan-Black) burst in through the windows, hey what was wrong with the doors guys? The one in command (Colin Salmon, like Milla his characters name is never mentioned during the film) seems to know Alice. Along with a mysterious man who claims to be a cop called Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) they all get on-board a train and find yet another survivor named Spence Parks (James Purefoy) who also has memory loss like Alice. They all travel on the train deep underground to the 'Hive'. The soldiers explain that the 'Hive' is located under Racoon City being half a mile underground at it's deepest point. It is a top secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corp. and houses over 500 scientists, technicians and support staff. The 'Hive' is controlled by 'Red Queen', state of the art artificial intelligence that takes on the holographic appearance of the lead programmers daughter (Michaela Dicker). They say they are there on a search and rescue mission as 'Red Queen' went homicidal and killed everyone inside the 'Hive', to try and find out what happened and to destroy 'Red Queen' if necessary. Things don't go according to plan however. There may be a traitor in the group, and a horde of flesh eating zombie office workers created by the Umbrella Corp. developed 'T-Virus' which is what all the fuss is about doesn't help their cause. Nor does the fact that in an hour the 'Hive' will be sealed, permanently with them still inside to stop any potential outside contamination! Will they all make it out in time? Can they put an end to the Umbrella Corp. research and deadly 'T-Virus' it has created and contain it so not to let it spread outside and infect millions of people? Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I think playing the game is ultimately more fun and rewarding. All the best ideas in this are taken from the game, the rest come from Aliens (1986) which this film resembles strongly. The script, to it's credit, moves along like a rocket and tries to add some twists here and there but for the most part they are fairly easy to see coming and not surprising. At least it's never dull or boring. I found the horror elements extremely disappointing, the zombies don't turn up until over half way through the film and there is virtually no blood or gore in it at all, apart from a CGI decapitation with no blood. I did like the skinless dogs, but they were taken directly from the game though. As was the big monster at the end which was also quite cool, if a little fake looking. A decent amount of gore would have helped this film no end, the potential was there with zombies Vs heavily armed soldiers but no, just a few bullet hits and that's it. The zombies don't eat anyone either. The action elements are also average at best, a few CGI enhanced fights and a couple of sequences that try to be exciting but generally aren't. I would have preferred the filmmakers to have more of it set in the Gothic cool looking mansion rather than the high-tech labs and offices as it would have given the whole film a much creepier atmosphere. Acting is OK for this type of thing but no-one is going to win an Oscar, and Milla Jovovich is a real babe in that dress and those boots as she kicks but. Everyone else involved has to deal with standard horror stereotypes and clichés. It's not a bad film I suppose as it's well made moves along a nice pace and entertains to an extent but it could have been so much more in the hands of someone with talent and imagination. Resident Evil plays like a cross between the game and Aliens, if the sound of that appeals to you you may like it otherwise you probably won't. Average, but worth a watch none the less.",Resident Evil
19,dbborroughs,After a classic first half hour this is done in by crappy monsters,5,12 September 2004,"This story of the walking dead in a secret government base is very disappointing. In all honesty I expected to despise this film and then was shocked when the first half hour leading up to the zombies, was a tight, scary horror film of the highest order.And then the zombies show up and it all falls into the toilet. The problem with this movie is that the monsters are so badly acted and so awful looking it takes away from any tension because you are laughing at them. Such is the problem with most post-Dawn of the Dead films, the people playing zombies over act and destroy the mood. Chalk it up to awful direction, or non direction of the crowds of zombies.If you can get past the laughter this is a good film. Many people I've told about the laughable monsters, liked the film when they saw it themselves, I on the other hand can't be as forgiving because I loved the opening that much.Try it, but expect to laugh more than you scream.5 out of 10 (purely because of the zombie, the rest is pretty good)",Resident Evil

No, I haven't done video games since Pacman, so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Milla Jovovich and, of course, am always happy to see Michelle Rodriguez.I have only come into zombies recently, so I was not aware that this film brought the genre back after a long absence.

21,zardoz-13,Underground Zombies Unite,6,15 October 2016,"""Mortal Combat"" director Paul W.S. Anderson's first entry in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise is basically a low-budget zombie munch-fest based on the popular Capcom video game that spawned the series. This $ 30-million horror chiller relies on several narrative devices to fuel its adrenalin-laced antics. First, the heroine suffers from amnesia as she struggles to remember what she was doing in the ultra-secret, high-tech, subterranean laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation where scientists have been conducting research and development on experimental viruses for military usage. Second, from the moment that the rescue team arrives and collects Alice (Milla Jovovich of ""The Fifth Element""), Matt (Eric Mabius of ""Cruel Intentions""), and Spence (James Purefoy of ""Solomon Kane""), they have an hour to penetrate the Hive, carry out their mission, and exit the complex before it seals itself shut. Third, the entire experience occurs in a claustrophobic setting that accentuates the suspense after our heroes encounter a zombie horde. Everybody earning a paycheck in the Hive dies when a traitor smashes a lethal t-virus container that shuts down the facility and winds up spreading death. Fourth, the ravenous undead are not the only adversaries that our heroes must contend with; zombie Dobermanns threaten them as well as a mysteriously mutated monster with a long, elastic tongue and razor-sharp claws that can penetrate a train. Believe it or not, Anderson displays some discretion in some of the greatest gut-churning scenes. When a group is trapped inside an elevator, one woman squeezes her head through an opening and realizes too late as do her companions that she is going to be decapitated when the elevator goes upward and smashes her head. The audience, especially those that have played the Capcom game, know that you have to put a bullet in a zombie's head to kill it. Unfortunately, our stalwart heroes aren't privy to this life-saving information. Eventually, the supercomputer that regulates the Hive and takes the holographic form of an adolescent female becomes another of our heroes' adversaries.As the plot unfolds, Alice regains her memory in bits and pieces and realizes that she was the individual who had decided to expose the Umbrella Corporation. All of the laboratory technicians in the Hive perish tragically through no fault of their own because one mysterious individual sabotaged the Hive. These employees come back to life as zombies that live only to eat. These zombies are traditional ""Night of the Living Dead"" shambling walkers. The close quarters inside the Hive as well as the booby-traps that our heroes must navigate to avoid constitutes a primary form of suspense. At one point, our desperate heroes clamber atop the air condition ducts dangling by wires from the ceiling to escape the zombies milling about beneath them. One of the more memorable scenes takes place before this one when the rescue team arrives in a hallway that has been booby-trapped with the equivalent of a cheese grater made up of lasers to slice up the rescue team as they scramble to avoid them. Our heroine Alice—dressed in a skimpy red dress—contends with hunger Dobermanns in one of the strongest scenes in the film. Just when she thinks that she had taken care of these menacing dogs, she runs into others. Before long, even these canines mutilate undead dogs and attack Milia, but she knows how to contend with them.""Resident Evil"" gets the franchise off to a fitting start when our hero arrives by train.",Resident Evil
22,Boba_Fett1138,Better than expected.,7,22 November 2005,"""Resident Evil"" didn't exactly received raving reviews when it got released. It however is an enjoyable action flick with some horror elements in it, that is worth seeing.Looks like only people really disappointed with this movie were and are the fans of the video games this movie is based on. The movie has very little to do with the video games but should that automatically mean that the movie is a bad one? I don't think that's exactly fair assumption. You should just take this movie for what it is; An action/horror movie that happens to be loosely BASED on a video game. As a movie it really isn't bad. It might not be the best or most original movie, it still is an enjoyable action flick that is perfectly watchable.Still its a movie with flaws. Biggest flaw is the continuity. Not everything that happens in the movie makes logically sense. for instance in the beginning of the movie all of the characters are suddenly split up, without any explanation why and how this happened and of course every character gets a bad encounter during their split up. There are several tiny things like this in the movie that don't make logical sense from a story point of view and the continuity and editing are weak and flawed at times. All little hints that director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't the greatest director in the business.The movie also isn't exactly successful as an horror. Most of the scare moments in the movie fail and are too much and too often the same. The action is good, although predictable. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and because of that it also never really becomes tense or truly exciting. It's really one of those ""Aliens""-wannabe movies. It's too bad but it doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It's still a movie made with lots of style and profession and even though it isn't the most original movie it still is a successful one, from a movie technical point of view.It's obvious that Milla Jovovich was just cast because of her looks but she does a fair enough job in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a good action movie star and Colin Salmon is a great actor but his role is too limited. The movie could had really used his acting abilities and his character more. The wonderful Jason Isaacs also has a uncredited cameo toward the ending of the movie and also as narrator.A movie worth seeing at least once. You might end up liking it better than expected, as with me was the case.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Resident Evil

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Well, what'd you expect?",7,21 August 2004,"I'm baffled at why people have high expectations for movies based on video games. No matter how good the source material is, you can't expect a video game to do good as a movie. I imagine that's where a lot of heat towards this movie is coming from; hordes of Resident Evil game fans who hate the film because it has got very little to do with the games. I agree, it doesn't have a lot to do with the games; there are a few references to various of the video game titles, and there are the zombies, and it does try to build the atmosphere of the games. But it just doesn't work too good in the end. The film is billed as an action/thriller/science fiction/horror film; unfortunately, not too many of those aspects of the film work very good. The action is pretty good, but action sequences are few and far between. The thriller parts are decent enough; I really enjoyed the very last scene. The science fiction portions of the film are not very well thought out or particularly professionally executed; I kind of liked the basic idea of the film, but it just didn't seem to work too well. The horror consists of director Paul W.S. Anderson's personal brand of loud noise, sudden scares/shocks(or attempts at such) and intense rock music. It does have some good scares, and some of the zombie scenes are quite intense. But a big problem with the zombies is the fact that they don't even turn up in the movie for a solid 45 minutes. That's almost half of the film. And there passes many scenes that don't involve any zombies at all. I suppose the film was supposed to be tense during those scenes, as in, the tension of knowing that the zombies are out there, but I was never really afraid of them. The plot is nonsensical and pretty badly put together. The acting is decent, but not at all great. The character development is nearly non-existent. The special effects are great; well, mostly great. There are a few times where the CGI is obvious, and quite a few where it's badly used. Worth noting is the amount of details that are taken from various of the games. Something that annoyed me was the lack of realism in the film; these zombies/walking corpses are supposed to be a few hours old, right? Then how come their teeth are so decayed, half of their faces rotten, and various of their body parts so screwed up? I know it was done for effect, but it was fairly ridiculous. Also, the action and stunts that Milla Jovovich's character pull off is not the least bit realistic, and mainly looks like a direct rip-off of The Matrix. All in all, I suppose it's decent enough. For such a just-above-average-film, I'm surprised at how many times I've managed to sit through it. Maybe that explains my rating. Who knows. I recommend it to fans of the various aforementioned genres. Just watch it with low expectations, and don't try too hard to make sense of the plot. 7/10",Resident Evil
25,view_and_review,A New Era of Video Game Based Movies,7,5 February 2021,"I think ""Resident Evil"" brought in a new era of movies. The video game based movie. Yes, there were other movies before that were based upon video games: ""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Street Fighter,"" ""Super Mario Bros.,"" and maybe some others, but they were terrible. For me, ""Resident Evil"" was the first video game movie that was worth watching.I don't know anything about the game, so the movie is the source of all of my knowledge. Per the movie, the Umbrella Corporation is the most powerful and most ubiquitous company in the land. Imagine Amazon and Apple rolled into one. The main character, Alice (Milla Jovovich), wakes up in an Umbrella Corp. owned mansion and she has no idea why she's there or how she got there. Before she can get her bearings, a strike force team all clad in black busts into the mansion and whisks her away. They are there to penetrate ""the hive"" and shutdown the main computer. ""The hive"" is an underground hive like facility that houses some sensitive Umbrella Corp. experiments and a lot of employees. Unbeknownst to this strike team, the hive computer has put the place on total lockdown to contain a deadly disease called the ""T-Virus."" The T-Virus reanimates the dead. Yeah, it makes zombies.Though some serious losses were suffered (the team captain was made into cube steak), they were able to shut down the main computer. That only unlocked the many doors holding back the zombies. Out of the pan, into the fire.I like zombie movies, so this movie was right up my alley. There's nothing like a horde of mindless, walking dead beings to bring people together. The set and setting of RE was truly superb. Every step of the way was a feeling of a high-tech center that had gone belly up. The detail and attention paid to the set showed that they cared. Well, that and they had the budget to make it all look authentic.The story was cohesive, there weren't any glaring plot holes, there was some good action, and the characters were likeable.

It's well made, with an impressive production design and some moments of effective tension; but it's also very derivative, and the mediocre digital effects may make you nostalgic for the good ol' days of practical gore.

Among the better qualities on display here is the rather impressive bureaucratic stranglehold on display that truly gives this a great feel for what kind of obstacles to overcome. The systems here are quite fun to overcome in the house' security offers a rather intriguing start here that goes along quite nicely with the system underground providing plenty of thrilling times here with the laser grids, control panels, supercomputers and high-tech containment units give this an effective base along the way to string the action off of. Those are quite fun here with this one providing this with its best features from the different encounters here really making for a thrilling time as the first encounter in the storage rooms where not only is the team overrun on all sides but the ineffectual methods to deal with them cause some explosive action with the swarm closing in around them as they fire away fruitlessly before escaping, a fantastic scene of the group escaping into the tunnels swarming with the undead through the sewer with them and leads into the frantic escape through the central station crawling with zombies all around them. This one also goes for some great action featuring the mutants as well with the scenes of the security office with the mutant dogs or a rather impressive brawl with a monstrous licker on-board their transport train so there's some rather nice diversity amongst the action within here. As well as the great-looking gore and zombie make-up here, these issues make this one enjoyable enough to hold off the few problems in here. The biggest issue in this one is the fact that this one makes a rather curious decision to knock off most of the rescue team in the house before getting to the zombies held on the lower levels. While this here does allow the film some gore while off the defenses quite nicely, the fact that these scenes take kills away from the zombies and creatures later on does seem a little unfair to feature here so that there's hardly any time here to survive to get attacked with such a small group of targets left. This really could've been solved easily by either eliminating the number killed off there in the site or have bigger team sent in initially and it solves that easily. As well, there's the fact that it plays a little too loose with the rules of infection by showing several who are turned quickly while others who are bitten repeatedly take forever to turn simply due to storyline needs despite the continuous bites meaning it should've occurred even quicker than it did previously. These, along with some shoddy CGI at times, does hold this one back somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",Resident Evil

32,Wuchakk,"Brilliant, mysterious, intense and creepy sci-fi-horror",8,4 October 2013,"Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was ""Resident Evil""). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot) A biological ""accident"" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive? ***END SPOILER*** POSITIVES: As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.NEGATIVES: Although ""Resident Evil"" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like ""Aliens"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original ""Planet of the Apes"")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.PERSONAL GRADE: A-",Resident Evil

The big monster on the other hand was clearly to see that it all was CGI. But not only that, even for a monster flick it is low on gore and even red stuff. Most of the slaughtering is done off-screen. But it is really the story that makes it watchable after all. A virus is let free in The Hive, an underground laboratory. The computer shut down all entrances to avoid infection. An elite military corpse has to investigate what went wrong and by entering The Hive they come across Alice (Milla Jovovich). She has amnesia and slowly her mind tells her what happened to her and what is happening inside The Hive.Being low on gore and red stuff Ithought it was meant to be PG-13 but knowing Milla we all know she isn't afraid to show her body and that's what she exactly does in Resident Evil. She even goes fully naked and shows it all if you watch closely. It was a nice entry in the genre with the walking dead and the monster but for me nowadays it doesn't really stand up towards the technology. That's weird because older flicks do stand their time. Still, worth watching.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Resident Evil

It begain ok, but the special forces actors where too much.  When one acts too over macho one looks like a wantabe. The million dollar question is if the virius only effects the dead why did the computer kill everyone. I keeped asking myself that question through out the movie!

35,HumanoidOfFlesh,"An enjoyable,but completely unscary zombie romp!",6,29 July 2002,"""Resident Evil"" isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made,but movie of the year?!...come on!I'm sad to have say that this is actually more action flick than horror.As cool as the games are(at least the first two),as mediocre is Anderson's film.Almost no gore at all,pretty bad acting(the characters in the computer game almost seem lively)and no uncanny atmosphere to be found.And,by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of ""Dawn of the Dead"".Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here.There's one reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning.The sequence where several characters are trapped in the bright,shiny corridor with a deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile.The battle between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent.The climax is okay and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel.The film is well-made and looks really nice,but the lack of gore can't be forgiven.However there are better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example ""Zombi 2"",""Burial Ground"",""The Beyond"",Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy,""Flesheater"",""Meat Market"" series etc.The game is also a lot more scarier-if you want a really good,albeit forgotten horror film which is quite similar to the first ""Resident Evil"" game,please check out ""Scarecrows""(1988).",Resident Evil

The girl in the red slip finally was given a man's coat to cover herself up and still she continued to wear this outfit which started to get torn and in threads. Out of the blue, all these so called human beings appear like in the ""Night of the Living Dead"", eating everyone in sight and leaving nothing on the bone. It did not take me very long to become completely disinterested and finished viewing the film with great disappointment. Everyone seemed to run around in circles and there was nothing outstanding about this film from beginning to end. Very cheap made film and that red slip and boots really got to ME !",Resident Evil
37,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""I've been a bad, bad girl""",7,7 September 2007,"Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them. So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies; and the story was excellent.A virus breaks out in a lab called the Hive where everyone is held in captivity and dies. All of a sudden we see a woman passed out in a shower, she has no idea who she is, she meets two other men who have no idea who they are, but they are taken by soldiers who take them underground to the Hive. There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened. The main thing is that they control the Hive, but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead, zombies. The woman, Alice, turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.Resident Evil was an awesome movie to watch and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies. If you loved Mortal Kombat I'm sure you'll love Resident Evil. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab, it was really scary but so awesome to watch. Well, you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice, she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.7/10",Resident Evil

39,KineticSeoul,"Not terrible, however the video games are more entertaining than this movie",7,11 September 2010,"Now this doesn't have almost nothing to do with the video games it tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it's still a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn't a fantastic film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.7/10",Resident Evil
40,cherold,"Finally, a video game adaption done right",7,8 October 2003,"This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.",Resident Evil
41,lost-in-limbo,So it has begun. Press start to begin.,4,28 April 2006,"Located in Racoon City is the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, where in an secret underground compound called the 'The Hive' one of their experiments known as the 'T-Virus' is unknowingly released. So the main computer system ""The Red Queen"" locks everyone in ""The Hive"", which the virus turns every living thing in the facility into fleshing eating zombies. So, a military crack force is sent in to shut down the main computer and pick up any survivors within three hours. One of them they come across is Alice who's suffering amnesia, but she slowly starts to puts the pieces together, while confronting this massive problem.I remember when I was originally going to see this at the cinema, but a friend of mine conned me out of it, in which we saw the sentimentally, wretched war flick ""We Were Soldiers"" instead. Well, I finally got around to seeing it after all of those years and well, meh! Now I just wonder what got me interested in it in the first place. I'm no fanatic of the video game and I have no idea how true it is to the story, but from what I've seen of the game. Anderson was no were near in capturing the dark and creepy atmosphere. Alternatively he brings his loud, rapid and glossy stylistic touches that find its way in most of his other films. I actually don't mind his earlier efforts like; the enjoyable rubbish ""Mortal Kombat"" and the mildly creepy ""Event Horizon"", but this project and even more so ""Alien vs. Predator"" I found mindlessly under whelming and kinda flat. Sure, I'm not expecting a meaningful masterpiece (although some specifics and character development wouldn't hurt), but the entertainment factor is rather botch. Maybe if I saw it when I was initially going to, I might've got more out of it and see it in a different manner. Since obviously its aimed at a certain target audience and to make a profitable franchise. I just found it far from gripping and the involvement was really lacking. That can be contributed to the story (which has decent plot device) that seems to go nowhere and the stock characters are pretty vague with their cheesy one-liners and thin dialogue.Well, since that was the case I was hoping the action, blood splatter and zombie madness would spice up this shindig! I'll admit the film has a couple of striking set-pieces and the pace keeps the film moving, but these aspects lose out to the ""Look at my shinning new toy! I don't know how it works, but it looks great!"" attitude. The film visually looks good. But it just got caught up trying to be too flashy in it's snazzy techno appearance than actually executing some tension, excitement or even some gore. Instead we get cheap jump scares that are plain predictable, lame slow-motion, tame combat and pretty clumsy, looking CGI. You got the usual chaotic editing worked around the slick camera-work that captures the crisp art direction. Surrounding these glossy fixtures is an impulsively, blaring techno mental soundtrack. Style definitely wins out here! The performances were rather vapid, though Milla Jovovich fits the buck in the lead role. She might not have much to do but to kick ass, but she does makes the most out of her undeveloped character. Michelle Rodriguez plays a very lazy stereotype; the tough female soldier who won't take any crap! The characters here actually share a real common interest with those in ""Aliens"", but at least in that movie that had interesting personalities. *Hmm* Now I'm sitting here looking at the DVD cover of ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which has on the front cover ""Bigger, better, action-packed"". Well, hopefully it lives up to that wrap or, maybe it will be equally forgettable.No way is it awful. But simply, it's a weak and very dumb action-video game hybrid that lacks the firepower and is unintentionally laughable when it came to shove.",Resident Evil
42,Robert_duder,Shoot-em-up smash at the movies!!,9,11 April 2002,"Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie. Although the advertisements did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't expect greatness or failure from the movie. Originally when they talked George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some sort of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should. This movie did not come close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it amazing. The action was top notch and the music was pounding and excellent. It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story comes together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied. The characters and actors are excellent and you are definitely left disappointed to see any one of them killed. I would like to have seen more of them survive. Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt heroine who gets some great dialogue. This movie felt like X-Men in the way that it left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning. I thought the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have wished for a better ending. I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many instalments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.",Resident Evil
43,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Almost a Jill Sandwich.,5,26 October 2020,"It's a well-known fact that 'Resident Evil (2002)' has very little resemblance to, well, any of the video-games in the series it is based on. It has a mansion and some familiar monster designs but that's about it. This isn't atmospheric horror, it's schlocky sci-fi. Of course, that alone doesn't make it a bad film. It's the choppy editing, forced early-2000s edginess, poor CGI, bland characters and barely-there plot that does that. There are occasional moments of hammy ridiculousness that come very close to replicating a certain B-movie charm (see Milla Jovovich running up a wall and spin-kicking a zombie dog through a window), but these moments are simply too few and far between. For the most part, the piece is just dull. It also suffers from some major story and character issues; I literally can't think of a reason why the focal military unit actually enter the H.I.V.E. and there's more charisma in a loaf of bread than there is in any of the lead performances. The whole thing is just a mess. It has a few enjoyable moments but, overall, it isn't particularly entertaining. 5/10",Resident Evil
44,dromasca,A Well Made Microsoft - Zombies Film,7,8 September 2002,"I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?). This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all is well linked, there are no major  flaws, and even the quantity of pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie, easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see it.",Resident Evil
45,ThomasDrufke,Throwback Action-Horror,5,19 January 2017,"Video game movies have been awful for decades now. Resident Evil isn't necessarily the exception to that rule, but it's nowhere near as awful as the genre has been.Resident Evil is at its best when it pushes aside the politics of this ""secret military group"" named The Umbrella, and instead is an homage to the original Alien. When the film takes twists and turns that are supposed to surprise you, when in fact, they feel like a weak attempt at shock, it becomes overwhelmingly convoluted. But in the instances that the survivors, led by Alice (Milla Jovovich), are scrambling through rooms doing anything to survive CGI creatures and flesh eating zombies, Resident Evil is pure guilty pleasure.Much like the Underworld franchise, I honestly don't care about any of the supporting characters. Knowing where most zombie flicks go, there's really no use to getting attached to secondary characters when you know their deaths are all but guaranteed. I did, however, find Alice to be compelling, as long as the sequels do more to expand her history and explain how she became an absolute bada**. In fact, one can make the argument that Alice is a more likable character than Selene is in Underworld.As I've said a lot recently, there's nothing wrong with a mindless action adventure if it doesn't take itself too seriously. Resident Evil is actually a pretty serious film, people are dying left and right, and the world is on the brink of an apocalypse. But there's something to be said about a throwback action-horror taking place in one confined space. In this case, it gives the viewer a sense of what a first person shooter game with this story would feel like. I've never played any of the games, but I can certainly see where this story lends itself to the video game medium. Now, is there an excuse for a horrendous looking creature via CGI? Or maybe some truly useless characters with weak (at best) dialogue? No, I can't say there is. But hey, it's a solid cable watch.+Action that doesn't pull punches+Alice is likable-Dated CGI-Inexcusably bad dialogue5.8/10",Resident Evil
46,Cineanalyst,Choppy Recycling,2,25 March 2020,"""Resident Evil,"" an adaptation of a video game, is a bad movie in essentially every regard: hackneyed, simplistic scenario (evil corporation unleashing zombies), adulteration by association of classic literature in Lewis Carroll's Alice books, rudimentary acting, perfunctory dialogue, loud music for the sake of being loud, inept style, generic action scenes. Despite all of that, this may have been a more enjoyable action flick, at least on a so-bad-it's-good or guilty-pleasure level, if not for some atrociously choppy editing. The quick cuts to get around actors being substituted for stunt doubles or to otherwise conceal the fact that they can't physically do what their characters can is worse than usual. Alice's fight with the dogs is one of the worst examples. Moreover, these flimsy constructions being passed off as action scenes are cobbled together with unmotivated, silly slow-motion shots. There are far too many close-ups of Milla Jovovich's consistently blank expression in lieu of actual dramatic tension, too. All of this is reflected in the soundscape, as well, which is a shambles of bombastic score and clanging metal.The choppy editing is all the more conspicuous because the blueprint of the ""Hive"" occupies a significant space in a scene early on, only for the picture to loose all direction once inside the architecture. One moment, Alice is listening to exposition from some guy whose sister she just re-killed, and the next she's back with the group locked in a room surrounded by zombies. Another moment, Michelle Rodriguez's tough chick (yeah, I know, what a stretch for her, right) is diving for a gun underneath another horde of the walking dead; then, cut, and all of a sudden she's escaped with the rest of the remaining gang from the bitters below. Even some of the CGI is overly choppy, especially when we first see the monster recycled from the ""Alien"" series. As with the stunt work, quick cuts are also meant to conceal deficiencies in the visual effects. Play the score and sound effects loud enough and have Jovovich pose in various states of undress often enough, however, and, perhaps, nobody will notice or care, seems to be the logic here. Yet, worst of all are the movie's equivalent of video-game cut-scenes. With two of the main characters experiencing amnesia, the plot takes several breaks from the action to catch up on the backstory--the sort of poorly-directed bits of dullness that a gamer would likely press a button to skip in a video game so as to get back to killing zombies.I knew there was a reason I had avoided this movie for nearly two decades now. I only came to it now for the references to Carroll's Alice books. Unfortunately, like everything else here, these are trite. Besides a protagonist named ""Alice,"" who awakens from a state of unconsciousness, there's the AI's little girl avatar, and the AI itself is called the ""Red Queen,"" although it really should've been named ""HAL 9000,"" for how much it rips off yet another far better film, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). ""Resident Evil"" is rubbish. I think I'll continue to pass on the inexplicably-made sequels.",Resident Evil

I've seen some of the sequels and they're not as good. I'm not familiar with the games, but as far as I know, this was pretty faithful to them. There was, however this one major problem that kept me from liking it. The CGI was simply terrible! I'm sorry, but while the practical effects were fairly nice to look at, a lot of this movie was just plain ugly! Now, I know that it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It does seem a lot like a video game.I appreciate it when people are loyal to the fanbase. The pacing is this film is kind of on and off. It gets a bit too fast into it, but then again, a lot of the film is well put together. I actually do feel for some of these characters even though I'm not familiar with the games. I also like how this does set up a story that is used for more movies, even if they're not that great of a product. It probably helps that I'm into zombies.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Little intrigue, lots of opportunity missed.",6,7 May 2004,"Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.
Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichéd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.",Resident Evil

I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a difference). I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in setting the tone for the rest of the movie.It's really difficult to describe what it was about ""Resident Evil"" that made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies. The touch of humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together. Milla as an actress did a great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and emotions. The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash.

53,paulclaassen,An impressive take on the zombie genre.,7,22 February 2021,"'Resident Evil' is very different to most zombie films out there. The film revolves around a very powerful company, the Umbrella Corporation, which - unbeknownst to most of their employees - also designs and manufactures warfare weapons. The Hive is an impressively designed underground mega structure which houses over 500 scientists. We soon learn the company is being sabotaged, and it is this very sabotage that would ultimately lead to devastating consequences, as we discover in later installments in the franchise. Spence (James Purefoy) is the man responsible for this sabotage.We really don't know much about Alice (Milla Jovovich) during the first half of the movie. This is a very clever and interesting set-up for a character that is to lead six films. Her beauty is utilized by sensual photography and poses - very well integrated in the situations she finds herself in, and most unusual for a film of this genre, yet it works so well. The mystery surrounding her lingers for quite a while. In fact, we keep guessing and speculating almost until the very end.What starts as a rescue operation ends in a fight for survival in an excellent display of fantastic visuals and make-up effects, and lots of action. The film grows more intense as it progresses, and all the more awesome - if you have the stomach for it, that is. It is thrilling from beginning to end, with nail-biting suspense from the opening scene until the closing finale. It is so fast-paced, it hardly allows the viewer time to catch its breath. Be warned, there are highly effective jump scares! I loved this.",Resident Evil

The computer that is at the heart of the heart, at the heart of the hive, is the queen of the hive and she has a problem one day. In a hurrying hasteful and hateful movement, some rather careless if not carefree employee of this hive drops an ampoule that contains a very serious dangerous virus, and what's more without even realizing his mistake.

58,Dr_Coulardeau,You will be safe for ever against fear,7,15 March 2020,"A little longish film that knits together some of the standard recipes for fear, more based on horror, I mean grossing6out horror, than on subtlety and complicated plot.First, you perverts some words, and the ""hive"" becomes the monstrous heart of a totalitarian corporation, the Ombrella Corporation, that owns everything and everyone, especially everyone because humans are easily replaced when they are wasted or destroyed since they reproduce most of the time, as is well-known, faster than rabbits in Australia. The computer that is at the heart of the heart, at the heart of the hive, is the queen of the hive and she has a problem one day. In a hurrying hasteful and hateful movement, some rather careless if not carefree employee of this hive drops an ampoule that contains a very serious dangerous virus, and what's more without even realizing his mistake. That sets the whole hive berserk because the queen considers the hive is under attack, biomedical attack of course, and she closes up everything and more or less exterminate everyone, except that she does not exterminate them really but she causes the virus that was liberated to become active and cause in its turn some mutations among the various beings, dogs and all, trapped in there.Then you have a team of saviors, super-duper technicians, and repairmen, with a few repair ladies that arrive most brutally.

59,johnnyboyz,What a Shame.,5,29 June 2005,"It's disappointing when a successful computer game franchise is brought to the screen in a disappointing fashion and that's exactly what's happened here. When a Resident Evil computer game comes out, it's a bit of an event especially to the die hard fans of the series. I, myself own Resident Evil 2 and have played every single title at some point down the years. This, you would suggest does not classify me as a die hard fan and you're correct but what I am quite a large fan of is survival films such as '28 Days Later', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Dog Soldiers' so watching 'Resident Evil' was pretty compulsory, fan of the games or not.Everything was set up nicely, the situation was clearly established as it must've been tricky to do a first Resident Evil film, especially after several games; 'where do you start?' springs to mind. However, what follows is a case of 'where do we continue from?' The film seemed to get into a gear and just stay there the whole time. I grew tired of the same location over and over and the way all of the characters look the same. There was no real suspense, no real monsters from the games, no real proper weaponry, in fact the whole thing just dug itself in and stuck itself there for two and a bit hours, a real shame as there was some potential what with the games creating such a success. We aren't treated to many of the games characters either and for most of them, I couldn't really care less if they survived, there is even a temptation to hope that they all snuff it anyway.In fact, the ultimate irony is when they actually get up onto the street surface which is where I wanted the film to take place. This would be fine except: it happens right at the very end of the film! A lot of damn good that is! The REAL survival starts just as all the other rubbish ends. I really can't see the point of this film as from what I understand, with the second film street based, this is just a break in for the absolute non-fans of the game who won't mind not seeing the characters and monsters from the game because they won't even have played it! Where as for the fans, no matter how large or how small they are; they're guaranteed to be disappointed.How ironic- aiming a film based on a successful gaming series at people who AREN'T fans of the games.I didn't enjoy this that much, I'm afraid.",Resident Evil
60,Rectangular_businessman,One of the worst video game adaptations .,1,10 January 2007,"I'm writing this review just to comment that I don't agree with all the comments that say that it was one of the best adaptations of a game into a movie . What is more ,I think that I didn't make any justice to the games. First of all ,I liked the games ,but it seems that Paul W.S. Anderson (""Mortañl Kombat "" ) doesn't know very much about the game except that the enemies were zombies . First ,the game have a dark and thrilling atmosphere ,while the movie prefers to replace it with a scenery closer to a sci - fi movie,being noisy and pompous about monsters ,like ""Alien "" with some good effects ,but isn't very thrilling . Second ,it have many irrelevant character that just appear to die one by one ,and that 's nothing original . I guess that the movie gives more importance to the visual aspect ( that doesn't have many similarities with the game ) but in general lines it's a empty and irrelevant movie that have too many elements in common with many other movies . But it isn't a accurate adaptation of the game . the good things : the cast was great . Milla Jovovich is perfect as Alice ,the heroine . The same is for Michelle Rodrìguez ,even when she made a pathetic character that just appear to die . And some effects were good . But that isn't enough to make better this movie .",Resident Evil
61,TheMovieDiorama,"Resident Evil deviates completely from its source material, but does so with confidence.",5,25 February 2018,"No one could've predicted that this was going to be the start of something massive. Regarded by many as the ultimate guilty pleasure series, this first instalment gives us zombies, a badass female protagonist and an utterly convoluted plot. A woman simply known as ""Alice"" wakes up unable to recall her memories. A specialised team take her and infiltrate 'The Hive' which has entered a state of lockdown. Why? Viral breakout obviously. The infamous T-Virus. Fans of Capcom's survival horror games of the same name, will be immensely disappointed. There's no horror, there's limited survival and replicates nothing from the first game. It's simply taken the name and turned into something else. Fortunately, whilst I've played the game and discount myself as a fanboy, I honestly don't mind the lack of replication. Call it a film reinvention as you will. Doesn't stop it from being mediocre though. Paul W.S. Anderson directs what looks like a B-Movie. Cringeworthy dialogue, although with some damn good one liners from the badass Michelle Rodriguez, terrible and dated effects that are incorporated in a plot that finds itself incredibly confused. What seems like a simple infiltration turns out to be a mess fuelled by patchy flashbacks and exposition. Milla Jovovich definitely transforms herself and you can start to see her action stardom manifest. There is an almighty personality switch where her timid and quiet self transforms into the ultimate badass b**** in town. She does not give a flip what you think. She kicks a zombie dog in the face for Christ's sake! I appreciate the usage of props and makeup, but simple aesthetics does not create a good film. Mediocrity at its finest. A sentence I'll be saying consistently in these reviews...",Resident Evil
62,Tweetienator,Maybe the Best One,8,6 June 2020,"A real great pleasure at the time of its first release and besides Resident Evil: Apocalypse my most favorite of the whole franchise. With the last two movies sadly Mr. Anderson got a little confused storywise (or he likes it too much to jump around in circles) but anyway, Milla in her iconic role as our heroin Alice was and still is always worth a watch. The first movie of the series got the best story, a real fine dark ""tone"" and the only thing I would complain about, if I have to, is the fact that I would have used some more gory scenes, like in the first classics of Mr. Romero's work. Verdict: still good and entertaining.",Resident Evil
63,Fella_shibby,High octane zombi flick with an amazing laser defence system scene n ferocious dogs.,9,19 February 2017,"I saw this first in a theatre in 2002. It is a fast-paced, high octane zombie flick filled with brisk action sequences. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - A virus has been released inside a secret underground lab, turning its workers into zombies, a military task force is deployed to take care of the problem. The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesh-eating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene, the zombified dogs, awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters, especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face, Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for action/horror/sci-fi films did a fine job with the direction.",Resident Evil

I don't agree with some users who state that the producer and director was heavily influenced by the game. In my opinion, this movie lacked of the creepiness and eerie atmosphere of the original Resident Evil game. What do I mean? The extremely dangerous, morbid, haunting and macabre atmosphere felt in the mansion in part 1 and in the streets of Racoon City in part 2. The movie deals with a scientific explanation towards the events and most of the action sequences but I feel that it lacked of the creepiness and sadistic nature of the game. Yes I enjoyed the extremely detailed and expensive action sequences but I wanted a more zombie oriented movie.The direction that this movie took should please fans of Sci-Fi and Survival Scientific Horror.",Resident Evil
66,Anonymous_Maxine,"Wow, I wonder what the video game's like.",5,6 February 2004,"So obviously I make no secret of the fact that I've never played the video game on which this movie is based, although I can't say it's that easy to come up with what the objective of a game would be that would inspire a movie like this. Not that I hated the movie or anything, but I think the story here would work better as a game than it does as a movie. First of all, the foundation of the story as a whole is based on a gigantic fallacy, or a series of gigantic fallacies. Specifically, the poisonous gas in the movie that basically reanimates dead people, turning them into flesh-eating zombies, supposedly works because, as it's explained in the movie, the body is still active even after death (`for months,' one character explains).
The problem here is that, while it's true that it is a widely accepted myth that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death (also mentioned in the movie), it is not true at all that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death, it just doesn't happen. There is, in fact, a recognized postmortem lengthening of hair and fingernails, but it's not because they're growing, it's because the dead skin is receding, revealing the hair and fingernail material that was previously underneath the skin. So in a sense, hair and fingernails do, in fact, grow after death, but it is a result of the decay of the body, not in any way a product of still-functioning hair follicles and whatever the glands are that produce fingernails. Another reason that the movie gives for the ability of the gas to bring dead people back to life is that cells continue to reproduce after death. This may be true, but it would certainly never happen at the level required for a cadaver to be operational enough to be a zombie. Cells that have no incoming source of oxygen have a remarkably short shelf-life.So now that I've unnecessarily pointed out that logic has no place in this movie, I might as well point out that, for a horror film, the chronology of the plot is remarkably well thought out. I like that it starts with a couple elite agents who have lost their memories of what they have been doing and why they find themselves at the places where they wake up. Milla Jovovich plays one of these officers, and the other is supposedly her tactical boyfriend/husband is a life that she can't remember. As the film goes on and the cast find themselves deeper and deeper within this underground lab called The hive (and more and more surrounded by the living dead), their memories gradually come back and they realize their old jobs, motives, etc.
As far as plot, that is very original for a horror film, especially one involving zombies. You think of a movie that is centered around a gas that turns dead people into cannibalistic zombies and you immediately pretty much know how the whole movie is going to go. In Resident Evil, however, the majority of the tension comes not necessarily from the walking dead that are trying to eat the cast, but ultimately more from the awakening memories of certain characters who find themselves to be enemies, turning guns on each other even while the dead pound on the doors trying to sink their teeth into their flesh.Oh, by the way, that's another thing. Not only does this gas reanimate the dead by utilizing the fictional continuation of bodily function after death, but once turned into zombies, they have the ability to turn others into zombies with the slightest scratch or bite. So not only does this gas turn dead people into cannibal zombies, but cannibal VAMPIRE zombies. If they bite you you turn into one of them. No wonder they came up with the idea of internal strife as a way to create more tension, because the original premise of the effects of this gas are pretty ridiculous. It was created for military use, although I can't imagine a military use for a gas that, when used, would turn entire populations into walking dead, turning entire cities into the disaster that we see in the final shot of the film. Entire continents and, ultimately, the human race would be wiped out with a single use of such a weapon.Michelle Rodriguez takes on exactly the same role that she played in the ridiculous movie The Fast and the Furious as well as the somewhat less ridiculous S.W.A.T. She always plays a very impressive, very tough role, but her half-lidded tough-girl routine gets real old real quick. Milla Jovovich is just as staggeringly beautiful as ever, yet taking on another role that is fathoms below her ability, and really the rest of the cast kind of blends together, with no one standing out as important or with much of an impressive performance.Getting back to the story, like I said above, it's actually pretty impressive conceptually, but then again you have to overlook such forehead-slappers as the machine coming to life (embodied, for some reason, in the voice of a little British girl), becoming self-aware, and trying to terminate the people there to shut her down. She apparently has managed to create a gigantic monster out of some sort of organic material the source of which escaped me, as well as whole herds of dogs that seem to have no skin and no other purpose for existing than to attack anything that moves. Cleverly animated, but certainly one of the things that raised a few eyebrows as to where they came from or what was the point.
Recently I've been seeing previews at the movies for a Resident Evil 2, which is most of the reason that I went back and watched this one. Based on the fact that this movie ends with a shot that is also seen in the trailer for part 2, the shot with Alice (Jovovich) emerging from a manhole to find the entire city in a state of complete destruction, the gas having infected the population above ground, I assume that part 2 takes place in an above-ground setting. I also like that the preview starts off looking like an advertisement for some sort of beauty product, which leads me to believe that maybe that will be something that the dead use to cover up their deformities and the fact that they are dead, thus allowing them to sneak up on the living. Although if that happens, it would refute the claim made in this movie that they have no cognitive function other than the primal instinct to feed.At any rate, a fresh new setting, above-ground, would provide a whole array of new possibilities for a sequel to this movie. In fact, in order to save money, sort of kill two birds with one stone, they might even be able to double their profits by calling the next movie something like `Resident Evil: 28 Days Later.'",Resident Evil
67,Vartiainen,One of the cornerstones of horror genre,6,16 June 2014,"Resident Evil franchise has quite frankly gotten out of hand. At the moment there are five movies made and a sixth in the making. Not all of them are that good, but most of them wouldn't exist if not for this film's good qualities and success.Resident Evil benefits from an interesting setting, full of creeping zombies and other monstrosities, as well as from some really nice actors doing their best to breath life into this video game adaptation. Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect fit for their respective roles and really nail the tough action woman ideal. And yes, none of the characters in this film are all that deep or have good lines of dialogue, but such a flaw can be forgiven if the horror works well. And it does. The zombies are suitably scary, The Red Queen is unbelievably unnerving, the rest of the monsters, both supernatural and human, are a genuine threat and as a whole the film has a good claustrophobic feel to it. Would it have been better with more rounded characters and better dialogues? Of course, but it's not bad as it is.Aside from the characters, the film's biggest weakness, to me at least, is the fact that sometimes the video game shines through a bit too much. They make a commendable effort to make the film its own creation, but there are certain scenes, which just scream ""a boss fight"" or ""a platforming section"". Minor things really, but they do take away from the experience.As a whole Resident Evil is a lot of fun. It's actually scary because of its excellent premise and setting, because of its atmosphere and because it doesn't rely solely on jump scares. Definitely worth checking out for any fan of zombies and/or horror in general.",Resident Evil
68,FiendishDramaturgy,Resident Evil: A Project in Terror.,8,13 January 2005,"To be honest, the first time I saw this, I didn't care for it. It did not follow the story line of the game, and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor.Upon realization that a video game is ""dumbed down"" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed. I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way, they made little notice of records and files lying about, no matter how relevant they were or were not, and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game. I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active. Considering this is first and foremost, an action movie (with horror elements), that would not be considered a good thing.The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work. Her supporting cast (every one) gave nothing but the best they had. The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed. There is nothing wrong with this attempt. It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations. Unfortunately, that was their major principal audience; game fans, and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt. The fanboys were disappointed; the casual fans casually attended this event; and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal, either way and so did not participate to a profitable level.With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it. We took it and, in retrospect, embraced the first attempt, as well.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Resident Evil
69,jtindahouse,The zombies let it down,6,6 January 2017,"I was never really into video games growing up, and I'm still not today. So a series like 'Resident Evil' just completely passed over my radar. With the 'Final Chapter' coming out shortly though I decided to go back and review the series to see what I think of it. Going back 14 years when it comes to a CGI heavy film can be a dodgy thing to do. Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference compared to the quality being produced today, but it's certainly not distractingly bad. I quite like films that are set in a confined space with the characters having to either work their way to the centre, or find a way out. This is one of those films and most aspects of it are done fairly well. The one element (that happened to be probably the biggest of them all sadly) that didn't work was the zombies. Zombies are simply not scary, not visually impressive and not entertaining. They're still better than vampires, but they are not a strong thing to have as a heavy component of your film. Having never played the game I can't confirm how close this is in terms of being true to it. I suspect though that it's pretty close. A lot of scenes feel like they're straight from a game and you can even imagine yourself having to pass the level that the characters are currently on. Milla Jovovich plays the lead role well, but I hope in the sequels she evolves a lot. At times in this one she felt like just another member of the squad, and certainly not the main character. People to this day say are still waiting for a great video game adaption to come out. 'Resident Evil' is a solid film, but it's certainly far from being great.",Resident Evil
70,Captain_Couth,"Disappointed, highly disappointed.",4,22 April 2004,"Resident Evil (2002) is a movie that's loosely based on the zombie killing video game series. If you're going to make a movie based upon a video game at least play it before you decide to write and direct a movie based on it. I've seen several Japanese zombie flicks that are not based on the game that are more truer to the original source than this movie. Leave it up to Paul W. Anderson to take a brilliant concept and ruin it by making a movie that is so unlike the game. By itself it's a decent movie. You can take Resident Evil out of the title and it wouldn't make a difference. This movie wasn't that very good to be labeled Resident Evil. The brain dead suits at Capcom made a huge mistake when they let George A. Romero go and hired someone who's never made a zombie flick. Oh well, that's their problem.Back to the movie. How can you make a zombie movie with sparse views of head shots? I don't know but the makers of this movie manage to. The only thing worth while about this film are the first appearance of the zombies, the music and Milla Jovovich. Other than that it's a complete waste of time.

72,dee.reid,Well done horror film,10,2 August 2002,"""Resident Evil"" which is the highly anticipated big screen adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is a very well done horror film. The story surrounds a rescue team that is sent to a large underground facility to find out the cause of a mysterious accident that occurred there. When they first arrive, they discover three survivors: a young woman (Milla Jovovich) who is suffering from amnesia and whose name I don't think is ever mentioned, a guy named Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be a cop, and another guy named Spence (James Purefoy).  When they finally get into the Hive, which is the name of the large underground facility, they discover that no one is there, or so it seems.  Soon the team members begin getting picked off one at a time by bloodthirsty zombies, mutated dogs, and a hideous monstrosity that has an incredibly long tongue. 
I must say that this film is above all things, very entertaining.  I've never played the video games the film was based on, so I really can't be sure how accurate the movie is.  The acting is all right, but it isn't good nor is it bad.  The movie does maintain a constant level of creepiness, which is good.  I must say that ""Resident Evil"" does keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  NOTE: One thing I do want to point out to gore fans is that this movie is no where near as gory as you may think it is.  I was pretty disappointed by that.  I mean a zombie movie, especially one like ""Resident Evil"" should be dripping with bloody violence and gore, but it isn't.    I really like the fact that Paul Anderson (who directed another movie adaptation of a popular video game, ""Mortal Kombat"", as well as a previous horror film ""Event Horizon"") directed this film.  I love both of those movies.  I really don't see why so many people hated ""Mortal Kombat"".  That is probably the only movie adaptation of a video game that up until this film, is really worth watching.  ""Event Horizon"" while it wasn't a perfect horror film, should have almost certainly pleased any sci-fi fan.  That was a creepy movie right there, despite its flaws.  However, where ""Event Horizon"" failed as a horror movie, Paul Anderson makes up for it here in ""Resident Evil"". A lot people claim that Milla Jovovich is hot (seeing that she reveals almost everything in this movie is worth the $20 for the DVD), but I don't really think she's that hot.

75,lukem-52760,ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE FILMS EVER MADE & ONE OF MY BEST FILMS!!!,9,3 August 2018,"This first film in the Resident Evil franchise came out in 2002 & i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema & i did & it was EXCELLENT!!! i loved this John Carpenter inspired survival Horror, infact if John Carpenter made a zombie film this would be it & that's a huge compliment.I saw this at the cinema & it was a fun time watching this survival Horror film & probably the most fun I've had watching a film at the cinema!!!
It felt like this movie was made for me as at the time i was obsessed with Zombie films & i couldn't wait to see this & it didn't disappoint at all, infact it was even more enjoyable & entertaining & exciting that i could've imagined!!!
Every time i revisit this film I'm reminded just how damn good it REALLY is & if I'm the only one who likes it this much i don't care as it's definitely a personal favourite of mine & one of my all time favourite films.
I have big love & big Nostalgia for this Action zombie film as it was the first ever ""Zombie"" film i saw at the cinema & that's a big deal to me as i grew up obsessed with Zombie films such as George Romero's Dead Trilogy & the Evil Dead Trilogy, i honestly loved ""Resident Evil"" it's a nice budget take on those old school zombie films with a nice dose of ""John Carpenter"" mixed in so how could i not love this?
The production design is excellent within the Hive & the first zombie encounter is done so well with suspense,Horror & action as we have our mixed group of Commandos & survivors having to work together to get out alive, i love that ensemble lgroup dynamic of different characters teamed up, great fun.
A couple of good standout characters other than the main stars, were British actor Colin Salmon who plays the leader of the group of Commandos & his big tall frame & deep commanding voice adds alot to the very creepy beginning scenes, his character is not around long but he makes such an intense presence on screen that i would've loved him to have been a main lead!!! Also the computer expert/soldier ""Kaplan"" is good played by another British actor Martin Crewes, a good solid cast with everyone involved actually.
Some of the imagery is the best I've ever seen in a zombie film & the design & look is incredible like the underground Access tunnels scene with the dripping water & grimy walls & old pipes that are heroes have to crawl accross that's an incredibly exciting & intense sequence as is the iconic laser hallway scene & the test subjects tanks scene when we first meet a zombie & the atmosphere is so raw & full of dread with it's dark smoky look & then hearing a metal being dragged accross the floor noise it's a zombie dragging an axe, just some of the greatest suspenseful moments in a zombie film I've ever seen, this movie doesn't get the recognition it so deserves & yes the other films in the franchise are not very good & don't come no where near the level of brilliance & quality here so this one 2002 movie that started it all should be considered a ""Cult Classic"" & it's definitely the best movie made by Paul Anderson.
""RESIDENT EVIL"" is ridiculously underrated & yet it's more exciting than most huge budget films at the cinema now!!! To me it's a zombie masterpiece that could easily fit into the universe of the legendary ""John Carpenter"" it's got a primal raw survival tone & cold high-tech & artificial intelligence feel to it when our team enter the scary ""Hive"" underground lab base, i feel that contract of old & new here like i did with ""Escape from New York"" & the violent bloody rawness of old school zombie flicks like ""Dawn of the Dead"" for example, there's alot of quality in this film to ignore & i love it.The music score at the beginning sets the tone, it's a creepy digital score that sounds like a ""Carpenter"" inspired 80s synth score, it's really well done & one of my favourite music scores ever as it's so creepy.
The cast was great especially Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriquez both are great actors & are both fantastic tough ladies of Action in this film, obviously ""Alice"" (Jovovich) is the heart of the movie & is on a mission to uncover the truth about herself & what's happening & ""Rain"" (Rodriguez) is a no nonsense tough as hell soldier & she will stop at nothing to get her job done. Great performances.
the rest of the team are all good in their roles basically Marine types & the zombies look great with excellent FX especially the big Licker monster!!!
The underground lab where the zombie outbreak starts is a really creepy setting for a zombie movie & the whole idea of a group of marines having to sneak in & shut it down is very exciting with a great sense of dread atmosphere, one of the best scenes in the movie is the terrifying laser corridor sequence, it's a scary scene & we lose most of the soldiers in that Corridor before we even get to the zombies!!!
Resident Evil is definitely one of my personal favourite Zombie films of all time, i put this in my top 5 along with ""Dawn of the Dead 1978"" ""Day of the Dead 1985"" ""28 Days Later"" & ""Night of the Living Dead 1990"" all Excellent Zombie films!!!
There's a great mix of cold Technical cybernetic futuristic surroundings, with the underground Hive base, & old fashioned bloody flesh-Eating zombie carnage, it's this mix of Sci-fi & Horror that makes Resident Evil very exciting,edgy & Awesome.
There's an icey-cold scary atmosphere within ""The Hive"" as the corridors are empty & silent & at any moment our survivors could turn a corner into wondering zombies, it's enclosed & claustrophobic trapped setting reminded me definitely of the legendary ""Carpenter"" in it's look,mood & style.
I love this movie & it's mix of exciting action scenes & moody creepy Horror & dark futuristic sci-fi setting, a stunning mix done perfectly.a BRILLIANT & scary ending but it's a shame the sequel is Terrible to follow on from this great ending!!!
A great sci-fi action Horror Thriller & EASILY the best of the whole franchise & really the only great movie of the LOT!!!
Yeah good suspense & very exciting Action make RESIDENT EVIL a great film & one of the best Zombie flicks out there!!! Definitely an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion & one hell of a fun ride & a great popcorn flick too!!!
The most fun zombie flick ever.",Resident Evil
76,kluseba,Science-fiction horror classic of the early years of the new millennium that has aged surprisingly well,9,12 June 2020,"Resident Evil is the first of six live action movies based upon the Japanese Biohazard video game franchise. The movie tells the story of a mysterious attack on an underground research facility known as The Hive that is owned by Umbrella Corporation. A specialized commando attempts to enter the vast complex and find out what has happened. Three amnesiacs who are found near the facility are captured by the the commando. The group soon realizes that the scientists have been murdered and that the research facility hides abominable secrets that put their lives in danger.This movie has aged surprisingly well. The special effects look barely dated and convince with a gripping dystopian atmosphere. The locations are particularly intriguing as the entire movie takes place in a dark underground research facility and its immediate surroundings. The soundtrack underlines the film's atmosphere and comes around with sinister, liberating and gripping nu metal and alternative rock music. The story comes around with a few twists and turns. The characters are quite intriguing, especially enigmatic lead character Alice played by an excellent Milla Jovovich, tough police officer Rain Ocampo played by Michelle Rodriguez and the holograph played by Michaela Dicker who represents the facility's artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen. Resident Evil offers a balanced mixture of atmospheric and tense sequences and brutal and dynamic scenes. The combination of action, horror, mystery and science-fiction elements is also quite balanced.In the end, Resident Evil is certainly one of the very best live action movies based upon a video game franchise. I initially watched this film as a teenager and liked it but I have recently been watching it again as an adult and have come to the conclusion that I like it even better today than I did back in the days. The movie is in the spirit of numerous horror and science-fiction movies of the late nineties and early years of the millennium such as Cube, Equilibirum and My Little Eye. If you like these films, you are going to adore Resident Evil. Make sure to check out the video games as well if you haven't done so already.",Resident Evil
77,hu675,Entertaining action/horror/thriller is certainly well made.,8,6 June 2008,"An attractive woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) woke up from the running shower, after being mysterious knocked-out by it. At first, she doesn't seem to remember anything and including her name. Then a group of professional trained commandos (Lead by Colin Solmon) breaks from the large mansion, she lives in. Including an mysterious cop (Eric Mabuis) is forced to go Alice and the soldiers break in an mysterious underground laboratory called The Hive by the Umbrella Coporation from the mansion. Which the corporation are involved with medical supply, computer technology and others but they are also involved with illegal experimentation. Which the team has also find another man (James Purefoy), who also lost his memory. Earlier on that day, an mysterious virus is been unleashed by killing many innocent people and it sealed the working area by an high-tech intelligence computer called The Red Queen (Voiced by Micheala Dicker). Once the team has turned off The Red Queen, the room were sealed turned open... and the dead has died from the virus returned to live by attack the group for warm human flesh. The illegal experiment from Umbrella turned loose as well. But Alice and the others has to escape before the underground laboratory closed itself and becomes trapped underground.Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AVP Alien Vs Predator, Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) made an enjoyable horror film that mixes science-fiction and action quite well. Anderson gets an decent cast here, some of the performances from the actors are good. Although Anderson's writing script is quiet heavy at times and it doesn't always work (Especially the monster ""Licker"" could have used more work in the CGI department) but Anderson knows how to set up action sequences and moments of visual style are always been his best at film-making. This survival horror flick is based on a hugely popular game from Capcom and ""Resident Evil"" is one the best video game adaptations so far.In the Resurrected Edition on the DVD, ""Resident Evil"" is placed double feature with the sequel ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" on a two disc set. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. It has bonus features on the second disc but it's mostly on the sequel than the first feature. If you loved this film, you could find 2002 Special Edition DVD or the Deluxe Edition from 2004 with additional special features. ""Resident Evil"" wasn't an huge success at the box office but it did well in Overseas and especially with DVD Sales was enough to produced the sequels ""Apocalyspe"" and ""Extinction"". Die Hard fans of the video game and especially those who loved Zombie movies will get an kick out of this movie. Don't miss it. Good music score by Marco Beltrami (Scream Trilogy, Hellboy, 3:10 to Yuma ""2007"") and heavy metal rock singer:Marilyn Manson. (****/*****).",Resident Evil
78,RavenGlamDVDCollector,Resident Evil,7,15 August 2016,"Okay, I do not play video games, being RavenGlamDVDCollector takes up too much time to fool around with other stuff as well, and my interests are 100% glamour-driven. Also, I originally, way back in 2007, had a multitude of choice, and decided to give RESIDENT EVIL and ULTRAVIOLET and BLOODRAYNE a miss, they'd be blood and gore fests, judging by the posters in the video store. Recently, I obtained UNDERWORLD's first three, and then there was the trailer of ULTRAVIOLET, which surprised me, I was hooked, that I had to see. Okay, I have since learned that people do not go for ULTRAVIOLET, that it is a rip-off, and, yeah, as good as that trailer is, it also became immediately clear to me that there is a lot of fakery, a lot of cartoonish stuff, I mean, look at the trailer, it's great, but cannot hide that there might be problems...... Tp cut a long story a bit shorter, I could only obtain ULTRAVIOLET as part of a two-disc deal, the other movie being RESIDENT EVIL, so, a couple of days ago, I watched the big gore fest. Ooh boy, it was only the week before that I saw THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE with those mandrill creatures attacking, and this week it was mutated Dobermanns on the rampage.I've been a fan of Milla Jovovich ever since she was a child star in TWO MOON JUNCTION way back in the previous century, yes, I am that old! Then, a few years later, she was in RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, and that one sure had its moments. Time has treated her well, I see, quite a few years later, she is still this stunning long- legged beauty with this amazingly aquiline face. She is ultra-feminine, prime quality Ukranian export. The movie itself has a cumbersome slow start, but eventually the action is astounding, the producers had gone all out to provide the creepiest ugliness you can hope to find on film. It's just, I wouldn't really call it scary, it's not really suspenseful, it happens too blatantly in the open, it doesn't come unexpectedly, that's what I mean. But the mutated dog scene, that is something, when you hear that dog coming on, tip, tip, tip, claws on steel, and the first sight... hoo, horrible.I'd give them an A for effort, but I have to point out that the movie takes a very long time to establish itself. Once it gets going, it lifts off, but you can't shake the feeling that it could have been done a whole lot better. Certainly Milla Jovovich (hey, and the commentary finally taught me how to pronounce her name!) is the ideal choice. Really, that is the only thing I am sure about re this movie. Some of the male leads are kinda blah! but I'm not going into that right now. And Michelle Rodriguez is one tough ol' bird, hey?A weak point of this very violent movie is the unrealistic portrayal of dismemberment. A pinprick causes blood, people, you know that. So what does it mean when on-screen HUMAN characters, not undead characters, get chopped up, but not a drop of blood? Well, d-uh, it means the producers we're trying to appease the American Motion Picture Association by cutting down on what would have earned them a more stringent rating. But if a character doesn't bleed, it was undead too... Something everybody forgot. Major goof.In closing, this Milla Jovovich fan is quite satisfied. She's great, movie is not too bad, not as good as she is, though.Grrr-aarghhh!",Resident Evil
79,jfgibson73,Forgettable,3,15 August 2021,"I've never played the game, but I was interested, so I watched this to see what it's about. It wasn't very memorable. Hopefully the game is better. It has sequences of soldiers maneuvering through some kind of futuristic base fighting monsters. I can't think of a single scene that was worth rewatching. Very skippable.",Resident Evil
80,drystyx,Takes the fun out of movie watching,1,31 October 2008,"This is a throwback to the movies of the late sixties and seventies, which were meant to take the fun out of movie watching. It reverts to the old Nazi standard of Hollywood in which any woman with dark hair and any man with fair hair must die, and the Nazi ideal of the blonde woman and brunette male live. The movie bends over backwards in its Nazi idealism, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so trite and predictable. We get this 99 time out of a hundred, and it is dull, and it just isn't fun for anyone who isn't a Nazi. Can't say much about the plot. There is none. Can't say much about the acting. There is none. Can't say much about the characters. They are one dimensional cardboard stereotypes. Can't say anything good about the writing or directing. Total bomb. And depressing, too.",Resident Evil
81,Agent10,I actually liked this film,7,20 May 2002,"While never having played the games, the movie was rather interesting. Granted, the acting wasn't exactly something to write home about, the music, cinematography and the lighting proved to give this film a boost. The production value was also exceptional, allowing the effects to be legitimate as opposed to being some hokie paint on CGI. I've also wondered, Why does Milla Jovovich show her breasts in every movie and photo shoot she is in? Gets kind of dull after a while. Anyway, I will state this, the ending proved to be one of the finest constructed moments in sci-fi history.",Resident Evil
82,ShootingShark,Stylish But Derivative Zombie Flick Based On Computer Game Series,5,14 August 2005,"A woman suffering from amnesia is taken into a secret underground complex where a sinister corporation has been carrying out biological weapons research. Unfortunately, a virus has been released, causing the staff to turn into zombies and the super-computer in charge to use all of its defence systems to contain the outbreak. Our heroine must escape whilst trying to piece together who she is and why she is there.Based on the popular series of zombie shoot-'em-up videogames by Capcom, this is a good-looking but ultimately hollow horror movie. It does a good job of creating the settings and atmosphere of the games, but it all too often wanders into noisy MTV-style visuals which dissipate the tension and make the zombie attack sequences confusing rather than scary and suspenseful. Worst of all, the script and the performances are lacklustre - by the time we find out who these people are we don't really care much about them. There are some good points though - nice visual effects by Richard Yuricich, great production design by Richard Bridgland, and having a little girl voice the Red Queen super-computer is an excellent touch. This film has an odd resemblance to John Carpenter's superior Ghosts Of Mars - zombies, amnesia, an airborne virus, thrash metal music and a finale set on a train - but unlike that movie it doesn't give its characters enough time to develop, and it borrows far too much from better pictures, particularly Aliens and Dawn Of The Dead. An interesting but unsatisfying film.",Resident Evil
83,ctomvelu1,Watch that laser!,7,27 October 2009,"Who knew Paul Anderson had it in him? Well, the fact is, while by no means a great director, he can certainly create mood and atmosphere, as witness EVENT HORIZON. This adaptation of a popular video game has mood and atmosphere to spare, as a top-secret lab experiment goes haywire and soldiers are sent in to deal with the aftermath. Everybody's favorite Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich, is the heroine of the piece, and is surrounded by a cast of mostly unknown actors evidently from many different countries based on their potpourri of accents (the film was shot overseas). Probably the best video game-derived movie to date, as befits one the best video games ever made.",Resident Evil
84,nycritic,This is Sci-Fi For the Cinematically Impaired.,5,17 December 2005,"We have to thank the MTV and video game culture for bringing us the rapid-fire montage of seemingly unrelated images and cartoon-like sequences that came out of the AEON FLUX canon. We also have to give George A. Romero another handshake -- because of him the story of people turned into mindless, shuffling zombies whose sole intention it is to rip other people apart (and of course, always the lingering question: why not themselves and the healthy humans prevails, always without an answer) has become something of a mainstay even for more serious features (28 DAYS LATER...).So here we are in RESIDENT EVIL. Much like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the aforementioned 28 DAYS LATER..., and a not-too-subtle nod to ALIENS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, there is a viral plague released in the confines of an organization called The Hive which turns its corporate employees into (you guessed it) hollowed-up corporate employees. So predictable! Except there's a super-employee, call it the monster in the closet that every company of the likes of Enron has, and it's out for (you guessed it again) blood and guts. Which made me ponder, ""Don't they feed this thing?"" Of course not: being the product of greed, it always wants more, and Michael Douglas did say once upon a time in a much better movie, ""Greed is good."" Oh well, telling you more about this story is frankly, fruitless. Been there, done that, not particularly shocked when the shocks arrive. Now, into some interesting aspects. Being a product birthed from a video game, the appearance of a killer laser that operates (surprise) like it would in a video game, even changing into a grid. Why is it included? Oh... let me see... Oh, I can't think straight right now. But there's something else. The never-named Alice (Milla Jovovich, proving that acting is beyond her but looking smashing) and Matt (Eric Mabius) learn that there is a conspiracy. Cut to a nifty computer image as-seen from the outside of The Hive, then to them going back to where their friends are, being pursued by the zombified corporates. Where's the transition? Some neat touches, though. The use of what could be the ugliest soundtrack in movie history provides a boost to erstwhile predictable moments of terror. Some composition shots, such as the transition between the prologue to the Mansion where Milla emerges or when Milla, walking down a murderous hallway (the one with the laser with a mind of its own), is interposed with the image of scientists performing unnatural acts, bringing back ""important details."" The revelation of what we missed in the prologue emerging later on when one character's true motives are exposed.However, there is the saying that any film can be elevated into the levels of an instant classic with a good director with a strong hand. True. But again, this is a movie version of a video game and I'd like to know if there ever has been a (movie version of a video game) that has ever been more than vaguely adequate with a good dose of shrill.",Resident Evil
85,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A slightly above average horror action thriller based on a video game,6,23 January 2021,"Video game movies have been around since the video game industry boomed after its initial crash. Considered to be a guilty pleasure and one of the more accurate adaptations was the original Mortal Kombat (1995). Yes, it was cheesy and it didn't gain high reviews, but people still enjoy it today. Since then video game movie adaptations have been a thing for the last couple decades and probably will continue onward. The level of interest movie studios has had though seemed to have gone in waves. By the end of the 1990s it wasn't as profitable until this movie came out. The weird thing is how it started. Reason for this is that this movie was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson...the same director of Mortal Kombat (1995). What are the odds he reinvigorates a genre once every decade or so?The plot of the film is that sometime in the future, a national conglomerate company called The Umbrella Corporation is the sole provider for all consumers of basic needs. However, behind the scenes they also produce high weapons grade items and bio-hazards. When a deadly mutagen is released inside the company's facility and goes into lockdown, a taskforce is sent in to fix the issue. Tagging along with them are what seem to be three ordinary civilians. Two of which, Spence (James Purefoy) and Alice (Milla Jovovich) have a case of memory loss and don't recall how they were involved to begin with. The premise is the most intriguing part of the movie, story wise. As for the rest, there's not a whole lot to get behind.There are plot holes that turn up later on that don't make sense when looking at the full story. Employees of the umbrella corporation work in a facility underground and are not allowed to be above ground. Yet, the initiation of this whole plot happens above ground involving employees of said company. That's not to say Paul W. S. Anderson did not do his research on the brand though. To be able to write and direct this feature, he made sure to dive deep into the games. With that said, there are several references throughout the movie to the video game itself. To that, fans of the video game series must have been marginally happy with those nods of nostalgia. Despite those clever callbacks, charming characters are hard to find among all that's on screen.Coming out on top of the cast as not only the lead actor, not only as an action star but also meeting her future husband (the director); Milla Jovovich plays the only character a viewer might root for. The other cast members like Colin Salmon, James Purefoy, Eric Mabius, Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes act their way through the movie just fine, but their characters just aren't written with anything special. The same could be said for the special effects, more specifically the CGI. Being that CGI had been shown to blend fairly well with physical backgrounds by this point, it makes no sense why some of the visuals look like they were still from the era of Mortal Kombat (1995). Maybe these aspects were also homage to the original Resident Evil video game since the visuals and characters weren't Oscar material either.The gore on the other hand is pretty good looking as well as the practical effects. Credit to cinematographer David Johnson for helping with getting good looking shots. The set design also helps in the look of the film. Lastly for music, the score was composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. While there has been no clear official release of the score itself, the music to the film is a mix of electronic pulses and brooding synthesizers. The idea was to have edgy music and while it feels that way in some places, other times it matches the more tactical depiction used by the military unit. It's worth a listen if possible because it is not the classic sounding orchestral score one would expect.Director Paul W. S. Anderson seems to have had a knack for jump starting video game movie trends early on in his career by doing the same thing twice. While it's not by any means high end in performances, this video game movie is fairly faithful to its source material even if the special effect qualities are subpar in certain places even for 2002. Music also provides an interesting listen.",Resident Evil
86,Kamurai25,"""Down the Rabbit Hole""",8,1 July 2021,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.I understand that zombies have been done to death by the time I wrote this, but I've always enjoyed them, and I understand that, as a movie franchise, ""Resident Evil"" is fairly laughed at, but the first movie was somewhat promising, even if it didn't REALLY have anything to do with the video game.If nothing else, Milla Jojovich and Michelle Rodriguez are quality actors and carry the movie very well, though I honestly think the cast does well.I'm all for unique movies, and, at the time, this felt like one. It is well remembered for a particular death scene.If you like zombies, then you should like this one. It just has this evil corporation trope looming in the background.It does a great job of slowly escalating the situation, if in a slightly absurd way.",Resident Evil
87,PredragReviews,"""Yeah, you like how I taste, don't you?""",8,22 May 2016,"""Resident Evil"" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of employees; at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandos. Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the ""Resident Evil"" series of video games.The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James ""One"" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the disgusting ""Licker"". A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completest, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Resident Evil
88,lewiskendell,"Just because the zombies are slow, doesn't mean the movie should be.",5,17 March 2010,"I'll admit that I'm a closet fan of the series, but the first installment doesn't do as much for me as the later movies. My main complaint is that the best part of the franchise, Milla Jovovich (Alice), doesn't get going until the last quarter of the movie. Until then, we're subjected to boring build-up and the lamest, slowest zombies since the first Resident Evil game. When Alice finally starts doing her thing, the action picks up, but that doesn't fully wash away the boredom of watching the generic other characters being killed far too slowly. There isn't much cross-over between the movie and the game, besides a few of the locations and the zombies. I don't mind that so much, but I wish Anderson would have added a few more cool moments and set-pieces to Resident Evil, to balance out the boredom. He clearly didn't aim to make the movie scary, so it really needed to be action-packed, to keep the viewer's interest.",Resident Evil
89,screenman,Pot-Pourri Horror.,6,21 June 2008,"This movie tries to be a lot more clever than it is. The dream-like opening sequences are intended to endue it with a gravitas that is simply never realised. Likewise, the rather art-house flashback sequences in glorious black and white with a graveyard setting, all merely create confusion because their accomplishment is clumsy rather than deft. It would have been far simpler, better, and less confusing to have taken the straightforward approach with a solid, logical 'rescue' movie like 'Aliens' - which it very much resembles - and sort out the conspiracy later.Once we finally know what is going on, the story gets into its stride. Set pieces are excellent and the pacing and revelations likewise. There are lots of strange-sinister environments - again, like alien/aliens - that leave you guessing what might turn up.What actually turns up is every cliché known to horror movies. There are - Zombies! And they're - flesh-eaters! It has never been explained ever, since the 'Living Dead' franchise why zombies are so picky. They won't so much as nibble each other, but give them a living human and they fall upon it like wolves. Why? protein is protein, after all.There's also a chamber of horrors into which most of the commando team blunder only to get wiped-out - once again, like 'Aliens'. But there's also a hint of 'Cube' about it, because this really is a booby-trap, and people get diced in much the same way.There's a malevolent computer like Hal of '2001', which needs to be shut down before it kills everybody. There's a deadly virus (where would we be without a deadly virus?) that also turns people into zombie flesh-eaters. There's even a pack of zombie dogs, that appear to have lost all of their hair for some unexplained reason. It makes them look more ghastly - and that's probably the reason.On top of all this, there's a really shocking beastie with big claws and a very long tongue - 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1957) - popping-up there, by the looks of it. And there's a riotous train ride with the villain on board, not so far removed from 'The Wrong Trousers'.And, last but not least; the mission is time-sensitive. So we all know the clock is ticking...If they don't get their arses into gear, they suffer a permanent lock-in - rather like 'The Crystal Maze'.The cast are about as unmemorable a bunch of players as ever graced a B-movie. Apart from the blonde communist typing-error, Jovovich, none of them register a single point on the Richter-scale of acting ability. An Hispanic female (called Rodriguez, would you believe) suffers from some strange opthalmic condition whereby she is permanently looking upwards. It is not a very endearing characteristic. Whilst Ms Jovovich's high point was to fall through the roof of you-know-who's taxi in 'Fifth Element'. One suspects that she must have fallen onto numerous casting-couches first. Frankly, I have seen more human emotion expressed by a pair of buttocks than I have seen manifest in her face. That blank, pale, uncomprehending stare has now become a staple at the check-out queue of my local Tesco's. Usually it is accompanied by a black-haired, bull-necked, block-headed lump who's eyebrows meet above the nose. Pretty, they certainly ain't. Such is European integration. Ms Jovovich also engages in the sort of gravity-defying wall-walk that 'The Matrix' made fashionable.There's a clever little shock-ending that is very well accomplished; it leaves you in no doubt that things really have gone pear-shaped, and looks like the origins of all 'Living Dead' movies.Soundtracks and incidental music are drawn from a variety of heavy-metal and thrash-rock tracks with which I am unfamiliar, and don't really add much atmosphere to the movie as, perhaps, simple silence might.And that's about it. Don't expect too much. Don't ask any questions. Just sit down with your six-pack or whatever, and watch. It's a well-made B-movie. The six stars I've given it more reflect the quality of set pieces and special effects than anything else.",Resident Evil
90,begob,The need to feed,9,31 May 2015,"Woman rages against the machine, but the machine won't stand for rage.Lovely resistance movie. After 13 years it's still crisp and pacey. Two great close-up actresses, Jovovich and Rodriguez, and the director/writer knows just how to use those images and the music to keep the rhythm going.The story is good and clear, and the theme of humanity betrayed by the corporate collective is even more urgent today. Not a great movie, but still has a lot to say, and it gets me every time - I guess time will tell.I suppose the CGI is the only thing that ages it, but trying to update this with superior tech would be pointless.Overall, great entertainment.",Resident Evil
91,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"The first ""Resident Evil"" film is a very, very guilty pleasure. Dopey (if not just plain dumb) beyond belief but a TON of fun.",6,11 January 2014,"The world of Video-Game-to-Film adaptations is a very dark place in the world of entertainment. Over the past 20 years, starting in the 90's, video-games have become increasingly elaborate, cinematic and sophisticated in terms of storytelling, often delving into deep plots and rich character development that rivals the best in Hollywood filmmaking. Especially in recent years, with the release of games like ""Uncharted"", ""Heavy Rain"" and many others, which feel more akin to interactive films than they do like old-school video-games.Yet, Hollywood has yet to figure out how to properly release a video-game adaptation. Starting with the abysmal 90's adaptation of ""Super Mario Bros."", the studio system has displayed once major flaw over and over again that has plagued every video-game adaptation since: Studios do not understand, nor do they make any effort to understand, video-games and gaming culture.Studios (and many modern producers, directors and writers) seem stuck in a very 80's mindset that games are merely mindless entertainment without stories, and/or can somehow be made ""better"" by violently altering the source material's stories and characters. And thus so many video-game to film adaptations are released that bear little-to-no resemblance to their source material. Yes, almost every single video-game film has relied on making radical and unneeded changes to their source material, under the delusion that they need to change things to make it work. To date, there have been virtually no video-game movies that have actually resembled the original games.And Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" is definitely a major offender in this respect. Yes, it is a film that almost exclusively alters, disregards and even disrespects its source material, turning the original slow-moving and deliberate Romero-esque video game into a goofy, pseudo-James Cameron-inspired action extravaganza.But you know what? Looking past how much it disrespects the original ""Resident Evil"" game franchise... it's actually not too terrible a film. Oh, it's bad. Pretty darned bad. But it's also wildly entertaining, and is clearly full of the rampant eye-candy that Director Anderson relishes in. And in terms of sheer, unadulterated entertainment value... you could do much worse.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac woman who awakens in a seemingly deserted mansion. After encounter another survivor (Eric Mabius) and a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez), she is whisked away into ""The Hive"", a technologically advanced underground compound below the mansion, run by the ""Umbrella Corporation."" Alice, Matt and the commandos are forced to investigate the complex, in order to figure out why it was sealed off, and survive when they realize researchers and scientists of The Hive have become ravenous, zombie-like creatures.The acting isn't too shabby. Jovovich is a lot of fun in the role, underwritten though it may be. Mabius does come off a tad boring, though. And Rodriguez, who I've actually quite admired in some films as a touch-yet-sexy chick, is pretty good in her role.The production is also pretty decent. If there's one thing writer/director Anderson knows, it's how to make pretty pictures on screen. The production design is convincing enough, giving us sleek quasi-futuristic designs, and the production design does lend to some cool action sequences and even a couple of reasonably intense horror segments. I did find some of Anderson's choice in shots and compositions to be over-done at times, though.Unfortunately, the writing is pretty dreadful. Ignoring the fact that it essentially disregards the original video game (save for a few character names and passing references), it's way too fast, and the dialog is very wonky.But still, this is one of those movies where you care more about the images than the written words. As mentioned above, Anderson is a king at making ""pretty pictures"", and here, asides from his more over- the-top visuals, he delivers on some great action beats and decent sequences of suspense. So I can't say the film is a total loss just because the script kinda sucked. Anderson seemed to have the mindset that he wanted to make a fun action-horror movie. And I think that's pretty much what this film is. It's criminally stupid at times. It's under-written. But there's enough guns, gore and even some exploit-o-riffic nudity in a few sequences, so I'd say audiences looking for a good time should get what they're pay for. I like it as dumb fun as a 25-year-old male, as do my college-aged friends and even my 50-something-year-old mom. So that should tell you that it's worth checking out once for sheer dumb- fun.I give it a 6 out of 10, just for entertainment value. However, if you are looking for a film that is very well-made or true to the video-game source material, you will be very disappointed.",Resident Evil
92,denis888,Masterpiece!!!,10,1 August 2007,"I love Milla very much. I like this movie, since this is one of the best she ever starred in, including the Fifth Element or any other. But Resident Evil is ever fresh, ever thrilling monster. The plot is excellent and from the very start the movie holds you glued to the seat and never allows you even to take a breath in or out. Milla as Alice is brave, sexy, valiant, courageous, smart, cool and so clever. And then there is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, she is so gloomy, so dark and so demonic, that you hardly avoid falling in love with her too. The very idea that some large corporation like Umbrella here may control you, create some terrible genetic monsters and never be responsible for that is also a big magnet in this film. This is cool, impeccable and great All 10 / 10",Resident Evil

94,Terryfan,Resident Evil The horror Comes to the big screen,8,10 September 2012,Hard to believe this movie came out ten years ago.This is the first of the live action Resident Evil movies based off the video game of the same name.For the record the reason the movies are not based off the games fully is because Capcom requested the filmmakers not too because they were worry that the fans wouldn't buy the games but watch the movies.Being since games and movies cost just about the same amount of money to make them so I can understand Capcom's point of view.However now that we got that out of the way lets get started on this movie.The Story kind of feels like Resident Evil the game where a Mansion is the base of operation for the HIVE Umbrella's hidden lab where the T-Virus escape killing all the workers in the HIVE.Our main Character Alice played by Milla Jovovich who suffers from a effect that causes her to lose her memories.So when Alice meets Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius they are soon taking by a Special Forces team with Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez they are send in to find out what happen in the HIVE only for it to become a mission for survival against countless waves of Zombies and Monsters.Paul Anderson played the game before making the movie so at least he gave the game a try before making the movie and from what he said in interviews he fell in love with the games so he wanted to make a movie out of it.And to tell you the truth the movie really give me chills watching it because of the fact that the zombies and zombie dogs and Lickers the main villain in the movie looking so real that it really makes your heart race.So if you're a fan of horror movies or a fan of the Resident Evil Series I would recommend checking out this movie.Beware the movie is very graphic for some scenes so you got to have a strong stomach for it Nonetheless a good movie for fans and I recommend checking out I give Resident Evil a 8 out of 10,Resident Evil
95,DJAkin,"Milla Jovovich good, movie bad.",2,17 March 2002,"Wow, this film was bad.  I mean, the best part was watching Milla Jovovich!! She looked good and hid her accent well.  This performance on her part was fine and she shows good moves (way better than that pile of dribble called TOMB RAIDER).  The movie starts off ok with a cool shot of where the scientists work in ""the hive"".  Then something goes wrong and the computer locks down the lab and kills everybody.  Then, a SWAT team shows up lead by some man who looks like the CANDYMAN.  There's a scene where some laser beams slice some of that team.  That was a rip off from the Cell.  Then suddenly all these makeshift Zombies show up after five hours of being dead! It was Alien's meets Return of the Living Dead (especially since The Candyman is in it) with a little bit of OUTBREAK thrown in.  What you get when you mix those three together is a movie that appeals to only little kids with candy.  In fact, I was embarassed because I was the only adult in the movie theater!  I wanted to see that hispanic girl DIE the entire time. I also wanted for Milla Jovovich to have more speaking parts.  Milla Jovovich is one of the best actresses of our generation.  I hope that Milla Jovovich learns that she can do more than just these sell out movies.  Ugg. And what's the deal with that stupid Red Queen?  As if any artificial intelligence (another stupid movie) could be all nice and then start screaming ""KILL HER!  KILL HER NOW!""  Many things were wrong with this movie.  Shame on you Milla Jovovich.  I will give you another chance though because you're the best looking actress since Andie McDowll.  I rate this movie a 2.",Resident Evil
96,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Evil on TV,6,31 July 2014,"At the beginning of the 21st century, the Umbrella Corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. Nine out of every ten homes contain its products. Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public, it is the world's leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, and health care. Unknown, even to its own employees, its massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, and viral weaponry....It seems so cool, doesn't it? And yeah, I was very intrigued by the beginning, those awesome-looking turquoise vials of some zombie virus. Then a homicidal computer, similar to GlaDOS from Portal or CAS from the Tower (1993), begins torturing and killing every scientist in the lab, locking the place down (I'm nostalgic for the 1985 film Warning Sign). It was so amazing...But then the character Alice is introduced, and she wrecked the film. They were less concerned with making a good plot and more with actress Milla Jojovich's inhuman action kicks and punches. The scene where she leaps along the wall and karate kicks a mutant lab dog's head in, what was that!?

98,rivertam26,"cool, slick, action packed and scary",9,22 August 2012,"Resident Evil is one of the biggest if not the biggest video game franchise ever and rightly so. The games are intelligent, action packed and scary as hell. Taking the first game and sort of making a prequel/sequel to it with this film Paul W.S. Anderson of the 1995's visual spectacle Mortal Kombat executes the right formula with his adaptation. By setting it in a sort of alternate universe he manages to keep an heir of unpredictability. We open the film with a viral attack on a huge underground laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation. Soon after that we meet Alice the films lead heroine who is suffering from memory loss played by Milla Jovovich with a exceptionally physical cool factor. A studly mystery man named Matt played by hunky Eric Mabius and soon after a security team featuring a very young and quite annoying Michelle Rodriguez. They of course go into the hive where they encounter many biological and digital terors such as an evil computer program, mutant creatures and loads and loads of zombies. What make this film work so well is the way it's paced it feels like a video game and you feel like your playing. As the film opens into its later segments and you learn more about the main character and the storyline you seem to be one upping levels it's an intriguing experience and a brilliant approach. Sure there's a little goofiness afoot and some of the FX are unimpressive especially by the standards now as well as being slightly repetitive at times. But Resident Evil is the best adaptation of a game it's cool, slick, action packed and scary!",Resident Evil
99,oneguyrambling,The original - and only good entry - in an increasingly lousy series.,6,19 November 2010,"Resident Evil was Milla's first ""I can do it all by myself role, and the double edged sword of being in a pretty good and more-successful-than-they-thought film is that so far she has had to star in three sh*tty sequels.Resident Evil was alright though, and for a while it was a minor highlight in the awful game or comic book to film group.Resident Evil takes place in an underground facility run by the Umbrella Corp, located beneath Raccoon City, both names classic examples of why foreign game developers should consult with native English speakers if they plan to prepare a game for that market.Have you ever heard of a city as stupidly named as Raccoon City? Would you choose to live there? Wouldn't you fully pull the p*ss out of anyone that you knew that did live there? I mean seriously... And if they worked for Umbrella Corp wouldn't that only sweeten the deal? I mean Umbrella Corp?!? In essence the big-nawty Umbrella Corp (tee-hee) has made some whiz bang virus that has apparently been unleashed in the massive underground research facility, and the thousands of staff working there have been locked in to prevent the virus from escaping.The full implications of the virus are unknown, and the impact of the virus on the trapped staff is not shown in the early goings on, we do see in some initial moments that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows for everyone though.Cut! And Scene! Milla J wakes up nekkid on the floor of a running shower, how long the shower was running wasn't calculatable but her pale white skin showed no signs of ""pruning"", I looked... for a long time... in freeze frame.Milla looks around to find herself in a large mansion-y building, with evidence that she lives there, and clothes carefully laid out for her. Now dressed in a strange fanboy-fantasy outfit of a red dress over combat boots (which she later adds a black leather jacket to. Huh?), Milla has no memory, no weapons, or no understanding of why she is there. At this stage I'm not sure if she even knew she was supposed to be acting, all she did was look around with wide eyes and her lower lip perpetually dropped for her early scenes.A strike team shows up with a squad leader who looks very much like a robot (mouth closed though), it appears that Milla has something to do with things, how or what we don't know yet. At least she now has friends.And a name, Alice.The team announce their intentions to move into the underground facility, now dubbed the Hive, to see exactly what is going on. They enter through a sneaky door in the Milla-Mansion.After a short zip down into the Earth on a subway style train system the crew end up at the gates of the underground Hive, from here on in numerous variations of ""JUMP"" scares are the order of the day, each with an accompanying ""BOO"" noise.Their mission takes them to where the AI system that runs security for the facility, called Japanese-game-developerly the Red Queen, ""she"" is personified by a hologramatic young girl with a British accent, who thankfully seems also programmed to spout menacing dialogue when it is deemed to be most unsettling.Like a rapping granny, a ""black-acting"" old white guy or a talking animal in an ad or kid's film (non-animated, cartoons are supposed to talk), it just gave me the sh*ts.There is a cool visual, but logically stupid scene in a security hallway, where a series of laser patterns sweep the hall, starting with a straight laser that they can step over, and progressing to more complicated patterns that begin wiping off various digits and limbs, before expanding into a Julianne style dicing pattern that shreds all inside.Why have the first three or four patterns before bringing out the sure fire crowd pleaser? Anyone who has played the game knows that it is about fighting Zombies, and as 99.3% of viruses nowadays in films create nothing but Zombies it seems why don't we just acknowledge that they are already here? Once the Zombies arrive it seems clear that the crack squad aren't really that well-trained, many of them simultaneously lose the plot and they seem to scatter in all directions, there is also much infighting and bickering, and it takes them forever to realise that a headshot drops their assailants.Alice rapidly comes to realise that whoever she is and however stupidly she is dressed that she has skillz, and that these skillz are effective VS zombies and zombie-dogs alike. (Although if you watch the couple scenes where she fires a gun pay attention to her eyes, she blinks hard with EVERY shot fired. I guess some models turned actresses just aren't cut out to be cold calculated cinematic assassins.) After escaping the initial onslaught the survivors discover they have only a limited time to escape before they are forever shut in (and therefore dead), which you would have thought relevant information to know prior to heading in! There are various sub-plots that mean little and add nothing to the film from this point. The zombies seem to inexplicably vanish from the film for very long stretches after the first headlong rush and a new CGI-assisted menace is introduced, I guess sort of like a level-boss in the game really.Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Despite all the sarcasm and crap written above this is actually an effective little movie, it can't help it that it was followed by three sub-terrible sequels... so far.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Resident Evil

Which has good excuse to borrow ideas from others. Not to mention... there's like this skip forward.  So your scratching your head trying to figure out how this one dude and Milla got back to the main group.  o_O  Had to backup the dvd and still can't figure it out.Two things come to mind when watching the movie however.  Evil Dead & The Stand.  Combine those two things together and what have you got?(SPOILER)One thing though I can't get past.  As usual, Milla provides a rather wooden & Stiff portrayal of her character.  Now perhaps fits this particular character, but not always (The Messenger). Michelle Rodrigez is pretty damn good in this movie though. We've got to get her into more movies.And of course this movie, like the X-Men was built as a vehicle.  It's more than obvious that this movie is set up in such a way that a sequel can't be that far away.  Though I really can't figure out why. lol(Which as I see here....

The graphics of the monsters are scary and perfect. Except of the zombies which in most cases look fake, and amateur. There are twists, unpredictability, and constant feeling of hope, mercy, and bit sexual because of the presence of two somewhat hot girls. Also realistic and convincing buildings, materials, masks, scientists. The ending is even more fun and although completed with one part, leaving us with even more questions, and motivation to watch the next sequel.

104,blott2319-1,Nothing good,3,26 June 2021,"Resident Evil is a mess of a movie from the beginning. My first complaint about the film is the fact that they made a choice to have the main character's memory wiped. The logic of how it happened was ludicrous, and the whole memory-loss thing never added anything to the story. There are only two reasons I can think of that would make them take the plot in this direction: Either they wanted to hold Alice back from reaching her full lethal potential (even though she seems to access it pretty quickly;) or they wanted to have a surprise reveal in the final act. This twist might have been exciting if I cared one bit about any of the characters in the movie, but I found them all bland, and didn't care when they were picked off one-by-one. So, I'm certainly not going to care if one of them is a person that betrayed the rest before all these killer zombies started running around.The acting in Resident Evil is disastrously bad across the board, only to be outdone by the miserably dated CG effects. I couldn't muster up any interest in these people because they were all so one-note and uninspiring. I get easily bored with zombie movies (or ""infected"" movies that are just zombie movies with only a minor semantical difference.) It seems they all have to spend time with the same things as people slowly start to discover what has happened, have to deduce how these creatures work, and then have to decide how they can be killed. It's all been done to death, and I hate feeling 10 steps ahead of the characters in a film. Perhaps it would be interesting sometime to have a zombie movie where the people have actually heard of zombies before, so they can cut to the chase faster. I'm not saying I'd love that movie, but it would at least bypass all the predictable stuff.But the biggest frustration that I had with Resident Evil was the lack of spatial awareness. The film did a disastrous job of establishing where people were at any given time. I could not track their movements, I kept getting confused why they were separating from each other, and lost sight of what they were trying to do other than survive. It felt a bit like a video game, in fact, because the story was secondary to the next big action set-piece. I suppose if their ultimate goal was to emulate the game, they succeeded in some way, but since I'm not holding a controller determining where people go and if they will survive, it's hard for me to follow. Not to mention, with most video games I can push a button and get a map that will show me where I am and where I need to go. That ability to orient myself in the world was sadly lacking in the Resident Evil movie, and is just one of many reasons that I found it completely unenjoyable.",Resident Evil
105,sarastro7,A Must-See For Milla Fans!,6,12 January 2004,"I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only 29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough. Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the zombies is a worthy attempt to ""technofy"" the zombie genre, but it doesn't quite work, esp. not the part about the ""need to feed"". All in all the movie brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel will, too.Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much more.",Resident Evil
106,mentalcritic,One of the best films I have seen in a while,10,29 April 2002,"Actually, it's something of a mixed bag, but the good far outweighs the bad in this case. I'll start with the bad first. The bad news is that the film seems a little tame in comparison with the computer games, which are some of the bloodiest and most creepily atmospheric releases the video game world has seen. Often, when you want to see blood gushing everywhere, all you will get is a relatively nice and clean death. A bit disappointing, but that's to be expected when the Moron Picture Association of America steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that adults watch films, too.The good news is that the same creepy atmosphere that made the games so grand, and made such interesting films as Night Of The Living Dead the way they are, is well-represented here. During each and every scene, one almost leaps out of their seat, anticipating the attack of a spider or a licker. The clever references to the games are also quite well-done, as is the reference to Day Of The Dead. Milla Jojovich really does a great job of bringing Jill Valentine to life, and the rest of the cast, anonymous though they may be, do a bang-up job of supporting her.Frankly, I cannot wait for the director's cut on DVD. I want to see more blood and gore.",Resident Evil
107,Richie-67-485852,At Home in this Residence,9,17 August 2017,"I remember the first time I caught this it was by accident (?) The opening sequence where they explain an underground facility intrigued me so I stayed with it. It pulled me right in. The story is rather unique and they pull it off in a credible way. Who doesn't like a secret underground city type facility, run by a computer that has had a breakdown of some sort being investigated by an elite squad of Marine types? It just captures you as the story unravels quite nicely. It had some nice scares and twists and just when you think you are out it pulls you back in more than once I might add. Its just a well executed movie. While I prefer no nudity in the movies, this was understandable as the story presents it. It does distract but for Hollywood that means $$$. This went on to launch a series of movies so need for me to go on and on. Give a look-see and find out what this is all about. BTW...I like to eat while watching. However, Zombie films don't stimulate the appetite and this had plenty of thrill-action keeping you occupied. Do have a tasty drink and perhaps some sunflower seeds on standby. Enjoy",Resident Evil
108,jaredmobarak,Project Alice is onlineResident Evil Trilogy,7,21 September 2007,"Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutesthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crowsyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10",Resident Evil
109,mattymatt4ever,"Nothing remarkable, but there's some cool action and f/x",5,16 August 2002,"I've never played the ""Resident Evil"" video game, being that I'm not a fan of video games.  So maybe the story and characters will appeal more to the fans of the video game.  They didn't appeal to me all that much.  But altogether, it's fairly entertaining.  There's some really cool action and special f/x.  The two lead actresses, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are extremely hot.  And the DVD commentary was amusing.  Paul Anderson also directed the video game-based ""Mortal Kombat.""  I have played that game, back in the days of Super Nintendo, so I was able to appreciate that film more.  If I saw ""Resident Evil"" in theaters, I wouldn't give it a recommendation, but it's a pretty good rental.  My score:  5 (out of 10)",Resident Evil
110,hnt_dnl,"Generally entertaining, but also flawed",6,11 November 2021,"RESIDENT EVIL (2002) is a unique hybrid film combining elements from the genres of sci-fi, action, thriller, and horror. I actually first saw it a long time ago not long after it first came out, but barely remember anything about it. It wasn't until all these endless sequels manifested with the pending Raccoon City prequel looming on the horizon that I decided to re-watch the original film. And now having seen it again, it's a very entertaining movie with a lot of positives, but also several negatives. The positives first. The best part of the movie is the set design and cinematography. For a movie from the very early 2000s, it still looks very pristine and beautiful. The underground, labyrinthine science facility where most of the action takes place actually looks cool. There is basically little to no CGI so that all of the action and sets are authentic. Also, the computers in the movie actually look incredibly modern like you could almost believe this movie was made in 2021 and not 2002. I also like the choice to use a pulse-pounding rock score to accentuate the action. The opening The action scenes are also exciting if at times a bit annoying with characters freezing up and being dumb. Which leads to the negatives.The film is pretty shallow filled with a bunch of good-looking B-list actors and unknowns who aren't exactly persuasive. In fact, I found most of these characters to be frustrating with some of their decision-making. The dialogue is full of exposition where characters just state the obvious. I also found it laughable that the extremely frail and puny Milla Jovovich (as the protagonist Alice) was doing all of these ridiculous stunts and constantly beating up the fast and powerful zombies while each character in the military infiltration team full of the strong guys and the butch Michelle Rodriguez could barely handle one zombie apiece. And I get it, Alice is genetically engineered, but it's not less dumb looking just the same. Rodriguez herself was rather annoying doing some diluted impression of Vasquez from Aliens and acting tough and mocking the guys in her crew. When they were on the train and the hacker guy actually opened the steel door that she couldn't herself, she made some snarky comment to him and I was like ""at least he opened the door when you couldn't!"" Also, why did her character look like she was about to fall asleep half the time?Also, all of the character closeups were obnoxious trying to show Alice and her generic husband (whose accent kept slipping) were having flashbacks whenever they remembered something. Which leads to another point and why was the guy from Ugly Betty handcuffed yet not Alice and Generic Guy? As far as the team knew, one or both of them could be the traitor and since they had no memory, how did they know they could trust them? Plus, the team was pretty large to the point they could have just had a couple of them guarding him at all times, one in front and one behind to make sure he didn't try anything. And the team was his ticket out of there anyway so why would he try to escape since he was completely clueless on how to get out? Also, in the scene where the military team leader and his squad were killed by the laser, why didn't Alice and the guy take their equipment and weapons to protect themselves? It was every man for himself at that point.The flawed writing for the characters and the inane plot logic kept me from giving this movie a higher rating, which is a shame because it's a really beautiful film to look at. Also, the story is pretty singular as there aren't many movies that successfully combine so many genres as Resident Evil. In fairness, none of the sequels look nearly as good as this movie, especially the CGI fests made in the last decade. And also I like how the action in this film is generally believable and not too ridiculous. To sum up, Resident Evil is an entertaining sci-fi action spectacle with a pretty cast, but a lot of flaws.",Resident Evil
111,Beta_Gallinger,"A cheesy, juvenile action blockbuster, but at least there's lots of adrenaline",7,9 December 2009,"This movie is another cheesy video game adaptation, and is based on a game series which I'm not familiar with. The film was released years before it ever caught my attention and it obviously wasn't any of the ""Resident Evil"" games that lead me to watch it, since I've never played any of them. I first found out about this Paul W.S. Anderson movie when I learned that Milla Jovovich was in it. Before I rented it the other day, I knew it was one of the polarizing modern action blockbusters, but fortunately not one of the universally panned ones. Due to all the criticism, I wasn't expecting a great film, but thought it could be pretty good at best. I can now understand the widespread criticism, but despite the severe flaws, I found some redeeming qualities.Below Raccoon City, there is a top secret underground genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the extremely powerful Umbrella Corporation. After a vial is broken, releasing a virus, the lab's supercomputer known as the Red Queen locks the Hive to prevent the virus from escaping, trapping and killing all the employees inside! A military unit then takes Alice and Spence, two people suffering from amnesia, and goes to the Hive to investigate what has happened. The head of the commandos, known as the ""One"", explains why they are all here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen, but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all over the facility! From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn't that great, but when the emergency in the ""Hive"" begins, so does the suspense! After that sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me. The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them seem like naive high school students who shouldn't be on a mission like this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez' performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull, there's a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special effects in this film.I'm not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7/10 rating I'm giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S. Anderson was also the one who directed 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" (another movie based on a video game), and I didn't like that film at all, but for some reason, that wasn't quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster. I'm not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it wasn't bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this movie, so don't watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you MIGHT like this first ""Resident Evil"" movie, but there's no guarantee. The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!",Resident Evil
112,educallejero,Good fun movie.,6,29 March 2019,"Entertaining movie based on a video-game. That's not an easy job.They managed to create a compelling personal story for the main protagonist (Mila) and explained the context and plot very efficiently.Once the action kicks in, the pace is great and the survival aspect mesh really well with the intriguing plot. The characters are thin, of course, but they work too, without annoying ""comic-relief only"" or ""the defenseless"".I don't know, but I'm sure someone could find plot-holes, but overall, if they exist, you don't notice while watching this good video-game zombi movie.",Resident Evil
113,SanteeFats,Very good,9,3 August 2013,"First I think most zombie movies made today are stupid. While this is considered a zombie movie it does differ in one respect, you know what is causing it and it is not just some made up plot line. I think Milla Jovovich is super hot. In this movie she plays a human that been turned into an almost perfect killer because of her training and the virus that has been unleashed by the corporation. The corporation sends an assault team to investigate and they end up dead. Milla gets reawakened and starts to do her thing. She does it very well and wipes out several of the zombie like creatures in the underground lair. It turns out that Milla was a security specialist who was infected and then placed in suspension. Gee it turns out she has some kind of immune response to the virus. She survives and it takes off from there. I really enjoyed this movie",Resident Evil
114,phubbs,Resident Evil,6,16 February 2015,"There was much trepidation when this came to bloom way back in 02, an adaptation of the highly popular zombie horror video game franchise? hmmm. Anderson's first foray into the adaptation world after some reasonable films like 'Soldier' and 'Event Horizon', his CV didn't look too shabby but previous attempts at this sort of genre proved dismal.Amazingly enough this first offering in what is now an overly ridiculous 'Matrix' 'Blade' 'Underworld' monster mash mess is actually quite good and sticks to the original formula. It all kicks off inside the well known mansion but in an imaginative spin delves deep underground to the secret Umbrella facility. Here we get a very admirable 'Aliens' type thriller as a team of commandos battle to survive against a sadistic mega computer that runs the facility and of course lots of undead creatures/monsters. So the whole film is contained within the underground labs instead of roaming the mansion which at first seemed wrong. Maybe they could of done with some mansion action but it actually works well. Later adaptation 'Doom' does seem somewhat similar in premise though, slight case of concept rip methinks.Naturally the effects are mostly CGI for the creatures and they do now look rather crappy, very obvious. Of course you can't pan a film for that but the CGI hasn't dated well, where as sets and overall look for the film isn't too bad, zombies look a bit childish though. It is nice to see most of the video game nasties in the film though, Anderson certainly did well not to stray far from the source yet add to it as well. Zombie dogs which aren't fully CGI but real dogs with makeup is a nice touch, a hint of the crows and Lickers which are good n scary...accept for the fact they are all fully CGI. The Red Queen computer character is a good addition to the fray and quite eerie at times also 'you're all going to die down here'.This film is a welcome presentation of the franchise and shows what can be done if done properly. Its still mind boggling to me that the film is actually a reasonably scary horror flick! there are quite a few good jumpy moments and certainly no hesitation with blood. A creation of slow building dread and suspense is well handled throughout, alongside some nifty visual moments and a good if slightly clichéd bunch of commandos all adds up to a darn fun ride.Yes you can see many steals from other similar films (the usual tough bunch of soldiers taken down one by one) and the characters are all generic copies stemmed from a certain Cameron film but the fact its not a kiddie flick and watered down is fantastic and astonishing. There is no silly slow motion nonsense, no over the top set pieces, actually Jovovich plays it for real and isn't a Selene clone from 'Underworld'...yet. Probably the best of the series if you ask me, and it was an Anderson film!! Its formulaic and clichéd but still provides enough punch to do what its suppose to do...pretty much like the 'Doom' film.6/10",Resident Evil
115,carbuff,"Maybe a back-handed compliment, but so much better than ""Doom""",6,9 June 2021,"As I understand it, the essential formula was the same as ""Doom"", that is, take a successful video game and turn it into a movie. The basic plot line of both of these films are very similar, but ""Doom"" is somewhat painful to sit through, while ""Resident Evil"" is much better in every single respect, although the acting still seems to be pretty flat (as opposed to ""Doom"" in which the characters where barely there cardboard). Relative to ""Doom"", the story line has better twists, the special effects are on par with each other, and this one actually stirs some true human emotion. You'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you simply watch ""Resident Evil"" and skip ""Doom"". Same basic film, but it's much better done.",Resident Evil
116,stamper,Zombie flick with brains,8,5 March 2003,"The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have been beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite original.
Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.

117,ivo-cobra8,"The best one in the series, amazing horror sci-fi action flick based on a video game - my favorite!",10,9 October 2016,"Resident Evil (2002) is my favorite horror sci-fi action flick that is based on a video game and it is my second favorite film from Paul W. S. Anderson! It is favorite horror sci-fi action flick of mine and I love this film to death! By far one of the best horror films ever made! Milla Jovovich is a sexy actress and plays a perfect role for this movie. For 2002 the special effects are amazing and the acting was great. Definitely the best out of the three. I Wouldn't Say Its A Horror Movie, Yet I'm Not Saying Its Not. This (Along With Underworld, Van Helsing and More) Is a strange combination of Horror, Action, & Sci-Fi. If someone asked me what genre It is I would probably say Horror. Horror is supposed to scare you. This makes you say ""Holy Crap This Is Cool."" either way awesome movie. Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), a young woman who along with fellow survivors must find a way to escape a underground bio facility that is infested with zombies. The film would launch the Resident Evil film series. Something rotten is brewing beneath the industrial mecca known as Raccoon City. Unknown to its millions of residents, a huge underground bio engineering facility known as The Hive has accidentally unleashed the deadly and mutating T-virus, killing all of its employees. To contain the leak, the governing supercomputer, Red Queen, has sealed all entrances and exits. Now a team of highly-trained super commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - The Fast and the Furious, Girlfight), Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element) and Matt (Eric Mabius - Cruel Intentions) must race to penetrate The Hive in order to isolate the T-virus before it overwhelms humanity. To do so, they must get past the Red Queen's deadly defenses, face the flesh-eating undead employees, fight killer mutant dogs and battle The Licker, a genetically mutated savage beast whose strength increases with each of its slain victims.""...Mila Jovovich is a first-rate action heroine.""This film has everything it is a zombie movie, about plague a deadly T-virus that infected its employees and turned them in to a bloody thirsty eating human zombies! It has deadly booby traps, killer mutant dogs, the Licker mutant zombie. The action is great, the horror in this movie is visually scary. Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious is excellent I love her character Rain Ocampo she was a tough special forces commando soldier in this flick. But Mila Jovovich is a bad ass, she is so hot and sexy I am kind of jealous on Paul W.S. Anderson for having so sexy and beautiful heroine for his wife. I love this flick and I love the songs in this movie. We have Eric Mabius from The Crow: Salvation I love the songs for this movie: My Plague (New Abuse Mix) - by Slipknot and Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) by Fear Factory. The movie itself is very good, it's a zombie flick but as some others have stated, not retarded or boring, it's actually a great movie with not a lot that I need to complain about, good characters, action sequences, story, game-references, dialogue, suspense, etc....I don't think I need to say too much there.Overall: I am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10, this is the best one in the series and no sequel can overpass the original. What else can one say about the Resident Evil franchise: as far as basing a movie off of a video game, Resident Evil has to be one of the best adaptations ever. It keeps the broad strokes of the game intact while creating a new character, Alice, that everyone can instantly identify with. Milla Jovovich takes the action hero foundation she laid in The Fifth Element and builds on it to make herself perhaps the first female action superstar. I love this film to death and it is my favorite film in the franchise it is still a true horror film! Resident Evil is a 2002 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S.

118,fernandoschiavi,"With terrible make up, CGI and score, Paul Anderson appeals to resources that are already overloaded, such as the use of loud sounds that ""come out of nowhere""",6,9 June 2021,"After the success of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, which cost $80 million and earned $131 million at the box office in the United States alone, it's only logical that another adaptation of a successful game won the big screen. Resident Evil at least manages to be more faithful to the spirit of the franchise than was the curvaceous heroine of Eidos. Arguably acclaimed, ""Resident Evil"" is directly responsible for the spread of survival horror in the gaming universe. Before him, ""Alone in The Dark"" had launched the genre, but it was ""Resident"" that really made it popular. According to some sources, the game is based on the Japanese game ""Sweet Home"", from 1989, in turn based on the movie ""Suiito Houmu"".The plot of the first film, revolves around the events in the basement of the Spencer Mansion. According to what the film explains, underneath the mansion is where the Beehive, a research center of the Umbrella Corporation, would be. Some things got out of control in this mega-hidden laboratory and all the employees were trapped inside, even with the release of a dangerous one, and still in tests, viruses, called in games and later in the movies, T-Virus.The T-Virus is the result of a genetically modified virus created by Umbrella and responsible for making humans look like zombies. Not getting much into the research merits, but there is an explanation for this to happen. Scientists employed by Umbrella for this research were trying to find a way to delay aging, but found that the virus is, in some ways, deadly. The point is that it killed the infected being, but later revived it with only a few active organs. Therefore, this being, now zombie, was driven by the desire to satiate hunger, providing cases of cannibalism. Anyone being bitten by a zombie would have already been infected and, in a matter of hours, would have the virus active in their body.Despite having an excellent plot to be adapted for the big screen, the director and screenwriter Paul W. S. Anderson was bringing in various elements from games without necessarily using the same characters and plot itself and that was a mistake. Evidently if these main elements were used, the film would be much more interesting, because there we would have extraordinary elements for a horror film. It could have included the Alpha rescue team, protagonists Wesker, Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Barry, and even the story of Albert Wesker who was an Umbrella agent with a mission to use the STARS teams as guinea pigs, in addition to the Tyrant among others stuff. These elements would bring the real characters of the game, with a lot of mystery and many horror scenes characteristic of the game and, above all, would please the fans of Capcom games. Justifying these absences, director Paul W. S. Anderson said that the film he made is a prequel (events prior to the story of the game).Analyzing all these events, you can see that Resident Evil: The Damned Guest (2002) is a film made by lovers of that universe. But was all that enough for the movie to work? The answer is no. The idea of Paul W. S. Anderson to create a completely new story, but that delivers several fan services until it works, but the way it was executed is completely disastrous. The film really posed itself as an adaptation of the game and not simply a story with bases. We see elements like the Spencer Mansion (target of the first game), the Umbrella megacorporation, the T-Virus, etc. However, the chaos of the first feature film is just throwing these elements in a blender and adding them to a new approach to the story, including a new protagonist; the character Alice (Milla Jovovich, from ""The Fifth Element""), thus distancing the renowned characters of the game, such as Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Carlos Olivera, Chris Redfield and his sister, etc.The characters are poorly constructed and do not gain the public's empathy, because they are careless and do not do the least bit of surveillance. In one of the scenes, Alice goes alone and unarmed in a deserted wing, slaughtering bloodied Dobermans in the greatest ""tomato extract"" style, distributing flyers and killing mercilessly. Milla Jovovich at least has a convincing look and intonation and still manages to be the best thing about the movie. In addition to her extraordinary beauty, the actress provides a strong, fearless and convincing interpretation of Alice to the public, a character who throughout the films has been the bridge with the other protagonists of the series in the games. The character, who could only have been prepared for war, would be the greatest potential to be explored in the film, but her moral redemption and her change of ethos, justified by a surprising amnesia, transforms the situation into something stupid and puerile, underestimating intelligence of the viewer. We also have the villain, totally questionable, the Queen of the Hive is a machine that has bouts of pity, which only serve to explore choices between life and death for some infected. Characters who are presumed dead return, only to die seconds later, in a sequence of disjointed scenes that takes the patience of even the most casual viewer.Anyone, even if they haven't played anything in the Resident Evil franchise in their life, read between the lines, will see that the story Anderson told there was a kind of remake of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the universe of the famous Capcom franchise. If you look closely, the main character is called Alice. Who she fights in the film is an artificial intelligence known as The Red Queen. The elevator the characters use to enter the Hive is all mirrored, referencing the book Alice Through the Mirror. When Alice enters the Hive and has a flashback of her lost memory about Umbrella's lab, she sees scientists operating a white rabbit. When a certain character is infected by the T-Virus, the Red Queen orders Alice to cut off her head. Anyway, there are many similarities between the film and the works of Lewis Carroll.Paul W. S. Anderson, who has already proved that video games and horror are his thing (he directed Mortal Kombat - 1995 - and Enigma do Horizonte - 1997), but the director, in this work, seems to forget that this is an action film adapting a franchise from horror of video games. Without the slightest originality, he appeals to resources that are already overloaded, such as the use of loud sounds that come ""out of nowhere"" to try to scare the audience. There are even some scares during the film, but the frantic and chopped action disturbs the plot's rhythm too much, getting cloying at times. The film is noisy, the electronic soundtrack by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson along with the shooting make the feature extremely tiring. Even in relation to the claustrophobic environment of games, the director manages to emulate that very well, even appealing to angles that refer to games. But the characters don't have charisma, the acting is very weak, and at times it even sounds a little playful, and look that this is a film that takes itself too seriously.Resident Evil monsters don't convince viewers, zombies are light and don't tear anyone apart, they just scratch and bite. The members of the elite squad casually enter the alleys, to the point of letting their tactical leader pass through a corridor full of traps in a scene with numerous continuity errors, such as the disappearance of corpses. The sets, which looked very elaborate at the beginning of the film, take on a very tasteless style and seem to be built with cardboard and cardboard. The makeup is so horrendous and the CG effects are so poor, aging terribly badly over the years. What about the monster created by live tests by the Umbrella Corporation that appears only to cause some tension in the final minutes of the film? The CGI is so precarious that the direction tried to avoid close-ups on the monster, but still couldn't avoid the fake movement and the unthreatening look.Luckily, ""Resident Evil"" isn't a complete waste: as pure and simple entertainment, it's a reasonable movie, which has fun with its dark look, as well as being the return of zombie movies (which doesn't mean much either). Even with shabby and paltry interpretations, the character's ooze sensuality (which, on the other hand, is not consistent with the situations they go through during the film). The outcome leaves some questions open, but at no time does this overcome the weaknesses of the plot, making doubt become banal. In the end, ""Resident Evil"" hardly works as a film and even less as an adaptation. If it weren't for the ending faithfully portraying the mood of the beginning of the second game, when Alice takes a shotgun from the police car and we see Raccoon City completely in chaos, fans' hopes might have died for this movie anyway. However, they cleverly managed to arrest them for a sequel.",Resident Evil
119,itamarscomix,Precisely what I expected,2,24 May 2005,"This film was, I'm sorry, *really* bad. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.",Resident Evil

The leader of the team is One (Colin Salmon) who is taking them from the mansion deep underground to stop the evil rogue AI, the Red Queen, beneath Raccoon City. Alice also has memories of being married to Spence (James Purefoy). She teams up with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) after most of the team is eliminated by a laser beam hallway. The movie turns into a typical zombie movie from that point on with cheap special effects and over the top action common for a movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. Audiences have been spoiled with zombie gore since this film was released and this is nowhere near one of the top in this subgenre of horror. The special effects are pretty flimsy and dated too.

Anderson) marks time between set-pieces, and barely makes an impression. Despite a top-line cast (including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson's movie replicates the computer game's limitless excess, and reduces its characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the zombie hordes descend from all sides. The action scenes are chaotic but unmemorable, and some of the gore appears to have been curtailed for censorship reasons. Watchable, competent, forgettable.

124,deatman9,not bad but I was hoping they would take a different route.,6,26 October 2012,This movie was not that bad but I was just hoping they would kind of stick to the video game and make it more like a horror movie instead they took a different route and made it like an action movie which greatly disappointed me.This movie is about a special military unit who is sent to fight a super computer and hundrerds of scientists that have been infected with a disease that turns them into flesh eating monsters.This movie was pretty good it was surely entertaining enough. The acting could have been better and I would of like to see some elements of the video game in there but overall not bad.,Resident Evil

Not brilliant, but not so terrible crap either.I laughed in several places where I probably should have been terrified or scared, so i actually can't recommend this one if you are looking for real horror, but if you can tolerate cheesy plot and bad acting and want some laughs, this is for you then. There is just a bit too much unintentional comedy in the film, the whole seriousness of the tone just adds in that factor.Not one of the best movies of Milla Jovovich",Resident Evil
127,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Whoa! this hall is dangerous!""",6,20 April 2019,I watched this movie as a kid back in 2002 and I remember thinking it was amazing and the best thing ever but years later I watched it on DVD and then recently on Blu Ray and well it is a good zombie and action movie it isn't a good Resident Evil movie.The movie takes the core concept of Resident Evil and coupled together with the games basic lore turns a survival horror game with a unique story into a basic action movie. Resident Evil is a big name franchise and in the right hands could make for a great movie series as well sadly the movies only got worse in the sequels.The actors are well cast no complaints there but you don't see a Zombie in the movie until around the forty minute mark which is way to late for a zombie movie. The dialogue and setup for the movies storyline takes over forty minutes and is just boring and uninteresting. The movie is filled with shots of swat team members checking around every corner in every area with weapons drawn as they walk around just to pad out the movies run time.The movies make up and practical effects are great but what really spoils it is the movies bad CGI creature meant to be a creature from the game. Sadly the CGI is laughable and when watching the movie on Blu Ray looks even worse do to the better picture and brightness that you don't get with DVD or VHS which this movie was also released on.I would recommend watching Resident Evil if your looking for a fun zombie action movie to watch. If your a fan of the Resident Evil game series the movie is definitely enjoyable but the games are far superior in story and atmospheric.,Resident Evil
128,anselmdaniel,Tame but still fun,6,24 October 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Resident Evil is a movie based on the video game of the same name. The movie is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and stars Milla Jovovich as Alice. The movie ias about a research structure called The Hive under a remote mansion close to Racoon city. The Hive is researching the T-Virus, a virus that alters its host to create zombies.Resident Evil is first and foremost not meant to be a classic movie. The movie relies too much on the video game's setting and it does not even have characters from the video game in this movie. The movie has its own cast that the movie relies on with its own story. This can be a good thing if the movie's plot can build upon the video game's plot, but the movie does not. This movie's plot is an excuse to have bio-weapons, zombies, and a paramilitary group fighting the zombies.The action is tame in today's standards but it is still fun to watch. There are some fun and creative sequences in this movie such as the laser hall sequence. I loved watching this trap and the stunts that were required from the actor. The zombies were threatening at first, but soon became background props for the characters to overcome.The sets in this movie are well designed. I liked the atmosphere the sets created. The Hive felt creepy and nefarious across the entire run-time. This setting of an underground laboratory definitely helped the movie stay on the horror genre.The acting in this movie is not good. This is not a reason to be watching these kinds of movies and the actors and actresses do an acceptable job that it is not too distracting.Overall, I would recommend Resident Evil. The movie has its flaws but it is still a fun movie to watch.Grade: B",Resident Evil

After all it can't be exactly like the game.I think the movie is pretty cool from the very start, though you might not know what going on in the first but you will, later. The action sequence that you will see is great and very much convincing and even though the casting is pretty weird it not that bad at all.I think it is a very good sci-fi movie that should not be missed.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)",Resident Evil
134,LebowskiT1000,Pretty good for a zombie movie.,7,7 August 2002,"First of all, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the video games (or zombie films for that matter).  I own the three games for the playstation, but I could never really get into them.As for the movie, I thought it was fairly entertaining.  It had it's good points and low points, like most movies.  The story is nothing terribly intellectual, but it's interesting.  There are a lot of things you just have to accept and take for granted in the film.  Such as why on earth they would have created this virus in the first place, and what on earth that crazy dog beast thing was!  But, ok, I'll accept it.The only major complaint I have about the film is the music in the film.  I love type of music that they used in the film, in fact I own a lot of the music that was used in the film, but it seemed to me that most of the time the music was just overwhelming and out of place.The special effects in this film were surprisingly good.  I wasn't really impressed with the trailers for this film, but seeing them in context made it much better.The acting is nothing to get excited about.  It's good, but it's a zombie movie, so you can't really expect great performances.  Milla Jovovich looked really good in this film, and there are even a few times where Michelle Rodriguez cracked a smile and looked pretty.  She always seems to have scowl on her face, and her eyes are always up in her eyebrows.  The only other cast member I'd heard of was Eric Mabius, he did just fine with his role. Although, I did recognize Colin Salmon from the 2 (soon to be 3) most recent James Bond films.  He did a fine job as well.I would think that anyone that likes zombie movies and those type of films would like this one.  Also, if you're into gory films, you may want to check this out.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",Resident Evil
135,Antagonisten,Uninteresting,3,7 February 2005,"I'm no fan of the Resident Evil video games. I have played them but i found them to be quite tedious and slow. Not bad, but nothing that didn't feel like ""Alone in the dark"" hadn't already done it years ago on the Amiga.The research complex called ""The Hive"" is buried deep under ground. Now a virus have gotten loose there that has caused the hive to close itself. A special military unit is going in to investigate.I was of course skeptical when i saw who directed this movie. The Antichrist of b-action Paul W.S. Anderson. And here he does it again, the same thing he almost always does. Turns the movie into crap. And there are several reasons for this.First of all Milla Jovovich is completely wrong in the hero part. Going to war in a mini skirt is ridiculous to begin with, and it just becomes even worse from there. The cinematography is surprisingly OK as are most of the special effects. But the action scenes completely lack any kind of tension or pulse. It's just people firing weapons while REALLY loud heavy metal music is playing, but there is no real excitement. This is typical of Paul W.S. Andersons movies though. The lack of any pulse in the action scenes. Seldom have so many fired bullets and so much fighting felt so incredibly slow.So why watch this? Well it's not recommended. I don't know how it compares with the video games as i don't know the games well enough. But i do know that standing on it's own this is an inferior action movie. There are a few tolerable scenes and a couple of moments that lift this a bit above the lowest mark. But in the end you can do something better with your time. I rate this 3/10.",Resident Evil
136,dfa120374,A Good Game-To-Film Adaptation,6,15 January 2015,"The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.Resident Evil is one of the much more enjoyable game-to-movie adaptations as usually these are pretty mediocre or just plain awful (Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros. etc), and fans of the game should be pretty pleased with this movie version as well, especially as the makers of the movie have brought in the formidable creature known as Licker who features in the game also.The action for the movie is really good, which is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack to get the adrenalin going that wee bit more as well. A good few special effects are really well done also, especially in the scene that involves the Red Queen using a laser as a defence system, and the effects for Licker was impressive making it just as scary in the film as it was in the game.Just one thing - this isn't a gore-fest of a zombie movie either and concentrates more toward the story, so if you're expecting (or hoping for) lots of splatter then you'll be highly disappointed.Resident Evil is an enjoyable film to watch. It's not a thinker of a movie, obviously, but it's not supposed to be and doesn't pretend to be either. Also, don't expect an exact game-to-movie film. It's an adaptation OF the game, so enjoy it for what it is - a good zombie horror/sci-fi action film.",Resident Evil
137,dilipbts,Resident evil,7,10 June 2020,"I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.",Resident Evil
138,Spanner-2,Entertaining thrill ride,8,20 March 2002,"This film, based on the popular video game, has a group of soldiers battling zombies in some kind of futuristic science lab underground.. the layout of the place was never really clear to me. However, the film is very entertaining even as it plays up the cliches of the zombie genre.  Milla Jovovich comes off well as an amnesiac who joins the soldiers as they fight the zombies, and she turns out to be a formidible fighter, even though she spends most of the film semi-naked... but hey.. works for me... The film is an entertaining thrill ride that plays like a live action video game but if you go in expecting that, you get what you wanted. GRADE: B",Resident Evil
139,markovd111,Given the source material and time it was made...,5,20 February 2020,"Making a movie based on a video game has only lately, when things in the industry are different, proved to be a good move. ""Resident Evil"" tries it's best, but instead of survival horror, we have action movie mixed with horror. Only ""scares"" present in this movie are jumpscares. Milla Jovovich is bland as a main character, Michelle Rodriguez being a far better suited for the role. Action is mostly bad and the best parts come in form of, ironically, hand to hand fighting with zombies (Jovovich). Story has a good idea, but it all falls flat with the atmosphere. It's jut when you watch a movie and you feel like you are not enjoying it, forcing yourself to watch it. Same is with this one. I wouldn't watch it again. As far as video game adaptations go, this one is good for it's time, but now, it isn't very good. Still, if you want to pass some time and are a fan of the games, knock yourself out. 5.5./10 (for a video game adaptation), 6/10 (for an action horror movie).",Resident Evil
140,hellholehorror,Nothing intellectual,6,21 December 2017,This is a good and gory zombie action film. It is not full of horror and suspense but it makes you jump and some of the gore kicks you back a little. This is good as there is no brain power required. You just sit back and enjoy the action and the beautiful star of the movie. Nothing intellectual is a good thing.

It has it's flaws for sure, but for the most part its an atmospheric, tense, and engaging experience, with some good twists and turns.My two major criticisms of the film are firstly, its numerous sections of clunky exposition, and secondly its reliance on jump scares. Neither were so jarring as to detract from the overall experience, but I would have liked some of the horror elements to be a little more intelligent and not just rely on jumps.The action hasn't aged awfully well in 20 years, but to be fair to it it still holds up enough to be enjoyable and engaging. I actually thought some of the zombie effects and makeup were pretty solid and hold up to scrutiny all these years later.I actually really enjoyed the story and the Milla Jovovich's character, and am excited to dive into the rest of the franchise.I'd definitely recommend this for any action/zombie lovers.

143,nitzanhavoc,"Resident Evil - Father of the ""zombie virus"" idea? Even if not, excellent zombie film!",7,16 May 2013,"As a devout Horror fan, I suggest that Zombie flicks are sort of a different genre. It could be considered a sub-genre of Horror, much like Ghost Stories and ""Torture Porn"", but it's more unique in it's differences, I reckon. I've seen my share of Zombie flicks. Most of them, like world famous Dawn of the Dead, take place in a zombie infected reality, where few survivors try to live through the aftermath of an apocalypse. Resident Evil predates most of the films of the passed decade, and the best thing - it shows the factors that lead to the zombie apocalypse. I must confess that I have no prior experience with the title, not the Comic books nor the animated films. But I very much enjoyed this film!The screenplay and story feel unoriginal, but if anyone knows of the first film that has come up with the idea of a major corporation developing a virus that turns people into zombies, then gets released somehow and infects the world - let me know, because I don't. White Zombie was released in 1932, but involved Voodoo rather than a virus. Resident Evil probably ins't the first, but it was there before many others. The story is great, with good plot twists and delightfully surprising turn of events.This film might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a great and fun to watch zombies film. The acting is good (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez of course, but I also liked James Purefoy as Spencer). Direction and cinematography are also good, done just right for such a film. I've watched this intending to continue and watch all the anthology, all the way to the latest 2012 film, including the animated films. It seems I'm in for quite a ride!",Resident Evil
144,willcundallreview,An underwhelming but all out horror thriller,4,6 September 2015,"How do you make a video game adaption work, hire Paul W.S Anderson? No that's not it, what about cast Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez? Well no but it feels more promising, oh I know actually, lets just make an all out crazy movie with little realistic dialogue and some poor acting. See that seemed to do the trick because this movie is a poor one, I didn't find it completely bad but it's still pretty bad anyway. You know I'm the kind of film fan who can truly enjoy movies with a premise like this but when they cast the wrong people behind the camera and on it, you just can't forgive the producers for this one. Resident Evil is based on the popular video game of the same name and definitely see's the kind of action you might expect from such, not all together a really un-enjoyable ride, but just a movie that is unlikeable. We see Milla Jovovich waking up and not knowing what the hell is going on, we also see James Purefoy with the same old predicament and both seem to need to know what's going on. In steps a whole team of people who have been sent in to investigate a thing called the ""Hive"" an underground facility that seems to have done some bad things to test subjects and even employees. The film is packed full of insane action, kick ass stunts and zombies (including zombie dogs) and really does pack quite a punch. I didn't feel this film was bad because of the action actually, it is what makes this slightly exciting and at least the movie has a certain horror element too it and can make you kind of jump.It wasn't the directing that made me cringe, it was the writing which seems to rip this movie apart, the cast can seem almost lifeless at moments with this script and the small talk is well, none existent. The cast do give it their best at certain times but in others it can feel as if they are trying too hard to make this dramatic and Anderson does nothing to help them. I think the only real redeeming factors in this are that it is not awful and not even maybe fully bad but still just poor, as I said the fighting and all the things like that are the only things that keep this a float before it sinks into the abyss of movie garbage. As for the actors themselves I can't say I liked any of them, Jovovich is not bad but she fails as her role to lead the movie and ends up in moments being second fiddle to more exciting characters. Michelle Rodriguez is probably more exciting than her but even she can not make this any better, coupled with the writing too, I just couldn't forgive this movie and felt disappointed. The story is played out well kind of full blown just go for it which does work in it's favour somehow, I didn't want any plot for large parts of this because I was enjoying the fighting, there are way too many obstacles set in this movie but I can say at least you get a few thrills and that's what is important. So all in all it is Anderson who truly damages the film, not as much with Jovovich or the cast as they are just sucked into the director's work. I think in fact I know for a fact many will enjoy this and think me crazy for saying this is poor, but just look at the film properly and really don't let it take you for a ride without first showing you its poor skills. I do however recommend this to all horror fans and action aficionados as it basically will do what it says on the tin really, scare and thrill.",Resident Evil

148,TwistedContent,The Most Atmospheric One,6,4 January 2021,"One day I sat and thought it could be nice re-watching some of the horror franchises real proper like, and all six ""Resident Evil"" installments happen to be somewhere far back in the viewing history. Having played a couple parts a little, I'm not well-versed in the gaming lore of ""Resident Evil"", so I won't talk much about those angles. Can't say I was a big fan of the films back then, but let's see the perception now. As the unforgettable Marilyn Manson's theme instrumental sets in, I'm cozy and ready.
Very quickly we get introduced to world's largest commercial entity, the Umbrella Corporation, their huge secret lab dubbed ""The Hive"", laying under Raccoon City, and the genetic experiments they carry on down there, as well as the T-virus. A yet unknown figure sabotages the operation and releases the virus, causing a rogue AI to shut off the hive and trap everyone inside. A special military unit gets sent in, on the way picking Milla Jovovich with a pretty bad memory lass. She is none other than Alice, as she'll reaffirm that to us for the rest of the franchise.In the essence, ""Resident Evil"" is a familiar story with some cheese and plenty of cliché characters, but it is happily aware of that. A horror survival story, made less routine with over-stylized action sequences, maddening editing, injection of humor by the good cast of characters, and the ever-beautiful femme fatale Milla Jovovich, for the most part in just a couple layers of clothes, of course. Acting is good throughout the film, and besides the main attractions, dames Milla and Michelle, props from me to Martin Crewes portraying the poor team's tech guy Kaplan. Kaplan had the most stressful jobs... The story uses same old blueprint tropes, and ends in seemingly the only way it every could've, apocalyptically more hopeless and setting up a sequel.Though I haven't yet re-watched the sequels, I doubt anything is going to change the fact that this is the most horror part of the franchise, the one that feels to justify the genre the most, because it's not only blowing zombie brains on rock music waves that makes horror. ""Resident Evil"" is the most atmospheric of the franchise, and I believe a role in that plays the sets - all underground, having a little long-term claustrophobic effect, as well as color grading, it's all red, white, black, silver, more red... Cold tones. Having said all this, psychological dread is not something this film possesses. ""Resident Evil"" is a decent horror movie that could've been a great one. A complaint with little weight, but the outdated ccgi didn't help, though there are also practical effects at play.In many ways of style, ""Resident Evil"" embodies a lot of what was high on top during the early 2000's, from the set and costume design to (outdated) FX, to industrial music, to the overall tone. If you're a fan of such vibes, zombies, Milla or the games, check it out! Though I don't find it likely You haven't already. My rating: 6/10.",Resident Evil
149,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,6 April 2005,"What had the potential to be the greatest zombie movie ever is let down by poor studio choices, distancing itself as far from the games as possible. However, it remains a solid action movie if not the terrifying, emotional, complex horror it could have been. Admittedly, truly bringing the game to life for a two hour movie would be an extremely difficult process, and those making it could easily have made a mess, mangling the characters and story. It has always been my opinion that the games should be made into feature length TV movies, say 2 two hour episodes for each game. This way everything would fit in, and the budget would not need to be great. Of course this is just a pipe dream, and what we have is not as bad as some make out, with many good points.The film starts with an outbreak at the Umbrella facility. Chaos ensues, and everyone appears to die. We then meet Alice, a woman inside an eerily empty mansion at night. She does not know who she is, and only has flashbacks of her life. Soon a group of marines enter, assuming she is a civilian, and along with the other survivors they try to work out what happened to the facility. They soon find out that everyone has been turned into zombies by an evil computer programme and they soon worry about how to escape. Though Alice is not what she first appears to be, and neither are some other survivors.The main problem with the film is that there is little fear created, and it is insanely watered down, with little gore. Fans of the series are used to high tension, jumps, threat and bloodshed, but this is simply not present here. Also, most of the marines are wiped out in a laser room, and only one is killed by a zombie. The licker effects are OK, but there are no Hunters, Spiders or Tyrants. As well as this, most of the marines get small parts, look similar and we fail to feel anything for them. Now the good points; Johovich is very good in the role, and there are a few decent twists, like the game. The way her mysterious past is revealed is clever and well-balanced against the escape. Howver the clear star is Michelle Rodriguez, giving an excellent, strong performance akin to Vasquez in Aliens. The action scenes are dealt with well, especially those involving the dogs, and the lighting and camera-work is good. The film makes a good attempt at creating an original story, and the direction is sound. Of course, us fans would have loved to see Wesker's antics and our favourite STARS members being picked off. Maybe one day the games will make truly great movies, but why complain when we still have the games. Obviously a let down for fans, but still a pretty good actioner.7 out of 10",Resident Evil
150,xamtaro,Who the heck is Alice?,5,1 May 2017,"Resident evil 2002 reviewHello. This is the resident evil movie franchise. And this is its story. The start of its story. It was conceptualised as an adaptation of the ""Biohazard"" horror genre video game, renamed ""Resident Evil"" for the global market. Paul Ws Anderson, director of the successful Mortal Kombat movie, was chosen to spearhead the project. But something seemed wrong. The characters were different from the game. Changed. Unrecognisable. It seemed as if he read the synopsis at the back of the video game box then tossed it out in favour of his own script. A script. Consisting of dialogue as silted as the first paragraph of this review. Considering that the games were never well liked for their characters' flowery discourse or Shakespearean soliloquy, the creators of the movie cut and pasted elements from other movies in Paul Ws Anderson's DVD collection then give it some cosmetic do-over to resemble the video games. Special force team sent to deal with an unknown threat in a cavernous facility? Aliens (which Anderson is unabashedly a fan of). The facility is ""alive"" and trying to kill you? Event horizon (also directed by Anderson). Actress Milla Jovovich in a skimpy red dress, combat boots, scenes teasing near nudity and doing all sorts of nimble kung fu to show off her lithe hot body? Straight out of Anderson's wet dreams. Jovovich plays Alice. Who the heck is Alice? We do not know as she's got amnesia. But clues to who she is are sprinkled throughout the film and it is fun to piece it all together by the end. What can I say? Other than that, Alice is a blank slate audience surrogate. The ultimate escapism protagonist titilating the men and allowing women to feel empowered by how she maintains her stunning beauty while fending off shameless groping perv.....I mean, shambling groups of zombies which only appear more than halfway through the movie.For much of the first half we are treated to a whole sequence of a special forces team breaking into a dark scary mansion to find Alice and another guy named Matt. The mansion is a cover for a hidden entrance to The Hive, a massive underground facility that had been had been mysteriously sealed. The artificial intelligence Programme dubbed ""red queen"" had killed all personnel in the hive and it was up to this special team to find out why. This is essentially a modernised haunted house story with the ""house"" being the hive and the red queen springing traps to kill the intruders. Though lacking in actual zombies, the film maintains a brisk pace and an increasing sense of dread as we descend further. The appearance of another amnesia named Spence compounds the mystery when they learn the lockdown was initiated by a virus outbreak and the red queen was merely acting to contain the virus. When the action kicks in, it is fantastic. Sure the characters do some silly things that fly in the face of common sense but the fight scenes are well shot with tight angles and claustrophobic feel which heighten the sense of panic when facing the zombie hordes with no escape. The mystery story is well plotted and shot but the experience is dampened by some of the corniest special effects even for a movie of its age. Near the end, they have a run in with a Super powered Monster rendered in the worst cgi ever. Why they decided to use rudimentary computer graphics instead of practical effects, puppetry and make up astounds me. The creature never blends with the rest of the footage and the disappointment is that it could easily have been done with a stuntman in a suit or animatronics. With an eventual resolution leaving more questions than answers, RESIDENT EVIL is undoubtedly a fun guilty pleasure. It does not follow the story but retains the tone of the games. A shallow superficial plot is at least held up by consistent tension and decent pulse pounding action. Once you can forgive all the familiar elements borrowed from other movies, RESIDENT EVIL proves itself to be a decent start to a Long running science fiction horror franchise.",Resident Evil

In places it was boring too, with a distinct lack of chemistry between any actors and poor 'one liners'. They went for a serious movie and came up with a joke. Romero's screenplay got him sacked and they came up with this instead?As for the actual linkage between the games and the movie, well it was sparse. There were definitely similarities in places, but not particularly good ones. None of the characters from the games are here which is a huge gamble. Overall, if you're a fan of the games, see this because you'll want to - but be warned that it's terrible.A number of 'patrons' actually left half way through.

156,jayjaycee,Borderline blasphemy to the original game,5,10 April 2020,"""Resident Evil"" is a 2002 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. As I previously expressed, my love for the video game franchise and all of its titles is endless. They accompanied me through high school and even as of today, I routinely play them as if it was the first time. I can never escape the packing atmosphere and the unique feeling that it never fails to create in me. While I adore the original games, I've always kept myself from watching the movies, as I heard they are nothing like the games. But now that I made my way through the ""Silent Hill"" adaptations, I thought it was long overdue to survive those films as well. I really wasn't expecting much, but what this movie offered was a huge disappointment even for that standard.
First of all, it's totally obvious that this film absolutely distanced itself from the source material. It's more than heavily adapted, it's something that's at last loosely connected with the iconic franchise. I knew about that. But what was this supposed to be? Neither does any of the beloved main characters appear in here, the whole premise has been extremely altered. Instead it follows a group of soldiers on the mission to contain the virus, with Milla Jovovich's character Alice (as only mentioned in the credits) as the protagonist. Many things from the game are name-dropped and only mentioned by the way and no part of the actual story. Even if this tries to be something on its own, it's still nothing but only just mediocre as a horror film. Director Anderson who's responsible for the infamously trashy gem ""Mortal Kombat"" tries to bring his own vision to the big screen, but fails to achieve anything I'd consider notable. After watching this film, I additionally watched a short documentary segment in which he explains his actions. In a nutshell, the man is a total hypocrite. He states that he'd absolutely love the game and always wanted to make it come to life and describes his admiration for the atmosphere, the characters and the specific kind of horror it created. Then why didn't he include any of those aspects? What did he do instead? In his own words, something that functions as some sort of prequel to the game. And I was even more confused. Funnily, he was confident enough to claim that he treated the source material with immense respect. What he just didn't. He simply did not. The plot is a total mess with less than a handful of scenes that I liked. Nothing else. Except from famously cheesy dialogue and one-liners, it didn't do anything about creating some similar sort of atmosphere. It's nonexistent. While I see some kind of silver lining in the not quite brilliant yet charismatic performance by Jovovich, how she roundhouse kicks the zombie hound and how the side characters die in the laser beam sequence, it's still nothing overall satisfying or entertaining. Don't even get me started about those horrible visual effects that are so bad my running gag of comparing it to PS2 graphics wouldn't make any sense in this case. Not even the zombie makeup looks scary in any way. I've seen countless film way older than this one which nailed to have frightening make up, so there's no excuse for it that they are so dull like this. They're worse. It's an imprudent and catastrophic mess that dares to call itself ""Resident Evil"". All in all, it's an absolutely terrible adaptation, but a mediocre action horror film that just didn't make anything on its own, although it's obviously intended. Despite declaring himself a huge fan of the franchise, director Anderson was without a doubt too incompetent to realize a decent life action adaptation of his allegedly favourite game. He completely misunderstood the source material and failed to capture its quintessential features. To be honest, given what he made here, it feels like he's never ever played any of the games. He wanted to make something original, but there's a difference between creating something from a fan favourite source material and insultingly using its huge success to half-heartedly produce a totally estranged flick that people hoped would be anything like their favourite horror experience. Not really surprising that he never achieved to make something outstanding. Aside from this, it would be more bearable if it wasn't named ""Resident Evil"". But what do I know? The outcome of PWSA's questionable experiment is nothing short of blasphemy. I expected low quality, but wow. It only gets and E for effort. If this was already the ""best"" I don't know what's about to come after it...",Resident Evil
157,GeorgeRoots,Something Went Wrong When Something Could've Been So Right.,5,7 August 2014,"Paul W.S. Anderson once said: ""I don't think anyone knows more about Resdient Evil than I do"".Well that's certainly crap, because we should have gotten a better film. Zombie master George A. Romero was originally set to direct a movie based on the franchise, after creating two successful live action commercials for the video game ""Resident Evil 2"", that were aired only in Japan (YouTube them, they starred Brad Renfro). He sat and took notes, whilst his secretary played the original game next to him and handed the screenplay to Capcom and Sony. Though somewhat true to the original game, the script was shelved. George was fired and the movie was plunged into development hell.Eventually Paul was hired and wrote something respectably set within the first game only, but ended up creating all these new characters who are so underwhelming. Milla Jovovich is probably one of my favourite actresses and arguably she's probably the only thing good about these movies. But even she can't save this poorly executed franchise that managed to start off so wrong. Michelle Rodriguez is Michelle Rodriguez, and to say the rest of these characters are cardboard would be an insult to good packaging material.What would have been more appropriate would to have instead have zombies roam the house, and have the squad fall back into the underground labs due to having no chance of escaping. If there going to die anyway, at least you suddenly have a situation they have no control over and a sense of danger. That would be more compelling then letting them loose yourself. Better yet, just keep it simple and follow the PlayStation one classic that managed to make the franchise what it is today.Final Verdict: I wish Paul actually knew how to make a zombie film, let alone a good film. 5/10.",Resident Evil

Six years later, this movie version has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh Milla Jovovich.Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.In all, the movie is actually nothing.

This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's heads and above trash like The Time Machine.  As one might assume -- the film is full of problems.  For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES, the film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should.  Speaking of zombies -- the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at times.  A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to make sense of it all.  The film has a lot of problems like this, but it still manages to deliver on the goods.  The film benefits from an amazingly sexy Milla Jovovich.  She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was.  The film also stands up pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a fan of).

The action which is pretty much non stop once they reach the Hive involving people mostly shooting at zombies and creatures created by the T-Virus are well executed. The special effects are impressive but at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The zombies and the Licker look terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. Well done. The dialogue however wasn't the greatest at times, it was a little predictable, and some characters are written out too soon for you to care about whether they survive or not.

167,tributarystu,Guts and...,4,22 October 2002,"Over one year passed since I first heard that the movie was being made and I've been waiting for it since then. Time passed once again after it was premiered, but I still didn't get to see it...until this oh-so happy day. And what do I have to say? 'twas a satisfactory experience. Terror of the undead is a pretty usual theme for horror movies. You've got Romero's groundbreaking Night, Day and Yawn...sorry, I meant Dawn. This, though, is the first horror movie that started from a game, the popular Resident Evil series. It seems to be a profitable deal to ""inspire"" yourself from games, but there is this other thing too. What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does: lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these ""inspired"" movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline: In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free. The computer (Red Queen) closes all exists to the outside world, and all the employees (who till recently had worked for the Umbrella Corporation) are killed. But, actually, as you may imagine, they are not quite...dead.Umbrella sends a special agents team to clear up the mess, and set things as straight as possible. This team will actually be shattered in the underground laboratory by what they find there. The stench of death everywhere. Milla Jovovich is the leading actress in the movie - solid reason for avid movie goers to see this one- and she plays the role of a security agent, who works for Umbrella. Incidentally, she suffers a memory loss after she inhales a protection gas released by the Red Queen. We get to find out in the movie who she really is and what she was going to do.Michelle Rodriguez, Mr. Purefoy & company all get together to do their acting tricks and they do them as well as they could've given the film. Now, as all fans of the RE series will say, this film totally sucked. I nearly subscribe. Only 'nearly' because it wasn't the excremental waste the second movie is (I was so naive in thinking it couldn't get any worse). Also, had there not been some very sloppy distribution of zombie actors and had Anderson at least been careful enough to do the simple things right, technically and chronologically speaking, then RE could've stood a chance. All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot. I consider his attitude extremely disgusting: why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game? (yeah, I know, money...it's meant to be rhetorical) It's as simple as this: the film doesn't do justice to the games. So even if RE can be a reasonably satisfactory sit-through, I am absolutely against what Anderson has done to the franchise, which simply wasn't his to ruin.",Resident Evil
168,willywants,"Zombies and mutants and monsters, oh my!",4,10 August 2005,"After a deadly virus escapes from a lab, a secret underground facility becomes a living hell as the staff is turned into undead zombies. To make matters worse, there are mutant creatures on the loose. Alice, a security operative for the subterranean lab, with the aid of a group of soldiers, enter the lab to see what happenedonly to discover escape seems impossible. This film is understandably hated by many people for various reasons, some of which I agree with and some of which I don't. The biggest problem with the film is writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson. He clearly is capable of making a good and enjoyable film, which he proved with 1997's underrated Event Horizon. However, his direction here is unfortunately MTV-style in naturethat is, there are lots of slow-motion shots during the action sequences and even a bullet-time shot or two. I do, however, really like the general atmosphere he gives the filmthe scene near the beginning of the film with Alice walking through the giant mansion is decidedly atmospheric and creepy. Unfortunately, the actors are all wooden, and most of the characters are easily recognizable as creature/zombie fodder from the second they enter the screen. While I really liked the main theme music for the film, the rock music employed for the action scenes is terrible and obnoxious as hell. While there are a couple of good bloody bits here and there, most of the gore is computer-generated and looks absolutely awful. On the topic of bad CG, the first stage of ""The Licker"", one of the mutant creatures, looks HORENDOUS!!! I'm talking sci-fi-channel-original-movie level CG. It must be seen to be believed! Fans of old-school horror will be happy to know that once the licker eats it's first victim it mutates into a predominantly animatronic creature, which looked great. I also really liked the ending (though, granted, it rips off John Carpenter's underrated 1995 flick In the Mouth of Madness pretty badly).In conclusion, Resident Evil may be flawed and relatively brainless at times, but it's entertaining and way, way better than its terrible sequel. 4/10.",Resident Evil
169,Jerique,Paul's second best video game adaptation!,9,8 July 2010,"Paul W.S. Anderson came into my radar in 1995 with Mortal Kombat becoming a film. A film in which I watched dozens of times throughout the year. I loved Mortal Kombat. Clearly, Paul has a knack for making video games into movies.Resident Evil as a film works on many levels. First, it doesn't specifically adapt one video game from the series. Second, it keeps loyal to the way the video game is shot and how the rules of Resident Evil games work. Third, it keeps the element of surprise and finally, it allows for an update and improvement in an already existent zombie movie genre.Milla Jovovich plays Alice, part of the Umbrella corporation. She's sexy, clever, funny, and bad-ass and kicks butt! Eric Mabius plays Matt, and there's just something about Eric's voice that attracts me to his characters. Michelle Rodriguez plays Rain, who kicks just as much butt as Milla.The special effects and make-up effects allow for some really gross and awesome scenes. You really feel apart of the movie throughout the film, and it gives the same vibe as when you're in the game and you're just waiting for the door to open and find out what's on the other side.It's a great adaptation, but the sequels don't follow the same pattern. I suggest skipping the sequels and playing the games after watching the first film. It's the only one worthwhile.",Resident Evil

It even stays relatively close to the game for once. Unfortunately, judged as a high-budget movie, it falls short of my expectations, although it's not a total waste either.To it's credit, the movie has some nice-looking special effects and action sequences, and there's even a somewhat successful attempt at creating a storyline with a bit of intrigue (I said ""somewhat"", so don't expect another ""Usual Suspects"" or anything).Unfortunately, this movie once again makes the common mistake of not letting us care about the characters. They're all fairly generic, none of them is introduced properly, and they all look the same. On top of this, most of the action sequences are so incredibly frantic and haphazardly edited that it's really impossible to determine what the *** is going on. As a result, I really lost track of what happened to the character and I didn't really care either. I just a little bored. If you like this kind of movie (""group-of-people-gets-trapped-in-facility-and-must-get-out""), I suggest you go watch the much better Aliens movies (especially Aliens), or even ""Deep Blue Sea"". Those movies have better characterization, more likeable characters, more suspense, and better jokes.

Just after we do a long take of the wind through the long red curtains, just after we do a long shot of Milla's eye as she wakes up lost in nowhereland.OK, we seen the swat do their stuff, normal film would kill them off one by one, but RE just kills them all straight away, in one shot. HA! We awesome film makers do not resort to such lame scripting as ""we kill this guy here, that guy there, then that one in the last bit"". Naa, let's just get them to ""exit stage left"", and be done with them. Look carefully through the film and you will see many possibilities for cheap scripting tricks that have been ignored, and kudos to the filmmakers for that; The change of pace and setting between the scenes of the film, the majestic use of color, (bright white, psychological horror at the Red Queen, dark brown and black, action bit in the train chase, red, claustrophobic zombie scene with the guy *not-actually-dieing* when you expect him to, blue/grey, beginning part with the virus release, etc..), make this one of the best films i have seen. For Me. Maybe i am under the delusion that *i understand it*, but i love it. all my friends think i am crazy, but watch it, you might just *understand it* too.One of the Best 10/10",Resident Evil
173,TheHande,Different and very cool...,9,2 December 2005,"Rewritten on: 10.9.06Let's get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie. Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would make the film difficult to follow.This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little goofy.As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I've seen in any film to date. Even if the film's plot (which I felt was on par with the games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my personal favorite on the front of video-game films.",Resident Evil
174,theinaniloquent,"""Survive the horror""",7,22 March 2012,"A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident.Before the review gets started, let me start by saying I haven't played any Resident Evil games but the 5th. The others do nothing to intrigue me, but I am a fan of zombie films, so this was a must-see in my book... The film actually has a story. Yeah, every film has a story, but this has much more depth than that. The world is ruled by a corporation called Umbrella, and to add to that, the film has tons of underlying messages and outlooks. But sadly, film's have to rely on execution, so I didn't have the highest of expectations, especially looking at the score. Safe to say, the film does things right. The opening sequence was brilliantly done, and interestingly one of my favorite opening scenes in any movie. The film does tend to get a little confusing, and a bit too much sometimes. Sometimes they almost forgot they were showing the world ruled by a greedy corporation, but this was only some scenes. I admit some scenes were super awesome, and I was on the edge of my seat. Examples: the entire 'laser scene' and the last scene. But sadly, some scenes all relied on pure action. Examples: the scene where Alice shoots up the zombie dogs, and ironically they had to place a hard rock song in there too. There were only flaws here and there, and thankfully didn't send the film downward to pure nothingness. In fact, I recommend it. If your a hardcore zombie fan, and enjoy a story as well, this could be your cup of tea. The film sometimes relies on hot chicks and rock music, but the rest is nothing you'd expect. If your expecting a horror film, your out of luck. The film relies on pure action survival, and it's a good one at that, but only for a select few. PS, if your looking for more films like this one, I highly recommend Zombieland. While Zombieland is a comedy, and your expecting that, than your going to love how it combines our today's raunchy comedy and zombie films. 7/10.",Resident Evil
175,wnterstar,A glorious waste of time!,5,7 January 2005,"This movie was visually stunning and the special effects were nothing short of spectacular.That's about the best thing I can say about this movie. I realize that the movie is based on a video game, but the plot is loose at best. the film makers seem to think that the way to make a good movie it to throw in all the movie clichés possible.1. The beautiful heroine, who just happens to have temporary amnesia who ends up wearing a skimpy outfit throughout the movie.2. The heroine being betrayed by someone she trusts.3. Someone HAS to go off on their own, and ends up getting killed.4. The score is so overdone that things that you miss the truly disturbing stuff and focus on the wrong stuff.There were no real shocks in the movie...they were all contrived, cheap scares that last barely as long as you are in the theater. And I'm sorry, when I saw the killer rabbit all I could think of is Montey Python and the Holy Grail ""It wasn't just any bunny...It was a vicious man-eating bunny....with big sharp teeth!"" Having said that, I gotta say I enjoyed the movie. I gave it a 5 out of 10!",Resident Evil
176,Ziya90,This was what I wanted,8,31 January 2010,"Resident Evil is not the best zombie movie, but the best action based on zombies, the battle between humans and zombies. The movie focuses on this battle as it should be, there are not trashy sub stories or there are not dull characters. There is not a cliché scientist who responsible for all the stuff. By the way, the movie is stylish and well executed that the sequels don't have. Also, the whole film is entertaining. Resident Evil is a consistent movie on all counts, direction, script... The mise-en-scene, especially the set designs, camera angles and atmosphere recall computer games. Besides, the laser scene is very high adrenalin and to me one of the most unforgettable scenes, not only of the movie, but also in action cinema. The first battle between Alice, the team and the zombies are my favorite, also a great demo scene. It is very long and satisfying. The make up effects are not flawless, but very impressive, not like the second and third movies (they were flimsy) There could have been more clash with the zombies, but as said, in terms of action and a Resident Evil adaptation, it is satisfying. The dog scenes are interesting, even if a bit funny (karate against animals?) The other Resident Evil movies copied it by the way, because it is really creative. The train scene is also pretty good. As said, mostly, those kind of movies start well, some of them develop well, too, but at the end, something ruins everything. Thus, Resident Evil is an exception. Lastly, yes, as many people think, the closing was one of the best closing scenes ever seen.",Resident Evil
177,dormesher-21565,Fun start to a franchise,8,13 November 2018,"Resident Evil loosely based on the game series of the same name. I like this film and the live action series I know alot of people would disagree and I will say the quality of the films drops quite a bit after extinction but I have alot of fun with series and I am a fan of these and the video games.This is the first film in the series and it's a great start to this franchise with an interesting storyline taking place in the Hive which is a government research center run by the evil corporation Umbrella and a zombie outbreak occurs and the characters have to deal with that and the Red Queen who is an Artificial Intelligence that is in control of the Hive.This is a very fun movie with some pretty cool action and some interesting characters. However I will say that there are some issues I have although it's based on the game series they don't use alot of characters from the game's which is annoying for me because I grew up on those characters like Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield and even Whesker now I know they show up in later movies but they feel more like side characters because the movie series focuses on Alice who is an original character for this franchise.
And even though it annoys me that they dont use characters from games right I will say Alice is a really interesting character and a bad ass and is brilliantly acted by Mila Jocovich who is awesome in this film and the franchise.The effects have dated quite Abit in my opinion but still look pretty good for 2002 and like I said the action is pretty awesome and alot of cool scenes in the movie.
The Licker looks ok and had some interesting action scenes with Alice and the crew.Theres also some pretty cool twists which involve Alice and her partner who she guards down with turns out she wants to take down Umbrella and was trying to sneak the T Virus and her partner overheard this and caused the break out in the Hive to begin with. That was a cool twists and really brought alot to the character of Alice in my opinion.It also sets up a sequel with one of the survivors going in for the Nemesis programme setting up the next villain which awesome for a fan of the game'sVerdict 8/10 enjoyable but dated movie",Resident Evil
178,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Resident Evil (2002),6,20 October 2007,"Resident evil is one of those movies that are not good and not bad at the same time.It had a bit of the games, Romero flicks and the Bourne movies rolled into one movie.This one is much more believable then the 2nd movie and might make you jump a little bit if it is your first time watching it and the sound is way up.Fans of the games will either like the movie or not like the movie. It may have the fans saying they should have put this zombie in the movie or that character.The zombies looked great with chunks of there faces or bits of there neck missing.This Sci-Fi horror movie is not bad and is one for the fans of the games and people who like a zombie movie. If you see this movie you must see the next 2 movies next.This movie is entertaining and a great popcorn movie that i recommend to those people who want a movie that are looking for a great Sci Fi movie. This a OK movie that has a few characters and monsters thrown in from the games. Go watch this but don't expect this to be better then 28 days later or dawn of the dead.6/10",Resident Evil
179,Aussie Stud,Awesome horror flick that people twenty years from now should still remember.,10,17 March 2002,"Okay, so ""RESIDENT EVIL"" wasn't up there in the high ranks with films like ""ALIENS"" and ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"", but it still gave me a reasonable amount of scares that I haven't experienced since the late 1980's.Primarily based on the successful video games, ""RESIDENT EVIL"" is a brooding piece of work that builds up suspense and horror in a claustrophobic-like atmosphere where a group of soldiers and two guards must infiltrate the headquarters known as 'the Hive' of a high-tech operation known as 'the Umbrella Organization' to shut down a mainframe computer that is known as 'the Queen Bee'. Little do they know that all 500 employees working in the Hive are now dead and have been re-animated as zombies while all other creatures inside have mutated into horrifying monsters.It appears that someone broke into the laboratories to steal a heavily-guarded experiment known as ""The T-Virus"" which has the ability to re-animate the dead. When the virus is stolen, the culprit throws one of the test-tubes containing the virus onto the floor which shatters, resulting the Hive in shutting itself down and trapping everybody inside the underground complex.Milla Jovovich is one of the guards who was supposed to protect the Hive. She is found in an outpost with severe memory loss of her identity and occupation. She along with the group of soldiers and one more guard are taken deep into the Hive. When all Hell breaks loose after the zombies and monsters are unleashed, you will be taken on an unforgettable thrill ride that will leave you riveted to your seat!Most of the praise for this movie lies within the special effects. I enjoyed seeing the zombified dogs and the creatures inside the huge metal containers. The only thing I was a little disappointed with were the zombies themselves. I am very serious when it comes to my zombies, so I was very excited to see the ones featured in this movie. When one man is attacked by a swarm of zombies and is basically eaten alive, I expected to see some good shots of limbs being torn off or flesh being eaten. Instead you only get to see a few of the zombies 'pretending' to bite into him as he screams, and later when he himself has been re-animated as one of the undead, the only signs of his demise are a few bite marks and some trickles of blood running down his face. Other than that, it appears as if the zombies didn't even bite into him at all! A few other scenes also display the same issue - one including a moment where a man is killed after a mutant beast 'eats' him, yet when looking closer at his body in a later part of the film when he too becomes one of the 'undead', he also appears not to have been injured greatly either. One might think that they originally died from fright!One small minor problem I had with the movie was the lack of characters left to 'survive' a sequel. The ending was fantastic - a deserted city scape left in ruin and pandemonium by something horrific, a door left open for a future sequel.I hope they make a sequel. I remember when ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"" came out and all actors involved had signed on for a trilogy, yet it performed very poorly at the box office meaning no sequels would be made. I don't care if ""RESIDENT EVIL"" only makes $1.00 in its opening weekend, I want to see a sequel!My Rating - 8 stars out of 10!",Resident Evil
180,springsunnywinter,One of my most favourite films,10,8 May 2007,"I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action, horror & thriller is superb; they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid & boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they ""need to feed"", nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is ""You're all going to die down here"" from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt & Rain. Background music score is the best music possibly for any film I have ever heard it has heavy metal guitar for the fight scenes and very soft, eerie & sensational for the main title. I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good. There is nothing more I can ask for in a film that makes it one of my all time favourite movies and there is never going to be another film based on a video game like this!",Resident Evil
181,BigGuy,Incredibly tense movie,4,15 March 2002,"First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc.  That being said I will review it as a movie only.This movie is incredibly tense.  Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled. The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage. And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the possibility of Resident Evil 2.The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie.  Basically the cast was Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about except that they (in some cases) advance the plot.  Milla did a fine job playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something to hide.  Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual endeavors).  Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes.  For Milla this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice nothing she is almost wearing.  For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the face snarl look.All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same level with other movies of the genre.",Resident Evil
182,jdring2007,"Violent fun, often mindless even in direction, but stylish without the silly flair of future installments, and enjoyable",9,22 October 2021,"I'll start off by saying that, while I am very familiar with the video game series, I'm no diehard fan. That said, I do recognize the sort of ""treason"" in play, making a movie adaptation and featuring not a single character from the games. Instead they go with a fabricated character, Alice, and from the second movie spawn this whole clone-with-magic-powers story arc. Before all of that, however, was this - ground zero. There are still homages to the first 2 games, some more obvious than others, but as a straightforward zombie action flick, it satisfies. Plus, I gotta say, especially as a teenager when I first ""fell in love with"" this flick, the characters - cliche and averagely acted as they are - each have very entertaining moments. Michelle Rodriguez and James Purefoy were favorites, although I've come to love Milla Jovovich too, who in this installment exercises her versatility in playing a helpless civilian to a major badass, all without being too over the top as the sequels were. Plus the ""evolving"" Licker, a great enemy from the games, was incorporated very well in my opinion, teasing it throughout until its final revelation, a delightful mix of practical effects and CGI. No, thisovie is far from the ideal video game adaptation, but hey, it was fun for me as an action flick with some charisma.",Resident Evil
183,haterofcrap,Atrocious,1,10 September 2010,"This has to be one of the worst films ever made. It is so dumb and unimaginative, that I almost fell sleep. It was just too boring and stupid. Everything about this film was bad: The effects were lousy and poorly made compared with much better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"". The acting was terrible, and all the characters were unlikeable and generic. Also the plot was weak and derivative of many other zombie movies, without nothing of originality. I never played the original video game (In fact, I hate videogames) but I know about good films and good stories, and I have to say that it is one of the worst films ever made. This film was terrible from beginning to end. ""Resident Evil"" is one of the worst action films ever made. It also fails as a horror film, because it is not scary at all.",Resident Evil
184,ryan_kuhn,"""You are all going to die down here.""",2,13 February 2005,"We've had movies based on books, based on the Bible, based comic books, based on songs, and ever since the mid 1990s, movies based on video games. Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather ""Red Queen"" takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. Some computer rebooting occurs, yada yada, and by the end of the film, only 1 or 2 of the people who were in the building at the beginning are alive by the end. The movie is directed by Paul Anderson, who also directed ""Alien vs. Predator,"" so action scenes are to be expected. Some of the action sequences are so dark, so frantically edited, that while the scenes convey ""chaos,"" the message is lost in the inability to figure out what is going on. I would tell you who the men actors were, except they all look alike, so I couldn't tell who was who, they all had the same height, same haircut, one guy wore a blue shirt, but most of the others were even dressed alike. I know there is only one casting list out there anymore, but this is ridiculous. Not the worst film I have ever seen, but after seeing it, I have to wonder why they felt compelled to make a sequel. I for one have not heard about ""Resident Evil Mania"" out there.",Resident Evil
185,pumaye,Romero on steroids,7,26 March 2002,"Much better than anticipated. Probably the best videogame translation till now.

The final scene is a great one, a perfect cliffhanger for a possible sequel.",Resident Evil
186,mirwais-orbit,Sad for a game fan,3,23 September 2007,"I don't know where or how to begin because it's really tough for me, as a game fan, to describe what I felt when I saw this movie for the first time.First of all, I played Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre.The introduction of the first game is quite exciting, showing us all the cinematic importance of the game with a man stepping into a corridor, being attacked by something unknown and the name ""RESIDENTE EVIL"" appearing in the screen in red blood. Then, the game opening shows how everything started. Of course the actors were a lot like amateurs but it was innovative and frightening for a game those disturbing scenes till the game finally starts into a hall in an anywhere mansion. The main characters of the game were Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. This brief description of the game is just to make clear how the movie starts as a completely mess.I think that, to say something about this movie, we have to say if from 2 different point of views: as a game player and as a non game player.As a game player I couldn't understand why they have changed all the original plot of the game. None of the original characters was there and all the interesting facts of the game have been totally ignored. All of the original game characters had different and well defined personalities and each one of them have its importance during the game story, something that do not happen in the movie for the fact that Alice is the main character and everything surrounds her. The cinematic importance of the game has been completely forgotten in the movie and all the frightening atmosphere of the game was totally lost. For a first impression, I liked the fact of Milla Jovovich as the main character just for the fact that she's not a box office name but she's an action star and a name needed for the movie's success, but she is an awful actress. Her face is always the same from the beginning to the end in each movie she's cast, with no exception. But what I keep asking myself is: ""Why Alice as the main character? Why all that stuffs about a girl suffering from amnesia, The Red Queen and The Hive, when we already had an interesting plot from the original game?"".The game plot involve a group of special agents that are lost into somewhere full of all kind of monsters that, in fact, are zombies from a genetic experience accident by a part of the Umbrella Co. that's hidden under a mansion for its illegal studies content. This is also an interesting plot for an action movie because it's simple, original, understandable and full of action (that's what action movies is all about). And why did they had to make something so complex in the worst way? But the worst thing is that they did something so strangely complex that's almost impossible to insert the original characters during the movie or in its sequels. So, as a game player this is an awful adaptation.As a non game player I could find the movie quite funny. The movie starts well giving a detailed explanation about the happenings over the Umbrella Co. until the virus takes control of everything. The zombies are interesting because jumps over your eyes that all zombies are people not dressed well with dirty make up. That thing about Milla recovering from an amnesia all, discovering her fighting techniques under pressure situations are so def that is hugely laughable. It's laughable because it's a common situation in the history of action movies and very few of them made it quite well as The Bourne Trilogy. It's also laughable because it's not in a movie called Resident Evil that that situation would be taken seriously from the writers and the audience. Milla Jovovich, as said before, is one of the worst famous actress of history and I can't understand why people like her so much as she isn't an actress because she's never acting. She's always looking with the same way, she's always with her mouth half-open when she's amazed, frighten, happy, sad... and she's always shaking her jaw when she has something quite important to say as: ""you'll die!"" I liked some scenes that I don't remember by now because they were too short. Lot of people hated the final scene, claiming that it was a scene for a predictable sequel, but I liked it a lot and I think that it's the kind of impressive scene I was waiting for during entire movie and it's the first time when you can finally realize the complete chaos and destruction that Umbrella Corporation caused and how it should be if something like that happened in real life. So, as a non game player I had an enjoyable time watching that movie but it could be a lot better.That's sad. The movie suffers from improvement failures over the potentials of the game, and the game (and also the fans) suffers under this awful adaptation.",Resident Evil
187,LanceBrave,A mess.,3,15 February 2007,"Every thing Anderson did right with video games movies on ""Mortal Kombat"" he seems to have forgotten by the time he got to this project. I'm not even a fan of the ""Resident Evil"" games and I can tell that this film changes much of the source material. I mean, was the whole computer going nuts and underground laboratory aspects necessary at all? It complicates the plot when it didn't need to be complicated. The characters are stupid, that's for sure, often doing things wrong just because it adds to the ""drama."" Milla Jovovich is sort of attractive, I suppose, but not much of an actress and certainly not strong enough to hold down a project as weak as this. The fact that she was engaged to the director at the time makes her casting even more bogus. The special effects are pretty good with some interesting looking monsters. However, it isn't much of a zombie movie as they don't really appear in it at all and most of the gore is pretty soft. ""Resident Evil"" is just plain dumb.

While Resident Evil is scary, violent, and has some great action sequences, I really did wish it stuck more to the first video game, or at least not have put in the ""Red Queen"". The movies does have its little twists that will surprise you. One more flaw is that sometimes the actors are actually trying to ACT. Those scenes are almost like watching Battlefield Earth.

191,repojack,Don't listen to the critics -- great flick,8,8 November 2020,"I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more.Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%).Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure. Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon.""",Resident Evil
192,Jakealope,best of it's genre and sub genre and a darn good flick in general,8,24 February 2006,"I never play video games, so I have no attachment to the theme. I saw the sequel a year ago and thought it was lame and derivative, though I liked Milla. I also thought she was the best part of ""The Fifth Element"", acting against one of the worst movie killers of all time, Bruce Willis. (OK, he put in a few good roles here and there.) So, I got the DVD of RE and it blew me away. The production value was far superior to almost any of those techno-cyber-man-vs-computer flicks, along with it being better than most zombie and action movies in general. It had the same sort of set and theme as the original 70's techno-science thriller, ""The Andromeda Strain"". The acting and characters were spartan but right on cue. Though most of the team members tended to look alike, they all had some personality and acted more like real people than some soul-less, Ahnuld type killing machines. Milla's body language was excellent, and she was sexy without hamming it up an ounce. She deserved an Oscar and is a pleasure to watch. THough the one scene where she kicks out the mutant dog was lame. Her character suffered from amnesia due to a nerve agent in the beginning and there was a dream like sequence when she awakes on the floor of her shower and is utterly blank. That scene was filmed in a huge German mansion that the Nazis and Communist used for a retreat, done in red, as her skimpy dress she wears. She has to reconstruct her past while battling zombies, genetically engineered killing animals and the Red Queen, or the AI program that runs the hive. But she always maintained her humanity and femininity throughout the horrors she faced and fought. She was paired with Michelle Rodriguez, doing her macha latina schtick as one of the security team members. But the two of them actually complemented each other and it worked well. Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo offered up some pretty decent comic relief and lines too!The sets and mechanical efx are great, but the cgi beasts were weaker. The cinematography and editing were first rate. The soundtrack was pulsing techno that drove the already good plot along, it was great too.In short this movie set a benchmark for all those cyber-mutant-techno-action-zombie movies that few will beat. Throw us the action, but at least have real people and great but spare efx. It's sequel, of course, was a turkey compared to this. It was made in Europe, which explained it's good techno style, Funny, but my man George A. Romero was supposed to direct it, but gave up. I don't think it would have been as good. Basically, this movie first rate period.",Resident Evil

Let's face it, Doom sucked (No offense intended, Dwayne), Tron was so-so (Oh wait, that's right, the movie was the basis for the game.) and Lara Croft, well...Hmmm, maybe I better shut up at that. After all, Angelina is one of the hottest women on the planet. Speaking of really hot women, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are certainly in the top twenty or so. This film is a no excuses romp through all the zombies and evil creations any modern Frankenstein could dream up, and the players are all well versed in the action adventure genre. This is one of those films that brings together all the phobias of evil corporations, illegal experiments, and scientists backed by the military to produce horrific weapons of mass destruction that, as always, backfire. James Purefoy is the greedy bastard that starts everything in motion, but the Red Queen, a computer with the holographic persona of the designers daughter, is HAL and Skynet rolled into one times ten. One by one the rescuers succumb to either the Red Queen or the Zombies, and we are sitting on the edge of our seat waiting to see if anyone survives. Rated R for violence, language, and some brief nudity/sexuality, this film has spawned four sequels and who knows if more are coming. Powerfully entertaining and thrilling, I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good sci fi flick with all the elements to keep it interesting. Definitely collectible.",Resident Evil

It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!! It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character. I first thought when I was watching this film that it was going to be an over-the-top gore movie with way to much blood and carnage, not so much as focusing on the main point of the story, but it turned out unimaginably well, for I thought it wasn't going to be that good at all, and the complexity and edgy scenes and screenplay surprised me. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez acted wonderfully in this film and this was a great action\horror movie that I am extremely glad I was able to have seen, and will gladly see over and over again.",Resident Evil

It is truly a different look on the horror genre, in a future like style, where characters, villains and the plot itself act very different. I think that RE is one of those good ol' modern horrors which should be given a chance and for good reason.The plot is not looked upon much, and it is very simple. A virus takes over the world, once a contamination is unleashed by a corrupt corporation. Survivorsw team up to survive. Sure simple enough, with not much ground covered, but what makes RE excellent is the action, the character development, the horrific kills, the technical/futuristic music and the theme of it all.I believe all of that stuff is done quite well and it so happens that it can become quite creepy with the dogs.Although RE isn't an award-winning film, it sure has some intense action and scary scenes to keep the viewer looking at the screen as well as pumping out the blood, gore and entertainment.My Verdict is that it is the best in the series (although I do like the rest so far). 8/10",Resident Evil
196,joestank15,Avoid this.,2,31 March 2005,"Resident Evil - Ugh. When the best thing you can say about a film is it's locations, something is terribly wrong. An underground evil corporation (and that's about ALL that is realistic about RE) named The Unbrella Corporation kills all of it's employees and lets 3 survive along with a Swat team to get mauled by zombies and try and escape. The movie takes an hour (after 2 glorious minutes of actually scary elevator stuff) to do a lot of boring exposition. None of it is terribly well done or intelligently said, as none of the characters are good at acting. And then the zombies show up because of the T-virus, because turning people into mindless killing machines (except they aren't. When off-screen, they ravage an entire city. When on-screen, they can't even walk straight) is SUCH a good strategy. The zombies aren't scary, and you don't care about them, much less the cast. There's Milla Jolovich, who spends half the movie kicking the crap out of zombies, and the other half looking like a stunned cow. There's Michelle Rodriguez, whose most intelligent line is ""Blow me"" and is not only and ice queen, but also can't act to save her soul (I honestly couldn't tell the difference between her as a normie and her as a zombie). The only good part is the Licker and a laser field that dices up some people we couldn't care less about (But couldn't it have done Paul S. Anderson, the maker of this tripe instead?). So the acting sucks. The writing sucks. (The most intelligent word used is implore, and it's said by a computer voice by a British school-girl, so that doesn't count) The directing sucks. What's to like here? This is NOT the game that a generation of Playstation owners loved and cherished.D-",Resident Evil
197,atzimo,Almost as bad as 'Ghosts of Mars',2,30 October 2002,"Let's be honest: 'Resident Evil' is a great idea for a horror flick. Unfortunately Anderson doesn't seem to have what it takes to become the John Carpenter of today, so this movie, more or less, sucks.I didn't expect to see 'Citizen Kane' here, but I was hoping for some crazy action, a lot of shooting, some creepy scenes and good rhythm.
If you don't have script, the action should keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat, but in 'Resident Evil' there is no action. Everything is predictable and boring.The only thing that is great is the last shot of the movie. That's all. Oh and Milla.2/10",Resident Evil
198,RickHarvey,Resident evil,5,16 February 2013,"funnily enough, my interested faded once the zombies arrived. The opening was chaotic, bringing you into the film immediately and the introduction of Alice up too the zombies was interesting. The vibe which the hive generated - a feel of imminent doom inside chrome walls, set up the rest of the film well. Now, it suffered in the character sector. The most important necessity in a horror is a strong group of characters; even more so than the frights themselves. Alice herself is weak and unlikable while the armed forces sent to investigate the hive also lack any charismatic flair. Take Michelle Rodriguez's character for example. Her chronic crumpled face syndrome did nothing but cheer me on for her to die.Resident evil might of been the film to bring the zombies craze to the 21st century, but after watching similar celluloid's such as 'The walking dead' I can only feel obliged to hate on the style in which is used to create a sense of rapid danger for the hordes of zombies. The jagged, blurred style of motion used does nothing but weakens the suspense. I feel that they've failed at creating any fear towards the zombies. Add the awful characters and we're left with the action which is frankly dull. They might as well be shooting at...Well,a bag of bones in all fairness , as the lack of appeal & emotion involvement with the guys down in the hive leaves me wishing that they take there shooting down to the target range.There are some good moments to be watched: the lasers and the dogs.

199,macabro357,Needs more gore!,5,14 May 2003,"Could have been better...  The premise is pretty good but the film cops out by reducing the amount of gore in order to get an R rating.
For instance, the cool scene showing them getting sliced in the hallway by the lasers, was cropped.  I wanted to see big hunks of meat lying on the floor, yet the camera quickly cuts away so we don't get to see much of anything.  I think a scene like that should be graphic since it shows everything else, short of what's being piled up on the floor. 
In Anderson's previous film, EVENT HORIZON, the implication (of gore) worked pretty well but not here, imo.  The result being that the scene looks cut instead of implied because the director shows too much restraint. 
Fear of censorship, Mr. Anderson?  That's understandable since something like that could have qualified for the UK's ""nasties list"", so why not have a director's DVD cut for those who want more gore?  And some of the cgi looks sloppy with the torn up faces of the walking dead looking more animated than real.  I think if they spent more time on it, they could've made it look better.   There's also an ending that looks like something out of the 70s film THE OMEGA MAN which is kinda cool, too.  We don't get to see too many ambiguous things like that anymore. I hope a future director's cut adds some more blood, guts and gore to it because this EVIL is holding back.5 out of 10 for being cropped",Resident Evil
200,vasco_cid,Satisfies the fans; and scares the others.,8,11 September 2002,"As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes, Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled film. As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The Movie should be coming any time now. Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it, which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel 2km underground. When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention, congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies recently. The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success, mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius. Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened end. That doesn't mean anything else than ""sequel next year"". B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying?

Sure, normally it would not be directly based on the games, so they would put something else instead to make it worthwhile to see. But what we get is something a little disappointing. It seems to tell a bit of a sensationalized story instead of the on in the game, and it seems to lack a bit of the horror and fun from the games, at least it still has the T-virus, I'm glad and thankful for that. And there are some STARS in it, and zombies, and dog zombies, and lickers, but it lacks the feel, it doesn't seem all that exciting, more of a generic zombie movie, doesn't even surpass the Dead trilogy. In other word it just doesn't have the spirit of the games. But despite all that, it's good to see it isn't like the other failed movies from video games, like Street Fighter, or Super Mario Bros, or Double Dragon, yuck!

I was very sorry they didn't show more of the mansion, I would have loved to have seen more of it.  It's an amazing property.

206,elcopy,A videogame flick that doesn't stink.,5,14 April 2002,"The fact that the movie is based on a videogame hurt the movie at the box office because it turns off mainstream audiences. But all the stinkers based on videogames, like Street Fighter and Super Mario Brother, or mediocre attempts like Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, had a problem with the translation. Resident Evil in the other hand is a very cinematic videogame, which makes it a natural for a movie translation.Just to say that a couple of things from the videogame would have helped this be a much better movie. Unlike the videogame, the movie environment looks too clean and bright for the horror factor. If you've seen films like ""The Sixth Sense"" you know than an eerie atmosphere makes the movie scarier tenfold. The camera anglesfor the videogame which makes a sense of uneasiness, are very scattered through the movie, and the techno soundtrack, though good in the action scenes, is annoying at some points.The combination of horror, science fiction, and action is not an easy task for any film, which is an effort worth of appreciation for this film.

Along with them are two amnesiacs and some other guy. Once inside, they have a limited time to get out again. Unfortunately, the dead have risen and zombie bashing ensues.You can't expect too much of a film based on a video game, but all the same - Resident Evil feels pretty sloppy. It has got a low budget feel to it, just witness the sparse settings, dodgy effects, and amateur make up. There isn't much in the way of character development either, so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to begin with.There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music. There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good considering that it's a zombie film after all.It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show anything new or even remotely exciting. Milla Jovovich does her best with what little she's given, but she deserved better.

208,Zombified_660,"Boredom, thy name is Resident Evil",5,24 August 2005,"I was originally going to give this a 6, but then realised I reserve that for movies that didn't quite work but never gave up trying. Resident Evil isn't really in that category. Strangely, the movie is slick and well-made, and full of wonderful production design. However, this can't hide the fact that it fails entirely to excite the viewer. A damn shame really considering the game franchise it derives its story from is actually more effectively scary than most horror of recent years.Maybe I was making a mistake, expecting what is effectively a big-budget mainstream flick with a major cast to be tense or scary, god knows most of them aren't, but it was the fact that Resident Evil failed totally to make me even worried for anyone until I fell asleep watching it and a large explosion jolted me out of my kip. You're supposed to care about the main characters in a horror movie and they're supposed to be vulnerable to some extent so that you get the impression they could die, therefore making you fear for their safe escape from the situation. This is where Resident Evil falls flat on it's face. Milla Jovovich's Alice is pretty much unstoppable during the movie, as are the other three or four key characters, who either get saved by Milla all the time or are fully capable of making their own way through events, and this removes all tension from proceedings.What compounds this problem is that Resident Evil commits an awful lot of horror movie faux-pas. There are so many scenes that even during the movie don't stand up to scrutiny. So much of this movie should have been killed at the screen writing phase, but they left it all in. For instance you don't have your characters physically fighting the zombies with their bare hands, not only does it look stupid, it doesn't work as a theory. Yeah zombies are pretty slow, and if you can't find a way of stopping one zombie on it's own or avoiding it, you may need to book into a 'special' school, but if you try to kung-fu fight twenty odd zombies with your bare hands, I don't care if you're Bruce Lee, you're gonna die. While for mainstream movie fans who don't watch a lot of horror this could perhaps look cool, to a horror fan, it looks really stupid and is something we don't want to see. Unless it's in something like Braindead which is supposed to be dumb anyway.Also, going back to the lack of tension, main character Alice is NOT an easy girl to relate to. In a horror movie, you must have someone helming the movie that you can relate to, otherwise as stated before, you don't care whether they live or die. Alice can inexplicably fight like Jackie Chan, a fact that seems wildly implausible. Simply put, if the girl in Freddy vs Jason ran up a wall and kicked Jason round the head sending him flying through a window pane, it would have ruined our impression of her as a normal girl determined to stop the madness around her. It does with Alice but director Anderson doesn't seem to care.Anyway, I think I've maybe gone into a bit too much detail, but the bottom line is that the emphasis in this movie is too heavily on action set pieces and being cool, and not enough on the accepted genre trappings of horror. Sometimes this can work, like in Versus, but Anderson doesn't have the balls, gore or naked intensity to pull it off. If you watched this with no prior knowledge of it's apparent genre or the video game it's based on, you'd probably enjoy it a lot more and maybe even give it a 7 or an 8, but for me the removal of the 'one person, 200 zombies and only a gun between them and certain death' vibe of the game, and the constant shocking ignorance of basic flaws in certain scenes makes it a dull, boring piece of style-over-substance mainstream tosh.",Resident Evil

I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good. When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece. It has guns and blood and horror all the way through and, boy, is it one heck of a awesome ride. The lady in red, Alice(Milla Jovovich), has to be one of the most important characters of all time. I mean without her the movie would seem crap and boring but she made it look good. The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite! When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil. I love this movie and all the sequels and I can't wait for the new one called RE: Afterlife.After waking up, Alice, has no memory of her object due to the exposure of nerve gas. Along the way she joins a squad whose mission is to contain a virus released by the Red Queen, a supercomputer in charge of the release of the T-Virus. They have to fight through zombies and the Red Queens fatal traps in order to complete their mission.The acting is wonderful from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and many more. They know how to use their expressions and body language in the movie. The gore and horror is so stupendous it was one of the reasons this became one of my favorites. From biting people on the body to deadly traps, this movie has it all. The sequels were impressive but could not match the power of RE1.

The way the movie is laid out seem to follow a video game's strategy of conquering room by room, save the flashbacks, which slowly revealed the main characters' purpose.  The different level of laser slicer served no purpose except if you are at the joystick yourself (a mechanism in which these people, who knew the ins and outs of the system, didn't know about.)

Things like that and some of the dumber, repetitive action scenes can get annoying.The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.
Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the game, and it's worthy of a rental. Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with friends. 7/10 -Mark",Resident Evil

The characters have been done before- on the team there's the 1. black guy who dies 2. the smart one who no one believes 3. the one who's been attacked already and has like a virus in them 4. the one who is cool with 2. but dies and 5. the one who no one likes cause the person is a bitch or an asshole.  The laser things that cut people up are cool, and the Red Queen is weird and funny cause she's a little British hologram girl.  It's a typical sci-fi movie, but one of the more fun ones.

216,pinokiyo,Make sure you have a good healthy heart before seeing this movie!,8,17 March 2002,"One of the reason that gave interest for seeing this movie was I myself for playing all the Resident Evil series. And the other was they did a really good job with the trailer which made me want to see it even more. It seemed really cool which it was.I really expected the story to be simple where you too can be brainless like the zombies and still understand what's going on but the storyline is actually thought really well, many scenes shocked me many times, good thing about this movie is you can't really predict what's going to happen next and there are many chilling all of a sudden something popping out every few minutes which keeps you awake and interested at all times.Out of all the game-to-movie adaption, Resident Evil is the best entertaining film, Final Fantasy wasn't too bad but it lacked in similarity with the game and some scenes made me fall asleep and Tomb Raider was just a joke. Resident Evil though, you can watch many times and not get bored. Pure entertainment.I don't think this is much of a spoiler but the ending is similar to the start of Resident Evil 2 the game. Another plus is it uses many ideas from all the Resident Evil series such as the mutated dogs in RE1, the licking creature in RE2. I'm sure it's hard to use ideas from games to a movie which the creators of Final Fantasy didn't do a good job of (where were the chocobo's?!) anyways, even if you haven't played the game at all you MUST see this movie!I think this was a great start to build up to the sequal, if they make a sequal which they must, a lot of people will be craving to see the movie. For you gamers who saw this movie I'm sure the sequal will have Nemesis like in RE3.#1 Game to the big screen movie! Actually the RE1 the game was practically a movie with real people in the game. The game is no doubt one of the best games ever made and this movie is pretty much up there with the horror movies.I would give this film a 7 but Milla Jovovich looked great in this movie! +1Overall Rating: 8/10 Great Entertainment! I never heard so many screams in the theater before, hopefully even more scares and gore in the sequal, hehe.",Resident Evil
217,Snake-666,Nothing special,6,26 June 2003,"Having never played the Resident Evil' video games this was all new to me. Many of my friends have berated this movie for ignoring the storyline of the games, but having never experienced them myself, this was a totally new experience to me.The plot for this movie centres around the headquarters of one of the world's largest companies. After a chemical container is broken and the contents released, the super-computer in charge of the place immediately takes over the facility and locks everybody in. A few hours later a small military force is sent in to try and regain control but unfortunately for them, the computer is not their only concern.In my opinion, Resident Evil' is an average zombie/action movie with a few interesting and exciting moments, but equally as many downfalls. There is an over-abundance of poor and unrealistic CGI throughout the movie which really harms the atmosphere that is trying to be created by director Paul W.S. Anderson. Combining some interesting camera work with some chilling visuals Anderson is able to bring the viewer into the movie; however the viewer is quickly snapped back to reality once one of the unrealistic CGI effects makes an appearance. This is a major floor, for the same price as the CGI the makers could have just as easily bought the materials to make great artificial effects such as those from The Thing' (1984) or Hellraiser' (1987) but alas, in these days of Hollywood big-budget horror, the brilliant effects of yesteryear are being replaced with mediocre CGI effects which can seriously damage a movie.The use of flashback images was also utilised in the movie, and while I feel that some were used to good effect and added some much-needed history to Resident Evil', I have to think that many of the flashbacks were filler used to generate a quick scare, as they were generally accompanied with loud music (as per all Hollywood horror movies).The screenplay also has some major flaws too in my eyes. Milla Jovovich was fairly good (though far from perfect) as Alice in the movie, but her part seemed to be written so ineptly. Considering what events are portrayed that revolve around her in the movie the script doesn't seem to fit the events. I found it hard to believe that she would not be more on edge and questionable, instead she seemed to just take a c'est la vie approach and accept what was going on too easily. I think there was a lot missing from the script that should have been included; a little more character interaction, for instance, would have aided this production in my opinion.The rest of the cast were average at best. I never have been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez's acting abilities. Once again she plays the typical `tough chick' roll that has so far been so predominant in her career, yet she continues to irritate me in this role as she also did in The Fast and the Furious' (2001). I'm not really much for her at all and can see her career fading out pretty fast unless she can break out of the roll she has now been typecast in. Martin Crewes, who I remember from the Sky One UK TV series Dream Team', played the part of Chad Kaplan very well in my opinion. I wasn't previously a fan of him as an actor but out of the actors in Resident Evil' I found his to be the best performance in the movie as he did manage to attract some sympathy for his character and, in my opinion, managed to hold the production together.There were some good and entertaining action scenes in the movie. One scene in the Red Queen's Chamber was particularly exciting and even slightly intense, but these moments of 'Resident Evil' were few and far between which was a shame. Unfortunately the makers seemed to try and highlight the subtexts of the movie rather than the plot in hand which led to a rather poor lack of action and excitement.This film was a little of a let down and is definitely not anything new in the horror genre as it recycles some of the successful elements of Romero's Dead' trilogy and adds a 21st Century perspective. Resident Evil' is somewhat unimaginative and I do believe that more could have been done with the film. Little tension or suspense is eventually built despite the attempts by Anderson to create an atmosphere; in the end the usual loud noise scare tactics of all modern-mainstream horror productions were resorted to and unfortunately damaged what could have been a great movie. It's worth checking out once, though I'm not sure if I will ever personally come back to this movie. My rating for Resident Evil'  6/10",Resident Evil
218,filmbuff1970,Hardly Original,5,22 March 2002,"First off i want to say i didnt hate this movie,It was just an average action horror movie that steals from Aliens,Night of the living dead.but the movie i found it copying the most was Ghosts of Mars.I liked Ghosts of Mars though i admit this was better.The characters in this are less likable.and only the female lead and Tony Todd come close to being memorable.the direction was good.so an entertaining movie that is better than most video game movies.6 out of 10",Resident Evil
219,dudedazzreviews,"Not much to do with the game series and as a zombie flick, not bad at all...",5,12 October 2010,"Quite an entertaining movie but the fans of the game may find it disappointing as this doesn't necessarily stick to the games. In fact, the things that this movie and the games have in common is the T-Virus, zombies, the monsters and Umbrella, not the story. The story wasn't so well-thought but W.S Anderson's twist on the Resident Evil universe works to an extent. While trying to make the movie his own, it felt like it was driving away from the Resident Evil universe and started being its own movie (which isn't really such a bad thing). The music added the tension and added more 'oomph' to the action scenes which fit the movie quite well. 'Resident Evil' didn't exactly have you waiting for more but at the same time, it didn't make you turn it off. There were two or three scenes that were kind of boring and pointless but other scenes were well-executed.One thing I couldn't really fault was the acting for some of the actors. Milla Jovovich being the star of the movie and Michelle Rodriguez following close-second were brilliant. Their on-screen 'friendship' made it entertaining to watch and also the scenes between Milla Jovovich as Alice and Eric Mabius as Matt was also good. I couldn't say much for the others like Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes who were just average. The special effects and make-up in the movie were done brilliantly and added such a dark and cold tone. The design of the monsters were done well as were the make-up for the zombies.The movie ended quite well and wasn't exactly predictable like some of the scenes in the movie was. The ending wasn't exactly so shocking that you would remember it but for a movie that was above average, it ended well and it felt like it went smoothly with the movie.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Resident Evil
220,mrskywalker,Way Over Rated,3,31 March 2002,"This film starts good.  It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense.  Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early.  There is some suspense and some strong music.  Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful.  This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick.  Even Milla is a little over rated.  She is not that pretty with a weird nose.  She has very little personality either.  And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars.  I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality.  But the ""I want to kiss you bit.."" line is stupid.  I much preferred John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film.  Resident Evil is just more depressing than it needs to be.",Resident Evil
221,GuyCC,Solid Film Interpretation Of The Video Game.,8,28 March 2002,"Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film.  I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns.  Fortunately, after seeing the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to pass.This film now resides in my ""Top 3"" (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being the other two) of video game based films.  And this is how the film should be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and story set-up.  The film starts out slow, offering background information on the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle.  The scenes (especially the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game.  Again, for this type of film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of mind.  Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense, especially with scenes from some of the game's more ""popular"" enemies.For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected.  It does have its fair share of ""gross"" moments, but succeeds more in some good old fashioned jumps and false ""gotcha"" scares scattered throughout the film. What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes of nudity in it.  Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast music.  What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming to the audience ""Hey, this prop is also from the game!  This scene is just like the game!  We included everything whether it needed to be there or not just to keep RE fans happy!""  While I'm sure some people would have delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with plenty of references if they look hard enough.  The feel of the game was captured without going overboard.Granted, some people have likened the film to ""Aliens"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"", but that's something of a moot point.  Yes, there are similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension for the game.  Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes things come full circle.  The film is meant to capture the feel of the game and provide some entertainment while it's at it.  In that regard, it succeeds in what it sets out to do.So is it worth it?  If you enjoy the games, then yes.  It's fun, it's got its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent ""closure"" for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD.  I have a feeling that some scenes were cut out of this.  Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition to my DVD collection.",Resident Evil
222,emfern13,Awesome,10,22 August 2002,Resident Evil is awesome. It is the best adaption of a video game to a movie. It is better than Tomb Raider. It doesn't have as many visual effects but it is still better. Milla Jovovich and Angie are really good action heroes but i think Milla is just a little better because she is a newer character. The script for RE is a little better than Tomb Raiders but neither one of them is very good. Resident Evil is an awesome well thoughtout movie.,Resident Evil
223,boondocksaint20,A pleasant surprise!,9,11 August 2002,"Yeah, I've read the other reviews and I agree...Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Street Fighter...any movie that is based on a video game has killed itself before it's even been released.  I am a big fan of the RE games, but honestly was not too thrilled to see this when it came out in theaters b\c of the above facts.  To me, there was no way that anyone could come close to translating that game into a good movie.  So, when this hit the video stores, it was 'the hot' dvd for the time being, so I indulged myself and bought it for the heck of it.  Man, was I pleasantly surprised!First off, I agree with 99% of the other negative reviews on what was negative about this movie...wooden characters, little to no character development, cheesy CGI at the end, etc.  But despite these annoyances, I couldn't help but admire this movie.  I mean, this movie defines how atmosphere should play a huge role in any movie.  The Hive is filmed as a dark and spooky place, grim and bleak from the sudden loss of life of the Umbrella employees.  Paul Anderson once again, like in Event Horizon, concentrated all of his efforts on atmosphere and direction and it shows. Like the story, this movie really makes everything feel like a dream, like you've just woken up from a strange dream into a weird type of Alice in Wonderland nightmare.  Marilyn Manson did an excellent job with the score, it is appropriately creepy and gives a feeling of both naivety and desperation.As for scares, there are a few, but the surprises far outweigh the frights which is actually good in this case.  I liked how everything was going on in the beginning and you really don't know what's going on until 30 minutes into it, and Milla Jovovich finally asks what we're all wanting to know. This is just not a conventional action/horror flick at all.  It offers a big factor of unpredictability, and not just cheap plot twists that make no sense, but instead, real human reactions if this were really to happen in real life.  Though the characters were underdeveloped, their expressions fit their roles.  Milla looks incredibly hot, especially at the beginning and the end.  She always has this innocent look on her face like she knows something noone else does that totally goes with the movie.  Michelle Rodriguez, though cliched (I think this badass woman thing started with James Cameron's masterpiece, Aliens) really convinced me that her character, Rain, was truly a take no prisoners, show no fear, take no crap soldier especially when she's fighting.  Both women make the movie, period.  The others, well, are just there as zombie fodder, though a lot of the deaths were totally unexpected (not so much who would survive, but when said people would buy the farm).  With this in mind though, I will agree with some other reviewers that there weren't enough zombie deaths, nor gunfights (if you think about it, these commandos really did not bring very much ammunition, nor did they think about picking up their fallen camarades' gear) for a zombie flick, but like I said earlier, this one is very untraditional.This movie really stays true to the game, which is as unpredictable as they come.  Anderson even pays homeage to it by using some of the same camera angles (die hard fans will love them).  And the scene with the attack dogs was refreshing since it was done without CGI.  The direction is solid. Enough said.All in all this is a good movie.  It has a great beginning (that will give you chills down your spine) that literally keeps you glued to the screen, and a slightly weaker second half that delivers as well.   Milla and the atmosphere alone are worth the price of viewing.  This is one of the better horror films to come out in the last ten years.  I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.",Resident Evil
224,walken_on_sunshine,Not A Good Adaptation But A Fun Movie,5,26 May 2007,"Resident Evil follows a team of commando's investigating an underground biolab after a reported incident occurs inside of it.The incident is more severe then any of them suspected as the former employees are dead but they are still walking around and they are hungry.Seeing as Resident Evil was originally a groundbreaking horror game you'd think this film adaptation would be a mirror image of it however this movie only has elements of the game in it spread out through various visual effects, lighting, and set design everything else is completely different.Director Paul WS Anderson (Mortal Kombat,AVP) intended this movie to be a prequel to the game and show how and why the viral infection escaped however many did not know this and immediately hated it because the storyline and characters in the movie were never in the game.The elements of this movie are a mixed bag.The acting is very good especially Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy but Michelle Rodriguez gives her one trick pony tough girl act again.The script is at times suspenseful and at times god awful mostly coming from poor dialogue and badly delivered one liners.Visually the film is gritty and very grainy with a very cold colour temperature which creates suspense but looks at times boring and unappealing.The music in the movie is also mixed sometimes it's absolutely perfect others it's loud and overbearing however the main score is an absolute masterpiece thank you Marilyn Manson.The action is raw and hardcore, the gun brawls are great but the hand to hand is weak and cheesy especially when it's Milla vs the zombie dogs.The special effects are pretty good but at times far too unrealistic and far too fake looking for example some of the gore and CGI effects(the licker is obviously CGI).This is probably Paul WS Andersons best film it's not perfect, it's not brutal but gamers probably won't like it too much.The film is mildly entertaining but the lack of special effects and good hand to hand choreography you generally see in an Anderson film (Mortal Kombat,Soldier) are missing in the otherwise fun film.The trailer isn't misleading if you've seen it you know what you're getting into n action/horror that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously.",Resident Evil
225,jake-179,Great Zombie movie,7,17 March 2002,"This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end.  There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really ""wow"" audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.  The plot outline is pretty simple:  A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever.  The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me.  In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done ""B"" horror flick.  If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's.  Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. 
If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie.  It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.",Resident Evil

which was surprising because at the time I wasn't sure about it, since it was
a horror movie, I stayed away from them a lot as a little kid.
The suspense is quite creepy but not too creepy because it's also an action
movie blended in to one, however this first installment is more suspense with
good jump scares and small action scenes.
The pace is fast and the movie is kinda edgy in music and action sequences,
I've seen the remake of the original game which my one buddy owns on Game Cube, it's good but also really creepy and I like that the movie captured that essence.
Alice played by MIlla Jovovich is the heroine of the film, who has amnesia,
as we met her she comes to the shower, which looks like she hit her head,
she is oblivious to things as the audience is, we lean what's going on as she
does. Which I feel is fresh for as zombie movie.The movie is 100 minutes but fairly fast paced and has an engaging story,
so you met characters as the movie goes. Alice is joined by special forces-like
operatives that inform her and a couple other characters about what's
going on.
Video game purists will not like this movie but casual audiences will probubly
enjoy it, it's made to be popcorn fun that's all, it should not be looked at as
anything else but a fun movie however haters will hate so each there own I
guess.Overall I enjoy the film to this day, for me it's a guilty pleasure.
I give it a 7/10. If you want a fun but suspenseful action film
with fun action scenes and great scares look no further.

So what made them think they could get away with Night of the Living Dead? This crap was okay in 1965 when it was done the first time and not so bad with the various George Romero remakes and sequels but all this is is a bigger budget B flick. Utterly predictable and full of ""startle scare"" scenes. This is the other side of 13 Ghosts but with a plausible(for the genre)idea and lousy monsters - ""more brains!"".

232,Ripe Peach,Does exactly what it says on the tin,10,7 June 2002,"Resident Evil is pretty much a montage of scene from previous films in the zombie / trapped with a monster genre, with dashes of Tomb Raider and Cube thrown in when they run out of ideas.This is filmmaking by the numbers.  Everything you'd expect to see is there, and nothing that you wouldn't.  There are no outstanding scenes, either good or bad, no surprises, no moments of unexpected creativity.  The script, dialog, cinematography, audio, score, pacing and FX are all absolutely adequate.  How much you will enjoy this film is entirely predictable based on your response to the premise ""Hot chick wasting zombies"".  If you think ""Cool!"" you'll enjoy this film.  If you think ""Lame"" then you won't.  It's as simple as that.The one scene worthy of mention is the ending, which might as well be captioned ""To be continued..."".  I strongly suspect that it was written (perhaps filmed) before the rest of the movie, because it is such a disjoint from the preceeding scenes.On balance, I'd rate this on the low end of the cinematic pecking order, but still above such recent adaptations as the tedious Fellowship of the Ring, or the irritating Spider-Man, both of which are annoyingly pretentious and self important.  Resident Evil sets its sights lower, gets all of its budget on screen, and doesn't promise more than it can deliver.

The visuals and score are better than the game, but the plot, dialogue, composition, lighting and camerawork are worse.It's just occurred to me that a couple of generations of console or PC down the line, when game visuals reach cinematic realism and we can have proper virtual hotties, then there will be absolutely no reason why game developers should put in any more work than filmmakers.Enjoy your quality 20+ hour games while you can, because the line between game and film is getting narrower.  When they reach 1:1 comparison, games will last (pro rata) approximately 4.5 hours, or they'll be sold as 1.5 hour ""episodes"" for the same price as a DVD.Shudder.

234,SILENCEikillyou,If the horror and gore isn't enough... Milla Jojovich,8,9 August 2002,"This movie has it all; if you like flesh-eating zombies, horror, guns, secrets -characters with amnesia and stuff, powerful monsters, and/or the game; you're gonna love this one.  I did!  But if all that I just mentioned isn't enough, see it for the performance of Milla Jojovich, alone.  As you may have guessed I'm a fan.  I've not necessarily liked all the movies she was in, but her performances are everything I look for in a great female character.  Pretty and pretty strange!!  I don't know, she just always makes the movie, for me.This movie had more than that, though.  Great graphics and plot.  Cool characters and acting.  Eerie atmosphere without too much dream-like strangeness.  It had just the right mixture of everything.8/10 - I've seen better; but not much.thank you",Resident Evil
235,dineshaishu,Resident evil,8,29 July 2019,"This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane.It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.",Resident Evil
236,tenten76,best..zombie..movie..ever..,9,25 July 2002,"I do have one criticism - I have (as far as I know) perfect hearing, so I don't appreciate having my eardrums ripped to shreds by what is easily the loudest film I've ever seen.  Even though I was in an empty cinema (matinees are so cool), the dialogue was at the right volume so there was no reason (other than for cheap scares) to whack the volume up to maximum and make me jump out of my seat every two minutes.On with the praise -The film is pacey, and keeps to a pretty simple but effective plot - very similar (I believe) to the videogame.  A great opening shows what went wrong, and then we're into the action.  There's a clever plot device (oh alright, it's a map), which I thought really worked well to branch the gap between the feel of a computer-game and a film.The actors are unfamiliar-enough that they don't detract, and Milla does a great job as the heroine.  There's a neat little rip-off of a scene from Cube (which is a great film too), and the zombies are really really good.I saw a behind-the-scenes preview with Paul Anderson at a film festival last year, where he explained how much effort went into making the zombies and special effects believable, and I think they did a fantastic job.  I know this will be sacriligeous to some, but I find Romero's stuff way too OTT. Previously, zombies have only really worked in a comedy sense - Braindead, Evil Dead, the Thriller video etc. so it's nice to see them done convincingly.  The dogs look great too.  The Licker looked good, but could have had a bigger role (it reminded me of the monster from The Relic, only naked), but the way they get rid if it made me laugh.Other good things - Milla Jovovich looks fantastic all the way through, and does a pretty good job too.  Michelle Rodriguez seems to be enjoying herself, even if her lines are a bit too Sanchez (from Aliens).  The ending was excellent - really sets you up for a sequel, without feeling short-changed.Apart from turning the volume up to 11 to scare me, my only other whinge would be that one of the squad characters (the whiney one) utters the ""we're all gonna die"" line - but I did appreciate the way lots of other cliched moments were neatly sidestepped.If you want to see a very attractive woman kill convincing zombies in an entertaining and vaguely futuristic action/horror movie, go see it.",Resident Evil

239,bullions27,Quite possibly one of the worst trash,1,15 March 2002,"... to ever be exposed to celluloid.SOME SPOILERSResident Evil follows the cliché and the stereotype right smack-in-your-face down to the letter. Excusing the fact that this is yet again another blatant Aliens hack, what we have here is one tough chick with a questionable past leading a bunch of commandos (except her reason was never explained clearly) into ground zero of monster-infested territory. All sound familiar?Paul Anderson shows once again what he does best and that is try to rip off past successful horror-action flicks with high budget slick special effects and show absolute no regard to continuity or a plot that makes sense. Good God the amount of crap that was displayed on the screen. We have plenty of cannon-fodder here who wander off for no apparent reason (other then being plain stupid) to be chomped on by zombies that appear out of the blue (and disappear just as quickly) or diced up by slick special effect laser beams! This happens way too often by the way. We have also the, err, undead themselves that seem impervious to close range 9mm rounds, but yet some skinny supermodel actress knocks them out with martial arts? Speaking of undead, the story itself how they were created is pretty hilarious. It's not really the virus as some of veteran gamers of the series believe. It's really this evil machine that went HAL9000 on its or hers or whatever folks. Funny stuff!To add to the camp factor, we also get to have a sex scene. Simply can't do a movie of this caliber without one. All in all, Resident Evil might seem good if you're into the mindless mayhem with bad acting and crayon written scripts like the godawful monster flicks from the Sci-Fi Channel. Otherwise, skip this crap and go for mindless mayhem with real style like Blade 2.Score: 1 out of 10.",Resident Evil
240,bullions27,Mind-boggling stupidity,1,25 October 2002,"SPOILERS... After a year since I last saw this mockery of film-making, I figured maybe a second-viewing would help me tolerate this film. That had to be the second biggest mistake of my life next to agreeing to go see Wing Commander. The mistakes and flaws in the film were made that much more obvious with a second-viewing I nearly had to gouge my eyes out in spite of its sheer medicority and utter ridiculousness.I tried to like this film... it was, after all, based on the cheesy video game from Japan that had some pretty good moments. I guess it was too much of a task to have both actors and a script in a movie even though Anderson has made some horrible films with some decent acting (Event Horizon) or cheesy acting with a pretty good film (Mortal Kombat). Resident Evil has neither. The plot is generic, and serves only as an excuse to develop a senseless sequel, have Milla pose half-nude (to appease the RE fans I figure) and have plenty of zombies go ballistic. With some stretch of the imagination this COULD be tolerable and FUN but there are two very glaring mistakes in the film that stand out like a leper in a crowd:1) Their choice of Actors - Cheesy, screwed up action films have only 2 saviors, excellent action sequences (to some degree), and at least average acting. Brotherhood of the Wolf, as ridiculous of a story as it was, had very decent acting and incredibly well-done sequences and cinematography. Resident Evil, with its silly storyline, had characters with the uncanny power to read their lines off script cards. Impressive. Can they act that horribly, or did they put effort into it? The leader of this ragtag bunch of soldiers was pretty cool. He could deliver all of his lines in monotone and display one facial expression. Needless to say, he was killed off quick. In fact, nearly all of the useless soldiers were killed off quickly (just like John Carpenter's Vampires) which I guess was a plus for Anderson. Michelle Rodriguez, playing in vain as the Vasquez-hack of Aliens (more about this later), tops him by emoting one emotion along with her delivery of lines in monotone. Sad, she was wasted in this film. A myriad of other characters share this same profile, including the dear Milla who can kill zombies with martial arts even though an entire clip of a MP5 will do nothing. By the way, why was she trained to do this? She could kick some serious behind for no explicable reason yet her partner/husband (this was never explained either) had none of the training? I assume all of this was discarded to ensure the people will return for the explanation in the sequel. At the other end of the spectrum, we also have Eric Mabius, who could display two emotions... slightly confused, and very confused. You know I've read the early drafts to this heinous monstrosity and he annoyingly keeps adding about how the suspense of this movie will freak you. Sorry, buddy, your whole crew of actors actually made us laugh more.2) Hacking other movies - I can point out at least a half dozen different scenes where Anderson (who loves to recycle other people's work) pulls from Aliens. These aren't subtle attempts, or clever renditions. I'm assuming his thought process was like this:Anderson: Wow, I just thought up of a cool and gruesome way to kill off all of my useless actors! What can I do to make it ""suspenseful"" and filled with ""tension"".Anderson's Brain: How about watching the movie Aliens and copy the scene where the marines were attacked for the first time?Anderson: Good idea! Let's see, I'll take the Hive, the Queen, and even the Aliens popping out of nowhere and snatching people. I could even recycle the lines without changing them! I am a GENIUS!Pretty pathetic, and I'm not even going to bother pointing out the stupidity of some of the plot elements or the other movies it borrows heavily from (like Odyssey). By the way, if this T-Virus was so powerful we are led to believe, why does it take a millennia for it to take effect on a live person? All in all, I couldn't find a single shred of entertainment in this. Why would I? If you took a recipe for Chicken with sauce diable and you thought it'd be neat to recycle it and throw in tang and peanut butter, it's not going to taste any good.3/10",Resident Evil
241,nathanjamesemerson,Not the most faithful adaption but ok,7,23 September 2018,"As a massive fan of the Resident Evil games, I was excited as all hell for the movie.I went to the premiere and left feeling somewhat disappointed. I did enjoy the movie but it did not feel like it was Resident Evil. More like a sci fi horror film with some nods to the game.I knew already it wasn't gonna be the most faithful adaption going in to it, but at least add some of what made the game famous. And the stuff they did add, such as the dogs and licker was well done. The zombie 's were pretty good but they were not terrifying at all. The build up until you see the first zombie was really well done.The soundtrack was very good and I enjoyed that tremendously. Milla Jovovich was pretty good as Alice. I just wish they made it somewhat more faithful to the game. It would not have been too hard to adapt the first game into a movie. It would have been more terrifying then what we got",Resident Evil
242,ks4,"Action packed and interesting, but far from scary.",7,2 May 2004,"Resident EvilA deadly virus escapes in a top secret research facility based underground, a team of top trained soldiers/agents are send to find out what happened down there.In the latter years it has become very popular to make movies out of popular computer games, and they often fail for some reason, i think maybe it's because there is a big difference from experiencing the story from computer games through movies, movies tells you a story, in games you act yourself as the investigator. However, this movie has a very interesting and much of the way pretty original and unpredictable storyline, even though it is probably stolen from the game, i never played the game, so i can not tell.
In the start i found the movie very confusing i must admit, not much made sense, but as the movie discovers most of the question marks are explained, although i am still wondering about a few things, but they are not so much related to the question marks, they are most related to the realism of the story. But i guess this is okay for a fantasy movie. Without giving too much spoilers one of the things i don't understand is why a team of soldiers are send into a research facility without wearing any kind of protection, couldn't it be possible there would be something in the air? Also if the AI protecting the Hive is still online, why can't they reach it that way and find the answers that way? Rather than sending a team down to discover the secret. However, if you look away from all these small flaws, the movie is actually very entertaining and driven, it is a very interesting story, though it has a lot more potential than used, but using the full potential might also remove much of the action. But maybe i am just one that prefers a deep storyline, especially about something that i find as interesting as this, i'd like a deeper look on the whole idea.But there is never any doubt, this movie wants the action part in focus, and that it does well, this is far from a horror movie, and it's not spooky or scary at all, it's a driven action movie with a lot effects, but that is entertaining enough, just don't go into the movie expecting pure horror.Paul Anderson has been put in charge of Alien Vs. Predator too, and if he can produce an interesting action movie like this one, then i am looking very much forward to it, because he has done an okay job to combine the storyline with the amount of action that is expected from his side, my personal preferences hopes for a deeper storyline in Resident Evil: Nemesis though.The acting is okay, there are many main characters, and we never learn much about either of them, only 3 persons we get background information on. Generally because they each have their own reasons to be there, none of them really shines through though, except one. I think Milla Jovovich has proven to the world now that she has quite some talent, which is good, this movie is very action driven and doesn't put her acting much in focus, but i'm looking forward to seeing her in the future, because i think she has her moments in this movie.To sum it all up a bit i found this movie rather good, it has some flaws which puts it down a little, but generally it's a good driven action movie that is worth watching if you're into this kind of movies. It's not a horror movie, so don't expect that, expect a solid action movie wrapped within an interesting storyline and you will be happy.7/10",Resident Evil
243,LBytes,It's got a beat you can dance to,7,31 August 2003,"The soundtrack is the most attractive element of the movie. It fits the screenplay very well. Jovovich is easy on the eyes and she has an expressive face that keeps you interested in her. The rest of the cast is fair to good; no crummy acting at least. Some settings are appropriately creepy. It does run down into a 'kill all zombies' movie, the plot could've used a few more minutes developing the mostly fictional science, and there were some lack of continuity in the scene transitions. Still Resident Evil worth watching if you don't mind blood and guts. I learned, for instance, never to stick my head out of a stuck elevator. I'd give it a 7.5 here at IMDb if I could but I can't quite go to an 8 so it is a 7/10.",Resident Evil

245,SwingBatta,Resident Dreadful: Appalling video game film as vivacious as a rabbit punch,1,21 March 2002,"Almost a year ago, I compared the two video-game movies ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Final Fantasy"" to Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, respectively, because ""Raider"" had annihilated ""Fantasy"" in the summer box office race.Now the latest to step between the ropes is ""Resident Evil,"" also based on a popular game series, and it's easily the Mike Tyson of this genre. You're probably thinking, why? Is it a heavy hitter that boasts a knockout punch? A movie that mows down everything in its path and leaves the audience awed and asking for more? Not even close. Simply put, it's because it bites.What's wrong with this film can be summed up in one word. Everything. ""Resident Evil"" is a painful, slow-moving exercise in sheer torment for every single one of its 100 minutes. Never before have I groaned in agony, buried my face in my hands and shook my head in disbelief so often in a single movie. ""Evil"" is so horrible, it should be used by police as a confession extractor. There is not one redeeming quality to be found whatsoever.Is it frightening at all? Yes, it will be for those who go into this dreck expecting menial details like a decent story and acting.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (not Paul Thomas Anderson of ""Magnolia"" fame), spun straw into gold with ""Mortal Kombat,"" but doesn't make lightning strike twice as he again eschews a competent script in favor of flashy visuals. In this case, it's gunfire, zombies, short dresses, speech-drowning music, poorly developed characters, bad editing, plus more gunfire and more zombies. ""Evil's"" lethargically-paced wreck of a plot is composed of long sequences showing people skulking through quiet, deserted locations, looking alarmed at every little sound, before unleashing loads of ammunition. Then the process is repeated minutes later.""Evil"" opens with an explanation of how scientists and workers at an underground laboratory called ""The Hive"" are suddenly exposed to deadly chemicals that look like neon mattress springs. This biological disaster has transformed everyone into  surprise!  flesh-eating zombies. (What were you expecting, the Rockettes?) Responsible for this havoc is the Hive's supercomputer, dubbed the ""Red Queen,"" who sounds like a high-pitched HAL and is represented visually as a small holographic girl. Don't ask.Enter Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac since collapsing unconscious in her shower. After changing into a Sturgis chic outfit of a very short red dress and very tall black boots, she spends an eternity investigating a huge mansion before abruptly being captured by a team of soldiers and taken to the Hive, where she's joined by another hostage, Matt (Eric Mabius), plus old flame Spence (James Purefoy) and tough-chick cop Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). As if you couldn't guess already, they combine forces to investigate the Hive and fight off the unimposing zombies, whose extent of a makeup job looks nothing more than having their faces covered in flour with a blood capsule to chew on. (They can also survive as much as five gunshots, yet are instantly dispatched by the undersized fists and feet of the female leads.)The pasty-faced automatons express more excitement than the actors who sleepwalk through their equally lifeless roles. Purefoy is the lone player who isn't a total laughingstock. Mabius is gifted with lines like ""She's right...we're gonna die here,"" in between repeatedly shouting the F-word for no reason. As usual, Rodriguez simply overexerts herself: ""After this...I'm gonna go get laid."" Her face is again frozen in her trademark head-down, eyes-up sneer. (Does her head slope downward because her protruding lower lip adds extra weight to it?) Entertainment Weekly recently stated that Jovovich ""could be a knife collection away from becoming the next Angelina Jolie."" It seems they forgot a few things: marketability, athleticism, and charisma. Little details like that. Jovovich doesn't yet have the star power to successfully carry a movie on her own. She sees only a mere thread of action in the whole film, including the much-publicized and dopey sequence in which she battles Dobermans who look like they've been doused in spaghetti sauce. She is stone-faced in a majority of her scenes, and lacks vitality in any physical activity such as firing a gun or fighting off the zombies. When she does emote, it's in a silly moment where she pleads with a wounded soldier who insists on being left behind. Anderson tries to hide the lack of depth in the script by constantly putting characters in compromising positions in order to utilize the ever-predictable jump-scare tactic. They're always reaching a hand out conveniently close to something that, in turn, you know will suddenly grab them. Plot expositions suddenly pop out of the blue, courtesy of cumbersome flashback sequences as Alice gradually regains her memory. Considering its intense buildup, the monster known as ""The Licker"" has no impact on the film at all. And on a local note, what was up with the San Francisco backdrop if the film takes place in (fictitious) Raccoon City?The worst part of ""Evil"" is courtesy of editor Alexander Berner. After a despondent scene where Alice and Spence hover pensively over the body of a main character's relative for several minutes in an empty office, the very next shot is a jump cut of them frantically running for their lives in a totally different location before pushing through a door and slamming it shut. I sat aghast as I wondered how the director could be so blind to allow such an ugly transition to get into the final print. Capping off this unabashed embarrassment is a miserable ending so obvious in touting  God help us  a sequel, that it might as well have been announced in huge letters on the screen. Listen up. There is an outstanding movie called ""Tomb Raider."" Buy it. It has a plot. It has a script. It has exhilarating characters. It has a brain. It was the best film of 2001. And it is more than light years ahead of this apathetic mess. To call ""Resident Evil"" a better film in any regard is sacrilegious. It's like saying the Cowsills are a better rock group than the Beatles. Keep your distance unless you are willing to sit and be tortured into submission for an hour and a half. I have spoken and you have been warned. 1/10",Resident Evil

This movie, like every video game saved game, is very subjective. Is a one man vision, so this is a vision that few people will join, or few people will understand. The ones who played the video game will miss the fear of the environment into that creepy and scary house, changed for the underground laboratory, that is not very scary. There is no Tyrant, but we have a nice mutating licker that dies in a super silly way, like one of the Fallas in the typical Spanish celebration. Well, let's just say that Resident Evil is a very subjective adaptation of that famous cult-indie video game, that changes the creepy house for the weird wacky scientist laboratory. At least we have the Dobermans, Milla Jovovich kicking asses (and heads) and the PWS Anderson Direction. What do we have in the other hand?

But let's face it: nothing in this sub-genre has ever topped ""Alien"" (except ""Aliens"") so why bother?  Especially when the filmmakers aren't even inspired enough to come up with a new climax or even a new twist  ""There's a traitor among us!  Surprise!"".  Director Paul Anderson's dark and broody ""Event Horizon"" was legitimately terrifying in places (and a serious improvement on ""Mortal Kombat""), but with its red and silver color palette and thumpin' soundtrack, his ""Resident Evil"" plays more like an overlong commercial for Pepsi Max.  Amongst the cast, James Purefoy and Milla Jovovich stand out  especially Jovovich who overcomes the impediment of a ludicrous costume to at least be convincing.  And Eric Mabius gives a superb audition for the title role in ""Max Payne""  with that body, voice and haircut, the guy is a digital sprite... which is no bad thing, if this film foreshadows the future of cinema.",Resident Evil

But, the last movie Paul made was 1998's flop ""Soldier"" (which was also good).  Even his 1997's ""Event Horizon was also good.  Not only that, he also wrote and co-produced the movie.

253,graestella,Agh Kill Me Now................................,1,26 May 2005,"I expected a slick American CGI explosion fest from this. The Film 4 logo on the opening credits was a bit of a give away. What we got was a cheapo British film with limited special effects and crap sets. The only special effects that were tagged onto this prosaic exploration of concrete tunnels and an office building were the laser slice up session, the CGI Alien creature rip off, the unexplained red dogs ( some which seemed to be a real dog covered in paint )a few slow motion bullets a la Band of Brothers and the Matrix and the hologram of the little girl. The rest was low budget British TV movie fare of the lowest order. Very basic zombies. i.e paint ordinary blokes in white paint, and add a bit off blood. Then the script. Where do you begin ? Basically take Aliens Space Marines and replace them with clichéd SAS types straight out of Ultimate Force. Don't even change the Hispanic girl Marine from Aliens, keep her in. Chuck in some Bourne Identity amnesia for the two central characters. This helps when they look bored and confused and disclaim their lines as if wishing they were somewhere else. Add some water. Hey it worked in the Abyss ! Then when the rushes still seem boring, throw in two nearly nude scenes of Mila for the teenage pervs to salivate over. If they'd had the bottle to make them fully nude it might have been worth the wait. But like everything else in this shoddy film they were half hearted.",Resident Evil
254,badfeelinganger,"It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick.",8,11 October 2014,"It is to writer/director Paul Anderson's credit that he retains the tension throughout. I don't quite understand why this thing received such crappy reviews when it was released five years ago as I found 'Resident Evil' to be real creepy fun entertainment. I am aware that director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't get a hell of a lot of love out there and is the brunt of many a scornful comment but with RE (that's what those of us in know call it) he has crafted a true zombie horror film that has an eerie ominous feel throughout, some legitimate jump out of your seat moments, plenty of blood and gore for those who like that kind thing and of course Milla is jumping around, scaling walls and kicking much zombie ass.Resident Evil may be empty, but it is still a lot of fun. It avoids being a tired sub-genre film by being so many sub-genres at once. It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick. And more than any of those, it's an adventure movie. What's surprising is that they are all done right. The pacing is nearly perfect, keeping things always moving, but never too fast to miss plot points or character development. The music keeps the tension high. The fights are exciting. And I found myself caring about Alice. It doesn't hurt that she's played by Milla Jovovich who looks stunning and moves like a cat. But then, the entire film looks good. It's worth watching once just to study the colours. No one will be discussing philosophy after watching Resident Evil, but sometimes, that's OK. You will be entertained.Followed by Resident Evil: Apocalypse.",Resident Evil
255,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,10,27 August 2013,"For those of you that played the video game of Resident Evil I am sure you had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, like I said, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to ""blow her"", hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.",Resident Evil
256,Junker-2,From Dusk Till The Ghosts of Mars,5,22 September 2002,"""Resident Evil"" follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent movies: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""The Ghosts of Mars."" All three start with an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored halfway through and said ""Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies.""  (Or vampires. Or whatever.)I don't mean to suggest that ""Resident Evil"" is terrible. It's okay. But the frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been so much more.In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret, underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of the situation.And then...! And then...! Zombies!Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay, her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained, but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick throughout. But her constant ""I'm tough, get out of my way"" routine gets old quickly.In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie. This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad guy.Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.",Resident Evil
257,allstarrunner,Pretty Solid,7,10 July 2018,"I remembered seeing this movie back in the theater, and hadn't watched it since so I thought I would watch it again since I wanted to watch all the RE movies and hadn't seen the last few (or any after the second one). 
The movie holds up surprisingly well after all these years - I mean the overall tone of the movie is clearly dated - it *feels* like a late 90's movie - not that that is bad per se. The acting is mediocre, but I never really care too much about that anyway. I just rate stuff on if I am entertained or not and I can say that I was indeed with this movie. It also helps that it is about 90 minutes. I don't think this style of movie could go on for much more than that - the jarring soundtrack I think would get a little too over the top if I had to keep hearing it for another 30 minutes. 
Overall the movie still hold up and is entertaining all these years later. Still worth a watch.",Resident Evil
258,Zod-2,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,4 October 2002,"I was generally surprised that I liked this movie, not being a fan of either of it's stars.  I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.",Resident Evil
259,JohnLennon1985,Best Game-to-Screen Adaptation EVER.,10,25 September 2002,"When we think about movies that are based on video games, we think of watchable movies like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat (and MK Annihilation). We think about good movies (but horrible adaptations) like Final Fantasy. Most of all, we think about the crappiest movies to ever hit the big screen such as Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, and Street Fighter. This explains why none of us expect Resident Evil to do justice to the game. How wrong we were.The adaptation was incredible. They don't use any of the characters from the game, but the story remains the same, basically. Milla Jovovich, the Fifth Element babe, teams up with the Fast and the Furious' Michelle Rodriguez as they try to escape an underground facility that's infested with zombies. I'm happy to say that the name of the corporation responsible is STILL Umbrella.The zombies were VERY well done, as were the dogs and lickers(?). The acting was also very good. The movie changed a lot of things, but I respect the fact that it kept the video game's story without filming the video game. That's a very hard thing to do.In short, don't ignore this movie for fear that it won't do the video game justice. It is one of the few game-to-screen adaptations that do.",Resident Evil
260,mkivtt,too much of a videoclip,6,27 April 2002,"This movie had quite some promises in my book, but alas it failed to deliver. **SPOILERS**Horror movies, even bloody action movies, are a rare find these days. Those that do come out are low budget direct-to-video releases and the cinemas are dominated by standard Hollywood fare.Therefor I was excited to hear that a zombie flick was about to hit the movies, but my excitement was short lived.In the first action scene, the music so dominates the picture that I was wondering whether this was a movie, or a videoclip. Sadly enough, this goes on for the entire movie. Whatever happened to atmospheric music that subtly accompanied the picture, the kind where you only realize its importance when you turn it off? Instead of this, we are pleasured with loud rock and rap music.The movie itself could have been much better too. The story is rather flimsy to say the least. (spoiler alert) Most all of the rescue squad dies in the first trap, so there is nobody left to become zombie food. The zombies are slow and drudging, and there is little to be feared from them. Yawn, boring. No excitement, no danger, no threatening monsters. Just slow, walking dead.

261,HunterDK,If you don't like the Matrix you'll hate this,3,24 July 2002,"""Resident Evil"" is one of the worst new movies I've watched this year.
I got to admit that I'm not a big fan of ""the Matrix"", I don't like the story and I don't like the special effects with slow motion and people running on the walls.The story in ""Resident Evil"" is a bit similar with computers taking control, and the special effects have also been used. One of them is the bullet being fired in slow motion - we have seen it before, and don't want to see it ever again.I also think that the director has been inspired by ""Aliens"", which is a much better movie than ""Resident Evil"". ""Aliens"" is a much more scary movie than this poor movie, and you don't know when the situations will occur. While watching ""Resident Evil"" you'll know whenever something will happen, there is nothing unexpected throughout the whole movie.Do you like ""the Matrix"" you'll maybe also like this one. If you just want to watch a movie where machines/computers take control, then you should watch the Terminator-movies.My vote for ""Resident Evil"" was 3/10.",Resident Evil

A mad homicidal supercomputer watching everything through cameras.  A heroine.

When you're making something this derivative its all about the delivery, and this movie fails badly at building suspense, has laughable dialog, huge unexplained plot holes, unscary monsters, and a goofy pseudo-rock soundtrack that does little to cover up the movie's poor construction (reminiscent of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars actually).  Just a complete failure.See it only if you're 12, have beaten every console game you own, have finished your homework, taken out the garbage, and can't find any paint to watch dry.

263,headfulofghosts126,This is NOT Resident Evil...,1,21 August 2002,"Here's a thought: if you're going to make a movie about zombies, put them in more than two scenes. I am not a big video game buff, but I'm familiar enough with the first two RE games to know that they were scary as hell, had fantastic atmosphere, and much better characters than this piece of trash. Guys- all you had to do was stick to the games! Most of the audience has never played them and you could have thrown in enough surprises for those that had. There is not one suspenseful/scary/emotional scene in this big empty glitter ball of a movie. There's also a surprising lack of gore for a zombie film. And the zombies themselves are laughable...not frightening. At some points you might be confused as to who's a zombie and who isn't because the human characters get about as much development as their undead enemies. Let's start with Alice played by Milla Jovovich. Being that she wakes up with total amnesia, how in the hell are we supposed to give a rats ass about her? Just bc she looks hot in a little red dress? Give me a break. Then there's the cookie cutter cliche group of soldiers. Note to Michelle Rodriguez: wearing a permanent scowl and rolling your eyes halfway back into your head does not make you look tough... it makes you annoying. If she made that ""tough bitch"" face one more time in this film I was going to scream. Eric Mabius has gone from great films (Black Circle Boys, Welcome to the Dollhouse) to all out crap (The Crow: Salvation). Eric, you're a talented boy... stop sinking so low.What is redeeming about this movie? Not a damn thing. The special effects are horrid, the zombies look lame, and there is no sense of dread or danger that the games handle so masterfully. What's the most tragic is that this movie had so much potential. Instead of sticking to its source material they decided to make a horrible little genre pic and stick the RE name on it. Oh, and the film boasts one the single most irritating commentary track you'll ever hear. At one point the director says this isn't a zombie movie. Then Mr. Anderson, you should have let someone who thought it was take the reigns of the film bc it's based on A ZOMBIE GAME. And I have completely lost all respect for the very unintelligent Ms. Jovovich who doesn't even understand how a commentary works until twenty minutes into the whole thing. In a word: insipid. Look it up. If I dislike the movie before the commentary, I HATED it afterwards.Few so-called horror films have ever been this uncreative... and given some of the garbage that's come out lately that's a hard thing to achieve. The bottom line is the movie is not scary. You can throw in the train from RE2... you can plaster some walls with Umbrella logo... hell, give us a few undead dobermans... but that a good RE film does not make. There is no tension, creepy atmosphere, or any believable threat. Fans of the game should skip this travesty. Those unfamiliar with it should not expect anything more than your typical Hollywood, soul-less, no IQ horror/action film. It's too bad original director George Romero wasn't behind the camera. Oh, what might have been...",Resident Evil
264,DesertDogMedia,Resident Evil,7,5 August 2014,"Title: Resident EvilCondensed Storyline: A special militaristic unit has to make their way through an underground base to shut off a supercomputer, but first they must get through the base which is full of zombies Notable Acting: I found most of the characters quite boring and as soon as I was starting to get invested in a character, they got killed off. I found Milla Jovovich's character Alice quite boring and bland, whereas I did like Eric Mabius' and Martin Crewes' characters of Mat and Kaplan. But that was really, just about it. Noticeable Camera work: Zoom in shot of a man using transportation hands to get the T-Virus and T-Vaccine, they work this so you can only see it is a man in a Hazmat suit, but you cannot see his face. Simple yet effective. Graphics: CGI monster that looks like Venom from Spiderman, bluntly looks CGI. I wish I could say more things about it, as it does look like a cool design. But there isn't much good I can say about it. Incorrect Science: The Red Queen tells the group that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death, this is incorrect as what actually happens is the skin around the nails and hair shrinks as it dehydrates, causing the hair and finger nails to look like they've grown. At the start of the movie when the T-Virus vial is dropped and escapes into the air vent, this is incorrect again as any lab that would have people working in hazmat suits wouldn't have an air vent, just like the scientist says when he is about to drown. I highly doubt dogs can smell the T-Virus, but you never know.Overall Feel: I am generally not a fan of video game movies, primarily because I feel like I would be missing out on a lot of easter egg and jokes, almost similar to comic book movies. But I actually know things about comic book movies so I don't feel left out. But thankfully, I didn't feel ""too"" left out while watching this movie as it felt more like a cut and print action movie more than a video game based movie.",Resident Evil

267,JG2001,One of the better video game movies.,7,19 March 2002,"More and more, studios are turning popular video game titles into movies. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films tend to turn out between mediocre and awful. The one film that rose above the norm in my opinion was Final Fantasy, which, despite its shortcomings, still provided some wonderful entertainment.Resident Evil is much like Final Fantasy in that respect. For one thing, it never pretends to be anything more than it is, a film based on a video game that already has a B-movie plotline. Naturally, it's not going to win any academy awards, but Paul Anderson managed to make a film that should leave most viewers satisfied as long as they aren't too condescending in their opinion.The action sequences are energetic, which is an accomplishment when you consider that the vast majority of the monsters in the film shuffle along at about two miles an hour. Some of the scenes with the zombies massed together resembled a literal mosh pit of the damned.While the film doesn't contain any characters from the video games, it's obvious that Anderson did his homework when he wrote the script. The movie functions well as a prequel and to my knowledge doesn't contradict plotline of the games. In many respects, the movie was tailored a bit more to the fans of the games than the general viewing public. Perfectly setting up room for a sequel, fans may yet get a chance to see some of the game series's heroes in living color. It certainly deserves a sequel more than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in any case.To sum up, while Resident Evil is most certainly a popcorn flick, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. It has its entertaining moments, and if it's given the benefit of the doubt, it has its rewards as well.",Resident Evil
268,mal karma,"Not Bad, Not Too Great",8,16 September 2002,"8/10***Spoilers***Let's make this clear: I'm a huge fan of the video-game, I've played Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 & the dissapointing Gun Survivor. So I was really looking forward to this one. Which falls on every common spot and/or cliche in horror movies, like only two survivors (the chick and the guy), a fast wipe out of the rescue team and the facility overtaken by the zombies. Alright, this time I'll let this one go 'cos it's just the same plot as the video game, which, OK, IS a bit dumb (Blame Capcom!). But I was anyway surprised--very-- by the directing. Paul W.S. Anderson has always been giving us only crappy work except perhaps for the mediocre Event Horizon, so aside the fact that I love the Videogame, he didn't do such a bad work. Specially when it comes to the environment, I mean specifically the blue and grey lighting which fitted really good in this very claustrophobic movie, and the filming location is a bit similar to those from the games. Which this movie gets close enough to, hopefully it will be even more faithful in the sequel, after all it's gonna have some characters from the games.So, basically this is the best...no... only good videogame to screen conversion to date. It is not as scary as other films, or even less then the VG, but this is probably due to the predictable nature of it.Minor stars, but good looking ones (don't get me wrong, I only have eyes for Milla Jovovich; hey, I even have a wallpaper from this movie with her on it) and perhaps with a bright future. But who knows.Anyway it has some good moments and is very well done for a budget that wasn't that big. I just liked it and recommend watching it with an open mind, specially if you're a die hard fan of the RE saga or a die hard fan of B movies.

""Varying environments"".The Bad""Mediocre acting"".
""Emotion not believable"".
""Film length too great"".
""Effects very poor"".
""Some necessary information omitted"".
""Music lacking"".
""No unexpected plot turns"".Resident evil is the first, of a long film series of action-horror films. Released: 2002. Having reviewed, I wouldn't recommend though.StorylineThe story was well introduced, so the background could be clearly understood. Often, horror films neglect the setting, so this was positive. It didn't however, go into any detail prior to weird and wonderful creatures appearing. This made the context of some lifeforms, impossible to comprehend. It meant, you couldn't understand where some creatures had emerged from, or how they came into being. Some of the film was rendered tame, because of this.
The storyline involved multiple locations which was good, but this didn't add much enjoyment overall.
The plot was a simple, yet clever, idea. One that should have lead to tense circumstances regularly. It could have been far better used however. The plot, whilst good, in my opinion for the significant film length, had to be epically supported by tension building effects such as strange sounds, changing lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses. Long horror films do rely on such quality, which was sadly absent here.TensionAt moments of attack, things should have been suspenseful. Creatures did allow tension to be created at a few sweet spots, but these were seldom regular. Special camera angles or effects would have helped increase tension. Music was barely used, and the infected creatures didn't make noises effectively enough, to create a tense atmosphere. Lighting wasn't varied enough, and injured struggles weren't prevalent.
I wanted to believe character adrenaline, but I'm still not truly convinced they had any.
CharactersA wide variety of creatures and infected humans were encountered, and some facial expressions were effective. A lack of stress under the circumstances, actually made it unrealistic though. The character make-up and creature movements however, appeared sleek and interesting. Creature body forms seemed well considered and should have been intimidating. Characters seemed fairly well played, with a few stand outs, using facial expressions well to combat fairly unimaginative, camera angles.
There were some close-ups used effectively, albeit very rarely. Enemies weren't unpredictable, and generally attacked as expected. Not helping the fear factor.All settings were well lit, and shadows weren't used. A lack of subtle suggestion then, didn't put you on edge. Certain scenes were horrific and gory, yet didn't elicit a believable horrified reaction, from peers or the viewer. Again, sound effects to accompany gore, just weren't there !SummaryTension building effects such as strange sounds, varying lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses were lacking. They couldn't lift a variety of imaginative characters and creatures, beyond a fairly uninteresting entity.",Resident Evil
270,ShinKyo81,"I wanna be a zombie to meet Milla :P~~~... Besides, the movie rocks!",7,16 April 2002,"""Resident Evil"" is one of those films that I was expecting with great interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of the project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson appeared, and everybody thought ""That guy rings me a bell..."".After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial films such as ""Mortal Kombat"" or ""Event Horizon"". And I say controversial because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both at the same time. And ""Resident Evil"" will be the next victim...""Mortal Kombat"" was a decent project that came out the same time ""Street Fighter"" did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson created a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, ""Mortal Kombat"" succeed in the duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches.""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror in a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list. Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that were incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).And now we have ""Resident Evil"". First, I quickly recognized the same dark atmosphere of ""Event Horizon"" in ""RE"". This strange way of Anderson to use the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived watching the ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""'s monster, you'll manage this one :P.Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly with the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so it absorbs you inside.The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul Anderson's peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the whole plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check out the takes next time, please)!!! :-PWell, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen ""Soldier"", though), you'll really enjoy this one.

272,m0rg16,Is this some kind of joke?,2,6 January 2003,"SPOILERS How could they even release this product into the cinemas? What a waste of time and space! This junk has got to be the worst thing ever made since Death Race 2000, only Death Race 2000 is fun to watch because of its crappiness, this movie is not fun to watch because it is just so horribly, horribly bad!Ok, in the beginning they show a scene where some people get trapped in an elevator and a virus is released in an underground research facility. So far so could, this could lead to some pop corn action. Then we jump to a scene in a house out of nowhere where a naked lady lies in a bathtub. She gets up, gets dressed and walks around this empty house without saying a word for a few minutes. Hmm... interesting. Suddenly a cop comes along and yells get down before... hey.. a cop? out in the middle of nowhere? With absolutely no signs of danger at all? Oh well, anyway just after he and the chick ""get down"" a bunch of swat-like guys jump in through the window. Why the heck did they do that whe  they could have just walked through the door and taken the unarmed girl without a problem?Apparently there is some sort of underground train beneath the house that the swat dudes need entrance too, and they take the girl and cop with them... apparently the girl works for them, but she doesn't know it. or something...On the train they find yet another dizzy character. Apparently he works for them too. And he is the chicks boyfriend... and he doesn't remember anything... or something...They step off at the research center and after a very long and boring house scene which makes absolutly no sense you finally get the feeling that something is about to happen. Well yeah, about half of the dudes die to a laser. Ok, cool... Then they have to disarm some kind of mainframe, because they got a feeling she is crazy. But in doing so, they release the virus into all halls of the research facility. Nice going guys! You just released a virus that turns all dead bodies into zombies! Better get out of there quick!! (or just restart the mainframe).However they find out to late, and zome (get it? zome?) zombie action occurs. Bite, screams, blood, gore. Probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, altough it isn't entertaining at all.Finally they decide to restart the mainframe in order to escape, and the mainframe leads them through some tunnels and airshafts through some really stupid and funny (unintentionally) scenes. Sometimes I thought it was supposed to be funny, because of the really, really excessive music and then suddenly... silence... Well, its wierd, and bad. And it goes on and on after that... you have to see it to understand how incredibly crappy it is. But instead spend your time on something else.For a very bad script, some very bad editing and directing, some very bad characters and acting (most of them anyway) and some zombie action I sum it all up to a 2... It almost deserves it.",Resident Evil
273,morkulv_athferion,A mixed bag,6,3 December 2009,"This movie is a bit hard for me to review, because for one I am a fan of the first Resident Evil games, and second because even though this movie is often seen as a very mediocre movie and overall adaption of the game, it is still much better then the second movie Resident Evil: Apocalypse.The acting in this movie is poor, but its the kind of acting that is so bad its good. Even though Milla Jovovich has the looks, she is just not a convincing actor at all. Michelle Rodriguez's part also doesn't work that well either, but I have to admit that both of them do deliver some good action-scenes.The music in this movie is also something I have mixed feelings about. Its composed in cooperation with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. The score sounds very industrial and cold, which adds a very eerie vibe to the movie. But in some places the music is way too loud. I first watched this movie in the theater and I kid you not when I say that the industrial rock soundtrack is deafening at some parts. But I have to say that it does fit the movie's atmosphere well.The story is about your average zombie-outbreak, but instead of it taking place on the street or in a mall its taking place in a underground laboratory. Nothing too special, but it works.If you are a fan of zombie-movies then you should definitely give Resident Evil a try, its certainly worth watching at least once. Don't bother watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse though because thats a whole different story.",Resident Evil

This movie based on the popular video game was a horror to watch leading me on a number of occasions to look for a gun or any kind of weapon so I could put an end to my misery. Fortunately for me, there was nothing but stale soda and greasy popcorn. Just when I thought this movie was going to end, it started back up again, did this about 3 different times. The best part of the movie was when the credits were rolling. That and the sexy Mila Jovovich who we do get to see naked  yes guys thats right, naked!

277,derekauthor,Game for 'Resident Evil',5,25 August 2005,"Exactly what can I say about ""Resident Evil?"" Well, first of all it's based on a popular video game series, so expect a lot of the action to be the same kind of action you would find in a cartoon. Second, be prepared for an incoherent plot (which is kind of dumb). Finally, get ready for lots of gore.So, why five out of ten stars? It's a lot of fun to watch. Even though it's totally unbelievable, it's somewhat involving (despite, like noted above, the dumb, incoherent plot). The characters are fun to watch, especially Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who have to be the toughest heroines in movie history.The special effects are very good, as is the enthusiastic direction by Paul W.S. Anderson (who also wrote the script based on his favorite video game). Also, the movie has a fun opening sequence.In brief, the movie is about a super computer in a top secret, underground research facility called 'The Hive' which goes awry, killing everyone down there. However, a manufactured virus brings them (and a few dogs) back from the dead, resulting in flesh-eating zombies.A lot of people might frown when they learn the plot and, eventually, see the movie, thinking it's something too unbelievable. Then again, what do they expect from a movie based on a video game?",Resident Evil

Watching the film draws inspiration from ""Alice in Wonderland"". There comes the lead's name, the mirror, the rabbit, and the Red Queen. There's that scare factor about what will happen next. When will the zombies first appear? Who may get killed first? The jump scares are well done. I like how Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do kickass moves. The atmosphere set in the underground lab is creepy. The music is also scarily very good.The action sequence is amazing. And the plot twists are shocking.

Nonstop thrills and frills.  With awesome special effects and a fantastic group of actors, this movie is a must-see for all Resident Evil, horror and/or sci-fi fans.The movie stars the lovely Milla Jovovich as Alice, a woman who was the victim of short-term amnesia and was suddenly drafted into an odd and unusual mission not meant for the-light-of-heart.Ms. Jovovich's co-star, the equally lovely Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, a no-nonsense, hardened, gonna-kick-your-ass-if-you-look-at-me-wrong kind of woman.  Armed with a machine gun, she was not about to let anything get in her way.Together, along with a few other military agents and Matt, a man who is not who he claims to be, they fight their way through Umbrella Corporation to complete their mission and eventually to save their own lives.All-in-all, this movie was fantastic.  Solely for its entertainment value, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars.

Even though killed pretty soon, at least most of the cast, each person gives a convincing performance. And that is exactly the ""overall-feel"" about the movie. The pieces - actors, storyline, filming - fit together. It IS a stupid monster movie, it is NOT like the game, but everybody takes the project serious. But it is in no way a great piece of art. Resident Evil is a solid movie, and good at this, no more! Nothing new, except for the scene with the zombie dogs. Ain't that beautiful. It is a new idea for the genre, it's visual fun.

281,JohnBoyRoy,"No, no, no, no!",4,22 March 2004,"For anyone who has played throught the videogames in the series (especially the GameCube remakes) will know that it was the immense tension, slow build up, film noir-like lighting and the gritty characterisations that made the zombie action so brilliantly scary.However, it seems that Paul 'Mortal Kombat' WS Anderson spent his time watching Kerrang! on cable in the run up to over seeing the design of the film.  Resident Evil, although catering mainly for the 'teen - rockers' faternity could also have appealed to a broader horror fan, or even been a more mainstream sucess (in the same way that 'The Others' was 'Poltergeist' for thesps).The entire thing plays like a two hour rock video.  Why is the installation so clean and new?  It was housed in  a rotting mansion in the games (with its decrepid grounds and gothic architecture) and merely placing a mansion in the film does not a plot point make.The zombies had CGI eczema and the amount of cast was OTT - why not have a few specific deaths instead of popcorn cannon fodder?  The music was terrible - just because it is horror and was made in the new millenium we had to put up with thrash metal. Hmmm.Paul's sequel will be just as crap, im sure.  God, I hated this film, as I'm sure you can tell - and you will too if you're a fan of serious and genuinely frightening horror.  This is just a media franchise film I'm afraid, and very unsatisfying.I gave it a 4 just because it had a vague resemblance to the game, but the potential that the game held, cinematically, has been devoured by this actually very poor film.This style was great in 'Mortal Kombat' - it was a good, fun, meaningless film (like the game) but in the case of 'Resident Evil', a narrative that holds deep emotioal and social meaning (and is subtly scary) it is as useful as a spoon.",Resident Evil
282,evilasahobby,"A good zombie film, but not a good film",7,10 May 2002,"Resident Evil isn't a bad film, just nothing exceptional. As a zombie film, it hits its marks, but doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the pack. Day of the Dead is a much better film if you want to see the walking dead in action.As a video game adaption, it does what any good adaption does: keep only the bare bones of the material and build new flesh over them. The original story contained in the game has thrown out. Unlike some game adaptions (Double Dragon, for instance) it works in this case, but mainly because the original story was a generic zombie / mad science plot. The Resident Evil movie has just taken one version of zombies / mad science and replaced it with another. In fact, the links to the game are so tenuous (apart from the theme and some stylistic factors) you wonder if the license was bought to attract a greater audience.The big problem with the film is that the narrative gets weaker as the film progresses. Starting with the stealing of the T-virus (the zombie making agent) and the smashing of a T-virus tube in the lab (because the thief was evil, as far as I can tell), the computer security system known as the Red Queen locks down the facility and kills all the employees. It's a great start, and the use of security cameras as a view point for the audience is a great effect because you get to see the Red Queen's abilities and depersonalised status. From here on it's downhill in regards to the narrative - some flashbacks, a weak backstory surrounding attempted corporate espionage and characters making stupid / evil decisions against all common sense. You got bitten by a zombie for which there is no cure? Hey, hang around us, please! A top secret bio-warfare facility went into lockdown? First thing we should do is open it up!There are some great moments, such as the appearance of the skinless dogs. But there are so many holes in the story the movie suffers.

Although the movie's uninspired shock sounds, dated computer graphics, choppy flashbacks, and stereotypical casting foreshadow the weaknesses of its vastly inferior sequels, Resident Evil benefits from a solid mystery plot, detailed art direction, and a charismatic performance by Milla Jovovich as a mordern, grown up Alice in Wonderland.

285,droogiedim77,AMAZINGLY WELL DONE!,10,3 July 2002,"I want to start off by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I am a big fan of horror movies. And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking....""Resident Evil a '10'?"" Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawn-out scene, but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well, without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick, but Manson does his best work to date. (And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme.) The score starts with an ominous sound, followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses, more and more tension builds as drums, guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short, but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic, haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual, but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment, you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun, gore-filled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscar-worthy, but they do portray their characters well. The make-up work IS oscar-worthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings, it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is well-directed, seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts, which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far, this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002, one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead, the other masterpiece. In fact, you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now, for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic, I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything, it captured it all to well. As with all movies, there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.",Resident Evil

As an action film the movie delivers lots of highly entertaining action scenes and is not boring at all. When it comes to a zombie film however I was dissapointed. Non of he zombies were scary and none were original. I thought the film could've done a little better job explaining the story also.

Including KILLING all of the people that work and live in the Hive.... And, as the deadly T-Virus is on the loose, which is chemically created to re-animate dead tissue, all of those same workers come back to life - with only the most basic of brain functions going - those that will keep them alive - breathing and eating... what do they eat?!? Living creatures.... Through this movie, we get an expansion on the Resident Evil video game series, giving us more back story into the T-Virus and the creatures that inhabit Raccoon City (far above the Hive). We learn a lot about how the virus escaped into the population - although not a lot about how it goes SO big in Raccoon City.We meet an elite force of security officers of Umbrella Corporation, whose job it is to shut it all down... many die along the way, getting killed by zombies and dogs and brain suckers and the Red Queen's unique security systems... This film is NOT for the feint of heart when it comes to gore - both realized and intimated.....The end of the movie leaves enough unraveled threads to allow for a sequel (see RESIDENT EVIL:APOCALYPSE - released in 2004) for more....

It doesn't get a lot deeper than that however and I haven't played the game so I guess there's a lot of back-story missing etc for me. Hence, the plot was very shallow, forced and I'd seen it all before.Even so, the set values seemed pretty good and the special effects weren't the worst I've seen (except maybe for the 'beast' at the end which sort of suggests they either had no budget to start with or ran it into the ground pretty quickly. Still, it was a bit better than the werewolf in Ginger Snaps so that's something. This isn't the best sci-fi movie you'll see (in fact it's not a sci-fi movie at all really) but it's not the worst zombie movie either. Somewhere in between.

295,GenK1981,Very enjoyable,8,7 September 2002,"First off i think that the critics were very harsh on there comments of this film.  Half of these so called critics probably havn't even heard of the 'Resident Evil' franchise and therefore their comments really dont have any effects to my view on the film.Ok, so it wasnt exactly an award winning film but it still had enough ingredients to make me want to see it again, and buy it on DVD.  Milla Jovovich was quite good as Alice though i did find i couldnt really bond to her as the main character to well.  Michelle Rodgriguez on the other hand was very impressive as the hard-ass Rain, her performance was only marred by the harsh fact that she probably is too young to be in an elite special force??? - but apart from that she was great!  Eric Mabius (Matt), Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Colin Salmon (One) were all good as supporting cast!The films special effects are brilliant and director Paul Anderson uses his imagination well to build a story around the resident evil game.  It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the mansion in which Resident Evil is known and loved for.  The twisted metal music score is excellent to this film and Marilyn Manson must be applauded in the way he handled the high tense scenes within this movie.Resident Evil: Nemesis is in the pipeline for 2003 and hopefully it will have the same pleasing effect as this film did.  It will also be nice to see some familiar looking characters be introduced into the sequal i.e. Albert Wesker!!A great film - 8/10",Resident Evil
296,pc_dean,All Work & No PlayStation,8,16 March 2002,"Making movies out of video games is tough work.  After all, video games typically feature shallow, simplistic plots, dialogue that is corny, head-scratchingly obtuse or unintentionally hilarious, and acting that is by turns monotonous and overwrought.Actually, come to think of it, that pretty well describes the typical Hollywood early-spring release.The ""Resident Evil"" series of survival-horror games is essentially a hodgepodge of various horror movies, and so the movie based on it is, if you can imagine, a hodgepodge of various horror movies.  The plot concerns dark doings in ""the Hive"", a secret underground lab run by the sinister Umbrella Corporation, a bio-stuff manufacturer that is what Pfizer would be if Victor Frankenstein were on the board of directors.  An experimental zombie-creating virus is released in the Hive, prompting a response by its overseer, a smarty-pants computer with a child's persona and a number of gleefully sadistic security systems (anyone with a fear of elevators should skip the first couple scenes).  A team of corporate commandos moves in, with a number of comically elaborate weapons but few names (their medic's nametag reads, ""Medic"".) They are to secure the lab (under the circumstances, they might have better sent a crack squad of expert morticians) and shut down the computer.  Along the way, they seize a couple living in the house that provides cover for the Hive entrance, as well as a cop who was sneaking around, and, for reasons that aren't quite clear, take them along into the Hive.  The couple is suffering memory loss due to nerve-gas exposure, and no one is what they seem.  But you knew that already.  From there ""Resident Evil"" turns into a zombie-killing haunted house war movie, as the heroes have to battle not only the computer, but a hellish host of undead creatures.  And it's pretty fun.The director is Paul Anderson, who also made ""Mortal Kombat"", and like that movie, ""Resident Evil"" is better than it really has any right to be. Anderson has a sure hand for creepy technological spaces.  He is economical with light, and manages to make the Hive both shadowy and harshly lit, with its flattening florescent lighting that make the heroes look half dead themselves.  This sense of place is very important: among the hallmarks of the ""Resident Evil"" games are their effectively creepy atmospherics. Playing often finds you strolling through the eerily quiet scene of some past carnage, while unsettling ethereal music plays in the background. Anderson does not incorporate specific places from the games (as he has dispensed with the games' familiar characters), but there are echoes of them in the darkened hallways and flooded labs of the Hive.  The movie also retains the games' problem-solving sensibilities, and there is a great deal of shutting off/restoring the power, opening coded locks, etc.The acting is good, if a bit underdeveloped.  This is a relief, since the ""Resident Evil"" video games seem to prize sub-competent voice acting.  Milla Jovovich plays the main character, Alice (Get it?  Alice goes down the rabbit hole?  'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'?  Oh, never mind.), and her performance starts flat and inflates slowly over the course of the movie.  I get that it's supposed to convey her memory loss, but it's still a bit uneven.  Jovovich works better when she doesn't speak, displaying a quiet, cornered-animal defiance that works well in this type of setting.  Plus her other, um, visual qualities.  As commando Rain, Michelle Rodriguez seems to be channelling Jenette Goldstein's immortal Pvt. Vasquez from ""Aliens"", and setting herself up for a long line of sneering toughgirl roles.  The weak link is Eric Mabius, unconvincing as the cop, whose resume supposedly boasts Quantico and the NSA, but is largely useless when the Bad Things come (though he does oddly resemble game hero Chris Redfield).  A better performance comes from Martin Crewes as a high-strung commando, who gets to do a gratifying twist on the old ""I'm surrounded, but at least I've got one bullet left"" scene.The visual style and fast pace of ""Resident Evil"" largely overcome its sometimes faulty internal logic:  the transmission of the virus seems more rooted in script convenience than anything else, and the computer, while supposedly coldly logical, comes off nuttier than trail mix.  There is also an unintentionally funny twist as the heroes are stressing over how to kill the bullet-sponge zombies.  They need the computer to explain to them what anyone with even passing knowledge of horror-movie physiology already knows: the zombies' weakness is massive trauma to the cerebral cortex, i.e. shoot them in the head.  Really, what's wrong with these people?  Haven't they ever seen a George Romero movie?",Resident Evil

I've never played the video game nor did I pay any attention to the movie when it was in theaters. But, when my friend suggested we watch it on pay-per-view, I figured ""What the heck?""--POTENTIAL SPOILERS.The special effects are decent, but nothing out of the ordinary given the technology we have today. The acting is marginal, but not too wooden. But my biggest complaint with the movie is the total lack of originality. Come on, dead people brought back to life, who seek human flesh? Can you say ""already been done many, many times?"" Guess how you kill the zombies? By shooting them in the head. Gee, sounds just like ""Night Of The Living Dead""Avoid this one unless your buddy is paying for the rental.",Resident Evil

Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.",Resident Evil

You're NEVER gonna enjoy a sci fi flick if you keep comparing it to the same 2 movies ALL THE TIME! Jeesh...get over it already.THAT said, Its about TIME a Zombie flick has come along, that with the exception of ""Night of the Living Dead"", has finally flushed the bad tatse out of my mouth that was left there with Romero's INSIPIDLY LOUD, BADLY ACTED, BADLY SFX'd and MAKEUP'd Zombie remakes....

301,bajbij,Gore nor horror need not apply *SPOILERS*,4,8 August 2002,"This was one the most mediocre Zombie films ever made and one of the more mediocre and predictable so called horror films since the ""Scream"" era started. None of the heroes in the film had any connection or humanity whatsoever and I didn;t care that they died. Michelle Rodriguez' character for example is utterly hateful and her death was welcome. None of the characters showed any fear and thus disrespected the theme of horror. Milla Jovavich's character is a kung fu expert? Why? Did the movie tell us? No, and because it filmmakers are to politically correct and gutless to show a woman in peril for the sake of not offending sensitive women today, this film fails and so does Milla's character.The zombie makeup was suprisingly well done, but what is a zombie movie without gore? Even George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had some gore that was extreme for its era. Speaking of which, Romero was originally slated to direct RE, but I guess producers felt he would have ended up making a better zombie film and thus canned him. Most of the gore was implied, but it fails. People would point out the TEXAS CHAINSAW technique where the gore was implied, but it works in TEXAS. For example, the girl hanging on the hook. We don't see the hook go into her back, but we do see her hanging painfully and struggling from the hook. A poor example of implied gore in RE is when the girl in the elevator in the begining has her head chopped off, we only see her point of view and then BAM- screen turns to black. Huh? Were the filmmakers too scared to do a zombie movie? It seems like it.The ending is a perfect example of how failed the writers were in their attempt to present something interesting and epic and instead give us a bland conclusion, where Milla walks out into the world to see desolation, burning streets, and no humans. It would have been an excellent opportunity to show a horde of zombies surrounding Milla, from all angles, throughout the city, and end the movie right there, but these are filmmakers who know absolutely nothing about horror, just popcorn moments and ALIENS ripoff techniques. A truly overrated film.",Resident Evil
302,slimjack,Pretty good for what it is.,6,29 March 2002,"Resident Evil is an action movie dressed up as a zombie horror flick. It has pretensions to being in the same gory category as George Romero's classic Day of the Dead.  In fact Romero was originally slated to direct Resident Evil. He left the production and a fellow named Paul Anderson took over. They made the right choice.  Anderson made a nifty joy ride of a movie with nothing in its brainless little head than to help you waste ninety minutes.
Resident Evil is the type of movie where momentum trumps plot. This is not to say that story is unimportant. You need enough substance to involve the audience in the mayhem but not so much that they will accidentally start thinking. This movie has just enough characterization to make you worry about the fate of the actors and just enough plot to give them something to do.  Something goes `Horribly WrongT' at a vast underground biological research facility. All the lab personnel die and provide a pool of hungry zombies.  A crack paramilitary commando squad goes in to find out what happened.  That's about it for the plot.  That's all you need, really, to string the action sequences together.  Okay, yes, there are some subplots involving corporate espionage, love and betrayal but most of that just gets lost in the noise.  All you have to know to enjoy the proceedings is that the good guys have to go from point A to point B without becoming hors-de-oeuvres.The acting rises to the occasion but not much farther.  A fellow named Colin Salmon does look like he's destined for better stuff.  Salmon plays the head commando and manages to stand out in his brief screen time. Milla Jovovich, on the other hand, never seems anything more than the glamour puss she really is.  Not that she gets much help from the script or costume department.  Now bear in mind that these zombies are suppose to be highly contagious. One scratch and you're a shambling mess. Ms. Jovovich, supposedly a highly trained security expert, goes into battle wearing a spaghetti-strapped purple mini dress. I suppose the thigh high Doc Martins provided some protection but still.anyway, Jovovich has a likable screen presence and does the requisite kickboxing moves with passable flair.
Michelle Rodriguez, now, looks as if she knows one end of an Uzi from another. She does go into battle wearing Kevlar but the ancient rules of dramaturgy being what they are; she eventually takes it off so we can see her t-shirt. To be fair, Rodriguez does a good job.  She shows more personality than Jovovich and is believable in a highly contrived situation.
Despite the zombies you can watch Resident Evil without gagging on your popcorn.  Gore is not Resident Evil's bag. The zombies here are a civilized lot. They do their feeding politely off camera. Yes, there is plenty of blood being splattered around but not much more than you'd see in your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.Resident Evil is one of those borderline movies that are fun to watch but don't bear much discussion.  Should you see it?  Well, if your favorite movie of the last ten years was Room With A View then there are other films you should see.  If you're in the mood for a swiftly paced, brainless action flick however, then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil.",Resident Evil

304,iamsam103,"If you're a fan of the franchise, steer clear.",4,23 December 2005,"I went to the cinema having high expectations for the film. I was and still am a huge fan oft he games, especially Resi 2. I was expecting the characteristics of the game to be int he film; gore, suspense, violence, zombies and some nasty monsters. I was in for a huge disappointment...The film starts off OK, with some unknown figure unleashing the T-Virus but then it goes circling out of control. Whereas there are some elements still retained from the game(laboratory is under a mansion outside Racoon City and is owned by Umbrella Corporation it seems that the director got bored of transferring the franchise to film, and instead made the rest up. What follows is a mindless adventure as some elite soldiers go through the underground lab to try and stop the threat of the virus. Of course, there are zombies, but the overall look of then pales in comparison to Dawn Of The Dead (2004). Whereas some of them have gruesome wounds, 80% of them are just very pale and have makeup and fake blood. Along with that, there is no suspense. And what happens is that a zombie(s)will emerge, and along with tons of shooting, rock music appears.The big bad boy boss monster is the licker, who most Resi fans will know and appreciate as a med-i-okre monster, not too challenging. This thing however is made out to be the mother of all creations and is very disappointingly realised with bad CGI. There is no suspense here, a total lack of blood and gore, and only one monster. True fans of the Resi games will be and should be disappointed.That said, their are a few things which raise Resi from the dead (sorry for the pun). The ending climactic train set piece is enjoyable and fast paced, and the laser hallway (imagine, 3 soldiers, trapped in a hallway, with lasers that chop things in half) is pretty neat. There's also a cool appearance by some zombie Doberman dogs, however they're quickly killed off in a silly action scene.This film could have been so much more if the director would have ditched the possibility for ""cool stunts"" and gone for more style, suspense and horror. Even when the heroes are outnumbered and surrounded by zombies, you never feel as if they are in THAT much danger....when in a situation like that you should be on the edge of your seat.For zombie lovers, there are better choices out there. George A Romero's Dead films, the remake of Dawn of The Dead (04, Saun Of The Dead and even 28 Days Later serve up better chills and scares than this med-i-okre action fest.",Resident Evil

306,boo_4ever,A nice deviation from the games,8,3 April 2005,"I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still enjoyable.The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a special team is sent in to investigate.Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre stage in the second film and third game.Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was what was intended more or less.",Resident Evil

While it retains certain elements of 'Resident Evil', it is completely devoid of the atmosphere that is at the core of the franchise. It doesn't seem done with any care or love of the source material. This is surprising coming from the director of Mortal Kombat, a movie that, although corny, captures the spirit of the games.It starts out okay with some intrigue, but it spirals out of control. There are some cool moments, by 2002 standards. The laser grid scene is very memorable. Yet that isn't enough to sustain the utter bore-fest that is the rest of the film.It's poorly shot, and poorly edited with continuity errors and outright nonsensical jumps. It also has god awful sound mixing that puts the obnoxious score front and center.If you want a fun Zombie movie, beware, this isn't one.

308,seandchoi,Got the looks but not the intelligence,6,25 March 2002,"Resident Evil, the latest film from Paul Anderson--not to be confused with a much better filmmaker, Paul Thomas Anderson--looks great enough, but it feels like a feature-length compilation of familiar scenes from a handful of superior horror and/or sci-fi films, e.g. George Romero's zombie flicks, the ""Alien"" films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and The Matrix. The film doesn't break any new grounds and would have been better served, I think, as a ""direct to video"" release. The film features the beautiful Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Claim) who, along with several others (most notably, Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious and Girlfight), must contain a chemical leakage at one of those secret underground laboratories which you find from time to time in sci-fi films like this. Unbeknownst to this crew, the contamination has turned all the workers in the lab into ""zombies,"" a group of walking dead who are driven solely by the instinct to feed on living flesh. As you might have expected, the crew has to fight off the zombies, resulting in plenty of carnage and gore. Resident Evil is a gory film. What the film lacks, however, is any real suspense or genuine scares. And the soundtrack is one of the loudest I have heard in a long time; I wasn't scared by the film, but several times I got scared that I might go deaf. (I guess the philosophy behind this tactic is: if you can't scare them, jolt them.) I should also mention that the film features several almost nude scenes of Jovovich which are sort of disappointing and anti-climactic (you sort of keep wishing that the damn towel, etc. would fall, but it never does) but might turn out, in the long run, to be the best part of this dead-brained film.",Resident Evil

For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next.I would give it a 10 in the genre.",Resident Evil

I remembered the days when video games first came to the big screen.  I remember the disapointment following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter.  But then there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat.  The origional story is kept in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie work.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with the volume turned way up.  Although it will always be a trend setting classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then until now.Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it.

Not just the first scene, but the whole movie. It didn't called my attention that much at the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence right now.The best about RE is it's soundtrack. It's what makes this movie convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same time. Even if the soundtrack isen't that original. It is pretty well placed in the right moments, and it's almost constantly throughout the movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.RE's photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident Evil. Even if it's not the same company working on it.Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the easier ever written. I've watched on English (I'm Brazilian) and still did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of it's language.RE is and entertaining film, won't add much at your knowledge, nothing like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you'll like to spend some hours watching it.Cheers.",Resident Evil

This movie is entertaining only in the same sense that Plan 9 From Outer Space is entertaining.  The attempts at both horror and scifi were quite humorous at times.Completely unabsorbing.

317,kensmark,A Huge Disappointment,1,31 March 2002,"Mild non-specific spoilers ahead.I had high hopes, but Resident Evil wants to be a zombie movie and an action movie, and it fails utterly on both counts.You can't have a good zombie movie without gore.  Or without some decent zombies.  The zombies in this movie are feeble, except for the dogs, who have hardly any screen time.  The movie also has a rather hastily concocted monster, which serves as padding.  The gore that does get onto the screen doesn't have any continuity with the action, as if the victims of violence in the film wandered in from an alternate universe where they died of different causes.And you can't have a good action movie without action.  Milla has about one-and-a-half good action moments in this film, and the rest of the cast manages another two.  Those are supplemented by a lot of inaction and a lot of loud nonsense where they try to confuse you into thinking something interesting is happening.  Dull, dull, dull.Shaking the camera a lot during a close-up of someone waving their arms and screaming is not an action scene.  It's passe and pathetic and wasn't a decent substitute for action back when it was relatively new, in the mid-80's.The movie has a few moments of genuine atmosphere, but those have all come and gone by the twenty-minute mark.  There are some nice props, but they generally don't get much use, and some nice sets, although the gross overuse of the close-up generally obscures them.  The cast shows some promise, but they don't have much to do, and the dialogue is all too often wincingly bad.The movie relentlessly copies better films, and does it poorly, a long and annoying reminder of what you could be watching instead.Most mysteriously of all, the film contains nudity, but none of it serves any purpose.  The movie already had an 'R' rating for violence.  The nudity isn't necessary or flattering.  I admit, rarely have I seen a movie in which an attractive woman appears without her clothes and thought the movie would be better without the nudity, but it happened here.All in all, it's not as interesting or exciting as watching someone play the game.  Or hearing them talk about having played the game.  It's not even as good as the director Paul Anderson's earlier videogame movie, Mortal Kombat. As the final credits rolled, I was easily able to think of almost a dozen zombie movies that are far, far superior -- and only two of them are Japanese.Weak, dull, derivative, amateurish, under-written, under-directed, and generally disappointing.

319,Justin Harris,"Has a good idea, but wasn't nearly as good as it could've been.",6,30 November 2002,"I had been anticipating the movie Resident Evil since I heard to was to be released back in 1998. At the time there were various directors and writers attached to the project, even George A. Romero -- The Master of Zombie Flicks. However, if you read Romero's script which appeared online, most would agree it was a quite corny script that had no real development.So finally I heard in 2001 that Paul Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat (and did a good job at that) would write/direct the project. And it was finally released March 2002. So here are my thoughts on the flick. His ideas for cutting away from the game by introducing a new story was a good idea... to leave some surprises for the gamers and non-gamers. However there were many problems in his script. The story is good because it keeps close to the idea of the corrupt Umbrella Corporation. However, character development and dialogue are the two biggest things wrong with the movie. Though the cast is minimal, there are only two interesting characters in the entire film. Milla Jovovich plays the mysterious ""Alice in Wonderland"" character who can't remember her identity. As the movie progresses, we learn more about her character, but never the entire thing (I'm sure it'll be answered in the sequel). However the problem with Jovovich's character is though she's mysterious, she's not very interesting. The only other character in the film that was interesting was One (played by Colin Salmon). Colin Salmon kicks ass as the elite group's leader. His dialogue is very well written, too. He basically explains the entire situation of what has happened, which is good because Salmon has a great, bold voice. It's very unfortunate that this movie follows all the other roots of 'horror' flicks and kills off the token black character early. So before we can even embrace Salmon's character, he is dead (an incidentally, dies in the sickest & coolest way possible).So with only one really interesting character who doesn't last long and another who isn't quite as interesting, this movie drags. However there is enough action-packed sequences in it to keep one entertained.OVERALL: 6 out of 10 (okay)",Resident Evil

Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should get an award for doing an unbelievable job with material that could have easily become bad.  The editing with the flashbacks made this movie a pleasure to watch.  Well, lots of gore, too, but it was partly a horror film.  Don't sell this flick short - you'll be in for a pleasant shock.",Resident Evil
323,brettlu,"Video game to movie adaptions suck, or so the saying goes...",6,7 November 2003,"I'd have to say that Resident Evil is one of the few video game movies I have ever been at least moderately entertained by. I didn't think it was a good movie, but it was an entertaining mindless romp of zombie killing fun.
Sure the script is weak, the acting is horrible, and the direction is needlessly formulaic, but hey it still is kind of fun to watch. Watching the movie is similar to playing through one of the video games, and that's all you should take it as. I can understand why most people and critics didn't like it. But I went to this movie expecting a mindless zombie killing adventure, that's exactly what I got.For fans of the game series, the movie provides some interesting back story. It probably could have been about 20 times better if Romero would have directed it, but I heard that he was straying heavily from the Resident Evil plot line already established in the games. Oh well, I guess we'll have to wait for the Night of the Living Dead 4.Anyway, I give it ** out of **** stars...",Resident Evil

325,xrellerx,big budget zombie adventure,4,16 August 2002,"Video game makers are mostly influenced by classic stories to give their games shape.  So, it's no wonder that RESIDENT EVIL has lots of hints to and ideas taken from for example Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD.  I would even dare to mention that there wouldn't be a RESIDENT EVIL if Romero didn't make his zombie trilogy!  But also new films are recognized in some scenes, like for example the scene with the lazer beams is totally taken from THE CUBE (which was pretty good by the way). RE has a bit more action over the whole line, but doesn't have the psychology that goes on in Romero films, neither does it create a tension or a feel with the characters.  It also doesn't have the gore that zombie films supposed to have.  The effects are smooth, yet there's not much blood spilled for a zombie flick.  Best example from this is the first scene in the elevator: we don't see her head fall off. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something to come, they try to build up tension and you are left behind with nothing. The plot (thank you Romero) tries to be high-tech, but it's obvious it's just dragged into the film for little reason, but to give us a falls feeling of intelligent action. RESIDENT EVIL was a total let down and was even worse then I expected.  And then I'm not even talking about the killer bunny...--- FOR GAMERS ONLY ---",Resident Evil

The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus and an ""accident"" occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors. A elite team is send to the installation and verify ""what a hell is going on"" and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the base of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the movie is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of ""matrix"". I explain, there is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some ""DOGS"" and a normal person NEVER does this things.These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors works well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked. Ok, the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this kind of movie.

Anderson, which ruins a great story, turning the whole thing into a huge mess that is barely watchable. As a movie independent of the games, it is mediocre at best. But as an adaptation it is just terrible, dreadful film.",Resident Evil

330,NonSequiturL,"Horrible, horrible, horrible movie",2,5 October 2008,"OK, so I'm incredibly bored and this movie is on TV now and I forgot how bad it is. So, I'm going to fill the next hour and a half with this pap and write as I watch. There is not one memorable character in it at all, apart from Milla Jovovich, who I would decline to actually refer to as a ""character"". She spends most of the runtime looking at things with a stupid, wide eyed glare, only taking a break to bullet time kick a dog in mid-air. Oh, and then there's Michelle Rodriguez looking angry, and sounding angry. Scary.Everyone else is just a cardboard cutout, never fleshed out or even given a decent line. They jump through a window at the beginning - I guess that's what Paul WS Anderson considers ""character development""... All the dialogue that follows after that is a bunch of useless, boring exposition. Who are these people and why the hell should I care? There's too many of them, all of them generic and never given anything to do.The film simply looks ugly and drab - nondescript metal corridors and rooms full of boxes and hokey machinery. A talented DP could make this look good, but instead it comes across as overly sterile. And the insulting computer generated map of the facility is just... ridiculous. Could this movie be any more aimed at morons? The zombies are pathetic. The action is poorly filmed. Most of the time we get a shot of someone firing a gun, sometimes in slow motion. The gore level should have been much higher, at least there would have been something to look at, but instead there is barely a drop of blood. Zombies drop to the ground in a bloodless heap while dusty squibs explode sporadically and unspectacularly. Aside from a few shots, you'd think they were aiming for a PG-13. Maybe they were, knowing PWSA.Why PWSA felt the need to stray so far away from the original atmosphere and story of the game is beyond me - surely, a talented writer could have structured a tense, claustrophobic zombie story set in the mansion, with the STARS team as characters? Instead, we got a derivative, half assed rip off of a bunch of different horror/sci-fi/action movies, and none of it works. There is no story here, just a bunch of crappy clichés and poorly orchestrated ""scary jump"" sequences where something crashes into a window. No tension at all.You know, there's movies as silly as this one, but they succeed because they KNOW they're silly. They wink at the audience. Instead, PWSA treats his audience with contempt. This is completely soulless, franchise film-making. You just know he came into the suit's office and pitched how he could make a dumb movie on the cheap, and the fans of the game would come in and see it regardless of how bad it was. He didn't even ATTEMPT to make a good movie.Back into another smoky corridor, suddenly filled with zombies. Horrid, obnoxious industrial metal music blares at the viewer while Milla ""kicks ass"" in slow motion again. Poorly edited, poorly filmed.Random guy: ""We're all gonna die down here."" Milla: ""No, we're gonna get out. All of us."" Ergh, this is gonna go on for another half an hour isn't it? Oops... Time for some weird flashback. OK, there's an antivirus. Fantastic... Who cares at this point? Oh, and ""Spence"" was the guy who released the virus... Who the hell is Spence? I guess he's one of those random cardboard cutouts that have been walking through the movie for the past hour and a bit. He looked so much like 3 of the other background characters, and didn't have barely a line of dialogue, so I would have never suspected him. What a brilliant twist! So now we have a Licker... crappy CG but it's by far the best thing in the movie so far. Too bad every shot of it is so short that we never get to really see it in action. And now we have another classic cliché - the action/thriller countdown, conveniently displayed on screen in big, digital numbers. Oh, and followed up by the return of a character that we all thought was dead! How surprising. I can't wait for the next cliché. Hahah, there it is. ""Spence"" is a zombie and he jumped at Milla - shocking! She then uttered a one liner and hit him in the head. Just lucky we have the big green digital watchface counting down to the end of the movie! Can't wait for it to end.So, now the Licker is jumping around inside the train. Sparks are flying everywhere... This must be the ""climax"". Milla just bullet-time shot it in the head. Didn't see that coming... Oh... and it's dead already. That wasn't very impressive. Michelle Rodriguez turned into a zombie and got shot in the head... How tragic. I was so very attached to her ""angry"" style of acting.FINALLY! The movie is over - and the last shot was probably the most impressive thing in the movie. It looked kinda cool... But that was very unsatisfying. And now there's some awful, lame nu-metal blasting over the credits. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. PWSA should be ashamed. And if you liked this mess, you should be too.",Resident Evil

333,xeneize007,gimme flesh!,8,12 June 2002,"***SpOiLeRs AhEaD***First of all i must say i'm a fan of the videogames, and was expecting anxiously for the movie; which goes through all common terror/sci-fi paths, as no survivors of the accident or whatever it is, most of the rescue team is killed too soon, some get killed in the final confrontation and only the cute, brave chick and the handsome, brave guy are the only survivors; also it's very predictable, and not difficult to guess who will scape and who will be zombie meal; and you just know that nothing will be ok for more than 3 minutes; but i didn't realise what was going to happen in the end, although i figured out that we wouldn't be much time without an RE movie, like x-men it leaves you wanting for more blood and gore. And i must be some kind of jinx because all characters that i want them to survive always get killed; i guess they should have made a tv series because there's so much to tell about the RE, or at least a mini series. well i guess i'll have to wait until the next movie. But it's really a good effort from a not so good director, and the acting doesn't shine, but it's OK for a movie this type, and Jovovich is just as beautiful as ever. Other stuff i liked is the blue environmental lighting they are always in, and there are many (or enough) similarities with the VG, as the final fight with the monster in an underground train, the leading female character waering a mini, and the terrifying fact that umbrella (the evil corporation who owns ""The Hive"")will always get what they want. RE fans and any regular viewers will have a nice time as long as they don't expect any movie that can beat Cameron's Aliens as the best action-sci-fi-movie-with-monsters-and-explosions-and-slaughtered-people, but you'll have good time. hopefully the sequel will be everything this one isn't (at least less predictable, the major flaw, and scary, this one just isn't).

You love it or you hate it. Most of the criticism about the RE film is that it doesn't stick true to the games. This is true, but to be honest, it doesn't effect my opinion on the matter. I love it, but a lot of people hate it. This is why I like it.'Resident Evil' never struck me as a video game that could be made into a movie, but it did seem nicely done. Besides the bad acting throughout most of the movie, it was a pretty good movie. There was a lot of repetitive music but it was good because it totally fit the scenario and was pump-up music that was light then progresses to heavier and more intense. It was a bit slow at first but it gradually got faster, eventually I couldn't even notice the time passing by. The creatures were unique. There were interesting zombie-dogs and a massive four-legged creature in which I can't compare with anything running all over the place, it was quite freaky. The zombies were just typical zombies, no different than any other zombie movie you would see. 'Resident Evil' was entertaining and worth the 90 minutes you are spending,",Resident Evil

It's pure escapism, and it's fun to watch.I have to hand it to the creative team behind this one, as it cooks up new and creative ways to kill people.

I was actually stunned at how much I enjoyed RE. Yeah, it took a lot of liberties from the games, but it was very close to the story line and actually leads into the story lines from the games. Anderson did a good job of translating the main game elements (a secluded mansion, an underground lab, a viral outbreak, a mysterious pharmaceutical company and an employee that reports to somebody on the outside) and managed to wrap it all into one fresh, suspenseful entity with some nice editing and an energetic score.  There's been a lot of complaints that the movie has ripped off a lot of films, but what horror/action movie hasn't ripped off other movies?  And why start attacking here?

In my opinion when it comes to games like resident evil that have various story lines and many characters, it's kinda boring for a fan of the games to see the same characters and final bosses all over again, but this film has such an original resident evil storyline and original characters that I can easily see this movie fit in with story of the game without compromising the game. Mila Yovovich does a great job in this movie and I was amazed on how well she played that character, and let's not forget Michell Rodriguez which yet again shows us how much of a bad ass chick she can be.

340,enkephalin07,Good survival horror,8,16 January 2005,"I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.",Resident Evil

It is with great disappointment, then, that I must report that Resident Evil was none of those things.  There are so many problems with this film.  The main one being that all the characters and performances are excruciatingly one-note.  The worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez who never strays from that horrible scowl she has on her face the entire film.  Milla Jovovich, while nice to look at, gives a dull and lifeless performance.  The rest of the cast is simply forgettable.  This movie ends with a set-up for a sequel which LOOKS to be more promising than this one, but if Paul Anderson is in charge forget it. This doesn't measure up in any aspect to the classic George A. Romero zombie trilogy.  This movie takes the genre that Romero practically invented, (and which the video games admirably payed homage too) and destroys it.

I was disappointed with the changed characters, but the story was very much there.  And the special effects and gore were excellent.

Like most movies in the new age (2000s), most of the horror films are just put on the market for a minimal amount of scares and less than a 2 hour picture. This movie, in my eyes, was good, but easily could've been better with more airtime. One of the few good things about this movie though that saves it from being busts like ""Thirteen Ghosts"" and ""The Haunting"" is that it definitely took the bad label off video game movies which movies such as ""Double Dragon"" and ""Tomb Raider"" failed to master. The casting for Resident Evil is probably one of the main flaws of the movie. It including ""The Fast and the Furious"" star Michelle Rodriguez, who's character failed to entertain as a tough girl who's puns are more sickening than laughable. Also in the casting was Milla Jokovich, who had starred in Joan of Arc, before; I absolutely think that this actor has no skill whatsoever so i guess a role in this movie kinda fit her style. Regardless of the fact, she was good as a superhero but honestly, these two girls shouldn't of been on the top of the food chain.      All and all, the movie is good up until the ending, which drags on a bit too far leaving the viewer unsatisfied slightly and leading into a 'should be' sequel.

352,Poivoroinen,Play the games instead.,5,21 April 2002,"As ALL other game to movie this is a disappointment. Of course this is in the genre game to movie the best of it's genre.Complicated story (LOT'S of explaning) a lot of meleé actor's, and the zombies really stinks!That's the main problem with the film! It's already rated R, so why couldn't Andersson have brought out the gore more? That is one of the game's best bet, gore, thrill, horror simply. It's supposed to be a horrormovie, yet it's quite BORING! George A. Romero has done far better with Night of the Living Dead, and that was a black and white movie. The zombies in Resident Evil aint scary, they don't look dead.5/10. Oh, and Milla Jovovich is kinda flat in the movie, not at all the whamming experience that many imdbvoter's think she is.",Resident Evil
353,DarrenHorne,"Not great, but not awful. Watch with your brain switched to ""off""",5,7 March 2005,"I thoroughly enjoyed this zombie horror film that sets the scene for the hit Resident Evil computer game series. The sinister Umbrella Corporation runs a vast underground genetic research facility, known as The Hive, in which a viral outbreak occurs. A state of the art supercomputer, called the Red Queen, monitors the complex and responds by killing all within. The few survivors, including soldier with a conscience, Alice (Jovovich), suffer from memory loss as a result of the Queens gas attack. An Umbrella Commando team, who aims to shut down the computer and find out what has happened, soon joins them.From the opening scenes the tension is set on high as the all seeing, godlike Queen systematically eliminates the employees. The gory details are often left to the imagination, which is often far worse, particularly the decapitation scene.Fans of the game will know that the T-Virus will bring these people back from the dead as blood crazed zombies. Anderson keeps us waiting on the edge of our seats for that moment to finally happen. In the mean time he freaks us out with The Queen, who is spookily given the voice, and holographic image, of an English eight-year old girl. This works wonderfully, especially when she states ""I have been a very, very bad girl"".Jovovich is superb and wears a gorgeous red dress and mini skirt contraption, along with big black boots that show off her stunning legs that seem to lead all the way to the Promised Land. She is also kept soaking wet for much of the film.The suspense is top notch, with inventive camera angles and direction that will have you transfixed to the screen before hitting you with jump in your seat shocks. Marilyn Mansons soundtrack is ideally suited and adds to the creepy atmosphere.Unfortunately there are too many minor characters, all of which are underdeveloped and two-dimensional. This is made worse by the amount of relative unknowns, Rodriquez being the only other recognisable actress, and she delivers a monotonous performance that is far from the Vasquez like character that she is clearly based on. The dialogue and script are terrible, and some of the characters lumber along with less life than the soulless zombies that hunt them. The big bad monster is a horrific CGI creation that, thankfully, has a very brief role. This film suffers from the 15 certificate, and comes across as a little child-like. I would have liked a little more stamping on zombie head gore and greater shocks, perhaps even some genuine fear. However, it is aimed partly at the younger game playing audience and the lower certificate is understandable. The downbeat ending works well though, and will have you reaching for your control pad to play out the rest of the story.Ultimately this is a simple action/horror film that borrows heavily from films such as Aliens. There are some occasional great scenes and it is certainly worth switching off you brain and getting the beers and munchies in for some juvenile Friday night entertainment.",Resident Evil
354,Untoten,Great zombie flick!,8,4 July 2021,"Way too underrated movie! As a kid I remember this was scary as hell and even today 2021 it holds up pretty well.

355,beav33-1,A nice addition to the zombie genre,8,24 July 2005,"The first time I saw this film as a rental, it seemed pretty average. After multiple viewings via cable (it seems to be a favorite on HBO), my opinion has gone well up.The film does not necessarily have tons of scares, but plenty of suspense and action. I've always believed that Anderson has done a great job of creating isolation spaces, and this is no different.The acting is also decent, Michelle Rodriguez is not great, but let's face it is great to look at. I like Eric Mabius quite a bit, and Milla is as convincing as one might be with a supermodel kicking ass etc.All in all I'd recommend the film, however the sequel was another matter.",Resident Evil

I guess they tried to make the movie enjoyable for the people who already knew Resident Evil and the people who never heard about the game or the series story.... When they started with that ""the hive"" bullshit I just wanted to die! Where was the Resident Evil that I was expecting since I knew they were making a Resident evil movie?.... If you're a Resident Evil fan you can watch this, but don't expect to see that much of classical elements of the games here....just an average action movie....nothing more than it.....",Resident Evil

Unlike most other movies that are based on games (ie. Wing Commander), Resident Evil is so close of the game that it scared me more than the nasties on the screen. Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, and the memory loss thing is just a bit too convenient, nevertheless I enjoyed the rollercoaster ride that this movie provided.In a nutshell its blood, gore, sexy ladies and damn nasty zombies. The movied played out as nicely as the game and so I figured it was a good way to spend a almostly drizzly afternoon.8/10.",Resident Evil
358,adamzad,Even low expectations weren't enough...,1,1 March 2005,"to save this pile of rubbish.There is only *one* thing that can be said in favor of this movie: Surprisingly, for the first time in my memory, Milla Jovovich actually looks GOOD. In flicks like The Fifth Element, it never ceased to amaze me the lengths she would go to to make herself look hideous. In this, I didn't even know it was her until I saw the name in the credits here on IMDb. Yowsa. Yummy.Now, about the movie... It's worthless. The ""plot"" is weak, character development is half a step from non-existent, the premise is a rehash of dozens of old zombie movies mixed with the crazed supercomputer taken from dozens of other flicks, the acting is as you would expect from low budget B-Grade horror fare, and the scenery & effects are of the level that could be achieved in my basement with odds and ends I have lying around the house.This is what I will begin calling a ""Time-Machine Movie."" Meaning I wish I had a time machine to go back and recover the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on this schlock. It's too late for me, but you can save yourself from this impressive effort to lower the standards of mediocrity even farther than they already are.",Resident Evil
359,teslaman,Solid!!,9,29 November 2007,"As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this. I haven't played the game so i had no idea what to expect and had nothing to compare with. I really feel that this pays homage to the old zombie films at least to an extent. The zombies here are a little bit faster though.It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in ""The fifth element"" and also the character in the later ""Ultraviolet"" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this. I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.If you like zombie and action films you'll certainly like this one.",Resident Evil
360,plu4085,Why get so sloppy?,3,6 February 2006,"I was really disappointed with this movie, which had a pretty good reputation and ""buzz"" upon release. It started out well, but about 30 minutes into it a feeling of cheesiness came creeping over me. There were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic, etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling. The lead characters are unsympathetic or incomprehensible, and given no support by the weak actors.This movie follows the exact same pattern and weaknesses as Anderson's ""Event Horizon"", which however suffered less from its problems.",Resident Evil
361,enc1no,Unpremeditated?,8,2 April 2003,"Possible spoilers withinThe filmmakers creates, maybe inadvertently, a cold, dead scenery. Very much like the mentality and characteristics of Zombies.

This makes the movie work. Actually.",Resident Evil
362,MadMark96,Not as bad as I remember.,7,3 November 2021,"When I first watched this many moons ago I had the same reaction as every other fan. What does this have to do with the games, this is terrible. It didn't help either that the movies got progressively worse and worse as time went on. However this movie right here is actually really not bad. For what it is, Paul decided to tell an original story in the resident evil universe and I think it's pretty neat. Has lots of intense moments and a good cast of characters with good pacing and the nods to the game that are in there are great. Some questionable story changes but whatever. Overall it's not terrible and a fun movie to watch. The action scenes are really nicely done and not over the top and stupid like the rest of the movies which are THE definition of cash grab. It was very interesting seeing how much this movie also impacted the games. Alice was doing crazy kicks and neck snaps on zombies that were later used by Leon and Hunk in resident evil 4 and the red queen and the thigh zombie kill being used in Umbrella chronicles was also interesting. Whether this was a positive influence on the game franchise is a whole different discussion so I'm just gonna stick to the topic. Worth a watch if you're a fan of the games or not.",Resident Evil
363,onionbagel,Great video game-movie adaptation!,8,29 January 2017,"Let me start off by saying 2 things: 1. I have played all the ""core"" Resident Evil games (1-6). 2. I like the 6 movies more than the 6 games.Review for if you've played the game(s): The first Resident Evil movie starts off in the mansion much like the first game, but doesn't stay there long. Alice (the protagonist) (NOT in the games!) wakes up with no memory and ends up going below the mansion to a place called ""The Hive"" (Umbrella Corp's secret facility). Her and a group of Umbrella spec-ops are tasked with containing/killing a leaked virus before the infection spreads across the city above (and the rest of the world). There are of course zombies and ""lickers"" (from the games), but also an ""enemy"" called ""The Red Queen"" who is the security AI that locked down ""The Hive"" to contain the disease. In the end, Alice (and one other member) escapes to find Umbrella scientists waiting for them back in the mansion. Alice is taken to a lab in Raccoon City and her friend is put into the ""Nemesis Program"".Review for if you HAVEN'T played the game(s): A girl named Alice wakes up with no memory in a fake mansion above a secret government facility. In this facility, a virus is spread and the facility is locked down by the AI running the place. Alice and some spec-ops agents must kill/contain the infected in order to prevent the spreading of disease to the city above (and the rest of the world). FINAL VERDICT: If you're into action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above, you'll like this movie.

Milla does a good job with the lead despite the fact her acting skills are limited her sexiness makes up for that! Michelle Rodriguez Is Perfect in this role and she really impressed me . I had my worries when i saw Paul Anderson because i hated Event Horison And i hated AvP ( grrr avp is the worst movie ever made, it brought shame to both franchises ) but to my surprised it was pretty damn good. The licker I'm sad to say looked horrible it did really really bad but everything that was bad about this movie is eventually washed from your mind.

365,HoraceBury,"Faced paced action, a bit of gore, beautiful woman.",8,15 July 2002,"Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of recent movies.Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little clothing or script available sometimes.  Some might say that she was a little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I like to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come on guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'.  My only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram a bit more.  My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite frequently.All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget for the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype.  I must congratulate the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing Commander' - yes, I stand by that).",Resident Evil
366,musica1,"The main actors were excellent, but the zombies were laughable.",5,16 March 2002,"After seeing this movie, I had mixed emotions.  The actors did a much better job than others in movies based on video games.  The characters were people that you actually cared about and who seemed real enough to feel like they could be people you know.  James Purefoy as Spencer was especially interesting, adding layers as the film progressed.Unfortunately, the main plot of Resident Evil revolves around zombies. In this day and age, that shouldn't be difficult to make interesting.  A little imagination on the part of the makeup and wardrobe departments and some creative directing could've made this quite exciting.  Instead,I felt that I was teleported back to the 1950's, with slow zombies walking stiff-armed and looking less scary than those in Michael Jackson's Thriller.  At the screening I attended the audience actually giggled at some places in the movie which were supposed to be scary.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't either really bored or a big fan of the video game.

Anderson) being very poorly directed and boring.The acting is terrible, and all the characters from this film just seem just way too plain and bland to care about them. The story it is dumb and original as it can be, repeating several of the clichés used in every previous zombie film that have been done to death (No pun-intended) ""Resident Evil"" it's a lame film, being way too overrated and boring.

Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the movie should be like and what they really like about the games differs too. The things I like about this movie is Milla, zombies, and guns. The things I don't like about this movie is the story could have been better. The screenplay could have been better. And especially the Lickers, they should have been better. I'm really not really a big Licker fan, I would have rather have seen Hunters instead. Either way, the lickers were a little weak, but they definitely made an effort to improve the Lickers in the sequel. I really don't like zombie dogs. You mean a zombie man cannot run, but a dog can? Makes no sense. I understand this movie was also made to set the stage for other future movies and sometimes I hate that. I love for each movie to tell its own story without having to worry about leaving something for later. The scene with the laser security system was cool, reminded me of the cool scene in Ghost Ship. This movie is okay to watch from time to time, but its really something that I wont watch more than once every few months. I love zombie movies but I have others that are better than this.

Anderson movies are trash tier and a poor representation of the franchise.Poorly written dialogues, nonsensical plot and set design,unlistenable soundtrack, wooden acting and Milla Jovovich's Alice being a complete Mary Sue really bring this movie down. Even if there are some positives like some of the characteristic monsters from the original RE trilogy being represented (mostly) accurately, the negatives far outweight them. This movie is unwatchable for me.If you are craving for some good Resident Evil movies, go watch the Sony produced CGI ones.

The Punisher, Captain America, Superman, Batman... they never captured the essence of the comic book.  We needed a director like Martin Scorsese to direct Batman.  The good thing is, films based off of comic books have finally come of age with the coming of Spider-Man, X-Men... and hopefully The Hulk.Video games turned films seem to just be in it's infancy.  We had Super Mario Bros.  Ugh.  Street Fighter?  Ouch (RIP, Raul Julia... that should not have been your last film)!  But hey, Resident Evil wasn't bad!!  And look, Silent Hill is on the horizon!!

Milla Jovovich apart from being beautiful is now the holder of the Sigourney Weaver title of female bad guy ass kicker, and she dominates the sceen when ever she is on it as I couldn't take my eyes off her, and Michelle Rodriguez as the fiesty Rain was using her trade mark pout to maximum effect.On the negative side, the Zombies just were just not scary, and Ive seen better horror makeup in other films, one zombie I noticed was trying very hard not to laugh, and the sceen in the tunnel gave me the feeling the zombie gang, were all waiting off sceen ready for the director to say go before they all joined the shot.  The laser guard was good, and its special gory effects was good but the final laser victim of the traditional black man victim death was a waste of the best of the supporting characters, and was to brief to be really shocking, but this was understandable given the films British 15 certificate.  The zombie dogs though were good, and even gave me at 45 years old a start, and the way Milla took care of them, was in tune with the films source for action, well done Milla.As for the super baddie licker dog, it was all a bit fast in the train to get a real good look at it, but it gave off enough evil intent to be the best of the baddies.The ending sceen was really good, but before that who was the person walking across the screen before Milla escapes from the hospital, one of the crew? The final panoramic sceen sets the tone nicely for a sequel that I'll probably be going to see.Verdict, just enough gore, a reasonable adherance to the game play, and the lovely Milla Jovovich, showing lots of flesh and kicking zombie ass.",Resident Evil

Milla Jovovich is a knockout, and some of the zombie attacks are kind of scary, but this movie tries to make up in stylized action what it lacks in plot. Nowhere near as lame as House of the Dead, but perhaps video games should remain games, not movies. Still, Resident Evil had a few great death scenes.

It is a competent survival movie where a group of people have to escape an underground deathtrap with a crazy AI, zombies and worse. It is cheesy but it is also good fun. The movie have a lot of twists and turns in it but it somehow manages to stay reasonable coherent considering all of the elements it mixes into the story from a killer AI, zombies, monsters, amnesia, conspiracies, betrayals and more.I think that the actors did a good job with what they were given and i found myself really warming up to the remaining military guys. Its a shame that they died so abruptly at the end of the movie. With all of this said i would not recommend this movie to just anyone. It is certainly not on my ""must see"" list and i would not recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of the genre.

I saw one of them say something about zombies not as good as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and a train not as big as ""Ghosts of Mars."" Doesn't he get it? The zombies were pretty much exactly as they were the game -shambling, shuffling along until they are close enough to attack, and then diving in for that bite! The train, of course, was lifted pretty much exactly from the game. They weren't trying for a ""Ghosts of Mars"" type thing.Milla was amazing. I read another review that claimed ""Tomb Raider"" would be considered a better movie because it had a higher babe factor. Well yes, Angelina Jolie is a babe, but guess what, so is Milla.

All the personnel die agonizing, after moments, bit a bit, and ""the beehive"" remains inactive. There appears Alice (Mile J.) in the shower of the bath, but she does not remember anything of anything. The mansion appears where she lives (identical to that of the video game RESIDENT EVIL 1) and on having tried to go out of the mansion, someone her enters again in the house by force (the first fright). He is Matt Adison. The group of commands appear rapidly, breaking the windows of the mansion. The group of commandos this one led by the commander James (Colin Samon), and formed principally by Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan, Salinas, and Medic. The commandos interrogate Matt, he says to them that he is a policeman of Raccon city. nonetheless they take him as a prisoner. Rapidly, and without explanations, the commander directs to the whole group towards a secret door that gives to a species of underground. There in the underground stores (identical to those of a real video game) on having come to the train that joins the mansion with the beehive, they find Spencer Praks (James P.), who also suffers of amnesia.He is the supposed husband of Alice. From this moment, both, Alice and Spencer remember during the whole movie, bit a bit, recovering the memory. The whole group goes in train up to ""the beehive"". There they discover that quite this solitary, and the commandos put hands to the work your mission. They speak about the beehive and of the computer that directs everything and that supposedly madman has turned, the so called red queen. Immediately, the commander James and three commandos more, remain caught in a trap. Enclosed in a corridor, a red laser them is departing from one in one (first, medic loses the head, after another the fingers of the hand, another commando is departed in two, and finally the commander is he throw thousand pieces). After this unexpected event (and very gore), Alice and the demas, safely someone already, deactivate the red queen (the first appearance of the girl). On the other hand, Rain and two commandos more, together with Matt of prisoner, discover a woman zombie (the first walking zombie, exactly at the half hour of the movie). The zombie attacks and bites Rain, and the whole loader shoots this one, but the bush. There joins to the group Alice and the others, and appears zombies for all sites, surrounding them. There is a great gunfire, but the commandos do not manage to kill to anybody zombie. They all try to escape, and ultimately after the alone holocaust they remain alive, Alice, Matt, Rain, Kaplan, and Spencer. Matt manages to escape of his captivity and avoids to the offices. Matt, discovers your sister, Liza, but it is a zombie. Alice fights against the doberman zombie (killing all spectacularly). Alice kills to Combat, and Matt tells Alice who is a secret agent with the aim to unmask Umbrella's company and extracting to the light your secret experiments.From these events, more zombies and spectacular situations. Alice reveals herself to if same she turns into the real heroine of the movie. In the distance to your destiny, Rain is attacked and bitten often by some zombies. They all come to Umbrella's laboratory and there there discovers the reality of the plot of the movie (Spencer's real role is explained to us, that in the end, it is the wicked one of the movie). Spencer betrays Alice, and makes all enclosed. Giant appears the monster zombie and one eats it. The red queen makes clear that Rain must die in order that the demas survive, but Alice does not want to kill her. There appears Kaplan, to which him believe dead man, and he saves to all. The monster zombie giant chases them. They come to the train and there this one Spencer, dead man. He turns in zombie and Alice murders it of a palazo in the head. They ignite in train and flee. Alice gives the antidote against the virus to Rain (that this very bad). Appears again, the monster zombie giant and kills Kaplan. Alice and Matt try to kill it but they cannot. Matt is hurt by the monster. Rain turns in zombie and attacks Matt. Matt kills Rain, and drives also a button in order that the monster zombie giant is destroyed against the route of train.Matt and Alice are saved, and are the surviving only ones. On having come to the mansion, Matt's wound begins to mutar, and Alice scares. They appear suddenly, a few rare types and they remove them to the two by force. One of the doctors says: "" we will put him in the project NEMESIS "". Alice remains incoscient. After a relax, Alice wakes up in a room of operations. Alone this one. There is nobody. Quite this desert. she goes out from the hospital to the street. There the great this desolate avenue, and everything looks like a chaos, as if a catastrophe had happened. A newspaper says: "" the dead men walk!! "". Alice takes a shotgun of a car policeman, and wait .... soon the second part, RESIDENT EVIL ""NEMESIS""",Resident Evil
387,illimattic,This movie is great!,10,5 March 2004,"I love this movie! I like the story, characters, plot and storyline! Milla Jovovich is great as the female heroine. The zombies are cool, the laser scene, and the licker.I like the twist near the end, and the ending is the perfect intro to the sequel. Forget what others have said about the movie, just watch this movie for the fun of it!While it may not be as gory as the zombie movies in the past, it is still good, and this movie doesn't just incorporate zombies, but other enemies in the games as well. so its more than just a zombie movie. If you are a hardcore zombie lover then you might not like it, but otherwise its very entertaining! If you get into the character's I'm sure you'll like the film. My Grade = A.",Resident Evil
388,isabelbutic,subpar B movie,4,23 February 2004,"I was hoping it would be creepier than it was. But as a few other posters already pointed out- the director is not very good at creating suspenseful situations or characters you care about. I agree with another poster who said that the editing was really disjointed. Characters appear in places, and you don't know how they got there. There are some plot holes as well, i.e. why was the ""cop"" there to begin with? How did he know about the mansion? I knew this movie wasn't going to be a work of art or anything. I knew plot and all that were not that important, but at least it could have been scary.",Resident Evil
389,daffyphack,"""Take him to the nemesis project.""",8,22 March 2002,"Bollicks to you, Glacier.  You talk as if a midget with brass knuckles was punching you in the balls during the duration of the movie.  I'll agree with anyone who says this film wasn't art, but it was NOT a bad movie.  I'm not gonna nominate it for an Oscar, but it was entertaining, and much more so than ""Tomb Raider."" And before we get into the ""you don't know the game"" issue, let it be known that I am a diehard fanatic of the Resident Evil series, having played all of the games, owning two, and having beaten both ""2"" and ""Veronica"".  The game itself consists of walking around rooms being frightened by sounds, and very often there isn't much zombie fighting involved.  Granted, ninja kicks to the heads of Dobermans forced my eyebrow to rise a little, but I let it pass, especially once they showed the Licker (only complaint I have is that such a weak character would be made into the ""boss"").  The special effects weren't great, and I found myself chuckling to myself at the sight of the zombies, but what got me into the film was the constant ambience.  It played just like the game, with more moments where you're scared of the silence than gunplay against approaching zombies.  As for accuracy to the game, it's not all there (if it was, they'd be able to hold eight guns at a time, and eat plants to cure their wounds), but as it is a prequel, it doesn't have much to stick to anyway.  The beginning introductions were accurate, and the ending was seamless, as well as being extremely creepy. And while I had expected to hate this movie, as video game transitions typically suck eggs (i.e. Super Mario Bros), I was very pleasantly surprised, and while I can't repeat enough that I wasn't blown away by the depth or artistry involved with the film, it was a good, mindless, lets-shoot-the-hell-out-of-some-zombies movie.  And if this series which seems like it's gonna sprout is true AND chronological, it's only gonna get cooler.  Anyone who remembers a specific line from the end of the movie, and knows what it's referring to...you know I'm right.",Resident Evil
390,zombear,Well done!,8,18 March 2002,"Not only is this the best movie to come from a video game since Paul Anderson's own Mortal Kombat (RE may have even topped MK), it's the best American zombie movie in ages!  Sure, it could have been more atmospheric (the RE games provide a feeling of dread that the movie didn't equal) and there could have been more gore, but as it is, it's still an astounding effort.  The creature effects were good (though the CG-ness of some of them was too noticeable), the zombies were creepy and relentless, and Milla Jovovich was fantastic (and hot!)  It ain't quite Night Of The Living Dead or Return Of The Living Dead but it's better than most of the Italian gore-fests, and certainly worth seeing a time or two.",Resident Evil
391,silverandblack72,Not bad..,7,16 March 2002,"After having just seen RE, and being a HUGE fan of the video games since their inception, I will say that this movie wasn't bad.  It wasn't great like the video games though.  Everything in the movie was very professionally done and the F/X looked great!  However, the movie lacked what the video game provided, and that is a sense of horror...of genuine fright.  I am a 30 year old male, and when I first started playing RE I would avoid playing the games at night...cause...well...I'm sure you get the picture.  The movie had nearly none of that terror or suspense.  Sure, there was some parts but on the whole it was a little dissappointing.  I would have preferred that the movie stay in either the urban areas of Racoon City (ie., RE2, RE3), instead of the movie created ""Hive"".  It was an interesting idea thought and might have been better had it been fleshed out a little bit more.  Anyways, this is a entertaining movie and most fans of RE should enjoy.  Oh, and Milla is superfreakin hot in this.  WOW!!",Resident Evil
392,foxbrick,"a dull disappointment, even for a videogame film",1,16 March 2002,"Despite good-enough performances from Jovovich, Rodriguez, and the rest of the cast, there is little more good to be said for this film, aside from some handsomely unhandsome zombies.  Did we need a cross between CUBE and Romero's zombie trilogy with an even more ridiculous version of ALIEN's anticorporate slant (when anticorporatism becomes as ridiculous as this, it certainly undercuts real anticorporatism)?  Nonsensical doubletalk, an idiot-plot from the beginning, and not even much in the way of interesting violence.  So, go to see Milla J be fetching and Michelle R be sardonic, but you can probably do that with some other films which might also entertain you.",Resident Evil

394,jwerwin80,"Cool idea, but poorly executed. The script is boring.",3,2 September 2002,"The basic idea for this movie is pretty cool, and visually the movie is engaging. Unfortunately, it looks like they spent all their money on visual effects and creating a cool look, and nothing on the script. One of the basic rules of story telling is show, don't tell. Most of scenes involve the characters standing around explaining to each other (i.e. explaining to us in the audience) what is happening. This makes the story move incredibly slow.The most interesting part of the story is how Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. She knows that she's directly involved somehow, but doesn't know what she's done. Unfortunately she never reveals much about herself, so we don't get to know her enough to care about her. There are a couple of very awkward partial nude scenes that look painfully like the producers wanted to show Jovovich naked and she wouldn't play ball.
This one really isn't worth the effort. The action scenes are few and far between, and aren't very well done. The story is so painfully slow that it seems to take forever to get started, and never really delivers enough energy to put you on the edge of your seat. It's really a shame because there are some very cool plot elements to the story, but it's just so poorly written that you're left wondering what this movie could have been if it had been given to a capable writer.",Resident Evil
395,prodigy-25,A trash can filler.,2,5 April 2008,"What to say - I understand that movies inspired by computer games are somewhat limited by their origins but this can't be taken as a good excuse for just anything. That, what is acceptable in a game, is not in a movie. You see, ""DOOM"" wasn't good either but it was better.Even the fact that the movie starts quite promising only adds to your disappointment when zombies appear. Cheap, cheap, cheap...Original? You'll see a computer with self-preservative instinct, amnesia victims, underground (literally) secret labs, a corporative private army, a deadly virus, a predictable betrayal and all kind of old third-rate nonsense. Scary? Then only scary thing I found about RE is that you can advertise this kind of hackwork as an art and get away with it. Entertaining? You'll thank god that this realm of boredom only lasts for 1.5 hours (more than needed anyway).2/10 for Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy. There's pretty much nothing else to look at.",Resident Evil
396,Urbanmetropolis,Resident Evil Summary,8,2 November 2002,"The Game adapted ""Resident Evil"" shows great action, a nicely done score and some rememberable scenes... though the film doesn't introduce any characters from the game... it still hands down a good plot and some good characters to go with it.",Resident Evil
397,AdamWhite1421,"Average, but better than expected",6,17 July 2004,"This movie should be terrible. It's director has an awful track record (although I did enjoy Event Horizon), It's full of unknown actors and it's based on a video game. But somehow, I enjoyed it. It's not going to go into my top ten list, or even my top 100, but it is an enjoyable way to waste an evening. The special effects were terrible and the action scenes cliched and badly done but it all adds to the appeal of the film. The game itself is very tongue-in-cheek and the movie reflects this, although not quite as much. It could have been a lot worse than it was and I suppose that adds a lot to the reason why I don't give it too bad a mark. An average film, but entertaining nonetheless.6/10",Resident Evil
398,ETAe,Better than expected for this game fan!,9,21 March 2002,"I must say this is a way more accurate translation of game-to-movie than any of the others! I thought Milla would have been lame for this one, but she fit perfectly. I like the cinematic look of this film. As a Resident Evil fan, I am glad they took a huge chunk of the actual plot of the game series and told it in an entertaining movie-like way. And unlike the game, this movie allowed the characters to fight with their hands as well as weapons!They seem to have combined the first three Resident Evil games into one, in a sense. But the sequel will be more of the latter two. There were quite a bit of shocking moments in this one, and I love the effects! The acting was also really good for a cast of people I haven't really seen before (except for Jovovich of course -- and she looks real good here!).Some issues I have... they left out the huge sky-high creature like at the end of the first RE game, and there is no rescue plan. But I suppose they're tying the ending of RE1 and beginning of RE2 into the movie's sequel. The commandos were not called S.T.A.R.S. here, at least I don't recall, but they should have been. Also, the music is pretty good but I was hoping they would use some piano pieces, which in my opinion would be scarier. The majority of silence was done well though, because the games are like that as well. One last gripe is that the whole movie was mainly in the lab, and not in the mansion like the game (thus ""resident"").All in all, I give it a 9 out of 10! :)",Resident Evil
399,simpeton,"Really, REALLY, Bad",1,30 July 2002,"The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as follows:1:  They never established a sense of utter hopelessness.  In any Zombie flick this is the key.  Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow.  The only way to make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.  It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger.  There are scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do little.  Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!2.  While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the 60's.  Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all.  Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of the high tech goings on.All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Zombie"", an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr. Romero came out with ""Dawn of the Dead"".  If you go with ""Resident Evil"", you will regret it before you finish the movie.",Resident Evil
400,hireswell,I Cannot believe I Paid Money to See this Garbage!,1,17 March 2002,"The gift of the IMDB is that it gives people like me the oppurtunity to voice his reaction to a film and now I am going to indulge on this privilege. THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN! First of all the music overwhelmed the dialogue: during the action sequences the actors lips would be moving but all you would hear would be the techno-musical score that resembled the sound of a hammer pounding on a bag full of electronics. Perhaps the filmakers were so embarassed of their final product that they tried to cover it up with the soundtrack. Another thing that I noticed was that there were few establishing master shots, so the actors would go from room to room and the audience would not have a clear idea of where they were coming from or where they were going. It could be that the producers didn't want to invest any money into a good production design so we are stuck with tight, cookie-cutter shots of the enviroment. That takes me to the story itself, which is nothing more than elements from other, better movies (Alien, Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak). And worst of all, just when you think it's over, the movie adds on an epilogue to set up a sequel. All I can do is hope that this film losses enough money to convince the producers that to make a sequel would be truly evil.",Resident Evil
401,tsnake,Wow...,8,15 March 2002,"I expected to enjoy this one... but not as much as I did. It is extremely VIOLENT and overtly brutal. Any parent bringing their kids to this should be put in jail ;) I've not played the game... but might look into it now.The FX were pretty sweet, but weren't the main focus. The main focus, as it appeared to me, was a First Person Shooter (FPS) in REAL life. While watching, I kept thinking about how I was feeling the same sensations as when I played an intense gaming session. The game Thief had me nervous at many corners, this movie did that too. But the story was still great. No more far fetched than any other piece of fiction based on fears of genetic testing. :)I'm giving it an 8/10",Resident Evil

With immediately forgettable characters (who you couldn't care less about whether or not they live or die) laughable, garish special effects, and extremely unfrightening zombie things as the primary terror delivery systems, ""Resident Evil"" doesn't have enough action, scares, or anything else for that matter to satisfy anyone. Not horror junkies, not video game fans, not even teenage boys looking for a lowbrow 90 minute diversion.  It's even more glaringly bad when you consider that its left itself open for a sequel... *sigh* Well as long as people keep pouring millions and millions of dollars into crud, unoriginal movies, Hollywood'll keep pumping them out.",Resident Evil

Personally, if I think a movie will be good I tend not to read movie reviews before I see as they can really throw your judgement going in.First off I must say... I love the resident evil line of games, they are the only games I have ever owned, they seem to be the only games I like. I cant explain that, but solving puzzles and killing the living dead just does it for me. So when I heard that my fav game series is to be brought to life on film I thought, cool.But then I heard who was directing it. Paul W.S.Anderson. Mr. Mortal Kombat... the man who helmed the unbelieveably bad ""soldier""  So thias lowered my expectations to almost flatlining. But, nonetheless I read some of the IMDB user comments on this movie and wel, most of them were in praise of it, so I took my chances and went to see it.I must say My lower expectations helped a lot. I was genuinely frightened by this movie, the only other film that has ever scared me was the sixth sense. Dont get me wrong this is no where near that level of film, but it makes good on the genre its based. Although the score (of lack of) can be a tad annoying at times, distorted guitars dont always provide a good backrop and sometimes, it was unecessary.If your reading, Im not going to say much about the story, cuz its resident evil, less I say is more for you. But the movie plays a lot like the game, the twists, the action... all very cool, and familiar.I loved this film, because I love the games, it was just like another game.

I give it a 3.  1 - for convincing someone to make the film.  1 - for the really good soundtrack.  1 - for gore.  That's it.

408,Stevieheuge,Evil Never Dies...,9,3 December 2002,"As an avid fan of all the RE games, I eagerly anticipated this movie for years, and when it finally hit the cinemas, i was not disappointed.Paul Anderson both wrote and directed Resident Evil, and decided to make it pretty different from the games, which worried a lot of fans.He is however, introducing many of the games characters into the sequel in 2003.*review with SPOILERS*Resident Evil was slated by many critics, and its easy to see why. One look at the cast would put most critics off, because it is plain to see that Resident Evil was written and casted to be a COOL movie, not a well acted thriller. Simply put, it is the type of movie that the critics love to hammer.The first half hour of the film is all build up, getting more and more intense as Milla Jovovich wakes up in a mansion confused and without memory. Soon she is confronted with a crack military team, who explain that she is a security officer in the mansion, which is merely a front for the underground biological weapon research lab that lies beneath it...The crew along with Jovovich head down into the 'hive' to see what has gone wrong, and to shut down the 'Red Queen' (the automated computer which controls the hive). Needless to say, the place is crawling with zombies, and all hell breaks loose.The performances in each of the lead roles are solid enough, apart from Eric Mabius, who is a bit wooden. Milla Jovovich is surprisingly good in the role of Alice, and does well in the martial art-type action scenes.Paul Anderson has decided to make Resident Evil as much of an action movie as it is a horror, making it all the more entertaining, and while the jumpy moments and scares are second to none, with perfect timing and an excellent score by Marilyn Manson all adding to the effect, each of the action scenes - particularly the ones including the Hellhounds and the licker, are edge of the seat stuff.The finale of Resident Evil is a thriller and then some, with the  remaining survivors trying to escape via a speeding underground train. We then see the unexpected return of the licker, which, after shredding Martin Crewes to pieces, is disposed of with great effect.Anderson also does a good job of presenting us with cliches, such as Michelle Rodriguez being so close to death, but getting the antidote to the virus at the last second - but then totally reverses them by allowing her to turn anyway. He also used the old, ""unexpected survivor who returns at the end"" ploy (Crewes), but then allows him to be obliterated unexpectedly as well, confirming to the viewer that no-one is safe.The last ten minutes of the movie are very, very impressive, with the final scene being so powerful, that it sets up the soon to come sequel perfectly...As with any movie, there are a few things that could have been better.The CGI effects on the licker in its earlier scenes could have been much better, but this was probably down to the budget.Also, a few more scenes where one or two zombies appear, and are quite easily disposed of would have been nice, instead of the mass hoards of them constantly flooding the rooms.All in all, Resident Evil is everything it was meant to be - a cool gory action horror, with a lot of death, and a few surprises too...Superb. - 9 out of 10.",Resident Evil

When I saw the tv ads I said to my self "" Man that doesn't look like it would be any good"" So I didn't go to the Theater to see it(big mistake).In stead I got the DVD and when I watched, I was blown away by how good it was. The composing, The camera work and the creature creation were outstanding not to mention the acting and script were decent.The begining and ending of this film are symbolic to each other and are by far the best begining and ending sequences I have ever seen in a Film.

Memorable scenes recreated in live action showing that not all game to film movies suck.  Anderson, jovovich, rodriguez, they're all fans of the series and that represents the voice of all the other fans who made the series what it is today.  Compared to other zombie flicks like night of the living dead, this film is more believable since its explanation for what's going on is actually possible and it makes sense why these zombies are actually dangerous.  I mean, in NOTLD, the zombies moved like a block an hour.  How can anybody really get caught by them if they actually tried to get away?",Resident Evil

I have never played this game so I had only known there are many zombies and people fight them. After watching this movie, I surprised that characters are very attractive. This story is not only scary but also describe of human involvement. Alice, who is a main character of this film has no memories when she awakes. As the story goes on, gradually she regains own memories. I think these flashback scenes are great. We can realize many things at the same time she remembers her memory. It is very exciting to revere many secrets such as who is she and what she wanted to do before she lost her memories. There are many zombies and cruel scenes so this film is scary for me.

It made Mission to Mars look like an epic.  The film is just nonsense action followed by nonsense action.  None of the characters are ever developed, they try but the actors obviously don't know what they were supposed to be doing, so the audience never figures it out.  Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice. They have the typical problem that bad horror films have of inconsistency. Sometimes, one thing will kill a monster and in a different scene, someone does the same thing to the monster 25 times and it hardly flinches.  I guess it was supposed to be a prequel for the video games, but even with that it seemed unfinished at all levels.  I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it.  I wish I had just fallen asleep and had some productive time for my 5 bucks.",Resident Evil

All of these film I begyou to watch! This one however, ..second to all of the above. I dontreally blame Anderson. I think the material he had to work with is abit dull. Flesh eating zombies was a cool idea ONCE. Continuallyhitting that dead horse(no pun intended) has become very boringfor the viewers. Anderson managed to get all you can fromJovovich. The other actors fell under the old Star Trek philosophy,(If you aint seen 'em before, there going to die, has anyone elseEVER seen these people in ANYTHING?) so I guess flushing outthere characters would of been a waste of time. All and all Resident Evil was just a 90 minute lead in to the sequel. I've got my fingers crossed that Anderson can write and directhimself out of this corner and provide his fans with a reason to seehis next non-Resident Evil film.",Resident Evil
414,mrtacoman,I give it a 2 out of 10!,3,19 March 2002,"I went into this movie expecting a decent adaptation of the game series, but instead I got Matrix ripoff crap.It's not that the atmosphere wasn't there, my main problems with the film had to do with the main character played by Milla Jovovich. First off, they make a big point to show that the zombies can take quite a few bullets without any effect, yet when Milla kicks a zombie in the chest, it's dead. Uh huh. Yeah,okay. Then she kills another one by hitting it in the back with a paperweight later on. When cornered by the dogs, she manages to hit a bunch of moving targets with expert accuracy, then kicks a dog who was jumping while her back is turned, killing it instantly. How'd she know the dog was jumping? Then there's a damn bullet-time moment towards the end, I swear the Matrix ruined action films forever with that s***.After seeing the film, I can only assume that Resident Evil takes place in The Matrix and Milla Jovovich is actually The One.Then there's the whole thing that bothered me in the beginning of the film. The soldiers are strapped to the gills with explosives and automatic weapons, yet they are unaware of the fact that there are zombies and creatures in the lab. They think they're just there to shut down a computer.Why the hell would you need HK's to shut down a frickin computer?Resident Evil would probably be a decent film if I was about 10 years old and had never played the games. The hand to hand combat aspect was totally out of place, I know I wouldn't touch an infectious zombie if I were in the same situation, I think I'd rather run like hell.It is the best video game adaptation to date though, so I had to give it at least a 2 for effort. Paul Anderson, please leave video games and classic films alone. If you must continue to make s***** movies, at least ruin something original and don't bring down the quality of what's already been made well.",Resident Evil
415,mrtacoman,Arrrrrrrrghh!,3,24 April 2002,"Y'know, I've often said that movies are like music. There's no deciding whether something is bad or good, it's in the eye of the beholder. This mass of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but were 10 times more fun.In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich naked...(Sarcasm begins now) OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I promise I'll never sin again! (End Sarcasm) Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was younger and looked a lot better in that film.I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most actors who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect example.By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or do we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get names for the people....Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe ( Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...",Resident Evil

If you are a fan of the game, you might be a little disappointed with the slight twist in the plot and different characters but believe you me, it doesn't take too long to get hooked on to these characters.  And the blond chick, i don't even know her name.  She was like whoa!  She rocks!This movie is the best guys.  I loved every moment of it! Amazing special effects!  Also, just so the fans of the game know, its a mixture of Resident Evil 1 and 2.  They give you a kind of prelogue to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in the end which means that Nemesis is coming.  No mention of Code Veronica yet!  But my God!  Spine chilling, interesting, x-filey like!  Full of conspiracies and the hot chick!  A MUST see for all fans!

Milla Jovovich is great and so are the other cast members giving their all throughout the film! It even has a decent plot which other video game movies have lacked in the past (ie.Tomb Raider). This is definetly better than Tomb Raider (which I still loved!) and a whole lot better than Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (which was...ok). I really hope they make a sequel because they've left the movie at such a cool cliffhanger!! I only wish they'd have made as much effort with Final Fantasy.

418,ghostofdaniel,Like a porno movie with no sex.,4,22 June 2004,"The logic of a ""zombie movie"" is not to have a good plot, but to have lot of gore. Like a porno : who cares the script since we watch sex ? But, if we have no sex  and no interesting plot, it's really boring.The plot : A virus transforms deads in zombies. The computer says ""These zombies must eat !"" . But it doesn't say why they must eat human flesh. And zombies can't eat each other, they need to eat the flesh of the living. So our heroes must fight against them. Ho, I forgot : a monster chases them and he mutates when he eats ""fresh DNA"" (lol). So, as you see, a very intelligent science plot. (Sorry not to have mentioned ""SPOILERS"", you'll miss the pleasure to discover this beautiful and unpredictable story).
Let's see now the fun gore : as the movie begins, when the first gore scene is missed (the girl in the elevator), I knew this puritan style will spoil the only good thing of this movie. And I was right ! How many ""let's look elsewhere"" to avoid a bad scene. ""A zombie must be shot in the head"" ? Yeah... but in Romero's movies, the head explodes, in this one, there is just a little red spot on the front. It's ridiculous !Apparently, the director wanted to make an horror movie for the little kids.So, Okay, if you are a little kid, run to watch this movie ! Otherwise, return to watch ""Dawn of the dead"" which knows what gore means.4/10",Resident Evil
419,diadectes58,Unconvincing and poorly put together.,4,23 March 2013,"I watched this movie on the television last night. I have not played the game. It came across like a video game with real actors playing the roles. However, I think it would be more entertaining to watch people playing the game for real on YouTube. I could not finish the film and stopped watching about half way through. I looked up what happened next on Wikipedia and was glad I stopped watching. Nothing made sense or felt right. I know it's fantasy but no one uses bimbos in mansions for security. And why did those SAS type commandos burst in through the windows? Why not just come in quietly through the front door? It was supposed to be a secret entrance after all. Did they ever explain what Matt was doing there? And why did they take Alice and Matt in with them and not just leave them with the back up outside? And why was there no support and back-up at the mansion to secure things as they moved in? And why did the Red Queen not just kill the four commandos in the Queen Chamber straight away instead of playing with them? And how come Alice was able to disable a zombie with her bare hands and kill a pack of zombie dogs with a pistol when the commandos could not do this with a small arsenal of weapons? And why were Alice and Matt suddenly wandering around on their own anyway? I could go on and I only watched half the film.",Resident Evil
420,se7endaze,"Thanks, but I'll stick to the game",5,28 December 2005,"This film opens in the ""Hive"", the massive underground research complex run by the Evil Umbrella Corporation. A vile containing a deadly virus is broken and it sifts it's way throughout the entire complex, wiping out everyone. This, if in all reality, would not have happened if the Hive had not been entirely connected by the ventilation system. But hey, I guess it goes to show, Military intelligence isn't too high in the movie world either.Casting includes Milla Jovovich as Alice, who was found in the mansion suffering from amnesia, but coincidently remembers how to kick ass, and looks great doing it. Michelle Rodriguez is Rain, by far the toughest and sexiest member of the task force sent into the Hive to check things out. A female commando, who knows how to get it done, go figure. And then there are the other guys in the cast who survive past the 30-minute mark, but they're just the bait for the baddies. Most of the movie consists of the main characters shouting orders, and occasionally getting hoarded by zombies. Oh, and there's a deadly laser beam, which is fun to watch for the most unexpected decapitations I've seen. However, I was impressed with the licker, and the ""Cujo"" wanna-be zombie dogs.Director Paul Anderson gives the film a nice Holly' gloss finish. And the music, industrial metal which got very annoying, managed to drown out some of the lousy dialogue. This was more of an action movie than the horror flick I expected, it doesn't even stride with George A. Romero's zombie films.The one thing that messed up the movie for me was the unnecessary last scene that sets up the sequel; you already know (if you've played the game) that one was coming. Thanks, but I'll stick to the game",Resident Evil
421,georg_gruber,I love the game and I like the movie,8,14 March 2002,"I just saw the movie in a sneak preview. I'm really really into the video game. I love it.The movie is great if you know the game. If you don't you'll also have a lot of fun. It's always a little risky to make a movie from a video game or comic but the film crew got it pretty right from the beginning.The story is ok, the set is great. The atmosphere in the movie is quite frightening! There are some shocking scenes in it - the audience is screaming ;-)Overall I have to say that the actors do a fair job. IMHO the movie is a little short - there could have been much more action in it. Maybe the wanted to save it for RE 2?Well, bloody funny, RE is the best horror/action combo in the last time.

422,ghstface,Finally the dream comes true,9,17 March 2002,"Though Romero was nowhere to be found in the finally film, his archetypes were.  This visually stunning, claustrophobic piece brings the video game to life in a way rarely, if ever, seen before.  Moments of zombie-ridden calamity scream references to moments established in Romero's 'Dead' films, and leave the horror fanatic drooling with delight.  Aside from some occasional bad dialogue, a constantly brooding Michelle Rodriguez and that ever present curse of finding good zombies to act in a film, it was a stunning work of horror.  The zombie-loving public never gets a fair shake in the mainstream of Hollywood, so this is a must see if only for the moments that glimmer references to Romero-past.",Resident Evil
423,brinks811,Just what I expected,10,31 March 2002,"I am all about Resident Evil; I have played and beaten every game in the series.  Perhaps I have carry bit of a bias.  Anyhow, I took my lady friend out to see it. I will admit that near the beginning of the film I jumped more than she did, and she called me out on it too.  I was happy with the start, middle and finish of the film, it rolled right along.  The plot also contained nice little twists, which actually made for a pretty good story. However I was a bit disappointed with the suspense of the film.  While it did have some moments that kept your heart beating loudly and strongly, I just felt like it lacked the overall suspense that the games held.  Being a big fan of Dawn of the Dead (zombie killing classic), I didn't know what to think of the zombies in Resident Evil.  I would describe them as an army undead tenacious Heroin attics, refusing to be taken down.  You can tell director Paul Anderson had some influence from Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead.  There is a scene in RE that is nearly lifted right from Dawn of the Dead (the near suicide attempt if you are familiar).  Bottom line - If you are a fan of Resident Evil, you appreciate this movie, more importantly, you will LOVE the ending. 8/10",Resident Evil

Now if you don't know the game this is a 'okay' if somewhat lackluster Zombie film, After all it's standard fair for a movie of it's type.My problems with it stems from the fact this movie has NOTHING to do with it's source material but name alone. It felt like it was written by someone that didn't even read the crib sheets for the Resident Evil Game but ONLY skimmed them(briefly).That is my biggest complaint, it seems standard fair these days in Hollywood to slap on a name recognition titles on to movies with little to do with the source material. That's my complaint to the point, if this film had been more faithful to it's title (No Tyrant, Mansion, Jill, Chris or ANY characters from the game used or referenced to in the slightest.)I might have enjoyed it more.But as it stands it's at best a sub par overrated zombie film with a misplaced title.

426,krobyn,Very intense,9,23 March 2002,"I gave this movie a 9, but I don't rate movies in the usual fashion.  I don't think horror movies should be rated against all other types, just themselves.  It's a much more raw form of entertainment and it often fails to deliver.  I think the director, Paul Anderson, summed it up effectively in this quote, ""We tried to put into the movie that constant sense of dread and foreboding. As you play the game, as you're walking around, you're terrified as to what might happen next. That's the kind of tone of the movie.""  He is correct.  I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband's left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick.  I may be biased in that I feel there is no other concept scarier than zombies-beings whose ONLY objective is to kill you by eating you.  Very loudly.  Ewww.  I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had.  I asked him what the plot was to get a feel for whether or not it was an accurate depiction.  He had very VAGUE ideas about the plot.  I was able to fill in the blanks.  I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up.  I believe it only makes the movie better.  Sure there are one-liners that aren't stellar, but it IS horror.  You have to expect a little cheese with your flick.  I honestly don't think the ending could've been any better.  I was very entertained.  If you check out my other reviews though, I'm no major critic.  I go to the movies to be entertained, and I usually pay matinee price, as I did that day.  I can't say I would've loved it as much if we paid 6 more bucks to get in.

427,VWAdam,I could have found a better way to spend $5,2,18 March 2002,"I have one word to describe this film: laughable. For the first 20 minutes, the movie follows no definable plot. It leaves the audience utterly confused. There were about 60 other people in the theatre at the same time as me, and a goodly majority of them were laughing right along with me at this horrible game to movie translation. The only faintly interesting monster is the Licker towards the end. The zombies look nothing more than extras with poorly applied make-up and that's exactly what they are. I have one question to the makers of this film: Is it so hard to use the already well established and well written plot and story from the Resident Evil games? If it were up to me, I would go the easy route and straight up translate the game to movie form. Apparently CapCom didn't want to let Paul Anderson have the rights to the story as he would so obviously have screwed it up. If you absolutely must see this film, go ahead and waste your $5 to $8. If you want a good zombie story, play the Resident Evil games.Or, if you're dying to see a zombie move, go to your local video store and rent George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead.

430,ObiWanDan131,Computer Game Movies Always Turn Out Bad Except This One,7,17 July 2002,"I have always said ""why can't any film studios make a good movie from a computer game"". Every computer game movie to come out I have always thought this is going to be the first good one, but each time I have been disapointed with the like of Street Fighter (I never thought this one looked good),Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and even Tomb Raider.I was really hoping that Resident Evil would be different, not just because I enjoy a good film but because I was a huge Resident Evil fan, and this time I was not disapointed.The movie was such a great ride with the main characters in the movie, like the game, having hidden secrets, which are not that hard to guess during the movie but are interested.The casting was great for this film as well with Milla Jokovich proven how to be a good tough lead for these types of films (take note Angelina Jolie).
The start of the movie put you straight into the action before you could get a handful of popcorn with lift fulling, people drowning and other strange situations which seem to be a suspenceful as the game.
Like the game I was always worried about want was going to happen next. There was also other scenes which were even more frightening especially the action in the sewers.  The zombies were fantastic and very disturbing this was because they didn't just want to kill the people (like in most scary movies) they wanted to eat them  especially when they pulled a person into the lift and started eating him, it was not that pretty.Some bits of the movie was strange with some of the scenes starting with the group together and then suddenly Alice (Milla Jokovich) is walking down the corridor on her own and you are thinking ""why would somebody do that"", i know it happens in every horror film but its just stupid.Their was also no huge spiders (which are in the game) that I expected to jump out when they were in the sewers.I was a bit worried before watching this movie because it was made by Paul Anderson who directed Soldier and Event Horizon. But now after watching Resident Evil I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemeses.
The ending to this movie was excellent as well because it makes you want to see the sequel as soon as possible, like the Fellowship of the Rings did.Final ReviewEverything about this movie made it a fun ride, the music,the licker and Zombies, the main characters (good or bad)and the final showdown that made you want to watch more, which say a lot.8/10 I think Sarah Michelle Gellar could be great Jill Valentine for the next movie, because she has proven her self in Buffy.",Resident Evil

It is an action movie with a touch of gore now and again. There's a few cheap thrills which manage to make your heart jump for a second, but beyond that this movie has more in common with something like ""Aliens"" than ""Night of the Living Dead"". The script is mediocre, better than Romero's but still filled with wasted potential. The acting again is mediocre. In places this movie does get kinda stupid. The dog sequence comes to mind where she manages to kill 5 or 6 zombie dogs with one bullet each.The zombie sequences potential for some heavy action and gory scenes were again wasted as 4 of the team going into the hive to find out what happened are killed straight away by the Red Queen which means the film has to be more conservative with who lives and dies later on in the movie. Those characters went to waste in my opinion. The use of the Red Queen in the movie removes any horror elements remaining in the movie concerning the unknown of exactly what has happened as the Red Queen explains it all. There is in fact little or no atmosphere maintained in the movie, no where do you feel anxious or claustrophobic , and by no means does this movie inspire dread.All in all a below average action movie that tries to be something it isn't and disappointing for the game fans.",Resident Evil

435,de_cafe6914,Entertaining Zombie Flick,7,5 November 2006,"Resident Evil is one of the few films based on a video game that, as a whole, didn't disappoint me. As far as I am concerned, it was a very good video game-based movie, and an entertaining zombie flick. Let me break it down.Story: Alice, a woman with no memory, is brought into a world she doesn't understand when a team of paramilitary commandos take her down into a research lab to aid them. Apparently, the entire lab was wiped out by the area's supercomputer, entitled ""Red Queen."" Their mission is to wipe out the supercomputer, and determine the cause of why everyone was killed. The trouble is, a deadly virus was released through the facility, and the people that were killed are still walking around. Resident Evil is a film about conspiracy and scientific experiments gone horribly wrong.Direction: Paul W.S. Anderson, in my opinion, is a fine director. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve in each film, and sets out to do it. Anderson knows how to build up the audience, and submerse them into a film. The pacing of the film is terrific, with just the right blend of action and horror. Anderson can work wonders with a budget, and knows how to set up the mood for the entire picture, and keep it that way. Solid! Rock on, Mr. Anderson.Acting: This was the part where the film faltered. While not horrible, the acting isn't top par, either. Milla Jovovich(Alice) played the part of the amnesiac quite well. She was definitely the finest actor in the film. The girl has talent. Michelle Rodriguez(Rain) played her usual tomboy no-nonsense character almost as good as usual, though something was missing in this performance. Eric Mabius(Matt) did a poor job. His performance was just not believable to me. James Purefoy(Spence) is a gifted actor, and I look forward to seeing him more often. As for the rest of the cast, some were good, some were poor, and some just plain sucked.Score: Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami composed a fantastic score for the film. Their combined efforts really helped set the tone for the entire movie, and fit in so well with what was going on. I loved it.Violence: Unlike most zombie flicks, this film is not extremely gory or revolting. The zombies shed very little blood, because, as stated in the film, it has already coagulated. Still, there are a few bloody bits. We get countless head shots, gunshot wounds, decayed zombies, some creature violence, and a particularly nasty segment with a laser.Profanity/Sexual Themes: Of course, cussing is found in this film, though I must say, it is almost always justifiable in the flick. As far as sexual themes, there are two very brief sex scenes between Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy, with a brief glimpse of nudity on Milla's end.Substance Abuse: None.Overall: By the end of the movie, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Resident Evil is a good video game adaption, and a pretty entertaining zombie flick with the perfect blend of scares and action. 7.5/10",Resident Evil

An excellent soundtrack by Marilyn Manson that really suits the environment. The story is definitely interesting and keeps you focused. Flawless acting.One of the few things I find bad about Resident Evil is the excessive amount of zombies towards the end of the movie. IMHO 'Monsters' should come unexpected and in limited amounts to make it more thrilling. The huge mutant monster towards the very end could possibly be left out of changed to give it a bit more credibility.I also find the Red Queen mainframe computer 'laser' protection system somewhat stupid but this is a minor defect.A similar scenery and feeling can be found in the game Half-Life, so if you enjoyed playing that you will probably like this movie.",Resident Evil

  My husband and I took my teenage son, and I was pretty skeptical about liking it. But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or 5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate and parents should be aware.    The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried too hard to be tough- I found it annoying.

This is a zombie shoot-em-up.  As such, it has pretty good dialogue, characterization, and plotting.

441,mightyshwanzi,One of the best video game movies ever,9,17 March 2002,"I love the first 'Mortal Kombat' film.  It's one of my personal favorites. It just so happens that the film I'd place next to it on my list is 'Resident Evil'... and they're both directed by Paul Anderson!  I'm a huge fan of the video games, I've played them all.  Sure this film takes some liberties (none of the characters are here at all, and there was no Red Queen), but it successfully takes the majority of what made the games so scary and suspenseful and mixes them with some outlandish action scenes. Milla Jovovich (YUM!) is a great female action hero (and flashes some nip to boot!), and tackles the lead of the film rather well.  I've never been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez (she's all pout and no talent), but in the end I was rooting for her and feeling sympathy for her character (she gets the snot pummeled out of her over the course of the film).  There's the familiar villains (Licker, zombies and the dogs), familiar scenes (both from other films and the games) and familiar faces (Eric Mabius from 'The Crow 3' and even Paul Anderson regular Jason Isaacs from 'Event Horizon' and 'Soldier') that make it all the more fun.  The industrial metal music by Marilyn Manson is great, and the FX are for the most part pretty good.  My only major gripe is that while I was expecting this movie to be another 'Tomb Raider' (i.e. complete crap) and it wasn't, I was also looking forward to seeing a good splatter flick.  There is virtually no gore to be found in this film.  Sure there's a head that gets cut off and some nasty looking zombies, but we never see anyone get eaten or ripped apart... that's a staple for a zombie movie.  One particular moment involves the Licker killing someone... it obviously takes a bite out of the person's arm, but when it pulls back there is nothing... no marks, just blood that was there before it leant in for a quick snack.  And upon seeing the victim at a higher viewpoint, we are treated to a gigantic splatter of blood around the carcass, but there are no visible wounds on the person.  Lame!  I hope there is an unrated cut available when this comes out on DVD.  And the end is great, leading directly into a sequel that I hope gets made real soon!  9 out of 10, for all the immense fun and suspense to be found in this surprisingly entertaining survival horror film.",Resident Evil

443,rhyscooper82,Great movie.,10,26 December 2008,"I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this one kicked their butts! It got my number 1! In about 2005 I went to a friends place for her Birthday. We all sat down and started watching some movies. This was the only one that we could agree on. I was entranced through out the entire movie. The story, the characters, the mythology, it was captivating.A beautiful woman in a red dress, suffering from amnesia and being surrounded by anyones worst nightmares is enough to get the movie going. The progression was fantastic. Things never turned out the way you would expect.After I saw the movie, I hired it a few times from Video Easy. After about 3-4 hires I couldn't do it anymore. I needed to buy it. I bought it on VHS, but I was disappointed at the quality. I watched it another ten times. I then hired the DVD a few more times. During that time, I hired, watched (46 times) and bought Resident Evil: Extinction. We went to Thailand for a holiday, and I bought a copy the number 1. It was a pirate. Disappointedly, I came home and bought it again.After watching it a few dozen times, and researching Resident Evil on the net a few times I was ecstatic that there was a third coming out. I counted down the days for the next 9 months and got a group of 10 people and got them to join me in seeing it at the cinemas. We all loved it. I heard nothing bad from anyone. My blood felt strange, and I was in awe for the next week. I am just waiting now to buy it.If I could, I would send my money directly to them.I have watched the original about 30 times now, Apocalypse about 46 times, and Extinction 7 times. I bought the original Resident Evil on 3 different formats. If that doesn't say how good this movie is, I don't know what does.A really well done movie.",Resident Evil

It's hard to believe that something this horrendous could spawn two sequels and that people - presumably with functioning brains - would shell out hard-earned money to go see it. I'm not going to go into any specifics of the film; it's not even worth the effort. It's not just because it's based on a video game, either.. The people who made Silent Hill managed to do a decent enough job transitioning that video game to the big screen.Resident Evil, nor neither of it's two sequels, has any redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Ok there are three things: The virus, there ARE zombies, Lisa Trevor is in there somewhere - But she's a computer not a mutated freak.Anderson has never played Resident Evil. There are simply so few references to the game it's scary. Examples: No shotgun (the survival horror's weapon of choice) or Grenade launchers (because every female alive uses one.) And no crate pushing! CRATE PUSHING!The biggest disappointed is easily the fact that none of the infamous bosses appear. No 50 foot long snakes, no 30 foot long sharks, not a single spider, or plants the size of houses. What an idiot to not see that people would hate this. What an idiot with his budget.Oh and automatic weapons are for WUSSIES! You're not a man if you can't take down a zombie with a combat knife!

She's also the main character. ...How's that for a shocker? :o Alice also doesn't really have much of a background story.

447,solidchuck19,Wait... This might be Chris' blood....,4,8 February 2007,"I don't know if any other movie infuriates me more than this. Well, maybe the sequel. The people in charge in Hollywood don't seem to realize that videogames turned to film have so much more potential than given credit for. That's why films like this don't have a large budget, which leads to idiots like Paul W.S. Anderson getting the chance to direct and write... neither of which can he do.I mean honestly, the Resident Evil video game series does not have an amazing story like some will say. What it does have is many characters that will one day go down as classic heroes and villains, with a conspiracy plot that was original and highly entertaining in how it was uncovered. The was all set in the perfect atmosphere - a creepy mansion filled with bloodthirsty zombies... awesome! That would be a good movie and it is already a great series of games.The only thing this movie has in common with that is... yes, there are zombies, but they're not scary. They look like sick, hungover mental patients who can't do anything. I heard someone once say this movie was the poor man's Aliens. Exactly. Everything about it is just so routine and mediocre, and aside from that the best characters are killed right away and in awful ways. (The laser hallway is among the dumbest things ever conceived by mankind.) Furthermore, the atmosphere of the games is lost in misplaced maniacal techno music...why?? I'm not saying that the movie is bad just because it does not follow the games, because the setting as a prequel is acceptable. However, there are several other things that make a film enjoyable, and it just doesn't work here. No good acting leads to lack of chemistry amongst the characters. The pacing is poor, the dialogue is mundane, and it is not scary enough for the horror flick it aspires to be. The director was just lost. Rather than use a great premise, Paul Anderson abandoned it and made something of his own, which isn't any good on its own. I'll never know why they didn't let George Romero make it. And of course, since it was low budget - the film made a profit and they made a sequel. That is why this sad cycle will continue to repeat itself, and the video game movie will forever be wasted.",Resident Evil

I loved the way it was shot and the casting though none of the names were what I would consider big names. Michelle Rodriquez busts out and nearly steals the show from Milla. She is tough as nails and kicks butt but is still sexy as can be. Milla as Alice is just fantastic and dead on. She is great as the innocent confused Alice who can't remember who she is or what is going on. She sees these events through the confused eyes of an innocent. Then as she remembers who she is the transformation is great and she comes off like King Kong, Godzilla, and Bruce Lee all in one. She looks great and she carries the movie and has shown she is an excellent action heroine. Milla can do anything.",Resident Evil
450,dimlim77,One of the few good video game conversions,8,27 March 2006,"The first thing to remember here is that this movie was a very popular video game and therefore the first thing that a viewer should look for is the similarity to that game. Personally, I do not understand anyone going to see this without at least some knowledge of the game. Having said all that, this movie was almost perfect in relating to the game.This movie had the same locations as the game, the exact same story and all the right characters that made the game so interesting. The action was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it, it usually sucks in these types of movies. I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is not much to say. The music fits perfectly, the casting was right for the movie (even if their acting was not perfect) and it stayed true to the original. My only advice is to stay away if you don't know about Resident Evil because that may cause you to have a lesser opinion of a movie that does exactly what it is supposed to.",Resident Evil

Turn it on, turn your brain off, and enjoy the action!Fans of the game complain that it's not faithful to the story lines of the game, but you have to recognize it for what it is. It is its own movie, not a live-action carbon copy of a video game. If you like the game's story, play the game. The movie doesn't have to follow it exactly to be a success.The CG work is looking pretty dated, but not bad. The zombie practical make-up effects are great. Sets are good and contribute a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Plenty of good fight scenes, suspense, and gross zombie behavior.The best scene in the movie is the end. It goes out with a bang, leaving you wanting more and wondering if the sequel will satisfy you.One note: don't base your opinion of this movie on what you see on cable.

453,JustinK-2,One of the best computer game to movie transfers,7,18 July 2002,"Let's start off with where I'm coming from on this one: I haven't played the game. I know a little about it but I'm coming at this movie from a movie viewer's perspective not a video game player's perspective.Well it's a computer game to movie adaptation so expectations are not running high, given the travesties this usually produces. We'll just sit back and await the simple plot to be explained in the first 5 minutes, watch the CGI bad guys get cut down by the good guys and, after the fight with the big bad boss at the end, watch the heroine and hero walk off into the sunset in victory ... err, well ""No"" actually!A swift overview of the film, avoiding any major spoilers, has the evil Umbrella Company  developing bio weapons and the like in a huge underground facility called ""The Hive"". The Hive is controlled by Red Queen (a computer with hologram, personality and voice based on the designer's daughter), which has gone psycho and killed everyone. In response a company SWAT team, armed to the teeth, have been sent in via the secret 'mansion entrance' to shut it down aided by their two operatives who guarded the entrance (both of whom have lost their memories due to being stunned by a nerve gas with that side effect) and a policeman who was present at the mansion when they arrived. In they go so let the movie commence ... with us, of course, knowing that one of those bio weapons is loose so they'll be facing more than just a computer ...Obviously I'm not going to tell you that the plot was intricate and complex, that the acting and dialogue was academy award stuff and that there was no sex and violence.With  regard to the plot? It was actually well developed throughout the film from the original premise by quite clever use of the lead characters' memories returning as time passed, adding new twists the more they remember. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this engaged me by revealing a new facet each time you thought you knew it all. The fact that some people have accused there of being too little plot while other have talked about too much plot development before the main action kicks in just goes to show they've probably got a decent balance :)With regard to the acting? While it was pretty wooden this actually makes sense within the context of the film  people on 'SWAT teams' and people without memories are not the most likely to be emoting or bonding. As the film goes on, logically, more relationships appear in the surviving team members and the emotions start to show. Alice (Milla Jovovich - 5th Element), as the heroine was the only character who really *had* much character but, two of the SWAT team members, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - Fast and the Furious) and Kaplan (Martin Crewes) did pretty well with their limited dialogue too. Alice's co-guardian Spencer (James Purfoy - A Knight's Tale), SWAT team leader James Shade (Colin Salmon - last 3 Bond movies) and the policeman, Matt (Eric Mabius) were the others who basically managed to hold up their part of the deal along with a few good lines by the holographic Red Queen (Michaela Dicker).With regard to the dialogue? Yeah, OK, it was poor and quite sparse but it was good enough for a film like this  you know the sort of thing:Surviving Team Member: ""I can't believe [???]'s going to get away with it""; Red Queen computer: ""I don't think so ... I've been a bad, bad girl...""Red Queen: ""The zombies can be stopped by severing of the spinal column at the base of the skull or by massive trauma to the brain""; Surviving Team Member:  ""You mean we shoot them in the head""With regard to the sex and violence? It's a zombie/monster movie with Milla Jovovich as the gun-toting heroine wearing a short skirt and long leather boots (yes, she looks stunning) ... what do you think!
OK, onto a few things I did and didn't like. Some of the early action set pieces seemed very bitty' and not very co-ordinated, but this improved as the film went on and the number of protagonists dropped!  While there were a good few jumpy moments Paul Anderson's directing (Mortal Kombat (!), Event Horizon) sometimes allowed the tension to drop off a little too much when it should have been sustained which is a shame. In part I think for me this was due to the zombies being all over our heroes in one scene and then, once eluded, they don't appear (or even feel like they might) until the next 'zombie set piece' and any reasons for this are often not well explained. The film managed to avoid a 'linear' feel which I thought was good for one based on a computer game and actually done better than many other 'we have to escape from the monster' films. It also didn't use much obvious CGI and that which it did use was pretty well done (except the first time we see the CGI beast for some reason). The SFX in general were pretty good and though there were lots of rumours of the gore factor being seriously cut down to keep the certificate as low as possible unless you are expecting a total gore-fest then the violence level was suitably high. The only thing they really cut down on was the level of 'pumping blood' which was actually explained by the fact that deaths were often as a result of lasers (in which case wounds were cauterised) or of zombies (where the blood had coagulated and wasn't being pumped because they were dead already). To me the worst thing about the deaths were that too often you didn't know the character well enough to care but that's a common problem in films like this and only the best in the genre overcome it totally. That copes with the image so a word on the sound. The Marilyn Manson soundtrack worked pretty well, though I don't think it's been popular with people used to the in-game music, and generally sound and were well utilised to enhance the atmosphere and should come out well on a DVD surround sound set-up. So, the ending ... well I think it would have worked better not only as a self-contained film but also as a set-up for the inevitable sequel (slated for 2003) if it had been cut off a few minutes earlier. However it's certainly not the Hollywood happy ending I expected and I for one will be interested where it goes from here.So to sum up. I think this is easily one of the best, if not the best, computer game to movie transfers that has taken place so far. OK not that that's saying much but if you're looking for a shoot-em-up monster movie with decent action, decent plot and sexy heroine and you're willing to suspend a bit of disbelief, this should be worth a look!7/10",Resident Evil
454,Patchbunny,*spoiler* Bigger scares in House Party II,3,20 March 2002,"I recently read a first draft for this movie by George Romero, and I can't understand why they discarded what he put together.  A much better script, with a genuine sense of drama and hopelessness.  Probably why they didn't use it.Now, I have never played the game (and that should not be a requirement. If it is, you need to hire another writer) so I cannot say if it's true to the game or not.  But then I don't really care if it does or not.  I'm interested in what sort of movie the studio produced.  Is it scary?  Can folks act?  Does it make sense?  Is the ending a standard movie cliche? Resident Evil fails on all these points.I won't bother going into the errors with their bio-toxin lab.  (If you can't figure out on your own that the lab would NOT run off the same air ducts as the rest of the facility, then you won't understand the rest of the movie's problems.  Go watch Ghosts of Mars and brace yourself for the surprise ending you'll never ever see coming.  Honest.)  The scene continuity is terrible.  Folks are surrounded by zombies with no way out, then next scene they're safely out of the way.  What happened?  How'd they get out?  Guess Paul Anderson wrote himself into a corner.  Frankly, he does that a lot.  Getting in and out of the lab appears so darn easy you have to wonder why they didn't send in the janitor to reboot the system while he's mopping the floor.The biggest hole is why the computer simply didn't TELL someone that the virus had escaped, why this is a Very Bad Thing.  But since there's an antidote, it's not really that bad, is it?  How about shutting down the facility entrances, notifying folks in charge, and then giving them a shout of the green stuff before you go killing everyone?  Must be a software error.  Darn that Windows 2000!Aren't we all getting tired of spotting the survivors when the movie starts? Could we at least have someone else survive for a change?  Would really be so difficult to not film the ending of `Guess what-it's not over yet!  Bet you didn't see THAT coming!'  Umm, yes, we did.  About an hour ago.

Dramatic = ""Film"" - General Entertainment = ""Movie"" - Artwork = ""Piece or Piece of Work"" and movies that I just enjoyed for their sheer entertainment value, or kept my huge brain occupied the whole time (that can be any of the above terms) = ""Flick"" (my most endearing term for movies). Aren't you glad to know that?  Well, this was a FLICK!!  I mean it had elements from many great films, pieces, movies, and flicks, and put them all into one, lacking just the right amount of perfection to keep me coming back for more.S * P * O * I * L * E * R * SIf but a few...What worked:  Action, horror, gore, eerie qualities, direction-direction, acting, and special effects.  No one actor/character tried to out play the other.  They all kept an even-keel on their desire for stardom and played together nicely.  People've said, 'No plot'; to which I say you're commenting on the wrong flick.  Maybe I'm retarded but even I found a plot in this flick, and I'm not that bright.  Really.  'Bad dialogue'; maybe, but if you're into the game you'd see that that's the whole point and is intentional to give it that 'zombie' flick appeal.  'Poor directing'; no way!  Where is there bad direction? I ask.  'Why do these two people that live in this mansion know how to kick butt?' -or- 'Why does Milla's character mysteriously seem to know kung fu?'; that was explained.  She's a trained agent, working for Umbrella, living in the mansion to serve as guardian to the Hive's only entrance... uh:  The Mansion.  She and the other agent know how to fight because of the afore mentioned, 'training'.What didn't work:  Well, I guess the character development could have used a bit more 'fleshing'-out (no pun intended... okay it was intended).  However, the only character that counts is Alice and she's fleshed-out quite well.  I can't think of another thing you need to know about her, right now:  Let's see, an agent trained by umbrella to guard the mansion-entrance who gets caught up in the whole stolen virus and subsequent leak who must not only remember her role in it all, but must survive the zombies, dogs, and computer... and you say there's no plot.END OF SPOILERS!!Well, there you have it.

467,fingerbo,At Last.An Unironical Horror Movie,9,8 March 2002,"Too long we fans of horror have been suffering the slings and arrows of post-`Scream' crappy, irony-laden, pseudo horror fare. `Resident Evil' is a straight up, no nonsense sci-fi/horror actioner that delivers the goods without tongue firmly (or loosely) in cheek. The film starts briskly, setting up the plot and situation. From the moment the toxin is loosed on the interior of the Umbrella Corp HQ, the flick kicks into a steadily building overdrive, tension mounting all the way.The cast, headlined by Milla Jovovich, is uniformly good, though most of the roles themselves are pretty much generically familiar constructs (tough, gravel voiced CO, hard-as-nails tough chick with chip on shoulder, slightly skittish techno guy; you get the gist). This, however, is not a criticism. In this kind of down-in-the-trenches-type film it works. Though I'm a big George Romero fan, I'm kind of glad the directorial torch ended up being passed to Paul Anderson. Anderson, whose previous films `Soldier', `Event Horizon' (another fine, straight-faced, sci-fi/horror motion picture), and of course, `Mortal Combat', is a deft hand at pacing, building atmos' and showy, edge-of-your-seat cinematic pyrotechnics, and has done a commendable job translating the Capcom computer game to the big screen. Much as I love Romero's work, I think he would have made a more bogged down film. Anderson's is lean, hungry and relentless, but gives ample and obvious props to Romero, which I think is quite suitable. (Note the newspaper at the film's conclusion that boasts the identical headline as the one shown in the opening of Romero's `Day of the Dead'.)Writing as someone who's played the game (why doesn't that sound as impressive as, `.as someone who's read the book?), I appreciated the film's fealty to its source material; spooky game, spooky movie. Really good ending, too.Technically, the effects are all top-drawer, as is the set design and cinematography. My only beef is that at times the thrashing soundtrack (which I otherwise enjoyed and found entirely suited to the material) overwhelmed the dialogue track. But maybe that was just a fault of the sound system in the screening room in which I saw it.All around, `Resident Evil' deserves high marks, and if you've played the game you won't be disappointed.",Resident Evil
468,rkrause,Special Effects and a Big Budget do not a horror movie make,3,30 July 2002,"As a fan of the horror genre and of the Resident Evil video game series I was looking forward to the theatrical adaption. However after viewing the movie I can only mourn what could have been. The majority of the movie is seen without the presence of any monsters and the ones that show up are few in number. One Licker a single pack of Cerberus zombie dogs and a few dozen Zombies, does little to impress this viewer. There is little character development and the performances themselves are hardly commendable. As for the amount of gore or in this case the lack there of it greatly hinders the movie itself. For an R rated horror movie this film had a serious lack in carnage and bloodshed. And if the title of Resident Evil is to be used the movie using it needs to have a certain quotient of violence and gore this film does not. In the end we have a movie with a big budget and fancy special effects that fail to cover up the fact that this is one lightweight horror movie. Not recomended at all",Resident Evil

472,zacky902,A great genre film,7,16 March 2002,"My review (*SPOILERS ABOUND, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM AND YOU DON'T WANT IT SPOILED!!!!!*)
I just saw the movie, fellas, and I must say that it wasn't so bad. There acting was very decent and the story was great (the amnesia thing was played well -- it was never so ""all of a sudden"" and made for suspense). Some parts of the movie were just fodder (the dog scenes), but some parts were great (the laser wire scene, the scene where Michelle Rodriguez goes nuts with the machine gun, the scene where the licker mutates).My only problems were that people died so suddenly. The black man should have lived longer, because he did a great job of being in control of the group. I was pretty disappointed when he died, even if he died in a horrendously cool fashion.One good thing about the movie was that there wasn't any camp. No winking or purposely bad acting or comedy. It surprisingly took itself pretty seriously. The film also had the great sense of ""panic"" that the games have, and the ammo conservation suspense from the games was present as well, which just made the film more believable. The super computer thing wasn't played out so badly either. There was a reason why it made the labratory go haywire, it didn't just do it for no reason, in some sort of self-righteous, anti-technology statement like I thought it would.Overall, I probably wouldn't go see it again, but I'd buy it on DVD if it had a lot of cool extras. It was infinitely better than Tomb Raider and more accessible than the techno-jargon mess that was Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. I went in expecting a crap-fest of bad CG and poor acting, and I got decent acting with a decent story, cool, non-cliched characters, and AN AWESOME FREAKING ENDING. Talk about Omega Man with Charleton Heston here. It was just neat.My final rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5. I recommend it to everyone here if you're into genre films. Its no Dawn of the Dead, but its the 5th best zombie film I can think of right now.",Resident Evil
473,Thund3rheart,"Bloody, Fast, Scary...",8,12 April 2002,"With no expectations or predjudice, I decided to watch the movie since I've played the games. It turns out the movie was not to be shown locally in our town, so me and my friends had to take the 1.5 hrs drive north to catch the movie there. So we did and I must say it was really entertaining! Not really like the game, but not letting game-fans down. The music is perfect for the movie, even though I personally don't enjoy that genre of music that much, it really fit. The gore is as always present, we love it and if you remember all the times you jumped to the ceiling when you got scared from a zombie or something else non-exciting creature jumping out... Yeah, you get those skips here too.All in all, a really entertaining game, RE fan or not!",Resident Evil

After nearly 20 years I couldn't remember a damn thing about it, so I had the joy of watching it for the ""first"" time all over again. It has intrigue, suspense, terror, action and mystery. I was prepared for a fun, silly, early 2000's cheesy action movie and was surprised to find much more than that.

like tomb raider, the lead star , here jovovich, is the main reason to watch the film. always willing to play the strong female lead , she brings believability to a role which a lesser actress would have failed in . starting from amnesiac and afriad to in control and kicking butt, she carries the film on her slim physique.michelle rodriguez reminds me of vasquez from aliens but fails to live up to the standard set from camerons masterpiece! the rest of the cast are predictable cannon fodder which the never rise above or even breathe life into there roles!if you hadnt already figured out the computer wasnt behind the killings then what movie where you watching , the shutting down of the red queen releases the zombies and the trouble starts for the commando's.  the zombies woor terrible , the costume department must be ashamed of themselves if there was one! they looked straight out of a b-movie not a hollywood production!
the overall blame for the movie lays with paul anderson director and writer, his films lacks any sense of dread or menace! we are never scared nor shocked. it is predictable and plodding, the twists are sign posted only those alseep could miss them! the effects could have been done a lot better , i beleive the director isnt to blame on this, with the budget he had this is all i can see hi being able to bring off and trying to use it as best as he can , either that or he is saluting the b-movies of a bygone age!possibly second time lucky?6/10",Resident Evil

It didn't seem to have much with the different video games to do. Except for the original plot ""An evil company, releases a massive virus which turns humans into living dead"".Though now, after I've seen it, I'm really surprised with the amount of places and objects you find simular with the objects and places of the different games. Even some scenes seems to be taken from the Games. As for me, who have played all of the games, that is very amusing. Still Resident Evil isn't just a good movie based on some video games.
My words are simple. Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror,but there's more to it than you'd ever expect. The Story is so intense and the actors are really doing a great job, including the Zombie actors. It was a long time ago we've got a really good Zombie movie, but now we are liberated. :DTo finalize it all, I will rate it. Really I would like to give it 10/10, but there's something that gave me the feeling om incompleteness. It is indeed a superb film, but they could've at least given us 40 minutes more of Zombies and terror.

478,Threeman,Noisy and VERY tedious,2,19 April 2002,"Rubbish action.  Rubbish horror.  I was going to limit my review of RESIDENT EVIL to these two pithy phrases.  But when the comment `Well, what were you expecting anyway?' floated in my general direction, I began to bristle at this lazy, time-worn mantra.  So what was I expecting, indeed hoping, to get out of this?   More.  Much more.  We simply must learn to be more demanding.  I speak as a fan of the original video games, and as a lover of a good Zombie-fest.  Yes, I love zombies  adore the pasty-faced, shambling hordes of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, the eerie moth-eaten Templar Knights from the BLIND DEAD series, even Fulci's faintly charming, crumbling undead.  And here's the thing  the zombies in RESIDENT EVIL are just about the most uninspiringly sanitised bunch you could ever (not) hope to bump into.  They are a distillation of all the film's failings.Early impressions are favourable, with slick visuals and meaty, evocative sound design.  But glossy aesthetics have the capacity to irritate rapidly in the absence of any semblance of plot.  Make no mistake, the screenplay is RESIDENT EVIL'S principal Achilles' heel.  The lousy dialogue (the one element to have survived intact in the transition from game to film) is further undermined by a limp narrative consisting entirely of one poorly conceived and executed set-piece after another.  Characters spend the vast majority of the time running from point A to point B, without thought or ingenuity, to the extent that the viewer is soon faced with a tiresomely uninteresting series of disconnected and repetitive episodes.  Things aren't helped along by some very strange continuity decisions, with characters regularly in calm conversation one moment and the next hysterically slamming doors shut in the face of a mutant horde.  As though to paper over the glaring cracks, a bombastic electronic / heavy guitar score kicks in every few seconds, often at the most inopportune moments.  Suspense and fear arise as much from moments of silence as from noise, but the first, most obvious lesson of horror filmmaking is so obviously and sadly lost on Paul Anderson and co.  The undisciplined noise put me very much in mind of TOMB RAIDER, which similarly failed to capture the spirit of the original video games despite superficial similarities in the set design.   These video games are primarily solitary experiences, I would venture almost introspective, whereas the celluloid incarnations are anything but, raucous and over-populated.  I can just imagine a major studio risking a high-profile franchise with an introspective film light on dialogue and supporting characters, but rich in atmosphere.... not.
I've seen the word `splatter' bandied about with reckless ease on these pages.  Please don't make me laugh.  The gallery of monsters on offer, including the aforementioned zombies, singularly fail to impress, victims of an overly clean, fussy cinematography that imparts a sanitised sheen on everything.  The blood-letting is unimpressive and deceptively clinical. Rather like persisting with a dull film in the hope of catching the odd crumb of gratuitous nudity, here I was soon hankering after some proper, sleazy gore to alleviate the tedium.  At this point, you know in your heart of hearts that both you and the film are in dire trouble, nay sinking fast. 
RESIDENT EVIL fails as horror and as action.  It's a one-trick pony that is relentlessly noisy and tedious.",Resident Evil
479,StormsEdgeProductions,A gem where the film is better than the games!,10,21 September 2010,"After playing the first game, and not really liking it, when I heard that Resident Evil was going to be made into a film, I had very high doubts. Usually an adaption decreases the quality of the original. However, after recording this film off the television and watching it with my Mum the night after, I found myself pleasantly satisfied. This is one of the only adaptions that are actually better than the original.What we get from British film makers Paul W.S. Anderson is a Zombie movie with a difference. Zombie movies tend to be relatively similar and very difficult to take seriously. In fact, I usually end up laughing my guts out whilst watching Zombie movies because of how B-Rate most of them seem! The clever thing about Resident Evil was that I ended up laughing (a quality to look for in all films), but not at the Zombies. I laughed at well structured dialogue, some potentially outrageous action sequences and quite lovable, though well developed characters. The Zombies were actually very realistic and quite scary too! I'm 17 and even I got scared whilst watching this.The plot, although slightly different from the game, was well written, flowing nicely from one event into the next, helping the audience to understand what is happening, yet keeping wonder and suspense as to why things are happening. As a writer myself, even I'll admit this is very hard to obtain, especially with action films when you want to keep your audience stuffing themselves with popcorn, but Anderson has done this very well. Characters kept on being introduced throughout the film, which kept it interesting. Better still, this film doesn't ramble on with pointless sequences! As far as the average duration of modern-day films go, this is relatively short, keeping on the 100 minute mark.The acting was extraordinary, with some very well delivered lines. It is so easy with a film like this just to choose an actor or actress for their looks, rather than talent. I've seen plenty of films where an actress has been cast just because she's pretty, but is such a bad actress that it would make being nominated for a Razzie unfair, as nobody else can get so potentially bad to win! With Resident Evil, however, not only were the female cast mind blowing pretty, but they were also very good actresses! As were the men, but I'm not going to make such a fuss over whether or not they're hansom because that would be weird, but they were very good and believable actors all the same.The heroin (the main character, not the drug) was very well played by a brilliantly cast and beautiful Milla Jovovich, who received some very imaginative and exciting action sequences, and executed them extremely well. Perhaps some of the stunts were slightly unrealistic, but a very good plot helped make them more believable, and anyway, in the world of Science Fiction, the more unrealistic the better sometimes! I've only played the first game, but I've seen the first two films, and this a real gem and masterpiece by Paul Anderson, with a great cast. I am very much looking forward to seeing the third and fourth instalments. Truly deserving of an Oscar or four.",Resident Evil

Yesterday I saw it on TV and I enjoyed it very much! Sure there are better movies out there, but this one does deliver what it promises: zombie action, cool heroine (Milla is unbeatable here - with Sigourney as Ripley out of contest, of course), tension, and - from time to time - even the relatively unexpected plot moves.Bear in mind, however, that this *is* a horror action movie. Don't expect it to be logical, to have a really great story, or to be free of errors.

But then I actually sat down to watch it, and to say the least was very disappointed with the out come.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD The film begins in an underground laboratory owned by the corporation Umbrealla inc. The lab is hidden deep within the basement of a mansion. Some asshole releases the virus the scientists are working on which can reanimate dead cells. The scientists get contaminated.Now when I saw this I thought fine its not 100% accurate but hey it still has the potential to be a great movie.NOThe computer within the lab goes psycho, sealing all the rooms off under quarantined regulations, then it begins wiping out all the scientists. Some woman wakes up who has lost all her memory. Deciding the time is right to go for a walk in the cold while wearing nothing but a highly revealing red dress she sets off on her journey, minuites later an army team burst through the windows and join her in her quest to do... not much. About 25 minutes further into the movie this team comes to a large hallway. The hallway leads to the computers core where they can shut it down. And low and behold the computer kills off 2/3 of the cast with its lasers faster than you can say ""danger Will Robbinson danger"" The survivors shut the computer down; zombies come out, and the team being of the greatest intellect decide the best way to execute the undead is by leg shots and shouting ""Stop"" a good 14 times. Team intelligence then decide they shouldn't have tried to switch the computer off, and so they switch the computer back on. Near the end of the film we are introduced to the ultimate biological weapon resembling a single licker, no I'm not kidding, they also incorectly name it a Hunter, where the hell is Tyrant you might ask? It's not as if it was an important part of the series, Tyrant virus and all. Our film draws to a close as the ""ultimate killing machine"" discovers its huge weakness it touches train tracks and promptly explodes.*yawn* The film has few plot twists which I wont spoil here. Most of the enemies from the series don't show up, in fact, the majority of the film concentrates on the evil computer not the creatures. Not even zombies.This movie would have been much better if it WASN'T called Resident Evil, but something else, anything else. Really, it bears little relation to the video games anyway besides the virus's and corporation's name and I still feel this film was only called Resident Evil so Paul Anderson could sell his hand me down script and market it towards a wider crowd (maybe this could be attributed to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as well). The point is if this movie was called Cube 3 he could still get away with it. In fact this film probably is Cube 3, just named Resident Evil to attract fans of the series to watch this very average zombiefest.Oh well it can't be as bad as Street Fighter the movie.",Resident Evil

487,jakwright,"Well, It Could've Been A Lot Worse.",5,16 March 2002,"So, I just got out of the movie about 20 minutes ago so my mind is fairly fresh on some of the details.  I guess I really had my hopes up with Paul Anderson (Event Horizon) directing this and having played Resident Evil 1 & 2, I was hoping that the movie would be as thrilling as the first two games (Yes I know it was only loosely based on the 1st game). (I guess I have to say that there may be spoilers and all that other fun stuff ^_^)   When I first saw the Mansion, I thought that half the film would take place there, and the second half would occur in ""The Hive,"" but only the first 10-15 minutes are spent there before the Umbrella organised team infiltrate the mansion then head underground.   I liked how the dogs were brought in, but Alice quickly dispatches with all 6 or 7 of them in a single scene (One in which she wanders off alone and returns without any questions).  It almost seemed like the scene was shot later after primary filming had finished.  Another thing I liked was the opening part of the film, showing what a normal day in the Umbrella Corp. was like.  This was really the only part of the film where I felt tension and suspense that seemed to be lacking from the rest of the film.  The inclusion of the ""Lickers"" from Resident Evil 2 I thought was really cool and how it gave some background into their origins (I don't recall if the game included any).  At the end of the movie, when the camera was panning out from Alice, I really liked the various small details; such as the streaks of blood from an open window and despite the entire film, it made me hopeful for the sequel. Either that or I'm just gullible.  If the sequel were to take on a more gothic approach (without all the pounding scare chords and the heavy metal music; why is it that because the movie was about zombies, killing et cetera, that death & heavy metal bands have to be associated with it?  What if Night of the Living Dead had been done with death metal music?  I cringe at the thought; off topic.)  So overall, the only point to see Resident Evil 1 would be to understand what is going on in Resident Evil 2, as long as it is better than this movie.",Resident Evil
488,jlsanchez01,True to the games,7,14 September 2004,"(Minor Spoilers)As a fan of the Resident Evil games, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. I know Paul W. S. Anderson is hated by many, mostly because of MORTAL COMBAT and SOLDIER, but I think this is by far his best directing (and writing) work.What I like the most is how the movie stays true to the spirit of the games in spite of moving away from the original plot and characters. The story is sort of a ""re-imagination"" of the first game with a few things taken from the second (mostly the Liker, the train sequences and the ending), but you can find the key elements that make up the Resident Evil universe: Racoon City, the Umbrella Corporation, the T-virus, the zombies, the dogs... And though none of the original characters appear in the movie, those created specifically for it could fit nicely into the games: Alice is some sort of a mix between Jill Valentine and Claire Redfield, Matt seems inspired by Leon S. Kennedy, Spence seems inspired by Wesker, and Colin Salmon's character is a compendium of all the Umbrella operatives seen through the games. The actors are serviceable, and I think Salmon stands out in spite of his limited screen time. Mila Jovovich is also perfectly cast as Alice, and though she's not a great actress, she makes the part her own. Michelle Rodriguez is also good, if only because she plays the same character in all of her movies. Of course, more character development would have been welcome, but I think there is enough for an action movie. Also, the script cleverly avoids a common mistake in this kind of 'combat team in hostile ground' stories: The most generic and interchangeable characters are killed early on (I wish Salmon had survived longer, though), so you can focus your attention in the rest  unlike in the recent STARSHIP TROOPERS 2, where there were too many cardboard cut-outs I mean characters.Another area where RE succeeds is in the balance between horror and action. Just like the games, the movie kicks off in what is (more or less) our everyday world, and quickly turns into a nightmare. The settings reproduce what you are used to find in the games, like the mansion, the laboratory, the train, etc. They all help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. On the plot side, I know the use of amnesia as a narrative device has been done to death, but here it serves the narration well: Just like Alice, we find step by step where we are and what is going on. Some scenes are adequately creepy and well handled, like the moment when the zombies show up for the first time. The action scenes are well edited, so you can tell what's going on (a rarity these days). The pace is also good, except for a few moments when you can tell that some scenes have been cut (particularly at the end of the conversation where Matt reveals his true identity to Alice). I also liked the epilogue. Though a bit overlong, it has the greatest Resident Evil feel in the movie (particularly the final shot).Overall, this is a good horror/action movie, specially for those who liked the games. As always happens, some of them may be disappointed, but I still think we've been far luckier than most Tomb Raider fans.",Resident Evil
489,klbowersox,Top-notch Saturday night drive-in fare.,8,20 March 2002,"I have said many times that games of any kind do not make good movies but I now have to make one exception when I say that. Resident Evil is a great zombie shoot-em-up that doesn't rely entirely on visceral thrills. The plot has enough twists to keep things interesting and the characters are real enough that you care about them. On top of all that Milla Jovanovich is a treat to look at for a couple of hours and makes a convincing heroine.
It is true that there is nothing very original in the movie but what it steals it puts to good use. If I have a complaint it is that the movie uses the same schtick too many times. I'm talking about the trick of having some obvious source of danger that everyone thinks is about to happen NOT happen and instead some other unexpected nastiness happens. Good once, not 4 times.As long as you don't put it in the Gladiator class and instead expect a thrilling Saturday night Drive in action movie this one is top of the line.",Resident Evil

Lets see hot women with guns-check, flesh eating zombies-check and generally s*** gettin blown up, what more do you want from a zombie film? Also as a fan of the game its great to see how much effort went into the production design recreating scenes from the games .  Sure the film could be better in places but most of what takes place is there to set up the sequel. I can't wait to see if the rumoured unrated edition will come out on DVD so we can see all the extra gore that was cut from the cinema release.  And the ending is right up there with some of all time classic horror finales.",Resident Evil

492,r_uldal,"Good idea, but just not made good enough",3,25 October 2007,"Yeah, well when you think about it, making a movie from a video game that primarily is a shoot-the-baddie's game there will be some big holes in the storyline and the plot. This is actually a movie that i had left twice before finally finishing it. When thats said i think the storyline and the plot is great, seen from the perspective that there wasn't enough of this from the game to make a movie with. But seen in the present of other movies in this genre or other movies that has been made from videogames, this one really sucks. Even if you are a huge fan of the games, this movie will ultimately make you suffer.The effects: The effects are on some occasions wildly and hugely overestimated. In some scenes a 45' can blast a hole in a building big enough to drive a lorry into the building, and in other scenes the exact same 45' can be used several times on a Zombie character and almost leave no marks.. In some scenes you see costumes that could be taken from ""lord of the rings"" and in other scenes they almost fall off the stuntmen wearing them!! Especially in one scene where some of a chase is in slowmotion you can see that everything on that actor/stuntman that are a part of his / her outfit is moving and shaking. If you like the genre of movies made from videogames and you want to see this one, i wont disencourage you. You'll find out for yourself. If you want to see some other movies made from videogames ""DOOM"" is much much better, even though that one isn't great either.",Resident Evil
493,dscronox,Have they won an Emmy yet?,10,18 March 2002,"Wow, what a great movie. Then acting was good, the script was good, the special effects were great and Mila Jovovich is fine. Paul Anderson may have finally done a good movie. Though, I only have one problem with his movie, what's with the transforming Licker? They never transformed in the games. Me and a few friends actually stayed up all night after seeing this movie debating this, and still haven't figured out how this one transformed. Though, it is a movie.So, when are they going to win an Emmy?",Resident Evil
494,Emanef,Great action zombie movie.....,7,31 July 2002,"As a fan of the Resi Evil games, I was really looking forward to the movie, and I wasn't disappointed.I read a real mixed bag of reviews before I saw the movie, and can't really understand how anyone can criticise a movie that ultimately stays faithful to its videogame origin, but without the cheesiness that most other videogame/movie crossover end up being.  If you're looking for something with intelligence and real substance, you shouldn't be watching a zombie movie.....The story, obviously, is very true to the videogames, but there are also many subtle camera shots and angles that bring back memories of playing the games, such as one moment when the lovely Milla shoots an ex-security guard. He falls back to the ground, slumped against the wall.  As she notices the gun in his pouch, the camera angle changes to above both Milla and the inanimate zombie looking down from above, and you just know that as soon as she touches the gun, he'll grab her! (He doesn't, incidently.....!) It also has the claustrophobic feel of a classic zombie movie, with the constantly increasing flow of relentless walking dead refusing to stop trying to munch their way through the cast.The soundtrack is pretty pumping and does carry the movie, though, to be honest, I think it would have been more atmospheric with no music, just the audio and effects, like the Romero movies of old. Movie companies seem to think they're neccessary for some reason.  Not neccessarily a criticism, just a personal preference. Mind you, these zombies are rather more aggressive looking that Romero's....!All in all, a very entertaining movie, doing exactly what it says on the tin.  Not really sure what else people expected....!And it's left it very nicely open for Mr Nemesis to take main stage.....!",Resident Evil

496,fredrick-eid,Rating,7,5 July 2021,"Considering the movie is from 2002 i can't really say anything bad about the CGI. The zombies was great, but the big bad monster in the end looked like ass, which is expected from a movie that was made in 2002. Probably good looking for it's time. Other than that i liked the story and the acting. The music also fit the movie perfectly. I liked the movie from the beginning to the end and i can't wait to watch the rest of the resident evil movies. A small minus for me because it didn't have any surprising scenarios and most of the things that happened was some what predictable. A solid 7 from me.",Resident Evil
497,iagobg,Loved this film,10,1 August 2002,"This movie was amazing. I sincerely enjoyed it from shocking beginning to the horrific ending.It was extremely suspenseful, disturbing and interesting all at the same time.

499,iamjacksbrain,"People running from A to B shooting things, just like the game",6,2 April 2002,"When the movie started, it was actually pretty creepy and quite interesting. You had a woman who didn't know who she was or what was going on, getting taken away by a group of soldiers who weren't willing to share everything they knew.  When there was mystery and a psychotic computer, the movie firmly had my interest.Then it became a zombie movie.  It was just 40 minutes of shooting things and plot holes after that.  The only real redeeming quality was that Milla Jovovich was pretty sexy.  That being said, it's not a good reason to see this movie, but it is entertaining.  For a little while anyway.",Resident Evil

Milla Jovovich was absolutely beautiful as ever, although I can't say much about her acting. It's not in a movie like this you can tell.The only really bad thing I have to say about it, and I really have to say it, is that the scene where the green grid cuts everybody into pieces is a very clear copy of a scene in a very nice little movie called ""The Cube""(which I absolutely recommend) where a similar grid made of some sort of wire also cuts a guy.I know this scene was very amusing for a lot of people. I just wanted to make it clear that it's not original.",Resident Evil
502,Dude_001,"The film's music is very hardcore, grinding, and violent. It's electronica with teeth, and it's perfect for the film.",8,23 February 2009,"It was just another day in the Hive- a high tech, underground bioengineering facility- that is, until a deadly virus, know as the T-Virus, is unleashed amongst the workers. A government supercomputer seals the Hive killing everyone left inside. However, it doesn't end there. A group of commandos are sent in to shut down the Hive for good, and at the mouth of the Hive they find Alice, a woman suffering from amnesia after being exposed to nerve gas. It seems becomes clear however, that not all is what it seems in the Hive, and shutting her down soon becomes the least of the teams worries...I am a huge fan of the Resident evil game series. My first exposure was playing Resident Evil 2 on my Nintendo 64 in the dark hours of the night, and jumping out of my skin when a licker crashed through a window, or a zombie that appeared down and out suddenly grabbed at my ankles. I remember playing Resident Evil 3 and being in absolute awe of the Nemesis creature. I remember the dark atmosphere,the ambient soundtrack. I remember the puzzles, some easy, some hard, and some just plain frustrating.The Resident Evil film offers something quite different then we saw in the video games, and many fans were displeased with this. Sure, the T- Virus plays a central role, and a few enemies from the film make appearances ( Those pesky Cerebus, the undead killer canines who often jumped out at random to attack your character and almost always traveled in packs, make quite a memorable appearance), but as a whole this doesn't look, feel, or sound like Resident Evil. And though I love the games, I really liked the slick action and stylish tone of this flick, and despite it's shortcomings, I enjoyed this flick.A soundtrack can make all the difference for a film, or even a video game. Gone are the spooky, eerie, piano ditties that populate the game. To match the high tech tone of the film, shock rocker Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami teamed up to create a totally new kind of musical score that adds so much to the film. The film's music is very hardcore, grinding, and violent. It's electronica with teeth, and it's perfect for the film. It gives the film an extra layer that a lot of films, especially action/horror films, lack.The film offers us no game characters, so we see no Jill Valentine, no Leon S. Kennedy, no Albert Wesker. A whole new slew of fresh faces fill this horror show, and this is one area where the film lacks. Many of the characters are disposable, secondary characters that receive no characterization. Even the main players, namely Alice, Rain, and Eric, receive little substance. Milla Jovovich does a good job as a lead action heroine, her merodic acting is forgivable because this girl has so much presence. Milla's charm make a poorly written character shine. Michelle Rodrigues, who I am not terribly fond of, does a great Vasquez impression (from the Aliens film) and it works. She deliver my favorite line of the film, after dispatching a zombie for the first time. Matt Addison is decent as the wide eyed pretty boy. Also, not to be forgotten, is Michaela Dicker, who's voice work for the Red Queen, the homicidal supercomputer of the film, is superb.Paul W.S Anderson does a fairly good job in directing this film. The film looks very vibrant, with bright colors, mainly reds and blues, contrasted with more darker scenes. There are some very cool shots, and some nice visual references to the game.I suppose one thing that bothered me was some of the CGI. Most notably was the licker creature. Slightly different then the lickers found roaming the walls of the RPD in Racoon city, I was quite disappointed in the final result. The licker is one of my favorite Resident Evil creatures, and this film did him no justice. The CGI licker looked terrible, and the animatronics are not much better. Also tied in with my disappointment at how the licker looked, and behaved, was the idea that the licker was the 'boss' creature. When I play Resident Evil, a few shotgun or bow gun rounds take down most lickers I run into, so the idea of the licker as a boss creature is a little silly.Overall, I really liked this live action Resident Evil. What Paul W.S. Anderson and crew did was simply take the structure of the the Resident Evil story and create an entirely different universe. As a fan of the game, I can say that I truly grooved to this new presentation of Resident Evil. A pulse pounding score, slick visuals,some exciting stunts and a quirky sense of humor all give reason to watch this film. Resident Evil's shortcoming's, mainly a lackluster script and a habit of relying on CGI, are forgivable.And that ending... wow.8/10",Resident Evil
503,Milla-M,Put it this way ... the videogame was better.,6,23 April 2003,"Heya! Well I saw this film twice, first in the cinema and secondly on a rented DVD. The first time I went to see it I wasn't extremely excited about it because I am not a huge Resident Evil fan. I have played most of the games before so I suppose the film did attract my interest a little. I left the cinema feeling a little disappointed, I wasn't built up for an amazing film and as I said before I wasn't overly-excited but I guess I just expected more...The second time I was actually more eager to see it. My friends had rented some DVDs and among their neat little pile was Resident Evil. I felt that maybe when I watched it this time I would appreciate some of the better bits more rather than criticising all the less than satisfactory areas of the film, I was riding on hope, and I guess I came up with the conclusion that this film is just a little above AVERAGE.First of all let's start with the acting ... fine! Eric Mabius (who played Matt Addison) was just average. He acted as if he was acting, I know that may not make sense but that's how I feel. Milla Jovovich (she has the same first name as me! I thought I was the only one) (playing Alice) acted well and in some scenes her acting was superb(SPOILER: the scene where she has to decide between killing Rain and her own survival). Michelle Rodriguez, ofcourse, pulled off the tough bitch (she played Rain) act with more than a little ease. The rest of the actors were fine however some were mediocre in parts (Martin Crewes).I was expecting a spooky mansion with plenty of jumps and chilling special effects. Whilst playing the videogame I jumped hundreds of times and I jumped no times during this film. Unless you have a serious fear of zombies then this film isn't extremely scary...either. The special effects were good in parts (amazing looking zombie dogs) but really, really weak in others (that 'Licker' monster...it almost spoiled the film). The setting was fine and I liked the transitions between computer and reality. The storyline was also interesting and easy to follow and there were a few scenes in the film that were quite tense. Also, using a child's hologram as one of the main villains in the film was an excellent idea and very intriguing and she was actually kind of spooky.The make-up was okay methinks. The zombies weren't amazing looking but did pull off the 'dead' sensation quite well. I think the make-up artists were going for a more subtle 'dead' feel rather than a gore-spattered monster look (however in my opinion I think this would've worked better). However some of the effects with the zombies (walking on a broken ankle) were excellent, and overall the sheer mass of flesh-eating dead monsters were enough to disturb you.The action was quite good too. This was one of the better parts of the film, Milla Jovovich racing through corridors, beating the crap out of zombies, executing amazing flying kicks off walls and firing some flashy weaponry made for entertaining watching.I am not a serious Rock fan but I know good music when I hear it. I'm not saying all the music in the film was good however it worked with the film well and created an eerie harmony, music and image flowed smoothly and effectively together.The ending in my opinion was a nice, bitter-sweet twist as well. Some people were just fed up with the film thus far and cared nothing for the ending but I felt that it set the film up for a flowing sequel and was also an unexpected, chilling ending.Overall it retained the essentials of the game and was quite entertaining. It's watchable, you can sit and watch it with no qualms whatsoever however it's not a film you'd go out of your way to make time for. I'm not sure about the DVD, I wouldn't mind owning it but I suppose it wouldn't get a lot of use on my shelf. Combining the acting, action, tension, storyline and other aspects of the film...it was just slightly above average.Watch it, you probably won't regret it! Some scenes are enjoyable and memorable but most likely you'll forget the rest of the film...6/10",Resident Evil
504,jncarr,Good Stuff,4,24 August 2003,"Resident Evil was a suprise in that it is a rather good film.  Milla Jovovich helps this by being easy on the eye.  The action was fairly well paced with some good scenes that made you jump and it was also great to see a lot of the chracters from the game, we did not see enough of the dogs.  I felt where the movie mis-fired slightly was that it had a subplot with Milla's character and few others suffering memory loss.  I don't feel it added to the movie just made you think what's going on.  I would have prefered a straight forward action film in the vain of Aliens where she takes the role of Jill Valentine.  That would have rocked.  The ending is left wide open for the sequel, let's just hope that this is the direction they go in for that one.",Resident Evil
505,david_blakemore,Not as bas as I thought it would be,7,24 July 2004,"After reading the reviews of the film and hearing what one of my mates had to say about it, I figured that this was not a film that was a must see, and I that I shouldn't go rushing to the cinema to see it.
When I did see it, yes I will hold my hands up to this one, it was better then I thought it would be. Ok it's not the BEST horror film to be made, and it does have it's flaws. The worst thing about this film is that it nicks a bit from Cube, anyone who has seen both films will know straight away which part, also the it seems to have nicked a bit from 28 days later.One flaw that does bother me (possible spoilers) why does it take so long for Rain to become infected with the virus, when another member of her team becomes infected as soon as he get bitten. Another one is Alice when shes faced with the infected dogs, surely no one is that accurate with a gun, even if they are good shots.Overall once I started watching I couldn't turn it off, (That doesn't normally happen with me). Milla Jovovich is better then I thought, I have to admit I thought she was such a very pretty face who couldn't act (how wrong I was), hopefully the 2nd one will be much better then the1st because there is a lot of potential here.",Resident Evil
506,popeman89,Conventional zombie film,4,19 January 2005,There isn't much to distinguish Resident Evil from any other zombie films; the same concept of how to kill the zombies or how the people became zombies. The concept of a group of survivors being killed off is also very conventional. The only fairly original part was the mutating hunter that at the start looked like a giant vicious rabbit (I'm not sure if that was a deliberate reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail). The only good thing that can be said about this film was that Milla Jovovich was quite convincing as an amnesiac.Overall it is just like almost every other zombie film ever made although it is watchable at times.4/10,Resident Evil
507,edithisaok580,Not bad actually,10,16 May 2005,"To me, this movie has the same strikes against it as did HP3. Movies are not literal adaptations of the source material. It really is a good movie. I love the games, but a single game can make about three movies, and nobody has the stamina or patience to sit through all that. Also copying the games to a fault would have brought in too much hackneyed cliché material.Would I have loved to have seen Leon, Wesker, or the Redfields? Yes, but this cast didn't disappoint me in the least. Milla was awesome, and Michelle was out of sight, and nobody can tell me that that ending was not amazing.Yes, 28 Days Later was good, but in my opinion, Resident Evil was far more chilling.It gave the eerie feel and the tension of the games. I didn't need much more than that, and it's not as if this were supposed to be Aliens or anything. Mortal Kombat and Super Mario Bros. were nothing to rave about either. At least I can say that I got scared by this.",Resident Evil
508,Werewolf_Reaper,"A really well made,acted and a fantastic story",10,5 October 2006,"I really like this movie because it is well written, well directed and Paul Anderson chose great actors to portray the the commandos. Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, Colin Salmon are definitely the better out of all the other actors. The zombies are not put in your face at the beginning and there is a cause for the infection unlike the night of the living dead movies and also unlike the night of the living dead movies the zombies are less like the stereotypical zombie. The story is easy to get into. Although most of it is not based on the games as far as i'm concerned this was a great movie. Paul Anderson is a genius for writing and directing this movie. Acting 8/10. Story 9.5/10. Directing 10/10. This movie is still scary and it is most definitely better than its sequel.",Resident Evil
509,Trevor-6,Yet another entry in the video game to movie sweepstakes...,8,17 May 2002,"Yet another entry in the video game to movie sweepstakes. Last year's Tomb Raider movie made a lot of money, but critics weren't kind (not that that matters), and Resident Evil looks to be in the same boat. Milla Jovovich stars as a temporary amnesiac who's dragged into an underground laboratory to help shut down a maniacal super computer, along with her husband (Eric Mabius) and a cop who happened to be around when she was grabbed by a special military unit, which includes Michelle Rodriguez, who needs to find at least one role where she isn't constantly angry. Directed by guilty pleasure specialist Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon), Evil borrows a lot from other movies, which is probably a fault of the game and not the screenplay. You can see bits of last year's 13 Ghosts (killer building), as well as Frankenstein (man-made monster), Night of the Living Dead (zombies) and even Speed (there's a scene on an underground train where one person wants to go faster and another shouts that it would make them fly off the tracks, and I thought to myself that that's exactly what happened in the 1994 thriller), among others. Most of those comparisons can only be made after the movie's over, since the action rarely lets up. Originality has never been important to science fiction/horror/action movies, they all happily feed off of their elders, so I can't really hold that against this movie. It's good fun and would make a good double bill with Tomb Raider (perhaps Jovovich or Rodriguez could join Angelina Jolie for the inevitable sequel).",Resident Evil

Why would zombies feed on humans instead of on whatever it was they ate when they were still human?Mutation is not the same as shape-shift.Why have a bunch of scrap steel pipe just hanging around a personnel transport except that the director has a plan for that prop later on?

Let's start with the plot. 1 homicidal computer (done in earlier movies) a lot of Zombies (done BETTER and with humour in MANY other movies) and a dash of lost memory (please, don't get me started). Hence noone really knows who the bad guy/girl is or event if there is one - and quite frankly I didn't care! The characters are so unrealistic and the acting so sub-...well---sub-everything, I'm afraid that I really couldn't care less as to who survived and who died a zombie-death we I had seen done better so many times before... hm. I think I hate Zombies now, and it is all due to this film. Damn! Oh, and I almost forgot! They decided to put in a pile of annoying and unneccesary flash-backs to p*** me off just enough to rate this movie 1 instead of a 2. So there you have it! You enjoyed this movie? SHAME ON YOU!

Nope. While Rodriguez and Jovovich were good within their characters, the plot, the interaction between characters, and the animation sucked. Big time. The movie was so predictable; the cresendo of music tells you when the next creature/character jumps out.

513,alntv,Finally...a decent horror flick!,8,26 March 2002,"Well it's about time! After plunking down good money to sit through crapola like ""The Haunting"" and ""The House On Haunted Hill"", it's refereshing to see a good horror flick come out that caters to this generation of ""it's gotta be loud and it's gotta move fast"". I would never compare this film to a ""Night of the Living Dead"", but I will say that for the matinee bucks that I paid for it, I got every cent worth.I went into this film really looking for a good escape. I had very low expectations and really almost considered not even seeing it. But the main character is pretty hot and the trailor looked somewhat decent so I figured I would give it a shot. I'm glad I did! Low on plot development and high on pacing, this movie takes you on a good ride right from the start. Not being a ""gamer"", I had no idea what the video game is about and so I didn't really know what to expect (unlike ""Tomb Raider"", which I did know a little about, and WOW did THAT movie suck?). I was pleasantly suprised by the way they introduced the main character. She doesn't know who she is either, so as the film develops we learn more and more about her and this makes it easier for the viewer to fall into the general plot of the film. Very nicely done! The opening sequence was very cool! Stealing a bit of Stephen King's ""The Stand"" opening, and making it even more horrific.The meat and potatoes of this film though is the audio. I saw this film with Dolby Surroundsound and it really kicks butt! The music is loud, there are movements behind your left ear, then it drifts over to your right. When a zombie drags a hammer on the ground, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Kudos to whoever did the audio mix on this film! It is done to perfection! And the soundtrack is a perfect match for the pace. Marilyn Manson did this movie justice!Another added feature to this movie, and it didn't occur to me until after I read some of the other reviews here on IMDB, is that there really isn't a lot of gore in this film. No blood splattering moments added for gratuitous reasons. Everything is suggested, which IS sort of odd for a modern day horror film. But sometimes suggesting it (such as the elevator scene starting the film) and/or showing it then cutting away (such as the now famous ""slice & dice"" scene in the hallway) are a much more effective way of freaking a viewer out!Overall, I put this film up there with some of the all-time great popcorn horror films such as ""Aliens"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Maximum Overdrive"". Not a lot of thinking involved, just get ready to be freaked out a little bit and have a great time!",Resident Evil
514,crackboy42,Very true to the game with an American twist,10,17 March 2002,"After Tomb Raider, I was very nervous about seeing Resident Evil.I heard it was to be a prequel to the games, and that just made mystomach turn more. Since Resident Evil (or Biohazard Japan) hasalways been written by the Japanesse, I viewed this movie as a 90minute fan fiction story. Standing on its own, Resident Evil is a great horror/action film. Theentire film is filled with ""what's that noise"" or ""what's around thecorner"" suspense, much like the game. I was always pleased tosee that Millia's ""Matrix Move"" that she uses against the dog (theyshow it at the end of EVERY commercial) was the only string stuntused. Now for the more important part. How well does the movie portraythe game? Very f***ing good. First of all, Millia's costume was verysimilar to Jill's in RE3. Second, about 10 minutes of the film DOtake place within the mansion from RE1 (and if you played thegame, you WILL notice which rooms they are in). Third, a lot of theshots in the film are similar to the game (ex: a dead body lyingagainst the wall and blood stains all over the wall and a pool ofblood leading to his body). Fourth, (and this may spoil some of themovie for you, so you might want to skip to the next paragraph) theclimax takes place on a train. Overall the tone of the game is verysimilar to the movie. On a down note, don't think all the monsters will be in it. Nohunters, tyrants, sharks, spiders. There is ONE Licker, whoevolves into a super Licker, but they save him for the end. The film does have very ""action"" moments, such as the laserscene in the beginning, and the matrix move, but it won't ruin theoverall feel. The audience cheered and said ""Oh damn!"" wheneverthese incidents occured. But my favorite thing about this movie... is the hidden things theyput in that only the gamers would understand. They talk and showRaccoon City, as well as the outside and inside of the mansion.""Biohazard"" is said and shown in the first five minutes. And,(Beware: HUGE SPOILER!) they show you who Nemisis really is,which I thought was a very nice touch. The ending did let you hanging, like they might make a sequel(and I hope they do). If they do it would have to take place duringRE2 and RE3, cause anyone who beat RE3, knows what happensto Racoon City. No Chris, No Jill, No Barry (I love Barry), and no ""You being themaster of unlocking"" (joke for the gamers). GOOD MOVIE. SEE THIS.  EVEN IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE GAME.",Resident Evil
515,kingvegeta8,Greatest Video Game to Movie translation EVER!,10,17 March 2002,"Being a fan of zombie-movies and the biggest Resident Evil fan in the Northern Hemisphere, I loved this movie.  The scenery was superb.  Some of the shots are taken directly from the game and give any true Re fan a feeling of coming home.  This has been my most anticipated movie for a long, long time.The plot is fairly basic but works very well:  An experimental virus has been released in a top secret, underground facility. A team of highly trained, highly equipped ""problem solvers"" working for the Umberella Corporation is sent in to take control of the situation.  As they enter the superficial cover of the mansion that is the entrance to the installation, The Hive, they find an unconscious Alice(Milla Jovovich) and a cop named Matt(Eric Mabius). After acquiring their two new members they break into The Hive and the fun begins. The computer ""brain"" of the Hive has gone homicidal and wants to kill everything within its grasp. After they go underground the action starts to run together and be non-stop, but in a Very good way. Possibly lurking around every corner is a zombie or something much, much worse. The scene to really watch for is when the team enters the corridor outside the main computer control room.  Also not to be missed is the nude scene Milla Jovovich did. HOT HOT HOT!!!  This movie works on so many levels.  It is a great movie that really entertains and has a thumpin' soundtrack. ROCK ON PAUL ANDERSON.  Hurry up with the sequel.",Resident Evil
516,killerjim4,A very good video game inspired movie,8,10 June 2006,"I have a confession: I've never played any of the Resident Evil games. But I have seen the movies and I love them. The story starts with a disgruntled employee of a illegal research facility releasing a chemical virus through the ventilation system. All the employees quickly die. Then we are introduced to a young woman (Milla Jovovich) with amnesia who is somehow connected to the facility. Suddenly a young man bursts into her home, followed by commandos who are there to exterminate the employees who are now flesh-eating zombies. I found the film to be exciting, scary and well made. Jovovich is very good in the role of Alice, who discovers she has fighting skills that come in handy when battling the undead. (I love the scene where she climbs the wall and kicks the zombie dog in the head!) Be sure to pay attention to all the ""Alice in Wonderland"" references. The audio commentary from the cast and crew on the DVD is entertaining. Jovovich points out all of her nude scenes. She also mentions that the American distributor wanted to change the voice of the little girl (Michaela Dicker) who plays the Red Queen, but the American girl's voice was too sexy for a little girl! All in all, a good Saturday night flick.",Resident Evil
517,tliikamaa,"Not horror, but damn good action!",7,10 April 2002,"I am not a great fan of the games, I know about them and have spent a few hours in front of them. Not that they are bad but I did lack the time.The movie acctually manages to capture the feeling of the games, very well indeed. The hopeless situation and the dejectedness of the people trying to survive. The movie also has a game like look and feel to it in the beginning. Watch the first scenes with Milla in the mansion and tell me if you agree...The game style diminishes when the action picks up in pace though. And it really do keep a nice pace trough the rest of the film.I was afraid that the end would spoil the movie in some way but it acctually lifted the overall impression one notch!One thing (the thing?) that I think could have been done better or even have been left out was the ""Big Monster"". It wasn't really state of the art and didn't really fit in. It didn't affect the overall feeling though and I can live with it.The story is good, it follows the original story with the evil Umbrella company performing illegal experiments and the effects of them is what we see. Screenplay lacks some but this isn't a drama, it's action so it doesn't really shine trough. Even the effects aren't that spectacular but they don't need to be. Less is more. Finally the movie score, I loved it! Hard, fastpaced and matched the movie close to perfectly.This is proof that computer games (console rather...) do make great movies. Just give the idea to the right person!7/10",Resident Evil
518,Maddio_2011,WHERE IS THE SEQUEL??????,8,30 March 2002,"The whole movie was fantastic!! The zombies were the most creepy and most vicious i have ever seen in a horror movie. But most of all the giant monster thing(if their is a name for it). The mutated Dobermans were cool to. The only thing that made me upset is that like most movies now a days .. .    IT ENDS OFF IN A SEQUEL!!!!!   In other words  To Be Continued . . .But like I said it was a great movie. Good acting, great special effects, cool mutated monsters, good looking heros, and major arsenals. A must see.",Resident Evil
519,Broudie69,This is the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen Batman & Robin,1,21 July 2002,"This movie is awful and Paul Anderson (Not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, who is a much more talented director and even though I don't like his movies I at least appreciate that he knows how to tell a story)has accomplished a great feat by making this movie bad on so many different levels: the plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the acting, the characterization, the gratuitous nudity (while appreciated by the men in the audience was no way justified). If only one of these aspects had been at fault I could have looked past it but unfortunately nothing was handled well. Firstly in an age of digital effects like those seen in Lord of the rings and Spider-man audiences have come to expect good effects not Zombies created with a bit of green make-up and dogs covered in tinned spaghetti the one digital effect they did spend any money on looked like it was created on an etchasketch, I was more impressed with the graphics in the game than the film. I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects, one only has to watch ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" or ""The Evil Dead"" to see that.The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever scare so you can hear the ""surprise"" coming every time. In an age of self-knowing films like ""Scream"" it's hard to believe that it takes the characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and I'm pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a conscious decision to avoid getting called a ""typical zombie movie"" but that is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how the virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the squad, to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an airborne virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one to the other as it felt like it. The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple and very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display this ""laugh in the face of danger"" attitude audiences have come to expect and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually did write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue to give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and suspenseful, the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it would have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of boredom sitting through the filmed version gave. Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various badly conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away with showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only person in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in this film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to come. An man sitting behind me in the cinema commented, once the film had finished, that it was ""The best film I've ever seen"" I can only assume this was the first film this person had ever seen.",Resident Evil

Here's The Plot:Alice wakes up and doesn't know who she is blah blah blah...etc Then they fight some zombies..... Someone Good dies for no real reason.... Someone you thaught was a bad guy is actually a good guy.... now same except turned around..... big monster wakes up... big monster dies.... bad guy comes back as zombie.... Alice kills said zombie.... happy ending..... Or Is It???? No It's A Sequel Ending.Okay Now what i was saying/feeling during this moviehey Mila Topless....Cool OH COOL ZOMBIES (turns to friends) I Love zombies WHY ARE THEY DEAD???? What A Bad Twist... I Knew that guy was evil... Is That A Licker Or A Hunter? Has To Be A Hunter! Doesn't Matter he was beaten easy... Oh Look who's back... Never mind he's dead... YAY Happy Ending!!! No Wait It Isn't.. That Was A Gay Ending.... No Wait It Isn't Over... SPOT THE GEORGE A ROMERO RIP OFF... No I Have To Wait For The Sequel... God's Sake!Anyone Who Has Watched This Movie Will Agree With Me. BUT it's still a decent Zombie Flick. Okay It's No Dawn(original and remake) But it's still good. It's Wrong To Compare this to the game since they are two different things. So Here's My Rating (given compared to game and not compared to game)Compared To Game 2/10 As A Stand Alone Movie 6.5/10my advice for viewing? With Friends So You Can Make Fun Of It,And So you can have fun. +For some real Fun? Pair it with RESI 4 Mercenaries. Please do me a favor,If you love the game?

521,pdover123,Where's the GORE!!!!!!,7,18 March 2002,I just went to see this movie and it was ok...it had it's moments. Some parts were truly great if they didn't have to be edited. Which I don't understand because Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were a hell of a lot more gorier than this film...and actually a lot better. While I thought this movie was great it could have been truly horrifying. Milla was awesome...but she seemed kinda lost or maybe it was supposed to look that way. But anyway if you want an action packed ride with a few scares thrown in this one is for you. If you are a gorehound then you will be disappointed. I hope that when the DVD comes out they restore some of the cut scenes. I think in all honesty that the nudity near the end is actually worse than the violence but hey I'm not complaining. 6 of 10,Resident Evil
522,Dushku_Fan77,a solid horror action film!!!,8,16 March 2002,"well, originally to me, this movie had cheese written all over it. I expected to have a good time, but Res.Evil, managed to pull me in, make me laugh, make me jump, and best of all, had me -and the rest of the theater- cheerin our asses off. This film definitely does the popular game series justice.as acting goes, milla jovovich is new queen of kickin ass (excludin TV's Buffy) she does great with what is her first REAL starring role. the rest of the cast, especially michelle rodriguez, handle themselves well and are genuinely likable.the gore in this movie is pretty good and both the zombies and the dobermans were terrific looking. Paul  Anderson does a great job writing and directing the film, bringing to life the best video game adaptation ever!the ending was superb and i cannot wait 4 the sequel.

523,Redblok,Who doesn't loathe zombies?,8,16 March 2002,"Don't expect a whole lot of oscar winning writing here, but I found this movie to be extremely interesting. The acting is actually good from some actors and moderate on others, and some of the lines are a little hammy, but overall the movie is terrific horror film.  I found myself consistantly frightened during some points of the film, and when I wasn't, it was certainly a pleasure to watch the kinetic Milla Jovovich preform.The soundtrack was at times inappropriate.  The special effects often obvious, and there was a hint of predictability, but surprisingly (due to the fantastic direction of Paul Anderson) I still found myself jumping. 
This movie was worth my 5.50, and I think it is well worth yours.",Resident Evil
524,jwpon,Better than I expected,7,8 November 2002,"After reading some of the other comments on this movie, it appears that the voting comes down to this: either you thought it was awful, dumb, unoriginal, etc, or that the movie was actually better than expected.  I fall into the latter category.  I've never played the Resident Evil video games, so I really had no expectations for the movie.  I just thought it might be interesting to see if they could make Resident Evil, the movie, better than Final Fantasy, the Movie (which was pretty disappointing). And surprise - it was much better than I expected.  Somewhat predictable, but the action scenes were well done, the scares were pretty scary, and I didn't think the acting was bad at all.  The movie worked for me.  If you want some entertaining distraction for an evening, get a bag of popcorn and pop this movie into the DVD player - it's a fun movie.",Resident Evil
525,SteveMadcow,"""RESIDENT EVIL was a surprise... Check it out if you want fun.""",7,31 March 2002,"I had not wanted to see this flick. The trailer sucked big time, I have never played the games, and I think Michelle Rodriguez is one of the worst actresses in the biz. I also did not find Milla Jovovich as attractive as most horror reviewers thought. Zombie movies aren't my favorite, and all this future stuff makes me sick. Haven't we had enough of the future? My god it's 2002, let's worry about 2002, not 2234. And why can't one director have the guts to change the way we see the future. Every one's god damn future is exactly the same! Shinny walls, computers with brains, stupid people, etc. But that's a whole different subject so back to Resident Evil.I sat and watched, not interested in the whole long explanation of what was happening on the earth at this time. I found myself asking questions like ""I wonder how much Panic Room will make this weekend,"" and ""I gotta buy The Book of the Dead DVD fast!"" Which is strange since the man only talked for about 45 seconds. When he shut the hell up, I cleared my mind, and watched. I thought, ""Oh my god, a camera with a brain,"" but I got myself fully focused when the dumb ass in the elevator got crushed. Now that's what I was looking for in this film. After all the action with the releasing of the virus, Milla Jovovich's character is introduced in this long drawn out scene. How the hell long does it take this girl to stand up! So far, so... well... decent.Well I don't want to go on with this play by play commentary so let me get to the goods. My view on Michelle Rodriguez didn't change one bit! Man, what a horrible actress. I also found it strange that this character is not at all like her character from The Fast and the Furious, yet she acts exactly the same in both! Now if that isn't the sign of a versatile actress, I don't know what is! However aside from the horrible dialogue she is given, and her horrible acting I found interest in her character. This fad of ass-kicking, take charge women seems to be continuing, and god damnit I love it!Milla Jovovich still isn't as attractive as she is made out to be (Well at least not in this film), and still not a very enthusiastic actress. Whenever she does a strenuous punch, or kick she gives off a little tennis player grunt (That little annoying: uh!), rather than an ""I'm kicking your ass"" scream (AHHHH) that I like from the woman who might soon be kicking my ass. But I'm sure she made her brother proud (For those of you who don't know, Milla has said in more than one interview that the main reason she wanted to play this part was to impress her brother.), kicking those zombies asses.I also gotta' ask how stupid can these people be. The guy sees this pale thing, limping along, blood dripping out of it's mouth, obviously not human, and he puts his gun up and says, ""Stop, I'll shot."" And continues saying this and that ""I mean it!"" that is said in all these types of movies, when it is obvious the character doesn't actually mean it. This zombie pretty much could have taken a bite out of his arm, and he just would have kept saying ""Don't move. I'll shot! I mean it!"" And the amount of time it took these people to realize these things are not human is incredible! Maybe they were supposed to look and act more human, but they went overboard on the makeup and overacted or whatever, but come on Milla, and Michelle! Your shooting at the thing, and he just stumbles. The thing ain't Superman babe, get a clue!Now you are all probably thinking, ""My god, he hated it!"" but I didn't! No, I was actually incredibly surprised at the entertainment factor of the film, and did, for the most part, enjoy it from start to finish. The bad dialogue made me laugh, the bad acting made me smile, and the stupidity of the characters made me yell at the screen. And I had a blast doing all of that. What did I particularly enjoy about the flick? Well for one the zombies. Very pretty, nice and bloody, and they didn't get any extras that were too bad (like the nurse zombie in Dawn of the Dead). The violence was also well done, not overdosing on the gore, and making it almost unwatchable, but putting in just enough to put a HUGE smile on my face when the characters I hated got killed.And I gotta talk about ""The Licker."" I loved it! Sure it looked extremely fake, but I thought Anderson did a smart thing by keeping it mostly off camera, and not showcasing his film's bad special effects like many other films do (Brotherhood of the Wolf comes to mind). But I also wish he would have put up a little bit more of a fight. The thing was huge, and he dies pretty quickly, and easily. And how about the highly entertaining death scenes. Woah, those were fun. Like I already mentioned the gore was nice, and that laser sequence was great.Thumbs up to Paul Anderson for his imaginative, and stylish direction. I know it would not have been the same with a different director (It would have been much worse, or much better). Even though I hated that stupid ""Red Queen,"" the POV shots were nice (But couldn't they have come up with a better name for that thing? I don't know if it was in the game or not, but Red Queen? It's a computer/camera for gods sake! How about ""The Computer."" Personally I don't want to live in the future if we name our computers ""The Red Queen."") The score was also a plus, getting me into the film even more. Very loud, very mean, and very nice. And the ending set up the sequel, and did a damn fine job in the process. I loved it!Overall, Resident Evil was a surprise. I expected it to suck, and although it TECHNICALLY did, there is no denying I loved it. Highly, highly, highly entertaining, gory, violent, and just all around fun. Check it out if you want fun, and some pretty bad performances. 7/10",Resident Evil
526,ranev,Blah,5,23 March 2002,"There hasn't been a commercial zombie movie in quite a while thus I was quite excited to watch this one. So I joyfully trotted to the cinema, paid for my ticket and took a seat. It all started quite nicely with people ruining around and having their heads chopped off by berserker elevators. Then I smiled when Mila Jovovich courteously showed a nipple because you simply can't have a good zombie movie without gratuitous nudity. But the further I got into the film, I mean the movie, the more disappointed I became. This movie is so tame! I wanted to see zombie brains splatter on walls. I wanted to see people being decapitated in graphic detail. I wanted to see Mila shoot a double barreled plasma powered bazooka twice her size at that tongued creature and to make it blow up in tiny little chunks of bloody goo.

Much to my surprise Resident Evil turned out to be even better than I had hoped. This movie has plenty of gore, however not just for gores sake but for a great plot line that worked well with it. The plot elements came together very nicely and contributed to a much more plausible zombie story than has ever been done in the past, the corporate security computer ""The Red Queen"" was also a nice touch. Although at times predictable, possibly intentional, it was surprisingly suspenseful. The acting was very good and believable, and for those would-be acting critiques out there this was not intended to be a drama, but an action thriller. As mentioned in another's review, Milla Jovovich is an accomplished actress that I believe made a wonderful performance and not just because she is awesome to look at.

Still, if you havent got anything better to do, this is a good way of killing off a couple of hours. Decent acting, ok action, and some nekkid ladies for us guys, but almost never really scary.I have purposefully avoided comparisons with the RE franchise of games, because i believe a movie should be able to stand up on its own, but there are some nice pointers and in-jokes for those of us who know the games as well.

It had basically exactly the same plot outline but less of the effects: A strange epidemic that turned humans into zombies was raging around a city turning everybody except a few lone survivors struggling to get away from these creatures and find a cure. That happens in Resident Evil aswell(The bit about the cure) but in Resident Evil:Nemisis, and happens through the course of the 'Of The Dead trilogy. But disregarding all that mumbojumbo, the film was pretty good. The special effects looked amazing like when the lazers sliced through the commando's body's, the bits slide off. Not a lot of swearing in it though, which I thought was a bit odd, because you'd expect lots in a movie like this. But quite a bit of blood and gore, which was good.

536,PrimitiveScrewhead,Utterly Disappointing VideoGame Adaption,1,16 December 2002,"This is quite possibly the worse VideoGame Adaption I have ever seen. Paul Anderson has 'hacked' his way into the VideoGame market, and created a blatant cash-in film. This is more like a rip-off of The Matrix than anything else. I am a HUGE fan of the videogame series. The Resident Evil videogames are my favorite games of all time, but this movie is really that BAD. The film follows the storyline of a group of 'ALIENS' type Commandos being sent into a Mansion of some sort, where a deadly Virus outbreak has occured. On the way, they meet Alice, a person who has lost her mind. And.....to hell with it. This film basically has no plot, or even if it has, it has been poorly constructed. The thing about the Resident Evil games, is that they have strong plots which guide you in. You really get drawn into it. This film is incredibly bland. The acting is absolutely terrible, and cringe worthy. It totally lacks atmohpere which the VideoGames provide. Let's see a small comparison between the Film and the Videogame: FILM : Hard rock-type music. - VIDEOGAME : Eerie, quiet, orchestral score. FILM : Bullet Time. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet-Time seen. FILM : Kung Fu. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet time. FILM : Bland Characters. VIDEOGAME : Interesting characters.It clearly comes to my attention, this film bares more resemblance to The Matrix than the Videogames. All characters are new (and very bland and one dimensional). We don't know them, and we never do. It's very unbelievable how a film like this could mess up the Resident Evil saga. The videogames are just begging for a movie version of themselves, and instead, we get something that offers nothing in common with the videogames. It's hard to believe this film was 'based' on them. I don't even think it is. This film feels like 'deja vu', we've seen it all before.Capcom made the biggest mistake of letting Paul Anderson near the Resident Evil series. They also made the mistake of firing George A Romero. Sure, Romero's script changed a few ideas, but it stuck the closest to the videogames. Romero was the only man to do a faithful adaption. Hell, the Resident Evil videogames are based off his ZOMBIE trilogy.Avoid Resident Evil The Movie at all costs.

537,danielmeakin,Well Worth Watching!,7,27 January 2004,"Ok, Video games to films? Not very good admitted, Super Mario Bros attests to that. I am trying not to be biased as i am a massive fan of the video games. Unfortunately, this film was a very very good chance to make a top notch horror flick. It's a double edged sword however, if they rewrite(As they pretty much did) the storyline, it leaves it dissimilar to the VG's that me and quite a few others love! and if they dont rewrite it, it would obviously turn out to be predictable. Besides the disappointment of RE for that matter, it is a great watch, with some special effects to make the game ""come to life"" (the licker) and the film is ultimately cast above such terrible efforts as mario bros and StreetFighter. Milla Jovovich is worthy of a lead role, and looks damn fine as well! A hashed ""alien-style"" plot of the underground laboratory security system ""turning against them"" was kinda shocking but given the aforementioned VG to film efforts, it holds it head up high, though without unfortunately being able to scare the life outta me!any comments or questions on my comment will be answered if you want to email me. Please put RE in the subject matter if you do so !",Resident Evil
538,BuddyCam97,My Guilty pleasure movie,5,24 January 2021,I have a soft spot for this movie yes it's terrible but it's a good bad movie it's the only one that feels like the first game more horror and I don't mind the action it's the lines are cheesy but all the resident evil games are like that cheesy and fun dumb horror action,Resident Evil
539,kimmo-tyyska,Interesting remake from a classic movie!,9,7 June 2005,"Excellent remake from an all-time horror classic 'Night of the living dead'. The movie very deliberately re-creates the horrified and depressing tensions apparent in its predecessor(the aforementioned film). In spite of that it's actually more science-fiction and action-oriented than horror. Don't remember did the director of original classic participate in making of this or not, but the aspects from tension between good and dark side of human nature are all there (under the action-style mainline). Racial conflicts are not so apparent in this, in fact characters all in all are just there to decorate the story (allthough the action and plot of the movie actually begins from Milla Jovovich appearance).There's naturally a lot similarities to other(later) films than NOTLD. For example the main plot about rescue team resembles Aliens movies (especially the 2nd, but others too...) Computerized cameras and views remind me somehow from Terminator films and of course, because movie is based on a game, there's a bit of tension from game-like storytelling. Haven't played the game though, cannot say how much there's similarity.One more aspect to mention is the 'music'(or sound scape) in film which is mostly from 90's ambient and something like techno-metal effects (it might have inspired from the game actually?). It very cleverly builds excitement in crucial moments.All in all, this must be one of the best (not many are worth mentioning) scifi-horror oriented films from 90's/2000. Also, I suppose it could be one of the few really good(if not only one?) movies based on PC-game. There's a lot needles violence and blood as in this kind films usually do, but not too much to spoil the excitement of the plot...",Resident Evil
540,sptmaster,The First and BEST Resident Evil Movie,8,26 September 2009,"First off, I'm one of those people who never played the Resident Evil video games, but after watching the film several times with friends, I quickly picked up on a lot of the stuff.This film starts out and almost immediately sets the plot in motion, before we get to know any of the characters. The computer system kicks in, knocks everyone out, and then hours later the camera is focusing on Alice as she wakes up. For almost the entire first half of the movie, the suspense is very real and effective, and the second half is zombies (and humans) getting their brains blown(/chewed!) out.Definitely one of the better zombie movies; and MUCH MUCH better than it's sequels. 8/10.",Resident Evil
541,thebodyguard_1,Resident Evil? More like Resident Laser,2,13 September 2007,"The movie was suppose to be based off the hit video game Resident Evil in which you play members of a special group in a mansion fighting off zombies and other chemically enhanced monsters. In this movie, our specially trained highly equipped special forces are killed by......lasers. More than half of the team is taken out and honestly, the monster madness isn't really much. This movie was pretty ridiculous. I thoroughly hated the movie. It is not faithful and it is not even a good adaptation of the games. The script is pretty silly. The action is god awful. The story itself is written by a monkey of a man as well as directed by one. I don't think this movie is very good for anyone. Even the blind would be offended. Weak acting from Milla Jovovich and bad acting from anyone else. So basically, go outside for a long job before you even think of watching this movie. It would do you a lot better.",Resident Evil
542,TooMuchSus,"It's Fine, But it Ain't Resident Evil",6,20 March 2018,"The film is alright, mostly. It's just, alright. The acting is hammy, the writing's mediocre, the soundtrack is generic, the visual look is basic and ugly, the story is generic and we've all seen it before. It lies between a rock and a hard place in the unfortunate spot of ""okay."" It's average. And that's fine, if you wanna watch an average action movie more power to you. But the main problem is, it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Resident Evil. The only thing that ties it to its source material is people throwing around the term ""Umbrella Corporation."" The Hive is made up. The Red Queen is made up. The main characters' team is made up. And hey, I mean, if you wanna maybe have your film pave its own path that's fine I guess, but the sequel for this film is very clearly supposed to be based on Resident Evil 2/3, so that excuse doesn't fly. 
 Even if they did try to make their own story they should have had it actually feel like something that would be in Resident Evil. As it stands, the adventures of Anderson's wife in The Hive feels like fan-fiction. Except calling it fanfiction is a stretch because I'm pretty sure Anderson probably never played any of the games, and just read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia. Of course at the very end, they tease with the phrase ""Nemesis program"" as both a fanbase ego-stroke and a sequel bait. The film is Uwe Boll-tier. In fact I think the only reason it performed better than Boll's Alone in the Dark adaptation is because Resident Evil is a Japanese series and most people over here that follow it probably know as little about it as Paul W.S. Anderson did.",Resident Evil

544,QBan,Well crafted game adaptation. A good film... had potential to be great!,7,20 March 2002,"I have not played the video game but the film does have the look and feel of an action game.  Which actually works quite well in fact.  This film has great visuals from sets to special effects to action sequences. It is probably one of the best video game based films yet.  In my opinion this one's far better than last year's much lauded attempt to a game based film.
Resident Evil has a straightforward plotline and wastes no time getting to the point.  The pace is energetic if not frantic. Plot twists and new details are not of the cheesy variety and are well integrated into the flow of the film.  No goofy, quirky characters or plotlines make this film a more serious and credible sci fi action film in the vein of Cameron's Aliens (if not quite as strong).What Resident Evil lacked and could have improved on is the more development and depth for the ""Resident Evil"" part itself. I can't expand on this here without giving away the plotline. But this area, if improved, could have made this a great movie movie indeed!",Resident Evil
545,The Garthster,"Horror fans, wait no more.",10,21 June 2002,"From the opening title sequence to the apocalyptic ending, this film tears you away from your chair and pushes you headfirst deep into its murky depths. Being a film based on a video game, you'd expect a film with non-stop action and visual effects, but without in-depth characters or good writing. `Resident Evil' keeps its characters fresh and interesting, enough so you at least care what happens to them, and has more than enough original plot gimmicks to break out of the sci-fi/ horror genre, but still manages to deliver the action, special effects, and zombie gore that the fans of the game love. I never played the games too much, but I know enough about them to know that this film takes its share of liberties. The characters are not the same ones out of the games, and those who want to get picky will notice that some of the notable creatures out of the games have been altered a little to drive the plot along. But the changes are so small in relation to the overall storyline, which is right on with the game. The thing that saved the film, though, is the direction. Director Paul Anderson's mix of action and horror was perfect for `Resident Evil.' (His first big hit was 1995's `Mortal Kombat,' the first of the successful video game movies, and what I believe started the whole video game adaptation craze in the first place).  He brings `Night of the Living Dead' to `The X-Files' and actually creates some genuine scares. The score by Marilyn Manson helps, along with the grinding heavy metal soundtrack, to create a feel that is dark and creepy one minute, pulse pounding and exciting the next. The sets are another thing that play a key role in this film. Just like any of the countless haunted house films out there, the environment is as much a character as the actors, and this film pulls it off nicely. It explains everything thoroughly, without over-explanations of every single thing that happens. This film won't puzzle you, but it doesn't insult your intelligence, either.Overall, the film is excellent, especially considering the horror films from the past few years. It doesn't attempt to be more than it is, but what it is is quite enough. No over the top horror acting, no over-the-top horror violence, but just enough to please. I recommend this film to fans of the game and to those who didn't know there was a game.",Resident Evil
546,osmanme,At last an excellent movie has been made from a computer game,10,21 May 2002,"I was dearly hoping not to be disappointed, by a movie I had been waiting for since playing the original resident evil on my Playstation alone in my bedroom, back in 1996.  I was hooked on the game and it's sequels, but of late have been made to jump less by Resident Evil games and I guess playing games less generally.With the track record of game to film conversions I was a little dubious that the quality of the film would match the gameplay.  I was disappointed with the conversion of another of my all time favourites conversions, namely Final Fantasy.  It wasn't a total disappointment, but for a series of games I became totally hooked on, just didn't live up to my expectations.  As for Tomb Raider, well I kind of got bored after the first game, but equally I think I would kind of get bored after that first movie aswell.All in all I wasn't sure what to expect of Resident Evil the movie, but I did have high expectations.  All in all I was shocked to find an excellent movie in its own standing, and have been hoping that the fact it's a game conversion doesn't drag it down too heavily at the box office.I think I have to rate this movie in my top 10 of all time, and no I'm not going to pretend that my experience of the games doesn't influence that ranking, because it does.  However, when you like something that much, all too often than not, you're disappointed.  What I'm trying to say here is that if someone who liked the games as much as I did can think this film is excellent, then someone without such high expectations must like it.I'm not about to go into details about the film.  I'll let you all watch it and enjoy it without any major spoilers.  The only criticism that I can level at this film is that it's too short and a few more bits could have been added into the mixture of the film that were in the game, such as more of the guns, other creatures and of course the infamous ""Barry Burton."" Well I guess they have to save some things until the 2nd movie (and I mean the guns, not Barry!) of what must prove to be at the least a trilogy.Watch it and decide for yourself.",Resident Evil

It had me with my jacket over my head and squishing in my seat.Definitely one gory movie ... or was it? Though somewhat graphic in violence (as one would expect from a movie about flesh eating zombies) the style of the film, made it more a tour de force of tension and suspense.  I almost walked out on the movie early, because I just couldn't sit in my seat in anticipation of the next horrific scene.It did what it set out to do very well...it scared the sh_t out of me.",Resident Evil

If nothing else, Milla is awfully easy on the eyes and has enough of a physical presence to make the fight scenes borderline believable.

549,ahmetsena,"What a bright game, What a pale movie!.",6,14 April 2002,"The game was fascinating. However; the movie cant catch up the success of the game. But; anyway, there are some special things which make movie a good one.Main reason is Milla Jovovich. She has a divine beauty. Secondly visual effect are good. Especially; when trooper trying to enter computer center of laboratories. However, if the budget of the movie had been big enough and the crew has been chosen carefully for some specific jobs, the movie would be great.To sum up, the movie is a kind of worth to see. If you like the game you will be satisfied enough.",Resident Evil

I highly suggest this movie to all special effects/gaming fans. This is NOT another final fantasy! 10 stars.",Resident Evil
551,Kingtokeyshawn,"Umbrella Inc. ""Bringing comfort into your home""",9,24 March 2002,"Does anyone else see the relation of Umbrella and Enron, although Umbrella's deception turnouts to be a little more deadly?  For those of you that are confused I am talking about the major corporation that does play a pivotal role in the plot of this movie(contrary to critical and cynical belief a plot does exist).My advice towards the other reviews that you are reading too is to be wary of any extreme take on this movie. Some people gave it a 1 out of 10 and that is not realistic because they were p***ed off by something in the movie thus shredding to part the entire film with fabrications and unbelievable exaggerations that actually made me laugh.  On the other hand be wary of someone who gives it a 10 out of 10 because they might be one of those crazed, lunatic biased fans that jumps at the sound of an unexpected groan.Although I have to admit that I am a biased fan of the game and I did go into this movie extremely pumped, I also had expectations for the film to live up to.  And just being able to say that I like a film that I have expectations for, much less being sucked into says a lot. Now enough of this BS credibility stuff let me tell you about an a thriller of an action/horror movie.  The first thing that jumps to mind when I think about Resident Evil- beginning, middle and end- is the atmosphere.  There was just something about the movies extremely fast pace, tense feeling and genuine dread that made me connect to the picture.  Granted I do have my ""I wish"" 's about the film too but like the others said, its a horror flick you let them slide and keep an open mind so that you are able to enjoy the rewarding aspects of the film, which are fresh, unexpected and plentiful.Milla makes me think that there are few things more sexy than a woman with a gun.  She is stunning throughout the picture and honestly feels like the only character developed by the way she plays her role outside of the dialogue and story development.  As Alfred Hitchcock once said (not in his exact words) ""a really good actor saves you 20 minutes of character development because the audience buys into the character"" and Milla does this.  You really get a good feel for who her character is by just watching her and she is the one person that I got attached to.  Now if we could have only gotten a little more out of the other characters in terms of story development.  I also felt that Hugh Jackman could have fit perfectly as the prisoner in this movie, but it did have a small budget.  The movie is also unique in its pace as it never slows down and you honestly cannot look away for a second for fear of missing something critical, which you might.  I have never ever seen a picture move faster.  This again adds to the atmosphere of the movie that I felt comparable to Memento or the Matrix. If you know the feel of those movies then you know what I am talking about.The action choreography is very good and better than most movies and there are even some scenes that will leave you saying ""awesome"" and ""glad I wasnt that zombie getting my neck snapped.""  I felt that the special forces as protaginists with guns gave the movie more validity and realism, as well as staying true to the game.  Of course there are also some great sequences with the hardware which also left me impressed.  I am anticipating the DVD of this movie already because I would love to see if there is a directors cut of that gives us a little more in character development and in turn would add to the story.  The thought of this however might take away from the razor fast pace, which creates the critical and unique atmosphere that Resident Evil video gamers definitely are familiar with.  Overall I would give this movie 9 out of 10 as I am rating it based on what it is.  A movie that is well above par from your average horror flick bringing in a realistically scary storyline and solid plot that aside from a little more development and omission of a few cheesy scenes and one liners could be one of the classic horror movies of all time.  This film will not disappoint the gamers either and fans of Milla, as I am now one of them after watching this movie, will respect her performance.  She is the standout in this film. Also look for the things that make the horror picture a different type of scary movie.  Director Paul Anderson uses the element of terror to scare the sh*t out of you and that is rare in a scary movie and I find it more terrifying. Moreover the original concept and conscious effort to avoid cliches left a refreshing taste in my mouth, but an extremely paranoid and skittish mind waiting for a zombie to reach from the back seat of my car on the ride home and take a chunk out of my neck.",Resident Evil
552,mmvideoproductions,Game Fans Will Love It,8,21 March 2002,"It may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it sure has some scary moments.  Jovovich is absolutely stunning in the movie and she plays the part well.  Rodriguez got a little carried away with the ""tough"" look on her face.  I was disappointed when I first heard that this movie had no characters from the game, however, I was quite pleased at how well the director captured images from the game.  The last shot of the movie literally blew me away and took me back to Resident Evil 3:  it was almost a perfect picture of the game.  RE fans, see this movie.",Resident Evil
553,americanscipio,Better than Tomb Raider,7,18 March 2002,"And the summary just about says it all.  What exactly about this movie makes it better than Tomb Raider?  EVERYTHING.1.  Action- good, violent, tense, without being too bloody. 2.  Characters- sure, they're two-dimensional at best, but Tomb Raider was one-dimensional at best. 3.  Plot- Tomb Raider didn't have one that made any sense; Resident Evil has a very methodical plot, with a few sharp, predictable twists that make it enjoyable popcorn flickage. 4.  Sequel set-up- never so blatant as in Resident Evil, but the movie still ends with a bang. 5.  Music- Okay, no U2 in this one, folks.  So maybe Tomb Raider wins one category.Not a very good horror film at all, but a great action film, which puts it directly at odds with the game series.  One good thing about the movie is that we finally find out exactly how the T-Virus got released.  This is a huge plus.  Another good thing is that none of the trademark characters from the games are involved directly, so the plot isn't fixed to their fates.Most of the CG work is grisly real, and totally unnoticeable.  The dialogue is sheer torture, and has no funny moments (I kept waiting for a vintage line like ""the master of unlocking,"" but none was forthcoming).  But the earnestness of the characters is sufficiently humorous that it leavens the deadpan seriousness of the film.  I rated this one a seven; I wish the music had been better, and the dialogue sucked.  But otherwise the execution is flawless.One thing: parents, leave the kids at home!  There were at least six kids under age 10 who saw this movie at the same time I did.  Without exception, they were crying at certain points of the movie.  This is just plain dumb. It's rated R for a reason.",Resident Evil
554,mjohns07,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,20 March 2002,"This movie has guilty pleasure written all over it: it has no character development, little revealed plot (it's like an installment of the games - you're never sure all of what has happened or that will happen in the future), and, ultimately, no point, but - unless you're adamantly opposed to either zombie or video game movies - it's hard to deny how creepy and fun this film truly is. ""Resident Evil"" has more than its fair share of genuine frights, some nice effects, and very few instances of incredulity when it comes to keeping certain characters alive - something that's plagued more than a few thrillers recently (MI2, Gladiator, to name a few). Yes, the suspense in this film is actual suspense, i.e. in every scene there is the chance that the main characters could actually lose. The movie plays out very much like one of the games, which was enough for me to enjoy it.That said, the movie has its flaws. People needing something deeper than close calls, gore, and death to enjoy the film will be let down. And there was certainly opportunity for the film to be more than just another installment of the game. There was definitely room for character development, which may not have seemed necessary for game purists (because, naturally, in the game you assume the main character's identity and can identify with their horror in that manner), but usually it is for movies. There is little room for personal attachment to the characters in the film, which is a small let down, good as some of the frights are. The movie also could have initiated us more in the workings of the Umbrella Corporation. There's a strong anti-corporation message under all this gore, but it never gets fully realized.Still, an overall enjoyable film. The laserbeam scene will go down in film history. Not for the squeamish.Matty J 7/10",Resident Evil

No humor, no surprise in an ultra-linear plot, just like a game with a start point and a game-over screen, just a little cheap twist about memory loss (not as good as Memento), a few scary moments OK but when i watch a movie i want more than a Luna Park feeling. No heart, i did not feel any emotion for any character, nothing matching Dawn of the Dead, or Day of the Dead from Romero. A pure vacuum feeling.

566,UthinnkUknoMe,"Years of sequels and still the most solid, story-driven of the franchise!",8,19 April 2016,"I want to start off this review by saying that I am a fan of the video game franchise- far more than I am the film franchise. However, this review is an honest review about the film- Resident Evil- and the overall film franchise. For starters the film kicks-off with a laboratory catastrophe, a viral outbreak of sorts which in turn, forces an emergency lock down on the facility leaving many for dead- setting the tone for the overall story line to this film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who mysteriously awakens from an unconscious state which is implied to be taking place after the lab catastrophe. The mystery revolving her whereabouts, her identity, and the lingering sensation that she may be in immediate danger soon draws the audience in for the remaining 90 minute, action-packed Sci-Fi thriller!Alice, along with a clean-up crew made up of a special military unit, soon unravel the horrible truth as to why the laboratory was put into lock down and the doors should have stayed locked! Brought to you with a chilling soundtrack, plenty of intense horror sequences, and jam-packed with some exciting choreography and action- Resident Evil is a truly timeless Sci-Fi thriller. Unlike its preceders, Resident Evil provides an intriguing story, a solid and likable cast, and ties up its own loose ends before setting us up for the sequel to follow. Without a doubt in my mind, Resident Evil is by far the best film in the entire franchise. This is a film that knew exactly what it wanted to provide its audience- a fast-paced Sci-Fi thriller that would be enjoyable to those who played the games and to those who didn't- and needless to say Resident Evil nailed it! If you're a fan of the genre and have yet to get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend doing so. As stated, this a timeless flick that is great to watch for a little bit of action, suspense, and everything else you'd expect from a Sci-Fi film. 8/10 - and by far the best film of the franchise!",Resident Evil
567,kingcnut23,dull,1,5 October 2012,"Simply one of the most boring, predictable and generally anticlimactic movies ever made, only being surpassed in it' awfulness by it' numerous sequels. The acting is sub-par (even by Milla Jovovich's standards), the plot is laughable, the action is dull and repetitive and the Matrix style bullet time effect is over used. For fans of the games, this film has nothing to offer you. In fact you're likely to end up hating Paul Anderson, that is, of course, if you didn't already hate him for his previous travesties.For fans of zombie movies, this film has nothing new to offer to you. All you will get from this film, and indeed the plethora of abortive train wrecks it's spawned, is an uninteresting rehash of things you've seen before, nothing has even been used in an original way. For fans of horror films, this film contains no suspense and is about as likely to frighten you as offering salt lick to horse is likely to frighten it. This is an action film pure and simple, an all style no substance action film at that.For fans of well-made movies, the genre of which really doesn't bother you, look elsewhere. If you are masochistic enough to feel you that you just have to see this film for yourself don't say I didn't warn you.There is a very special group of people who will love this movie, namely 14 year old boys with below average IQs and way too much testosterone. The only redeeming feature of this film is the soundtrack, but if you like that kind of music you'll probably have every song you hear in this film already.My suggestion save your money and get yourself a tin of paint, you'll have a lot more fun watching it dry than you would do sitting through this steaming pile of horse manure. In summary, the Resident evil the movie will probably go down in history as the most expensive B movie ever made. If you actually liked this film I have nothing but pity for you.",Resident Evil
568,greenhourfilms2,"great, if you know what to expect",6,17 September 2012,"If you are looking for a film that is thought provoking and will make you ask yourself some of the deepest questions in life, you've come to the wrong place. If you want to throw reality out the window for an hour and a half and enjoy a film with zombies, blood, side-boob shots, and great mindless action, this is the one. While this movies does have its flaws(bad acting being the biggest), its not like it's trying to win an Oscar. I will always defend movies like this because they often get panned by people who just don't understand what it's about. This movie is just plain fun and has tons of re-watch value. Of all the video game adaptations, this is among the better ones.9/10",Resident Evil
569,fmissel,"Action/sf/thriller worthwhile seeing for the effects and graphics, the story coming over as believable even if a bit thin",7,25 September 2004,"Resident Evil turned out a bit better than expected. It's a quite good action/SF/thriller with execellent shooting and stunning effects. From what I had read the plot would be a bit thin, and true enough the simplicity of it, is the weakest point of the movie. That said, I still think the acting is quite good all around, especially considering the story they had to work with. The characters simply come over as believable. It's like everybody believe in the universe that is the essence of the story, which makes it real, even if is not deep personality that is explored here. The above together with some really good graphics and picture effects makes it a movie worth seeing. As for the thriller part some of the scenes and effects were quite shocking - in a good sense. The pace is fast like Aliens (2) so that your attention is kept on the screen, even if not up to overall level of that movie. I gave it a 7.",Resident Evil
570,vanillacoke420,Very good action movie,8,21 March 2005,"I saw this when it first was up on the big screen, and then while I thought it was pretty cool I kinda forgot about it. Then a few days ago I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I remember it now.It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work together with to set things straight again.The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure there were clichés in this film but certainly not many and apparently they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling, from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and most that happened thereafter.As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more. If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get the answers as the story moves on.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far as I know, but I liked her performance.My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense mechanism that they encountered early on.All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.",Resident Evil
571,jbhard,sign of the times for the ailing horror genre,1,2 July 2005,"As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead, the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey, at least their films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even UNintentionally funny. So, with no humor, that leaves horror to carry the film, which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15 years, it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension takes time and consistency, something most modern film makers don't seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video without music.Once again, the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb things and they do dumb things. Once again, the 'modern' tough, smart, strong, cool, sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of seeing an equally appalling sequel.If you haven't seen this film - DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never have back. In the age of DVD, there's a wealth of good horror to be found. Better yet, Video games are fast becoming better than modern films. Resident Evil the game and it's sequels (especially 4) out class this pile by miles.",Resident Evil
572,DD_Shadow,Hardcore fans of the games be warned!,7,1 November 2005,"Now don't be too taken back by my comments summary. I actually thought Resident Evil was a really good action (yes action, not horror) flick. It has practically nothing to do with the video games except for the Umbrella Corporation who are the creators of the T-virus biotoxin. And of course, Racoon City. The Tvirus is catastrophically leaked in a large hi-tech underground facility beneath Racoon City named The Hive. Super slick, sexy ass kicker Alice (Milla Jovovich) has to team up with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Matt (Eric Mabius) to escape from the complex which is now overrun with flesh eating zombies. Ahaha. No need to describe it any further. Its plainly obvious how the rest goes. Fight scene goes to another fight scene with some shallow dialogue and weak plot, this movie is definitely not brilliant, but is, In my honest opinion, just ""good really"" The CGi within was remarkably well done, and the Licker monster was really (no DEFINITELY) the ONLY kinda scary thing within this movie. Worth a rental or purchase? Neither, just wait for it to air on TV.",Resident Evil

It's one of best movies that were made. Especially gamers will appreciate this one. All horror movies have -2 rating on average, just because they are horror movies. So this has real 8.7 rating. It is from 2002, after this year, most movies sucks. I watched it already hundred times and i still have fun watching it again, after some time.Good acting, it is suspenseful and action packed and has epic story !!! I remember watching it first time, i had so much fun. I don't want to mention any spoilers, i just had to write review and give this one 10, because it is so heavily underrated. I will just compare it to other movies like: matrix, speed 1994, fight club, the rock, swat and what not. It from time, when movies didn't suck yet.",Resident Evil

Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocampo) was awesome. Milla Jovovich (Alice) I think really did a good job...they even did almost all of there stunts! Some of the Goofs posted, you wouldn't know about unless you watched the commentary (I did of course). A lot of the things are really unnoticeable. The handwriting continuity was pretty bad though but I didn't realize it until the second time I watched the movie. I didn't watch the commentary until the 3rd time I rented it so I didn't know about the floor flexing in the elevator scene until I watched the commentary...I really liked how the director didn't shove the zombies in your face until like half-way through the movie. One of the reasons I really liked the movie was BECAUSE they didn't find out how to kill the undead until the Red-Queen chamber scene. I didn't enjoy the second one (Resident Evil: Apocalypse) BECAUSE they already knew how to kill them and it wasn't as much of the learning curve as in the first one. I really enjoyed this movie and I plan to get it for X-mas... Yes I loved it that much!",Resident Evil

Now, i have played the game and it is quite good, maybe if the story was based on the story from the game but no, it wasn't. They changed the story which is one of the best bits of the game.This movie is obviously for the people who don't watch many horror films and who don't play any games.I personally thought it was crap and even though i am eager to watch the sequel (to see if they stuck to the storyline a bit more, which i highly doubt) i am still going to say it once more.This movie is for people who want simple story lines and who want no explanations at all.. For people who haven't played the game and for people who don't watch horror films...",Resident Evil
576,h_a_taylor,Excellent premise....,3,23 February 2006,"...for a video game! I joined IMDb for the sole purpose of writing a review for this movie. I don't even care if anyone reads it, I just absolutely had to vent. I watched this movie with average expectations, knowing and having heard little about the film. Let me be the first to say that this movie should never, ever have been made. And then they should never, ever have made a sequel (but that's a story for another day). I won't give anything away here, because there's pretty much nothing to say about the movie that hasn't already been covered in the summary... in a way that makes way more sense, I promise. Meanwhile, this movie is just like the video game. Literally. I felt like I was playing a first-person shooter the whole time. The kind with a lot of unnecessary segues and animation, but no real action. But without the fun of doing it myself. (More accurately, I guess I felt like I was watching someone else play a first-person shooter.) The concept of the plot itself is just really, really dumb. Usually you can make up for something like that with good action or awesome fight scenes. Not so here. The action felt forced and was extremely predictable. Loud sound effects and a soundtrack with lots of power chords never make up for a lack of substance, and didn't here. Milla Jovovich's talent is completely wasted in this film. She's too good to be doing stuff like this. Really. And regarding Michelle Rodriguez... well, I've seen better acting skills in my 14-year-old sister's school plays. She has only two facial expressions: angry, and really angry. I only gave this movie a 3 out of 10 because I've seen The Hulk.",Resident Evil

580,Sil-7,Zombie-Bashing at its best,9,27 February 2002,"I was lucky enough to see Resident Evil in a Sneak Preview in Vienna, Austria. As usual for the horror genre the movie is rather short (around 90mins) but not a second of it is boring.The movie starts off with a virus being released in an underground research center called ""the Hive"". The A.I. closes all exits and kills everyone inside to keep the virus contained. When our main character (Milla Jovovich) awakes in the shower, she has no memory of who she is. A group of soldiers takes her along to the Hive that is located under the building she woke up. They don't tell her much, only that she was supposed to protect the entrance. Everyone who knows the computer game knows what follows: tons of zombies.The story evolves rather nicely since we never really know more than the main character. The suspense added by this to the known genre plot of ""get out before they kill you"" is a nice little extra. There is nothing to complain about the special effects and the action is well executed though obviously inspired by the Matrix in some places. The music is effective, loud and fits the movie.I really enjoyed it and I think that fans of movies like ""Pitch Black"" or ""The Relic"" will enjoy it too. Splatter-fans might be somewhat disappointed, the gore factor isn't higher than in any of the movies mentioned above. Fans of the video games will notice nice little tidbits taken from the games and even if I played only part of one of them, I liked the attention to the details (for example the sound that the zombies make, the equipment used, the enemies encountered and most importantly: the end). I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre and to everyone who played one of the games.",Resident Evil
581,geckodude,"The ragged they come, the ragged they kill. - Hardly!",4,26 July 2002,"Essentially, I was extremely unimpressed by this movie because of the wasted opportunity that it was!  This review may contain spoilers! (- if this movie can be spoiled by giving away plot details!)To put this in context, I have never played the game but have always been aware of it and its reputation.  I have always enjoyed the classic zombie movies of the 70's & 80's.  As such, I felt it would make a good movie, especially as there have been no good zombie movies for quite a while.The story was quite passable, but not totally engaging.  The acting was also average, but that's what I'd expect from such a movie.  Hell, the greatest zombie movies suffer from poor acting.However, there are 2 major flaws with this movie.  Firstly, the marketing aspect.  It's based on a computer game, therefore it has to appeal to a younger market - there goes any potential for a nice gory movie. Secondly, as a result of this, it's clearly more of an action movie than horror or zombie flick.There are moments that are supposed to be scary but these are all practically signposted - no surprises.  You can practically guess what will happen next.  This isn't a scary movie.  The scary element of a zombie movie is the way these monsters never relent until they've totally ripped apart their victim.  There is literally no blood or gore in this movie - no horror!  The effects of missing body parts might be nicely completed, but the zombie action is ultimately poor.  Does the audience really want to watch another average gung-ho Aliens rip off??The action itself isn't particularly spectacular either.  It's still amazing that these trained killers can't figure out that since body shots have no effect, a head shot might have more impact.  And it was unsurprising to see the introduction of a ""superbeast"" into the movie, to allow for a greater amount of pointless CGI.  Musically, they overdo it on the industrial metal front (an excuse for a tie in CD!!). More atmospherics and sparing using of the industrial metal would have been more effective!This movie is passable entertainment, but it just could have been so much more.  One can only imagine how different this movie would have been if George Romero had remained in charge.  Do yourself a favour, watch the classics (Night Of the Living Dead, Dawn Of the Dead, Day Of the Dead, Zombi 2, Evil Dead) rather than this average action movie!",Resident Evil
582,SmackmYackm,"If you love the game, you love the movie!",8,12 March 2002,"Friends, Gamers, Fellow movie goers, your friendly neighborhood SmackmYackm had the opportunity to see a special sneak preview of the new Resident Evil movie. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity, since it was free.
Let me first start by saying that I walked into the theater tonight completely biased and almost hoping for the movie to be a complete and total turd that didn't even deserve to be placed in the porcelain throne. I was totally certain that this movie was going to stink so bad that the stench would rise above the audience like a foul flatulent cloud and drive everyone out of the theater demanding their money back for a movie they didn't even pay for in the first place. Well friends, I was happily disappointed.From start to finish the movie just oozes everything that made me fall in love with the games. From the eerie atmosphere to the jumpy feeling to the hundreds of zombies this movie was from start to finish, Resident Evil. Those familiar with the game will start to see the resemblances right away and continue to see them all throughout the movie. The train, the mansion, the ending that screams sequel and most importantly the walking dead, its all there with the exception of the poor voice acting and the frustrating control scheme. Surprisingly, it doesn't rewrite the story, but expands it. Very easily just another chapter in the story, it could be tied together with the other chapters like a finely knit sweater. Even if you didn't like the game, but found the story compelling, you will like this movie.
As a movie it plays very well. It has action, suspense, a little drama and a whole lot of `what happens next'. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was lurking around the next corner. The acting was very good considering the fairly unknown actors and the few, which in my opinion just aren't very good in the first place. All in all it is an action movie but does not feel like one. A few scenes suspend belief, but after all it is basically science fiction. No overdone fight scenes or Matrixesque `wire fu' but a whole lot of run for your life. All these pieces come together to make a very well done movie. I also found out that this isn't a `Hollywood' movie so that may have something to do with the reason it didn't suck, but I would like to think that movie producers are finally starting to notice that the movie goers are not all as stupid as they think we are.
The bottom line, Resident Evil is a thrill ride good for both movie fans and gamers alike. I myself couldn't have been more pleased and I think you will feel the same. Whether you're a fan of the series or a gamer that would like to see a gamer movie made well or just a fan of the cinema, you should try this one out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Resident Evil

Michelle Rodriquez is awesome as Rain, the member of a team of commandos sent to find out what caused the death of all those poor lil peoples who were living and working underground at the Hive. It seems the Umbrella Corporation is up to no good and bad stuff happened to unsuspecting people leading to some lurking nasties you only see in your nightmares. Anyways, Alice (played by the lovely Milla Jovovich) is a woman suffering from amnesia who is pulled underground with all the commandos. You begin to see her fit into the whole movie as she remembers who she really was. The others are, uhh, ok. Just your regular tough commando boys running around with big guns. Okay forget the plot and just sit back and relax as you watch people getting chopped up, sliced and diced, served to some very hungry zombies, chased by dead dobermans and a thing with a long tongue (get this, its called a licker!)

585,Uncle A,It's Creature-tastic!,10,26 April 2002,"This is easily the best creature flick to come out in many years. Not since Aliens have beasties jumped out of the dark (or the corner of your eye) with more scare value. Sure, the story was clearly written on the back of a cocktail napkin, but that doesn't mean it's bad in any way. In fact, apart from the obligatory crawl-through-the-ducts scene the plot is not overladen with cliches and the twists and turns are not swiftly apparent. The two ladies in charge, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigez (sorry, can't spell) are excellent and are an excellent foil for each other. The monsters are cool and the amount of matrix rip-offs are kept to an acceptable minimum. All in all, this is a fun film with lots of jumpy moments and healthy helpings of gore. Expect Night of the Living Dead but with 2 hotties and some CG, and spend 1 and a half happy hours reacquainting yourself with zombie night-life.",Resident Evil
586,wyrder,pretty good action flick,8,15 March 2002,"The movie was a lot better than I expected.  Then again, my expectations were set *really* low (so that it would be difficult for me to be let down).Res. Evil greatly exceeded my expectations.  That means it was pretty good--not Oscar material, but good.They movie intentionally has a somewhat different plot from the game it's based on (so that things don't get boring).  At the same time, even though it's different from the game, it manages to keep a lot of the same feeling--and you can definitely still claim that this movie *is* ""Resident Evil"".
Warning: ::Possible semi-ENDING-SPOILER::Watch out for that ending--it's dark, open ended, and screaming, ""SEQUEL!!"" It looks really cool too.  :-)

Because instead of taking ever bit of the game titles and throwing it into a movie that appeals (and makes sense) only to fanboys, Resident Evil stands well on its own as a horror/suspense movie. To be fair, the acting is pretty stiff. Shakespeare its not. However, it definitely has its share of scares and times when stuff just pops up. The plot is surprising well put together, the music creepy, the zombies (this is a zombie movie in the vein of Evil Dead)well done. Basically, the bottom line is, if you want to go see a classic horror movie redone with Milla Jovovich then its a great movie to see. Its plain and simple fun.",Resident Evil
588,anithyng_gose,"Compared to the game, it falls way short.",4,16 March 2002,"Okay, I am going to warn you that the following comments may contain spoilers, because I'm not sure if comparing scenes from the film and the game could be seen as such.Anyway, Resident Evil is less like the video game and more like Event Horizon (by the same director, Paul Anderson) meets Dawn of the Dead (by the man who basically invented zombies, George Romero).  Here's the bad first, as it is a lot easier to recall the bad than the good.
Screw Up #1: Changing the script!  Our Event Horizon director must have really liked his old film, because he decided to rewrite the RE script and make the Umbrella lab a slave of some AI computer, just like the ""living spaceship"" in EH.  It felt more like the team was in battle with the lab instead of the zombies.  And to think they initially had George Romero on the staff and let him get away!Screw Up #2: The zombies (what's left?)! There were no zombies in the mansion like in the game, it was basically ""zip right to the lab to make the movie easier to shoot i.e. more contained.""  The zombies that were in the film were not scary or gory (except for a couple) and unlike older (Romero) zombie films, there was little violence in their destruction.  No humor, no creativity, terribly crowded camera work on many of the ""zombie"" sequences, etc.Screw Up #3: The plot (now what's left?).  The plot was a total rip off of Dawn of the Dead, yet Dawn was a much more entertaining, well-rounded movie. One major difference is that Anderson didn't take any time to develop ANY of the characters, so we really could care less who gets killed.  When the good guys do die, most viewers won't even remember their names at that very moment.Screw Up #4: Translation (yep, that's right).  They did not use ONE character from ANY of the games! Anderson claimed that using characters from the game would make the film too predictable.  I (and I hope you agree) think that was a BAD move.  I think his reason was that he didn't know JACK about the characters, so instead of doing some hard-nosed research on the games  to ""get it right"" he decided to do it ""his"" way. Ouch!Screw Up #5: The ending.  I won't give that away though...The Good: If you saw the commercial or trailer you saw most of the good stuff i.e. the dog getting kicked in the head, the lab sets were great, Milla is so beautiful I think she was the only reason most guys watch the film to the end, and there are a FEW other parts of the movie relative to the game which aren't worth mentioning.  I had mixed feelings about Tomb Raider when I saw it, I thought it was good, but not very deep.  But compared to this, Tomb Raider looks like gold.  Anderson did much better with Mortal Kombat, I'm not sure what happened here.Overall score: 1.5 out of 4 stars",Resident Evil
589,MattJHmm,"Get YOUR Umbrella, because this movie REIGNS supreme!",9,15 March 2002,"Excellent way to implement the story from the video game to the big screen without making it too complex. They weren't twins by any means, but the story line is definitely good, the plot is pretty thick and still somewhat echoes the game. Unfortunately, there are no connections to the characters within the actual game, but for the movie to stand on it's own and be ""inspired"" by the game, rather than a cinematic version of it, it was done nicely. Enjoy.",Resident Evil
590,Crayle,IT ROCKS!,10,10 April 2002,"I don't know who rocks hardest, Anderson or Rodriguez. Anderson is my favorite director and with R.E. he shows (again) how to make a game into a movie. With a simple story he manages to make the best game-to-movie ever, and probably the best zombie film ever. Michelle Rodriguez is cooler then any action-heroine around, with her cool rough style.  She also moves cool in the movie, in one scene she reminds me of a cat. Yeah, sure, Milla is also cool as action heroine (harder then in 5th Element) but the star of the movie is Michelle, whitout doubt. The introduction is really cool, and the fact that you just *know* that there are zombis lurking, before the commando team does is also great, you just wait for them to pop out. This movie is better then I expected, but Anderson is a genius. And Michelle rocks.",Resident Evil

Its a good thing too because I wouldn't have paid over $1.00 to see this crap. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil video games and I understand that the conversion from game to movie is hard. But thats not what made this movie ridiculous, in fact it lines up pretty well with the beginning of the first Resident Evil game, and the movie itself has a good plot. What makes this movie ridiculous is Umbrella's swat team sent in to control the threat of the T- Virus. This is the most absurd conglomeration of soldiers I have ever seen. Most of the people in the squad crap themselves whenever they witness anything bizarre. And Michelle Rodriguez's character ""Rain"" is absurd. Its like Paul Anderson was writing this movie and said, ""hmm I think I'll make one of the characters a ghetto bitch with a bad attitude."" If this movie is anyones fault it is Paul Anderson's. From the opening scene where Rain tells another character to ""blow me"" Resident Evil is full of ridiculous one liners. In fact thats about all of the dialogue. The only real speaking role is that of the ""red queen,"" the A.I computer system that is in control of the lab in which the outbreak has occured. As far as gore and violence go I have no idea why this movie was rated R other than the use of the F word. Anyone who applauds the action (if you can call them that) scenes in this movie is a moron. This movie is a joke and a disgrace to any other zombie based movie. I give it a 6 out of 10 only because Milla Jevovich is naked.",Resident Evil
593,wsp,Absolutely Fabulous,10,14 January 2003,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked that they didn't take one of the games and turn it into an adaptation.  I think Paul WS Anderson did a great job and I am anticipating Nemesis.  Everything about it was done excellently: special effect, cast, storyline, everything.  I recommend this movie to everyone not just the die hard video game series. Awesome movie!",Resident Evil
594,ben_ethus,Braaaaaaains!,8,16 March 2002,"**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**Being a big fan of the video game series, I went into the theater hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.  (I think we all know how well video-game-to-movie translations typically fare.)  The previews I'd seen for the movie did nothing to bolster my expectations, nor did the early reviews I'd read.  Imagine my surprise when it actually turned out to be GOOD.Granted, it has its flaws; namely, poor CG effects, and fairly lame acting, but, overall its a very enjoyable experience, provided you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride.Before seeing it, I knew that the movie would have virtually nothing to do with the games' existing story-line, or its existing characters, and that kind of irritated me.  (Why would you turn an existing franchise into a movie and eliminate its most basic of components?)  But, as it turns out, this actually works in the movie's favor.  They crafted an original, albeit basic, story using elements from the game that help to define it stylistically: story progression from creepy, Gothic mansion to high-tech research center, broken-down and flooded environments, the train sequences that just shout ""Resident Evil 2"", and a high quantity of ""shock moments"" involving creatures shattering windows, and arms flying through walls. 
There were also a number of homages to the game series that I found rather appealing, such as the use of certain static camera angles that look like they were ripped directly from the game, and the fact that bodies had a tendency to ""magically disappear"" when the characters weren't looking (which they did in fact notice.)I was rather surprised by the lack of gore present in the film, though, on the other hand, I was taken aback by the level of gruesomeness present. Very nasty things happen to a few of the characters, and the director lets your imagination do the work in some of the films most hideous moments, which is refreshing.  (You probably wouldn't really want to see the results of these things, anyhow.)Overall, ""Resident Evil"" is a satisfying movie experience that should definitely be checked out by fans of the games and horror fans in general. It's been far too long since a decent horror flick has been released theatrically, and an especially deplorable lack in the amount of zombie movies released.  I hope this movie does well, such that we see more zombie movies made in the future, potentially enabling George Romero to create the fourth installment of his ""Dead"" series.Heck, I'd even settle for a sequel to this movie.  The movie's final image is fabulous, and I would love to see a movie taking place in the environment shown.  The movies may even turn out to be like the games, where the sequel improves upon the original by leaps and bounds.  How cool would that be?",Resident Evil
595,kelley28,Awesome!!,10,9 August 2007,"I have said, I don't how many times, that if the movie were exactly like the game, we would see one person walking around a mansion for an hour and a half and solving puzzles. And the complaints would roll in about how boring it was. This movie and it's sequel, were what inspired me to play the games. And since I have played all of them, at least part way through, so many scenes in these movies make more sense to me. I can see where the director got the ideas he used. Also, if you have played the games, you can see that elements from the games have been used.Movie - Game *Alice's ""husband"" Spencer - Spencer Family Mansion *Matt's sister Lisa - Lisa is a character from RE 1 *The dogs *The Hive and most of the action takes place under the Mansion - Under the Mansion is where we find out why the STARS members are in the house in the first placeGranted, that's a small bit that I can think of, and yeah, Anderson could have had the original characters used, but if you saw the interview with him on the DVD, you would know that he said that he created the movie this way for people who had never played the game, but used things that the game fans were used to.Personally, I think the game series is awesome, and I can't believe that I had never played it before, but I thank Anderson for making this movie and bringing this series to my attention. It's easy enough for non-gamers to understand and enjoy; and there are plenty of game references for fans to see, even if some are not noticeable right away.P.S. - See this movie. And gamers, stop complaining so much. No adaptation is ever going to go the way we want it, and it just makes it harder for gamers to be taken seriously by non-gamers. Non-gamers already think we are losers. Let's not give them any reasons to think so.",Resident Evil

We've seen dissapointments ranging from dull (Final Fantasy, Tomb Radier) to utterly horrible (Mario Bros., Street Fighter).  I will concede that I found the original Mortal Kombat somewhat entertaining.  There is, however, absolutely no saving grace for this sorry excuse for a movie.  The acting is bad, the story seems thrown together, and did I mention the acting was bad?  Oh, I almost forgot, thanks to this movie, we now have a scientific explanation for zombies!  Come on, Hollywood!  I suppose next you'll tell us that The Force is really just a bunch of cells inside the body.If you want a good laugh, try to borror it from a friend who might have been tricked into buying this movie.

And let me put it this way; finally someone took over where Romero left off!The movie has been put together in a way, so that it never, at any time, seems to drag. All scenes, from the very first, to the, somewhat expectable ending, slithers on in a creepy pace, that really revives the feeling I had the first time I saw NotLD.As for acting, Milla Jovovich does her part well, but not the biggest challenge she's ever had.All in all, this is a new generation of zombie films, and I can't wait till ""Resident Evil 2 : Nemesis"" comes out!",Resident Evil

The actors in the movie were my favorite thing,  Milla Jovovich is awsome in this role and so is Michelle Rodriguez because there tough and know how to kick zombie butt.

But after watching this movie i must say the scares were quite refreshing as in they were not your standard kind of horror. Overall i'll say its pretty good. And i like the way milla jovovich (did i get that right?), played her role, that confused, apprehensive but yet calm and controlled kind of action figure you would find in the game. but i must say the role played by Michelle Rodriguez WAS HORRIBLE....it was super irritating the way she played the role, perhaps the director wanted it that way or it was the actress who made her role suck so bad i dunno, but the way she spoke and the way she TRIED to look unfriendly and bitchy really irritates me. She like a small child acting smart and have that ""know it all"" look in the film. Well dun let that spoil your enjoyment of the film. (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

605,halfband,Resident is not in the evil........,8,22 October 2007,"The first installment of Resident Evil was true enough to the video game to make it a great movie. The movie did not really concentrate on ""The Resident Evil"" meaning the house that was haunted by zombies. Although the zombie virus was created by Umbrella,... the video game concentrated on the fact that the mansion was infested with zombies. That made it ""Resident Evil"". The mansion was haunted by a resident that was evil,.... But the first movie was good because it had stayed true to the fact that zombies (whatever the virus infect-ant was) were the main theme. Resident Evil (the first movie) was really good. I'd give it a 8.5 on the movie scale.",Resident Evil

If you like a good action, suspense movie this is for you!The technical aspects of the movie are spectacular! Cameras, audio and visual effects all added to the overall helping to create the best movie I've seen in a long long while.The selection of acting skill was done quite well, imho. Just take a look at many of the other films some of these people have done - especially Milla; she's been in some very good movies in the recent past, and her abilities didn't shy away from the challenge in this great piece of art!Some of you might think ""Game to movie conversion?!! I don't think so!"" But hold off on that thought process. This movie portrays a general mix of the game ""stuff"" quite effectively. I had my doubts, but they were quickly set aside and discarded upon watching the first few minutes.The ""comic bookyness"" of the movie was a pleasing minimum. I don't like when movies go overboard in trying to do their special effects, but this movie had the perfect mix of computer graphics and such and reality.I stress that if you've heard any bad commentary on this masterpiece (although I can't imagine why anyone would think anything bad about this movie ;) ), please disregard it until you've seen it yourself - you'll be incredibly pleased you did - It's brilliant!",Resident Evil
607,monkey_ross,absolute garbage - You'd expect this kind of tripe with an student film not a studio....,3,11 May 2018,"I really can't find anything good about this film. 
The point of the story and chosen characters is confusing and just weak.
Michelle Rodriguez particularly is just annoying across the board with everything she says, acts and does. Though the whole cast isn't any good either including the AI computer.
The prosthetics and make up are awful and where they were actually good they utilise no animatronics making the dogs especially just look like statues being thrown at the camera, the camera work and transition shots are really jarring, uninspired and weird, the dialogue , script writing and one liners just come across stupid and make it feel like the characters don't even know what they are doing or saying.
Clearly money was put into the set production and some animation for this movie only. Whoever made some of the actual scenes and did the set design were clearly very good. Unfortunately that's all this film is; some good set design, everything else is just nothing coloured in.
The only reason the film is even rated as a 6 out of 10 is purely out of the success of the video game itself. As a stand alone film it is just terrible.
In addition as a pet hate......why does ' the box' have spirit levels????",Resident Evil
608,Parallax-UK,A shockingly good interpretation of the games.,9,19 July 2002,"We all know that there has so far not been a single decent movie based on a game. Of the most recent efforts, Final Fantasy was little more than a kiddie version of Aliens, whilst Tomb Raider was incoherent overly-sanitised nonsense quite obviously made by people who haven't played the games.The makers of Res Evil, on the other hand, are clearly fans of the games. This has allowed them to bring the forboding atmosphere of the the titles to the film. Initially designed to be a prequel to the games, Res Evil begins in the confines of the Hive, an underground research facility belonging to the menacing Umbrella Corporation.Whilst the film starts prior to the first game, the end of the film skips over the body of the first and second games, and finishes at the beginning of the third, paving the way for the sequel, Nemesis.The performances of the main characters are good, with a standout performance from Jovovich, as the Amnesiac operative of Umbrella Corp. As a bonus, in addition to her fine performance, Jovovich also spends much of the film either wet or naked!The effects are absolutely superb for a film without a blockbuster budget. Indeed, the effects for The Licker, the film's main villain, is actually far better and much less artificial in appearance than some of the Godawful CGI in blockbusters such as Star Wars Episode 2, and Spiderman.The pace of the film is also without fault, with the relentless action and tense sneaking around gripping the attention of the viewer, and never letting go. When packaged with the great effects, good performances, and excellent atmosphere, I have no hesitation in recommending Res Evil without qualification.There is one point of note, however. Some people I know who have seen the film but not played the games have enjoyed the film a little less than fans of the game. This is probably due to the back story the games provide. So, I'm giving this film two scores:If you've not played the games - 7/10 - An above average thriller. If you have played the games - 9/10 - See it now!",Resident Evil

Fair is fair, I have to admit that I left the movies with a reasonably good feeling. The first part of the film was catching and it was well on its way to become my all time favourite horror movie. Then it sort of went over the top. In trying to keep the attention of the audience they stretched the zombie action for to long and the climax with the mutated monster was greatly over-done. The last part of the movie and the average acting performances of the main characters will probably keep me from buying the DVD.I would have liked a bit more suspense and imaginative horror.

BUT if that weapon should be capable of sending a zombie trough the air with that force, the shooter (in this case the commando)would also be propelled into the air with the same force.Then there where some other annoyances like the laser beam thing when the beam went completely horizontal but still managed to cut peoples necks in a not-so-straight angleNow, you might think i'm just nit-picking on some random occasions, however this movie is FULL of these kind of things, physical impossibilities and things that simply don't make any sense whatsoever Some other simply makes no senseLike why would an AI want to scare the living *whatever* out of scientists by teasing them around in the elevator, and when one stuck their head out, accelerate, stop, then go up in turbo speed - decapitating the scientist.The movie is also full of irritating stuff like the camera's switching angles a million times per minute and EVERY time they flash intensivelyCharacters are also insanely stupid like: oh gee laser beam coming at me, better stand and stare at it, maybe it'l go away.or:Hmm, there's something in the vent, maybe i should just stare at the vent some and wait for it to go and potentially slaughter the other guys.or characters asking questions 5 year old could figure the out the answer, like:*huge steel door with something huge pounding on the outside* *main character points at door and says ""is it safe to go trough there?""*And ALL of these occasions happens in the first 20 minutes of the movie, and that's just the start of this annoying journey.However, on the good side, the action is amazing and some of the plot devices are really interesting to watch.So, + Good action and some interesting plot devicesstupid characters, nothing makes sense, impossibilities, and plainly irritating flaws",Resident Evil

Can you imagine a movie character on his own wandering around a spooky mansion looking for keys and other various pieces of treasure, it just wouldn't work. What you get however is an all out action movie that starts briefly ""granted"" in the well known RE Mansion then goes underground to the high tech Umbrella Facility.

Doesn't really matter, the story was irrelevant anyway. It's supposed to be a horror-flick, does anybody remember Nightmare, Halloween or Friday, if you can find a story in any of those 'classics' let me know.What this movie was is a lust for the eye. It looked so incredibly slick. The set decorating, the make-up, the costumes, the whole visual department did such an incredible job, that even though, the story had no content what so ever, the movie was so easy on the eye, that I didn't want to turn it off, because of this.A lot of people could learn from this.

Milla Jovovich and the cast do well with what is giving, and the movie itself is a good late night movie to watch but it should have been a balls to the wall horror feast that the games were. Of course like all adaptations of novels and games, it does not resemble its forefather in anyway, and it does not retain the sense of terror that the game had in spades. The zombies don't look scary at all, and the hunter looks a fake as a plastic chew toy.

618,moebeast,Typical Video Game Movie,5,2 January 2007,"Typical movie based on a video game: sparse plot, little to no character development, terrific special effects, lots of blood and gore, and a loud heavy metal soundtrack. Great if the viewer expects nothing more than a video game transferred to film. Disappointing if the viewer expects any use of imagination to expand the video game plot in said transfer. The female leads are physically strong heroines as opposed to whiny, sniveling damsels in distress (definitely a plus). Yet these ""strong female heroines"" demonstrate very little in the intellectual or common sense departments. Of course, neither do the male leads, so I can't complain too profusely. I enjoy zombie films because zombies do make fun movie monsters in an ugly and disgusting sort of way. Unfortunately, I do not consider them to be very scary or threatening except in large numbers. One on one they are a minor threat (don't get bitten or scratched) and are no match for an average human being who could out-think and out-run them with very little difficulty. The whole point of a movie with zombies as the main obstacle is to be gory, disgusting, cannibalistic, and provide a high body count. This particular film succeeds on all those counts!",Resident Evil

The general idea is that this is set in the 21st Century where a big evil company is doing naughty things such as DNA manipulation and virus generation in the name of top secret military research. The virus gets loose, and a computer controlling the secret underground society goes haywire. And that's just about enough setup to send in a special ops response team and give them some flesh eating zombies and other mutating creatures to shoot.

I hate when filmmakers do this to films, it seems so good and entertaining in the beginning and all but then something stupid pops up and ruins most of the movie for ya, for an example this movie. this movie should deserve better ratings then it should because not only did it have a better and more complicated story then most zombie films it lived up to its horrifying story. tip: I have seen the sequel to this movie (apocalypse) and it is one pile of crap, i recommend seeing the first one only and then stopping there because if u liked the first one u don't want to ruin the vibe by seeing that failure of a sequel.

622,jakemsn4,this actually IS an INTELLECTAL movie,10,9 January 2006,"many people say this movie is not deep, not intellectual, whereas movies like The Matrix is. I loved The Matrix but I have to say that Resident Evil is very much intellectual in a different way. How often in life is it that our family members, friends, and relatives, seem like zombies? In a way, this movie says more about humanity and says it more realistically than The Matrix, because in this movie, the enemies are other people, and often in life our enemies are other people, sometimes the ones closest to us. Also, many times in life, a person who is right about something (for example, the guy who thought the earth was round when everyone else around him thought he was an idiot, or the people who wanted to abolish racism when 99% of the people around them were racist) may live in a society in which 90% of the other people attack him for it. This is like the zombies attacking the small group of main characters. The zombies are also very cruel, eating other people, and isn't this similar to how many people are against George Bush, but have absolutely no way of getting through to the people who support Bush how wrong they are? Are the people who support Bush, not like Zombies who have gone mad and cruel and flesh-eating, and who we seem unable to stop? Are people who support Bush not very blind and ""mutated"", as those zombies in the movie were? Is Bush himself not like the last monster in this movie, huge powerful and just plain nasty? This movie is so representative of real life that it's really just awesome. You may say, ""well, tons of other movies with monsters aliens and vampires say the same thing"", but you can say the same for The Matrix. Dozens of movies before The Matrix have criticized humanity in the same way The Matrix has, but The Matrix is special because it does it SO MUCH BETTER than other movies had. Resident Evil does the same in this area. Even though many movies in the past have monsters and vampires, Resident Evil and its series is the first movie (and movie series) which has as its basic premise the fact the thE ENTIRE FREAKIN' TOWN has turned into monsters. And this is how it is in real life in many ways. In previous movies, it was always where the number of monsters was less than or equal to the number of survivors. In this movie, 99% of the people in the setting are monsters. This is different from The Matrix, where 99% of the people are blind, not monsters who attack the the main characters. The rest are robots, and these do attack the main characters, but they are robots not people so this is actually less representative of real life in a way because it implies that negative things in life may stem from objects foreign to us (i.e. the robots), or may stem from ourselves (i.e. Neo in The Matrix is often told by the Oracle how much influence he himself has), but Resident Evil focuses on the fact that sometimes in life the greatest negativity comes from the people around you who seem to not only become blind like the people in The Matrix, but to have become cruel and heartless and soulless.",Resident Evil
623,lordfaunswater,Baah!,1,26 March 2006,"Poor at best. The gritty horror of the games has been swapped for really incompetent soldiers posing for the camera with massive guns. The only cool bit is the ""laser net"" sequence which is both graphic, and hugely entertaining.I mean i've seen more realistic zombies coming home on a Friday night out. They just grope a bit and then stop bothering.The soldiers really are stupid. They, despite the obvious risk, go into the bunker and get brutally butchered, showing no military know how at all.What ruined it for me was the typical characters. For example, you've got the bitchy butch women soldier who is really ugly posing around dark corners for the entire film. You've got the ""good"" soldier who gets murdered in the most painful way. You've got the woman who loses her memory and gets it back, discovering she has got kung-fu skills. It is SO old and predictable. They have been done a million times before.It was not even scary. The moment you see the monsters, you think ""my god - they are so not scary"" There is no suspense, and when scenes to get a bit ""creepy"" (though no way near as creepy as say, aliens), the chance for a scare is ruined by the ""scare"" being a member of the team.The acting is pretty standard. You would expect the soldiers to be absolutely s****** them selves, but they just accept their fate with very little emotion. The special effects are also pretty average- when the licker arrived i thought it was a cat.The film explains nothing about umbrella corparation and why they have made such hideous monsters. Well to be fair, it does a bit at the beginning, but the rest of the film is ALL the same. Posing. With guns.",Resident Evil
624,No.6,Not the worst horror movie...,3,30 August 2002,"...but pretty close. Paul Anderson turns out another pathetic movie, this time however, he decides to taint the zombie genre. This movie is nearly unwatchable on every level. The worst part is probably the script. Many of the lines would seem stupid even in the video game that it is based on. Furthermore the exposition scenes are handled with the subtleness of a high-school student film. Anderson ""borrows"" liberally from much better movies such as the classic Romero ""Dead"" trilogy. If this movie does nothing else, it should prove that Paul Anderson should never be allowed on a movie set ever again.",Resident Evil

I realize that a movie cannot be the same as a video game, so I didn't have that expectation.  The opening of the movie if very intriguing, but once the assault team enters it the movie goes from bad to worse.  The ""evil computer"" subplot is ridiculous, the fact that ""bullets don't seem to stop them"" yet that is exactly how they stop them, and the entire virus plot is contrived.  The ""scary"" parts of the movie where you are supposed to jump are so obvious I didn't even blink. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.",Resident Evil
626,b6421,downright shocked at how not lame it was.,8,14 March 2002,"Traditionally, this time of year is devoted to films that are either bucking for Oscar consideration or too dreary to be released at any other time of the year, basically meaning that any movie one sees before the couple of weeks before Memorial Day is going to be really good or really bad. It seems that, this year, those movies that aren't Academy-Award hopefuls have been, across the board, gawd awful, representing some of the worst films that Hollywood has had to offer in the past 5 years. With those unpleasant experiences in mind, it is with a sense of sheer trepidation and lowered expectations that one goes into a movie like _Resident Evil_, whose trailers make it seem akin to most of the wretched movies that have come out so far this year. Perhaps, it is because nothing exceptional is expected of it that I begrudgingly have to admit that this movie is really not that bad. In fact, I could go so far as to say it was quite watchable. admittedly, there are plot holes, Michelle Rodriguez seems wasted in her role, and the material owes a great debt to George Romero's work, but once one gets past all that, a big dumb popcorn movie is there for the taking. In its favor, the actors give convincing performances, the cgi effects are used sparingly enough so that when one does get large doses of it, they don't look obviously fake like in the Harry Potter movie or _Jumanji_, and the movie overall displays an understanding that while it doesn't have the chops to actually scare you, it also doesn't over-rely on startling moments like so many horror movies will nowadays. Is it worth the full price of admission? Compared to some of the alternatives playing in theaters, I'm afraid so.As a sidenote, who among us knew that, at this point in our lives, with Paul T. Anderson slaving away on an Adam Sandler movie, the other Paul Anderson would make a more satisfying movie without any pretenses?",Resident Evil
627,Nostalgia,Great Zombie Flick!,9,21 March 2002,"I have some mixed reviews about this movie.  I will detail the good points first and then point out a few flaws or holes in the plot that can make or break your opinion.Good Points:Music, action, zombies, blood, shooting, guns, some flesh flashing are all good points.Action, shooting, guns and blood can all be categorized together.  One compliments the other and it was all well put together.Zombies were fantastic, with their heart stopping surprise thriller moments, great makeup and pretty good but not spectacular computer animated effects. They made me think of the old great Night of the Living dead movies, but the actors that portrayed them were better.Music was fantastic, the score was great for this movie and I was well pumped up for all the action scenes.Flesh Flashing.. well being a guy.. let's just leave it at that..
Bad Points:Not many, while the music and score were great, it was a little too loud at a few points.  The acting wasn't spectacular but adequate for a zombie flick.. just think back to Night of the Living Dead and remember how bad the acting was for those movies.Lastly, the major plot hole I noticed.  The movie shows that one of the blue vials were broken in the lab, the lab then sealed and locked.  Allright that's fine, but what I find disturbing, and this is after having worked in a level 5 capable lab environment, is that the virus could become airborne through the ventilation system.  Technically.. impossible.  There are so many filters and security measures in virus labs that it would be completely impossible for that virus to go airborne.  Even if the hive computer wanted it to.  You just can't turn off a filter.If you think about that, then there is no movie, they should have thought of another way to spread the virus, say.. through a plague of rats they were testing on or use the method that was used in 12 Monkeys.Overall: Great movie and a must see for video game fans or not.",Resident Evil

After reading the reviews, I got the notion that it was a great film for lovers of the genre, but lacked something to be desired for sci-fi/zombie movie loathers. Well, doesn't that assumption make sense? Anyway, I'm not going to spoil the movie, just suffice it to say, I was pleasantly surprised thinking it was going to be another mindless piece of celluloid. It turned out to be a movie filled with a dreaded atmosphere, and a continuing sense of foreboding, and actual morals. I think my only complaints about the film were the music (yes many other people had reservations about it), and the fact that I wanted to see more at the end, I wanted to know what happened next. Now that can be either a deterrent, or an advantage. Here it's both because there's no real sense of closure, but you actually care enough about the characters to want to know what happens next (rare for a video game-turned film).

I was really looking forward to a Resident Evil movie rumours had circulated for years about Romero directing and people like Robert Partric playing the key characters. Clearly Andersion wasn't interested in great things like that instead he thought he'd throw ""Aliens"",""2001"",""George A. Romero's Trilogy"" and a bit of ""The Matrix"" in a blender and see what comes out. I can't believe how bad this movie is first their is not one character from the original game in it instead a group of commandos with ridiculous names like One and Rain. 2nd the monsters, where are they? all their is are zombies(Key to the game of coarse) and a licker(Not even from Resident Evil it's from Resident Evil 2!). No sign of the hunters or the tyrant the two famous creatures from the first game. The platoon of commandos is such a rip off of the Marine corps from ""aliens"" right down to the tough soldier girl who doesn't take any crap (Played very annoyingly by Michele Rodreguize who also played the exact same character in the ""fast and the furious"" and ""Swat""). There are very few scenes that don't rip-off another film ""the Matrix"" rip-offs are probably the worst, watching ""Alice"" jump 6 feet in the air and karate kick a zombie dog in slow motion is absolutely ridiculous. What really rubs salt in the wounds is that George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead) wrote a script for this and was going to direct.

It was the worst ""horror"" film I have ever seen in my life. It was not scary, the plot didn't make any sense and when the end came and left open for a sequel I nearly hit the roof. Where was the mansion with deadly traps? Where was the BAD-ASS Albert Wesker? Where has gun-nut Barry Burton? What the hell was the Queen? a spoilt little brat inside a computer, even for a computer I think it needed acting lessons. The only decent actor/character in the whole film was Colin Salmon, even he didn't make it.

At first it seemed to have no references to the first video game, until it shows a mansion. But after that in this film, we didn't really get to see many references, and the nemesis transformation near the end was unexpected and weird.

634,jascry,Mainstream horror...,5,15 March 2002,"Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You have the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the whole package.What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore comes up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for Milla's nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly don't go out of your way to see it.",Resident Evil

Even if there are no characters from the video game in this movie, its spirit can easily be seen.For the monsters, we can say that Paul WS Anderson has made some great choices.  As you could see in the previews on television, the zombies, the cerberus and the horrifying Licker are all back.  It was so cool to see this adaptation of the games on the big screen.  So many things was remembering us some thrilling moments of the first two video games : the zombies crawling on the ground to bite our feet, the amazing mansion, the train,...Milla Jovovich is so cool!  She looks so different from all her other movies!  It's a really good thing because when we see her, we don't start thinking about, like, Joan of Arc or Leeloo.  So on for Michelle Rodriguez. She hasn't played in many movies so this motion picture really creates its own atmosphere.There was only one thing that I really didn't like in this film.  It seemed like if the director lost a little bit of his imagination because there is a scene where the only thing you can think of when watching it is the canadian movie Cube.  I won't tell you more about it because I don't want to give you a spoiler!Anyway, Resident Evil is a must-see movie for everyone, especially for the fans and the horror movie fans, you'll like it!

If someone makes a debut as bad as 'Shopping', then continues to consistently make awful films (okay, 'Event Horizon' was good ish, but the ending was a farce) why does Hollywood keep giving them money? 'Mortal Kombat' anyone? At least 'Soldier' was so horrifically bad that you could laugh at it, and at the $20 million that Kurt walked off with. But 'Resident Evil'? It's not difficult making a Zombie film. Zombies stumble around, Zombies chew people, Zombies get shot. What's the problem? All I ask for is some mindless violence, Milla with a big gun shooting Zombies. Did I get it? No! After she started kicking the dogs, you think, 'oo here we go, action.' But no! Paul W. S.

'Evil Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Braindead', 'Bad Taste' - these are real zombie films. 'Starship Troopers', 'Aliens', 'Buckaroo Banzai' - these are real sci-fi films.

If you have any good taste and think good movies have to have actual plots, actual characters, and some decent dialogue, do not see this movie, because it's horrible.The main actors in this movie have done much better work (Milla: 5th element, Michele: girlfight), and everyone else in the movie was pretty much just there to be killed or take up space. There weren't exactly charcters. I didn't even catch any of their names. There was hardly any dialogue except for the usual ""What is that?!"" or the pathetic comedic one liners from Michele. We learn absolutely nothing about the characters themself, because, once again they weren't characters.OK OK I know that's alot to expect from a video game adaption (is it though?). I mean, going into see this movie I was at least hoping for some decent zombie stuff to happen. But there was nothing! The zombies looked like people picked up off the street, covered in flour and ketchup and told to scream at milla jovovich. Even the computer generated thing that got out from it's cage, whatever it was, was pretty bad looking, not a memorable creature at all.So basically it all adds up to this: Pretty much everything in this movie has been done before AND better:Zombies: ""Dead Alive"", ""Evil Dead""; Butch Pretty Girl Heriones: ""Alien"", ""Terminater 2"";The Laser Sequence: ""Cube""; CGI Monsters: ""The Relic"", ""The Mummy"", ""Lord of the Rings"";Boring Characters (if you could call them that), Dull Plot, Bad Acting, Bad Editing, Bad Visual FX, Bad Dialogue... etc etc etc.HOWEVER I did like the dog sequence.

This movie is a bloody exposition of special effects and super-models with fire axes. If neither appeals to you, stay at home and read Dickens.Beyond this, ""Resident Evil"" relies heavily on tried-and-true formulae for the horror and action genres.  Things jump out.  There are loud noises. Blood gushes.  We have close ups.  We have slow-motion.  The plot twists aren't exactly the end of ""Usual Suspects.""If any of these things bother you, then the volume is too low and it isn't dark enough in the theatre.  Subjecting ""Resident Evil"" to a cynical criticism of its stock elements is like drinking your beer warm and then complaining because it tastes bad.

If I had one criticism for the film is that it wasn't gory enough - for Zombie movies to fill their potential, you have to show them to be at their most frightening, which involves feeding and just generally gory stuff they get up to a la Romero, In Resident Evil you don't really see the zombies feed - they are just there to be shot.Paul Anderson does a more than good attempt at a world-renowned game, but with a bigger budget and a better script, it could of been up there with the likes of ""Night of the Living Dead"".

I am a big fan of the video games, especially the first one, and like many of the gamers, I was shocked by the ""Supercomputer"" story. I would have loved the plot of RE being done in a movie, but well, you can't have it all.Also, the gore just was not enough. It is Rated R, but still not close to the game's great splatter effects. It's freakin Resident Evil!Aside from these two points I loved this movie, and I don't say this very often about a movie. It's fast and loud, a thrill ride from the beginning till the end (pretty much as scary as Event Horizon which I liked) and plenty of gun fights. The story is, while not the same as RE 1 (the game) at about the same level quality wise. The aspect I loved the most was Marilyn Manson's score. I love his music and he did a great job on this movie with a rather industrial, but still loud and freaky approach. The effects are good, I thought the Zombies looked just like they did in the game, and that's what I expected. The action scenes are nicely done, the only things I didn't like were the two ""Matrix-type"" scenes you can see in the trailers (bullet time & wall walk).I was deeply satisfied when I walked out of the cinema into the cold night and I expect you will be too if you liked the game.Oh btw, did I mention Milla is just beautiful?9/10 (closer to the game would have been a ten)",Resident Evil

However, I don't think that fans of the game will be disappointed with what they see. Many of the major ""dead"" characters are in the movie. I generally like the set of (living) characters. However, Michelle Rodriquez is _very_ one-dimensional as the pouty I-got-beat-up-by-my-older-brothers-a-lot-and-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-teach- you-the-meaning-of-the-word-pain soldier. I liked Milla's character a lot, and I think Milla does a great job.The movie is usually very claustrophobic which I think is one reason I really liked it. Anderson makes great use of cluttered closed-in spaces. I don't think the movie is particularly scary, but with how tight the sets are, I think it adds to the anxiety of the situation. There's very few options when something comes down on your head.The biggest flaw I have with the movie is the music. It sucks. I like loud music as much as the next person, but I think it is just too loud and takes away from the movie. It turns into a stupid MTV video. I think the music could have added a lot to the creepiness of the film... very minimalistic stuff... but as soon as any action happens, it turns into a stinking SlipKnot album.

I've played every game (except Gun Survivor) and I probably speak for everyone when I say that the first time you played a Resident Evil game, there were parts that scared the crap out of you (try in surround sound and you'll see what I mean). This movie has the same effect. I don't want to give away the plot (it's pretty obvious), but there were special effects in the movie that were as gory as they were awesome (the elevator, the laser room, the hives 'city simulator'). Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the perfect role of the games 'Attractive heroine who kicks zombie butt'. I can't express how typical this movie is of the RE genre (That expression being a very good thing). The ending follows closely to the opening of the game Resident Evil:2, and anyone who saw the ending and didn't understand it, just watch the opening sequence in the video game to get a really awesome, graphic explanation. 9 out of 10 for being such a good game-to-movie.",Resident Evil
653,uhmyeahhbrooke,"Overall, pretty good.",8,21 July 2007,"Resident Evil was by far one of the best video game adapted movies, especially considering the low budget boundaries. Unlike other zombie horror flicks it doesn't literally ""throw the zombies in your face"", it makes you wait and wonder what will happen. This giving the movie a better element of surprise in the beginning then other zombie flicks. Overall the performances from the actors was good, but at some points could have been better. As a fan of the game, I was very pleased to see how it was presented. Although the ending could have been better, I strongly recommend you seeing this if you are craving action, zombies, and suspense all in one movie.",Resident Evil

I'd be thrilled to speak about it with anybody, though.  All in all, not based on the characters from the game, not much of it takes place within the mansion, but it was still outstanding for the type of move. Milla Jovovich had an excellent performance on top of all of that, plus it is left open for a sequel.  I felt that it had a great ending.  Hope to hear from you all.

High praise for everyone involved, Milla Jovovich is a wonderful and gorgeous actress who portrays Alice (Who I assume to be Jill Valentine from the RE Game) excellently.  This movie is an Instant Hit that needs to be seen again and again!! Although it didn't have the amount of gore I hoped it would, it still had an extraordinary amount of action that kept you on the edge of your seat.

Resident Evil shows us what we have almost come to forget: old school horror with a stylish flair enough to separate it from the 80's horror films it selectively borrows from. I am not going to sit around and complain it wasn't gory enough, although there definately could have been more gore involved. I will say that it is definately a step in the right direction. Hopefully, if this film does well, we can hope to see more bold attempts at anything with the slightest backbone other than crappy 90210 mock slasher films, that do nothing but slowly kill the horror genre while it sleeps. Hopefully on that note, this would be more the awakening of a sleeping giant. Something that was missing in our cineplexes like it was in our minds.. something that didn't have a guaranteed appeal and took chances at reconnecting its audience with the main artery of why people go to see a horror film, albeit one based on a video game.",Resident Evil

But now I have seen all the movies she has been in, and she is a fine actress.

Then, when I finally got a chance to see it, I was a little relieved. While it had nothing to do with the games, it really wasn't that bad. Truthfully, the movie didn't have to be call Resident Evil, they could have used some different names or other forms of viruses to get into humans, without calling them the G or T virus. The characters in this movie are also lacking some spirit. There are a few, I even admit, that were amazing though. Alice (Milla Jovoich), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes). These 3 really made the film really worth watching. I suggest if you like horror flicks, pick this up, it's one of the better ones in the last while. But, if you like zombie flicks I'd suggest first, Dawn of the Dead, and Night of the Living Dead, then watch this after them. well that's all. have a scary day",Resident Evil

And after around one hundred minutes of action (and little more) I went home very dissapointed for several reasons.First of all, I don´t think this is a complete movie. I had the sensation that what I have just seen it was like a chapter of any T.V. serie. This film doesn´t have a complete plot or even a finish, it only puts the things in order for Resident Evil 2, something that in my opinion it´s disgusting.Also, there is an abuse of action scenes that completely dominate the movie. The action scenes are pretty good, but I would hope to see something more of the cerebral element (as it was sometimes in the video game, especially the first version).Finally, even the 'big bad boss' you are supposed to watch at the end of the film it´s pathetic. But of course this is connected with Resident Evil 2, when finally a really monster -Matt Adison converted in Nemesis- will come into the scene (again, this movie is only a chapter or a presentation of things to come).So, I only would recommend this film in case you are the purest fan of the action movies and have never take care of the video game.

I have watched every film I can think of since I moved here two years ago. So much so that when my best friend wanted to see this film I pointed to reviews in the uk press about how bad the film is. I have  completed all the games and he has not so I win, well maybe not. I was sooooo bored that he paid for my ticket. Sat in my seat I was immediately glad that I had not bought any popcorn or drinks as I jumped out of my seat too many times to count. As a person who has spent years laughing at Freddy and Jason this is a great achievement. This film appeals to the people who were angry at tomb raider and recently scooby doo for sucking bad. Mainly because it shines above all of them. For those who have not played the game, You are in a hopeless situation and the only way to win is to kill everything that moves  and guess what? that is what this film does and does very very well. If  you want a script go watch a beautiful mind, If you want zombies, lasers and more fake blood than a B-movie vampire flik then I urge you to see this. One of the best endings to a film  ever!.

Doom has more gore and blood, Halflife has more sense, Red Faction has more story, Wolfenstein is more dynamic. I found myself yawning after ""hell unleashed"". Don't buy it - this is hardly worth rental fee.Such story requires dynamics and at least sympathy for heroes - I felt none. Jumpy episodes and loosely coupled at that are somewhat frustrating - like tasteless food. Suspense is pushed on you (but misses target - it's too thin) - and dissipates before you even start to feel it. Mix of Aliens, Matrix and Living Dead - maybe too many ingredients? Or Robocop with Terminator are missing?The only good thing I can remember - some of the effects. Computer ones. Pity - not enough to make remarkable scenes.

668,GIANT223,My Review,9,20 August 2002,"There have been a few video games that have gone into the movie industry. Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and Resident Evil are three of them. And for me, I thought Paul Anderson did an excellent job taking Resident Evil the game to Resident Evil the movie. Although the story of this movie is different from any video game, that's what makes it great. Every Resident Evil video game has had a different story line to it, and the movie is no exception. I rated this movie a nine because for me it's something that I can watch over and over again. Although the movie does have some parts that can seem unbelievable such as the zombies and the creatures trying to eat you, the story of how the creatures were formed with the virus, makes it almost believable that some corporation somewhere in the world might be doing something such as this. All in all, Resident Evil is a movie that you have to get caught up in to understand, and it will definitely make you jump about every 10 minutes.",Resident Evil

I was disappointed to hear that George Romero had been replaced, with the guy (Paul W.S. Anderson) who brought us such treasures as 'Mortal Kombat', and 'Alien vs. Predator'.Still I was hopeful, despite my better judgment. I was expecting the same brilliant terror I'd come to love in Resident Evil. My hope was crushed as the movie began, flashy special effects, soulless action sequences. It was as if someone had taken the story, and hammered it into a shadow of itself. I expected survival horror, what I got was cheap action with cliché Hollywood shock scenes.This was not the marvel I expected. It lacked atmosphere, and relied heavily upon overly dramatic music suited only to excite a brain dead audience of zombies. A tribute to the works of George Romero, should never have been trusted in the hands of Paul W.S Anderson, butcher of great concepts.Even recalling this experience sends shivers down my spine, but not in the way Paul W.S Anderson and his team of Hollywood butchers intended.",Resident Evil

Milla Jovovich was spectacular.  Sexy and gorgeous in a cocktail dress didn't stop her from kicking zombie butt.  The special effects were very realistic with not a lot of CGI.  The plot is not all transparent like many action movies.  There are a lot of questions the viewer has during the movie, but be patient, all will be answered during the course of the film. The special features and commentary by her, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeremy Bolt,> and Paul Anderson was intriguing and entertaining.  I usually don't listen to the commentary, but the two girls were fabulous together, hilarious, and very impromptu.This movie is definately worth the money to buy.

672,aeroplane,Possibly the worst attempt at the horror genre.,1,4 March 2004,"I honestly believe that Paul Anderson thinks adding heavy metal music to a zombie-littered action sequence will somehow improve the genre of 'horror'. What he fails to see is that Resident Evil in all aspects *should* be regarded as a horror film (with elements of action.) What he has managed to create is some obscene attempt at all-out action (involving horror elements.) What could possibly go wrong with that? Well, in all honesty; horror isn't scary with some teenage metal band pounding your ears whilst a plague of zombies fills the screen, looking very unimpressive. Where's the atmosphere? Play the video game - you get bucket-loads; so why isn't that reflected in the film? I was very disappointed that the film is obviously aimed at the male 15-18 teenage-angst market, although I guess that's to be expected, as it is a videogame. Overall, tedium... unless you're into loud shouty heavy music interrupting a (quite stylistically) shot movie. Just hope he doesn't **** it up with Alien versus Predator... Yet that will be aimed at the same market. Gah! Still, nothing can be as bad as Mortal Kombat...

Its just sad to read what people who liked this film have to say on this site - have these people never watched any decent films in their lives compare this rubbish to?! Do they only watch what Hollywood vomits into their cinemas or on their TVs?! To say that this is a good movie just shows plain ignorance of what it actually takes to make a 'good movie' - these ignorant troglodytes are killing cinema!

The idea of the character 'Alice' was useless, if you played the game you would know their's no character named 'Alice', and there's no need for 'Alice' as their were several characters they could of used from the game. Besides Michelle Rodriguez the acting was below average in fact the only thing worse, was the directing. Paul W.S.Anderson my nominee for worse director.

Andersons attempt to scare and entertain us failed on every level possible.

One of the best scenes is when they are in a glass room and then suddenly lasers go through the room slicing and dicing the people inside, I thought the special effects were wicked especially when you see Colin Salmon's character falling to pieces in the reflection of the door (I was a bit freaked out by that part). Another scene where Alice (Milla Jovovich) is being chased by the dogs and she shoots them and there is a close up of the 9mm Umbrella Corporation bullet falling to the ground and when she runs up the wall and kicks the dog (totally wicked!) The dogs were pretty scary at first because I have a Doberman and she was sitting next to me while I was watching the film! A scene where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is 'out of it' on the train near the end and Alice thinks she is dead, well I started crying which is pretty embarrassing but I thought the 'moment'was quite emotional. I have watched this movie over and over (about 50 times not joking) and I have listened to the commentary which is great and pretty funny too and I bought a huge Resident Evil poster with Michelle's autograph on it!

However, i saw lots of parts in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse that were taken from the games. The film was based on the games but completely original at the same time. This film explains to you how the contamination of zombies started, where as most other zombie films don't explain this. In most, the zombies are just there and nobody knows how.

The only thing I hated about this movie was that they wanted to make boys to see this movie was because a hot looking girl was wearing a red tube top and a mini skirt. That not's what Resident Evil is about. It's about the horror, the action, the monsters, maybe hot looking girls, but not wearing mini skirts when she has no idea what is going on. Millia.

The movie does not drift far from this plot but has some particularly compelling twists.1) As much as the VG is about a dark megacorporation, the movie captures this ethos quite succinctly. The attitude of the corporations agents and officers mirror what you, I or anyone could turn into if we were to more vigilant in our own workplace. It is a dark future and the movie captures the mentality of those salarymen, even the mercenary soldiers, quite well.2) The acting is very purposeful and there is good chemistry. I believe Milla had a role in this because she has a natural flair for adding a unique and useful dimension to a cast as well as projecting her own self as she did in 5th element. The actors quite clearly have looked at the VG and they all do a good job of capturing the feel of the VG and its mysterious, perplexing surroundings.3) I believe it will become a classic like Alien because the movie has so much to tell about how things could go so horribly wrong in humanity's future. This is not just another zombie flick of supernatural resurrection made by John Romero. The movie adds a new epic dimension spawned out of the dark imaginations of the best imaginations in Tokyo. The movie falls into the same genre as Akira or Ghost in a Shell - a retelling of a dark forbidden future where you get to see what you could become like were you to live your whole life there.",Resident Evil
689,josephius,See this movie if you liked the games and books...,10,15 March 2002,"Resident Evil, or more appropriately, Biohazard, is a ground breaking movie based on a video game series.  The production values of Resident Evil are clearly superior to all others in its class.  The movie follows an original storyline with elements of the games interspersed.  The result is an explosive, fast-paced, action film that delivers the best of the games into one feature.  However, if you see this film, you shall see for yourself the following of its video game franchise name and originator, Resident Evil. See it...",Resident Evil
690,psychosyl20,Why did I like it???,7,19 March 2002,"This movie has no beginning, no story and no ending. The dialogs are written for 3 years hold children and the acting is one of the worst I've seen this year. But, obviously, nobody hopes that this movie will win a ""best zombie movie"" at the academy awards, so I'll say that it rocks.  There is no reason, but it's my favorite zombie movie this year ;-)",Resident Evil
691,covert-,Absolutely Aweful.,2,19 March 2002,"This movie had nothing that the video games staked their claim for - suspense, storyline, and depth.  The characters were poorly developed, using only much-cliched memory flashbacks, the plot was very hokey, and the atmosphere was totally wrong.  Also, the cast looked like lookalikes that may have turned down roles in it: the squad leader (L. Fishbourne), the man who had coffee spilled on him (D. Carver or E. Norton), the man put into the Nemesis program (B. Pitt/M. Wahlberg) and so on.  The worst movie made since Firestorm.",Resident Evil
692,kalvelo-2,THE best video game movie ever made! 2nd best Zombie flick!,8,17 March 2002,"The good: -Good fight sequences -Great Score -Faithful to not just the first game but also incorporates elements from RE2 and RE3:Nemesis -I loved Milla she was perfect as the heroine -Good camera work. Had some nice cuts and contrast -Good sense of atmosphere -I liked the computer and the ""Alice in Wonderland"" parallels.The bad: -Mood would have been even better if they had a little less music. Nothing is more suspenseful than silence. -As a previous reviewer said ""they cut away from all the extreme gorey scenes"". This needed to be done for an ""R"" rating but I hope they put it on DVD uncut.The ugly: -The box office asking me for I.D. to see a rated ""R"" movie(I am 26 years old) I missed first 10 minutes from the hold-up caused by this policy to everyone else in line. -All of the reviewers on this site who use the same old tired arguments against this movie: e.g. --it is an ""Aliens"" rip-off! (""Aliens"" didn't invent the war/action movie, and why does no one have trouble with the fact that ""Aliens"" itself totally robbed Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" with NO credit. given! --it is a ""Matrix"" rip-off! (Again, ""Matrix"" only pioneered the ""camera rotation"" effect. The bullet effects were done in ""Blade"" first(pre-Matrix) or even in ""Firestarter"" (pre-Blade). The karate moves(wall kick-off) were done in ""kung fu"" movies for years and also by this director in ""Mortal Kombat"" first. The karate/action by ""leather-clad"" protagonists set to blaring techno music was also done by ""Blade"" before ""Matrix"". So ends this ""Matrix rip-off"" argument. --it is a ""Night of the Living Dead"" rip-off! (Well duh! Find me ANY zombie flick that isn't. Yes, this incorporates the CONCEPT of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or should I say Matheson's ""I am Legend"", but not the same story. This concept has just become an ingredient to any movie dealing with this subject matter, it will never be ""new"".)

693,tooner440,Loved it,9,5 April 2005,"(Checked ""spoiler"" for a brief mention of the plot in paragraph three)First of all, I'm not into video games (gasp!), except for Age of Empires II, which I inhale. So this is the perspective of someone who's never played Resident Evil, the game.I watched this while working at my computer via a cable TV feed being piped into a little window in the top corner of my desktop window (Sci-Fi channel), but about 20 minutes in I quit pretending to work, went full-screen, sat back and watched. I was amazed. Yes there were some unrealistic elements, but I think this is a beautiful movie, really well done. It has a wonderful mix of suspense, creepiness, futuristic cool, and a good story.Milla Jovovich is AWESOME. She played her role perfectly, achieving a perfect mix of brains, bad-ass action hero, sexiness, and sympathetic figure who actually cares about human life and saving everybody in the group that's trying to escape the Hive.I'm writing this comment having just rented and watched Resident Evil 2- which I've been eagerly anticipating for a couple years now, having loved the first one so much. I'll eventually post my comments about the second one on the appropriate board, but briefly, it sucked in comparison. It was enjoyable as an action movie, but everything that was awesome about #1 is missing in #2. #2 is ultimately forgettable, but #1 is a movie I'm going to dig up and watch every so often.",Resident Evil

Thats what you got. An excellent tail of a race against time to save the world. Good performances from Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, help greatly, relatively unknown actors pull off some good performances.Although not a film classic, i think this is the first Great film based on a game to be made.

695,syurga17,Its not all that bad...not that good either,6,26 November 2006,"The fact that i am a big fan of the movie's game series doesn't make me feel any good when i finished watching the film. The Pace of the movie was very slow and actual zombie is not shown until much later in the movie. Though the camera angles in most of the scenes rocks (the close up of umbrella logo on the bullet thing) the whole idea of escaping the hive area in the movie is not very intriguing. It lacks the major theme of exploration of the environment unlike the game, making it rather a short movie.(SPOILER WARNING!!!) Horror? i don't think so. There is some tense and shocking moments appearing in the movie but none of them are adequate enough to push audience off their behinds. The horror factors are very weak in this movie where some of the scenes might kick-bums if only more eerie atmosphere were built and the concept of i'm-all-alone-in-this-zombie-infested-building were more put to use.Instead you will have ""military groupies"" wandering around with the main characters shooting any zombies they can in approaching their escape route from almost beginning to end.

The Zombies, Dog`s  etc. lookes very great and the Movie it self is good too und has many Shock Scenes`s. I am going to look the Movie again.

697,evan_13-1,A lot better than I expected...,8,15 March 2002,"For starters, I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil games.  I heard about this film about 4 years ago, and I was really excited.  Finally...a movie about my favourite video game.  Somewhere along the line while the film was being developed, word was released that the movie would contain all original characters and no video game favourites.  This upset me, and I was sure the movie would bomb.Now, years later when the movie has actually been released, I am proud of this movie.  The new characters were well done, and though the characters themselves weren't really developed or in depth, they still managed to fit in with the story and not make the movie a joke.  While the characters in the film do not equal up to the characters in the game, you barely notice character flaws as you are paying attention to the rest of the movie.The special effects, while obviously not up to par with movies like Star Wars, were convincing enough to enjoy them.  The zombies themselves looked awesome, with enough gore to make them grotesque and the perfect look and sounds to give them the perfect zombie feeling.  I have to admit, I was really creeped out and at the same time excited when a character looks up at a vent, and all you hear is zombies moaning from another room. Spectacular.All in all, this film is action packed, scary, retains some form of comedy, and is worth your time.  I saw a private screening, and I along with others were pleased with the film.  Great work...and it was a lot better than I expected.",Resident Evil

The action is nearly non existant, the sci fi was thin and stretched but the zombies were just ok.  That majority of this movie is movie is cliche after cliche and you almost always know whats going to happen next.  Its pretty obvious who will survive the whole ordeal right from the begining, and who the 'secret bad guy' is amongst the team. There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?  Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).If you're desperate for a zombie movie, I guess its worth a rental, or maybe you're a huge fan of the Resident Evil games, but otherwise I can't even recomend it for rental... much less the price of a movie ticket.",Resident Evil

She seems poised to have a great role in the sequel.Even the ""Red Queen"" that everyone seems to hate isn't that annoying, and she's only in about 15 minutes of the movie.While the film doesn't have the creep/chill/scare factor of the games, over all it is recommened to any fans of action movies.

Obviously like most horror movie this one is about over coming terrible odds, in this case (SPOILER maybe) zombies.  They do not win enough against the zombies for me.  There isn't that extra fun kick that you get when you know the main characters are going to make it and kick ass doing it.  I need that to really get over the stress I feel with all the excellent ""Boo!!""s there are in this movie.  And you need it for some really good dramatic tension, and that's just not there.

711,Sir-Ex,"Bad script, bad screenplay, bad acting.",5,25 March 2002,"Resident Evil was not a good movie.I watched this movie not being a fan of the game, but a huge fan of zombie-killing movies in general.  I was expecting more from Resdient Evil than the other videogame movies.  Although Resident Evil was better than said movies, that's not saying much.  Since it was an 18a movie, I was expecting some gruesome scenes.  Instead, I was presented with some cheesy laser cutting action, which unrealisticaly seemed to go right through the guys, leaving no identifiable burns.  It would have been a lot nicer to see some sizzles and cracks, or maybe to see that dudes intestines fall out as he jumped up.  But unfortunatley, the movie quickly moves away from any images of real gore.  To me, this was pretty bad, considering this was supposed to be a zombie killing movie.The movie also had some confusing parts.  Twice the main character, played by Milla Jovovich (which may have been the only really good part of this movie) was surrounded by zombies and it seems there is no hope, when suddenly she appears climbing up a ladder away from them, or closing a door on them.The zombies themselves were not that great either.  The movie totally abandoned the style that I can even respect in the game.  There were no axes, knives, chainsaws, flamethrowers, or other such weapons of violence. Instead the victims used guns to create small little holes in the zombies that did nothing.  The makeup of the zombies wasn't anything out of the ordinary either.Some people have said that the story matters more in Resident Evil.  Um, but the story isn't that great either.  Just another cliched example of the all powerful evil bioweaponry cooporation.  And if I wanted a story, I'd read a book.Resident Evil is the perfect example of how someone can mix a beautiful woman, zombie killing action, a creepy mood, and a heavy metal soundtrack and somehow manage to corrupt and detract from each element to create a 5/10 star movie at best.",Resident Evil

Plus, the whole Resident Evil franchise is BADLY overrated anyway. So, would you like to know why this movie sucks? It's clearly because that while I was watching this movie, trying to remain sane, I could not help but churn my stomach at a scene involving a laser slicing through ALIENS rip-off soldiers. Come on! Was this a message from the screenwriters saying that they ran out of ideas? Another thing is that I'm not saying that ALIENS rip-off soldiers are a bad thing. They did the same thing in Doom (2005). All I wanted to say is that when you want to kill off a cast, you have to come up with some plausible way of doing it. Plus, what makes me mad is that this movie could have been fun! It could have been cool! Why would someone write something so ridiculous?Nothing new is added, nothing interesting to look at, and nothing to get your spirits up. This is sci-fi at its worst.

713,orgaenic,out-of-this-world sensory with a great story and script.,9,17 March 2002,"the day was young and the sun was shining on this early january day. it was that same day that i visited the official site and noticed the big R in the lower left-hand corner of the teaser poster. just when you thought that movie-makers were a bunch of money-hungry snobs, along comes someone named Paul Anderson III. that big R i saw spelt everything out for me right then and there. this movie would be true to the game instead of widening the target audience to include 12-year old kiddies (who shouldn't being playing the game in the first place). and it was!! Paul has fully redeemed himself from the days of the PG-13 rated Mortal Kombat.Let me get into the movie, and just to let you know early on, i don't reveal spoilers. so you're safe :)people tend to go to movies with the hopes of seeing something that resembles our reality in the closest possible way. you'll hear things like, ""that can't be plausible"" or ""that would never happen."" i loved everything about this movie. the set design was great, the make-up and costumes were great, and even the script.....was great!! i mean, nothing is perfect, and if you go to the movies hoping for a perfect script, then you'll probably disappointed every time.the actors/actresses seemed to be limited. that's ok, there's only so far a budget can run. Milla Jovovich portrays her character, Alice, very well. i mean, how would you feel if you woke up one day and found out you could run up a wall and death-kick a ghoulish canine between the eyes? i mean, it was obvious to her that no one around her was going to be able to help her with her memory, so she didn't waste time talking. so that would have to explain the limited dialogue. i don't know what all this critique is about Michelle Rodriguez's character, Rain. i think she did a fantastic job! she wasn't going to be a member of S.T.A.R.S., and then have to stop every now and then to fix her make-up. she's part of an elite fighting force!! of course she's gonna act all gung-ho! Eric Mabius's character, Matt, was given little time to develop his role, but just remember his part gets much bigger in the sequel (yes, there is definitely going to be a sequel and Paul is coming back to direct it).i don't wanna say much more because i want you to only know as much as the trailer shows you. i can tell you this, though. don't expect all action. this movie has significant horror values. it is also cerebral in the aspect that it makes you ask a lot of questions without having to answer them. for instance, one might ask how you get a 20 million ton laboratory 2000 feet underground? but you can easily relate Umbrella, the owner of the whole thing, to something like the CIA and understand that they pretty much have the ability to do anything they want and within their power to keep something secret.to end this, i would like to include the most important aspect. the reason we all go to the movies: sheer entertainment. this movie has it to the highest degree. it is definitely a movie worth nine bucks to see. do not wait until video, or you will miss out on the great sound and visuals a movie theater has the ability to provide. take my advice.",Resident Evil

715,waltersbbq,"For me, it was worth the wait",10,27 November 2002,"I've been waiting for this movie, ever since I saw it go into Green Light back in 1998. I read in Empire magazine the film was in the works, and who was the lead back then? None other than Sarah Michelle Gellar. Although it wasn't confirmed, I was thrilled to read the basic plot, as my brother got me playing the video games not long before I read the article.The film itself has connections to the game, but you don't need to play them all to understand it. The cast, which actually is made up of a few Brits, become likeable. Those who make it through the first 30 mins anyway. The few who meet their end in the laser hallway don't really have much dialogue, so it's not loss seeing them die. Milla (a good-looking actress, yet to prove she's anything more to me) is clearly totty for the lads. Lets face it, who on Earth wears a slinky dress like that when planning to stay in for the night!? Does she feel the cold?I didn't quite follow the absence of Jill Valentine, and instead the choice of naming the lead Alice... I may have missed something in the games there. I'll admit, I'm no whizz at playing them and staying alive.Back to the film. I found the zombie scenes pretty tense. Although it doesn't take much to get me biting my nails, you do want a few of the cast to live through the film, so the action scenes were both entertaining and scary. the scenes with the zombie dogs were great. Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes aren't on their best form here, but I still liked their characters. Both their deaths come as a surprise. Arguably, Rodriguez's zombie-turn sucks. I wanted her to get through it all, but her death was cool. I wasn't overly keen on Eric Mabius. He's pretty wooden throughout the movie, and I wasn't too bothered if he was killed, or not. Although I am looking forward to the outcome of his bizzare arm incident in the sequel.The licker showdown at the end provides a few tense moments. It's not right to say the thing didn't look real, or convincing, because this is a film about zombies... I have no idea what the licker was all about, or if it is a reference to the games, but it keeps the action going when the crew are rid of zombies. Just as everyone is out fine, the thing appears and sees off one of the crew, while another turns into a zombie. The ending was slightly perky for a moment, so the re-appearance of the monster and two deaths is my kind of ending.The actual ending, with the Manson theme is excellent. From what I know, the ending was something similar to the opening in one of the Resident Evil video games. (I could really do with a trivia site to explain the links, or gaps between the film and the game. I get the feeling I haven't played all the Resident Evil games....)Generally I'm not too sure I'd tell anyone to see this. Some people aren't too keen on, or convinced by the whole zombie theme, or find action scenes annoying and loud, but I enjoyed the entire film. As for the kids who play the games.. (be honest, people younger than 15, or R-rated, I think it is in the States, play the video games) they'd probably love all the action. Like Tomb Raider, they might get bored with all the banter and explanations, but they'd get a kick from it... 9/10 from me.",Resident Evil

Good movie.",Resident Evil
717,PeaceDog-1,Let's review,10,17 March 2002,"This movie is superb for what it supposed to be. Don't let the people who obviously never played the games, haven't seen the movie, or can understand artistic impression fool you. If you've played the game, it makes sense.I have to say that I disagree with a few comments about this being a  movie for kids. It has nudity, extreme violence, language, and really graphic gore. So parents beware. As far as the people bashing the movie because it has a little Night of the Living Dead or Alien ""rips offs""....uh HELLO, that is what the game is all about. The GAME is a rip off of the Living Dead movies. If they didn't include those things, people would have been complaining about that. The movie is very true to the game, and the games popularity revolves around those other movies. It has the birds, the dogs, the dead, the licker, the train, the mansion, the chic, the conspiracy, etc. It may not have them in the same sense as the game, or frequency, as in the case of the dogs, but they are there (note: the birds, when Milla walks outside the mansion). Some other reviewers are saying that they can't believe how long it takes them to figure out the ""head shot"" theory. How many zombies in the game die with one shot? You guys are looking at this from the wrong angle. Did you guys think Saving Pvt Ryan sucked because it had scenes really similar to those old John Wayne movies? Sure they could have made the movie more like the game, making them walk back and forth between 8 rooms solving puzzles, but then how boring would that have been? Enough with the rant...the movie rocks, go see it so they will make a sequel. It has the jolts and jumps of a true horror movie, the pace is upbeat and it never bogs down. I don't believe they made this movie to be an Oscar contender anyway. Look at it for what it is. It is a great escape just like the game.10/10",Resident Evil
718,magneteye,WOW!,8,15 March 2002,"I didn't know what to expect from this. I had played the video game a bit, but went into this not knowing what was going to happen. This movie is a non-stop action/thriller/horror movie that will make you jump out of your seat a lot! I loved it. They did a great job with this film. Not a dull moment! I highly recommend it. It has an amazing plot considering it came from a video game. Can't wait for the sequel. (Warning: This might give some of you nightmares.)",Resident Evil
719,Barry_Allen,Fantastic but...,9,16 March 2002,"I played 3 out of the 4 games out in the US, and I absolutely loved the movie. I went with people who never played the game, or just 1 or 2 of them, and they all felt the same way.  I had a feeling it was going to be a little bit like ""Aliens"" but I didn't mind.  Game fans will notice the nods given to the game here and there.  It was a very enjoyable experience, but I think I'm going to have to see it again. Milla was just too darn distracting.",Resident Evil
720,metalman56,Good but to much like Aliens(SPOILERS),9,16 March 2002,"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect from this movie. When I walked out I knew it was the best film-from-a videogame made yet The acting is good as is the cgi. The story goes as following.
There is an accident at a research center know as the hive. The computer AI (known as the Red Queen) closes the facility because the virus which is dropped(or thrown) cause some serious mutation. So a team of elite soldiers come in to search for any Survivers. Sound familar. Thats because its basicly the same as Aliens except for diffent locations and different monsters.Still this movie is worth seeing. There is plenty of action, gore and (to be even more entertaining) Nudity (Milla in her second after fifth element)
Go see this movie. It is well worth the price and is definitly the best videogame movie",Resident Evil

THE GOOD ----------------The movie has a great opening (minus the video game-like title intro).  The first 15 min. of the movie does a great job of getting you very uncomfortable.  Then the movie becomes pretty much nonstop action till the finish. The director likes to put in scenes that are nerve wracking, but predictable... BUT then turns around and manages to surprise you   There were times when I was thinking to myself, ""Oh man, he's gonna get it... Wait, he's gonna pull through... See, I knew it, lame... This movie sucks... WAIT(jump)!  He didn't make it! Awesome.""Alice(Milla Jovovich), the main character, was surprisingly likable. She did as good a job as she could have for the character, and I actually cared about what happened to her. I dont care too much for the actress's previous work so I was expecting another annoying performance, but, to my surprise, she was great.  She had great reactions, the character was strong without being ""IN YOUR FACE"" and she actually managed to warm my heart a bit. :)Resident Evil is a classic pure zombie movie (love it or hate it), and most people have seen the old cliche's before.  What I think sets Resident Evil apart is that it takes what you think will happen and switch it around to surprise you... That and the zombies aren't slow! ;)The sound was really loud... Sometimes annoyingly loud... However, the soundtrack was very effective in enhancing the mood and I actually got a kick out it.THE BAD -------------WARNING!  This movie is not deep or intelligent in anyway.  It's there simply to get a couple thrills and have some fun.  Its a video game movie and it shows.There were a couple things that dragged this movie down. Rain(Michelle Rodriguez ), a female soldier working for Umbrella, was completely awful.  Her lines (""After this is over, I'm gonna get laid"") and her character's unrealistic reactions make her the most annoying female supporting role ever.  She was what was wrong with Resident Evil.There were a couple parts of the movie where the plot felt a tad clumbsy, it didnt injure the incredibly basic plot too bad.  Mostly they were creative mistakes.  Some of the lines were just terrible. ""Kiss me bitch""Also the CG was pretty bad and way too ""clean"" and ""look at how cool I am"".In the end, I had a lot of good dumb fun and I was actually looking forward for the sequel despite glaring flaws!  Definately better than expected.   RATING :  8/10",Resident Evil
722,liana-13,"Absolutely predictable scares, coupled with special effects",6,17 March 2002,"No spoilers here:Could the plot be anymore predictable? As soon as the sounds start to swell in this movie, you can count down the seconds until they scare you. You will sit around, placing bets in this movie about what will happen next, and how soon before the next zombie monster comes.Not to say the movie was a total washout. It's great for it's setting- a big, dark theater, with surround sound. The scares are well done- I fell for them every time, even though I knew what was going on. Questionable plot has generous amounts of cheese that will leave you going ""Did they REALLY do something that stupid?"" towards the end. I will say the movie is very good at faking you out with false alarms and then springing the expected scare about five false alarms later.The special effects were nicely done as well- anyone feel sorry for the dogs? The movie stays pretty true to the game, and feels like a giant video game thrown onscreen. Which it is, I suppose. Conspiracy plot presented in such a way that it's hard to grasp at the begining, but just smacks of ""We're going to make a sequel"" at the end. A good movie to watch if you're a fan of horror flicks or the game.",Resident Evil
723,Iceboy635,Great Adaption!,9,17 March 2002,"I loved this movie. Now, it did not have much do with game (besides the T-Virus, Umbrella, and music), but the new characters are done very well. I prefered them to Chris, Jill, Leon, and Claire. The action and visuals were fantastic, and its left wide open for a sequel (which, according to Entertainment Weekly, is currently being written) Overall Good: Good Acting. Milla Jonovich was a great cast for Alice, and she delivers again. Check her out in Zoolander(great movie!) and The 5th Element (so-so). Great Action. The zombie raids were very entertaining, and the movie was freaky as heck, not to mention disgusting (But the good kind of disgusting) And the licker was sooooo cool! And you can't forget the story! While it was different from the game's, it was still awesome. Overall Bad: Not enough from the games. There were only tidbits from the 3 games, and it kind of contradicts the game. But oh well. And then the ending... You either love it or hate it. I personally loved it (Its has to do with Resident Evil 2!!) But it leaves you with a million questions. But don't the critics sway you; if you've ever played the games: DO NOT MISS THIS!!!",Resident Evil
724,IceJester66,Fantastic,9,18 March 2002,"Finally, a superb movie, based on a great video game, that non gamers can and will enjoy. This movie had a great story,  fabulous actors/actresses and a very well picked soundtrack. Suspense level was an 9 out of 10, no long drawn out scenes so that even people with short attention spans could enjoy. Acting and screenplay asside, Rodriguez was very sexy and Jovovich was a close second when she decided to flash us her topside early off then below deck as a welcomed suprise. Overall i think everything was top notch, I gave this move a 9/10. It had everything I could ask for in an action movie and I can't wait for the second chapter of this awesome movie. Nemesis is one bad MF, i'm looking foreward to seeing him. So if you havn't seen this movie, don't ruin it by downloading it off of Kaza or Morpheus...spend $5 and treat yourself.See you the second time through, IceJester",Resident Evil
725,hiryudx,Does the game franchise justice...,9,25 March 2002,"An all new story beginning before RE1 and ending around the beginning to middle of RE2.  Definitely captures the feel and tension of the game.  The eerie (and fitting) horror soundtrack by Marilyn Manson heightens the tension.  Lots of good moments that make the viewer jump in their seat. You also get to see A LOT of Milla in this.  Lots of tips of the hat to players of the game, you will notice quick shots of similar rooms and cameos of characters from the game.  This film, while light on plot, does make use of it's R rating.  Definitely the best video game to movie conversion ever and the best horror film in several years.  Recommended.",Resident Evil

727,benfranklin,Brilliantly Evil!,8,3 April 2002,"If we look back to previous video game to film conversions, then you know straight away not to set your sights too high. Even the greatest game can be turned into the worst film with ease.But this isn't the case with Resident Evil. Paul W Anderson has done an excellent job of taking everything that made the games outstanding, and bringing them to life before our eyes.Rather than trying to follow any of the Resident Evil titles, it begins with the initial biohazard alert, where the humans begin to mutate into flesh eating zombies(!). This sets up the scene for great set pieces, like for example when the military, deep in the factory core, are making their way through a tunnel with darting lazers halting their progress.Of course the film is silly, with tongue firmly set in cheek, but at only one real point does it go over the top, with Milla Jovovich's, Matrix style, kung fu kick in the face of a zombie dog hot on her heels.People have said that it leaves itself at a point for the sequel, but in my opinion the film does not set itself up at all, merely just as a starting point for where the games start.Obviously if you don't like horror-type films, this probably won't be for you, but I enjoyed it, and found it much better than expected. Just remember not to take this stuff seriously, eh kids?A generous:- 8/10",Resident Evil
728,maggie_mason,Rocked,9,5 April 2002,This movie rocked hard. I really hope that there is a sequel to it.

729,DaFurnace75@aol.com,A really good horror/action movie,8,6 September 2002,"If there was ever a video game that deserved the big screen treatment, it is Resident Evil.  I have always been a fan of the game, so I had eagerly anticipated this film.  I really like this movie, even though it does stray away from the game's story line a little.One of my favorite things about this movie is that it doesn't follow the rules set by normal horror films.  In most movies you can normally figure out who is going to die.  This movie is shocking in how fast it kills off main characters.  I will not go into details for those who have not seen the film yet, but I could not believe that a few of those characters fought through such adversity, only to be killed off a few minutes later.  It really keeps you on your toes.The movie flows at a substantial pace, and never really gets boring.  I hate movies that rush out the gate, and then crawl to the finish line. The special effects are great, and I love the casting.  Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are fantastic.  I will admit that I wish you could see more of Jovovich naked.  If only those stinking paper towels would fall at the end!Bottom line:  If you liked the game, you will like the film.  If you have never played the game,you probably will still like the film.  It is just really good.",Resident Evil
730,balitout,The dead walk the earth again!,7,13 April 2002,"First of all: this is no George A. Romero film. That means, do not expect overly digging in people's intestines. Also, don't look for political metaphores or an indictment of bio-genetic sciences. It's just a classic PC-Game transferred onto the big screens. And for that, ""Resident Evil"" is one hell of a movie!So, what could you expect when Paul W.S. Anderson went on filming this picture? Here's a director who is not really known for his cineastic masterpieces. Also, the script strictly hangs on to ""Alien""-regulations. But for once, Mr. Anderson manages to prevail. The plot screams for action, not for significance or character development. From the first moment, the movie is just pure adrenalin.Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are known as talented and attractive actresses. They don't have to prove anything, so they don't start doing Shakespeare where no overly acting is required. You just feel, that they had much fun during the shooting, and they operate excellent, with Rodriguez as the Vasquez-like exterminatrice and Jovovich as Alice, left in a nightmarish wonderland. Besides, they both are refreshingly sexy!When I saw the movie in my favourite cinema in Berlin, it had the whole audience at the edge of their seats from the first scene. I'm pleased that all the scary scenes work without too much brain ripping and blood spilling. It's a straight and entertaining horror-movie, with a music score that is just a bit too extreme. But I strictly recommend it too anyone who waited all these years to finally see a good zombie-movie again.",Resident Evil

Man, was I surprised when I saw this one. Not only does it make you jump twenty times during the film and makes you have nightmares for a month afterward, it is also a great movie that is getting decent reviews.  I really like Milla Jovovich in the lead role, she's absolutely gorgeous and she plays the ass-kicking superhero very well. The other characters are good too, but I think some get killed off too soon.  Otherwise, this movie is a real suspense film that will make you jump and has an awesome ending too.  Lets hope there's a sequel.",Resident Evil
733,Karnage,Survive The Horror!,10,9 August 2002,"First of all...I cant wait for the sequel, which is due ot be released next year! I watch the film last night before I went to bed and I must admit: I think the film IS fantastic! I loved it. The film kept to the atmosphere and world of Resident Evil completely well - especially the ending of a film showing the dead city. The sets were great and kept the look of the game. It shows a good story based before the first Resident Evil, which doesnt even show how the Umbrella mansion had a biohazard. The action was non-stop and great throughout the film, I think the Licker 'Hunter' was great and pretty vicously cool! One bad mother f***er in my opinion HeHe! It was VERY good entertainment as it is NOT very easy turning games into movies these days. The only last one was Mortal Kombat, not Annihilation; also directed by Paul Anderson so I think he made a good achievement. My only complaint is that I wished Michelle Rodriguez's character survived! I hope that Paul does just as well with RE2: Nemesis. I rate this 9 outta 10! Don't expect it to be Oscar or this Millennium's great film, its a Blockbuster for the summer and great entertainment; no cheesy Milla Jovovich 'taking on the entire zombie nation on her own' crap. The film was great as its not often you see a great zombie flick. I wonder who will be playing Jill Valentine? And I hope that Milla stays on to play Alice.There is one spoiler though...mainly about the game. In both the game and film, it states: when bitten by a zombie, you are infected. Yet in the game you never turn into a zombie or have time to find an anti-dote for the virus. It would make the game harder but more interesting and true to the zombie transformation. Anyway give the film a go whether or not you have played the games. Its a memorable action film!",Resident Evil

But still, I believe that those who have played the games and know teh backstory would truly enjoy this movie as it captures the feel of the games PERFECTLY but without retreading parts of teh video game story.  The story isn't half bad, basically a virus is released inside a bioengineering corporation and teh buildings computer kills everyone inside to stop the contamination. A miltary team from the corporation is sent in to disable the computer and find out what happened to everyone.  Along the way we find out that the virus also turns its hosts into zombies.

The idea of having a Resident Evil movie was really exciting to me as a lover of Resident Evil 2's action and horror elements.  The movie adapted these elements fairly well with movie style and the video game's idea.  However, there was something about it that left you wanting maybe a little MORE of the video game's magic.  Maybe more blood.  Maybe more surprises.  I personally think the 2nd one will be much better.  That is if it picks up where the first left off.  Because I loved walking through that alley and being freaked out by the things that would pop up.  Most of them were zombies but some of them were dogs and assorted evils.  But anyway, you get the idea.  It was Resident Evil alright, but like Diet Resident Evil. Or Resident Evil Light.  It wasn't as filling as the game, plain and simply.",Resident Evil

The whole thing seems to be a pure money-making try. No real effort in it to make it a real MOVIE. Each and every second of it is stolen from somewhere, which can tell much about the attitude of the makers for the expert. Well, I have seen very good re-makes, so this does not mean anything. This could have been a good piece after all. But there should have been any concept in it, and not only cliches. I guess the audience of this film is the players of the game. Those who are very sensitive of logical errors. Well, I lost counting somewhere around one hundred :) OK. It could have been a good movie even with these errors, if the makers had anything to do with suspense. Not only up and down, up and down, monotonously. Fingers appearing on the screen is NOT a terrifying moment. If they make one of it, they destroy the suspense in the film. And that is what they actually did, throughout the whole film. Should it be just a little bit worse, I would have left the theatre at halftime. Yes, there are some good points as well. But miss Jovovich's beautiful body wrapped in a tiny piece of cloth or some good songs can not save the film. This is a failure.Please forgive me for my poor English.

At the time that I saw the movie however I was a bit upset with the RE series I had just beaten Code Veronica X and was disappointed by the fact that is was just a 128-bit RE nothing really new and wasn't scary at all.  But that aside I had seen the add for it and thought it might be mindless fun. I knew Paul Anderson was directing it and I had seen Event Horizon prior to this movie.  I thought Event Horizon was decent and quite scary so with that and the fact that RE is a video game movie i wasn't expecting to much. Well wasn't I surprised because this is the best movie of 2002 yet and probably the most well made horror film since The Thing.  The acting is well on and any bad actors seem to be killed in the beginning.  SPOILER Like the two guys in the laser hall who has his fingers cut off and then the guy who is cut in half END SPOILER. Milla does a fine job granted she isn't given as big a roll as say Joan of Arc this time but she definitely does a better job here then in that movie. Not since ALIEN have I seen a film with so much atmosphere which is definitely helped by the score by Marilyn Manson.Clearly Paul Anderson was the right way to go, had Romero done this it would have been a movie that went into the true evils of the Umbrella Corp.  Also Anderson seems to know more about RE then even someone like me even the train that they ride on is identical to the one in 2 (it says ALEXI 3000 or something in the front of the train). The only real problem is some clear cut exposition in the intro and a bit in the beginning but as the s?*! starts to hit the fan there is no more explaining.I can't recommed a better modern horror movie the production values are amazing.  Granted maybe my understanding of the game helps me like this movie so much which by the way is very faithful to the game even if there are different characters.  Great Movie.",Resident Evil
741,no_persona_here,Brainless violence and not much else...,4,5 June 2008,"I am a huge fan of video games. I love the medium just as much as I love movies, but when a couple of people up at Hollywood decided to merge the mediums together, 9 times out of 10 the merge turns out to be a waste of time and money. Your money, that is. This movie is nothing more than a cheap cash-in on a great series of games. It is a huge disappointment on a vast array of levels.The only area this movie prevails in is it's action, but even that area is in really rough shape. The action is violent, gory, and devoid of all intelligence. The action ranges from some neat zombie vs. human confrontations, such as being the human's being trapped in a sewer and zombies are approaching from all possible sides, but at other times there are some real stupid sequence taking place (Kung-Fu lady vs. Zombie Dogs!) that are really embarrassing. Plus, the action gets really stupid when the CG starts to kick in, given that the CG looks dated compared to today's modern video games. No joke.All other areas in the film really suck. The story is bogus, disjointed, and incoherent. The acting is bad (probably intentional, given the voice acting in the games is bad as well), and the production values are not as high as they should have been. To top it all off, you get Paul W. S. Anderson, a man who has brought more shame to the movie industry than Nixon brought to politics. His stupid one-liners, dumb cinematography, bad editing, and pitiful script should be the prime examples in this country's film schools on how NOT to make a movie.To be honest, I had a little fun with this dumb movie. With all the absurdities and such, I just decided to make a joke out of the movie and not take anything serious at all. I think I wound up liking the film because of that.All in all, Resident Evil is a corporate cash-in on the name that really dose not deserve such a bad adaptation.

Weak cast. No characters of the original idea appear in the film. Instead you get a steady stream of poorly performed cheesy lines and an absurd story line with bits and pieces stolen from the original Resident evil concept. Video games do not survive the video game to cinema transition. This is a painful reminder.I walked out on the scene in which Milla Jonavich did a matrix style ninja kick to defend herself against one of the cerberus's(zombie dogs). They did a good job on those(Props to their prop/make up crew) but used them in a way that just made them look stupid and a shameless rip off from the matrix that doesn't fit into the the original RE story line.Paul Anderson completely butchered the concept of Survival Horror and replaces it with loud death metal and machine guns.

Hence it killed everyone down there instead of those usual movie which will at least left one survivor.This movie was very exciting. It gives us a feeling of horror too.

The film is very intense and builds up suspense perfectly, even when they first entered the Hive i expected a horde of zombies to attack them, it was great.The great acting helps to make the film have more meaning, especially Milla Jovovich (Alice) who turns into a bad-ass heroine.

Don't listen to the haters of this movie, they're just mad because this isn't a carbon copy of their beloved video game. Paul Anderson makes a wise choice here in branching off from the games, because while the Resident Evil series works as a video game, it would suck as a movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and Michelle Rodriguez do an excellent job, and the zombies are extremely well choreographed.

Anderson, intends some sort of irony, when he serves up this mindless, soulless corpse of a film.  But really, I don't think he's that complex. Drivel of this kind puts even bombs such as 'Tomb Raider' in a good light.The premise involves something along the lines of: ""corporation happily conducting research into viruses, when it all goes terribly wrong, and there's some zombies and some screaming and .. er, some zombies."" The plot then takes this premise and promptly sits down. I mean it.  It goes absolutely nowhere.  It's as if the director just wants to string together meaningless, unrelated scenarios from generic computer games.  Characters are suddenly alone, without explanation.  Between scenes, the lead alternates from scared bystander to superhuman commando.  If by this point, you're thinking ""The only thing that kept this reviewer watching this film to the end was so that he can moan about it afterwards"", you'd be utterly correct.Milla Jovovich provides the gratuitous nudity that the director obviously feels belongs in a film like this.  He gets it out of the way at the start of the film, almost as if he's catering for all the viewers who will walk out during the film.  It may seem unfair to dismiss Jovovich like this, but it isn't as if she does any acting in this film.  To be fair, she has absolutely no material to work with, and the director's idea of character development seems to be the progression from ""wearing a jacket"" to ""not wearing a jacket"".Michelle Rodriguez garnered critical acclaim for her work in 'Girlfight', but sleepwalks through her role here.  The forgettable male cast repeat tired lines like clockwork; including the immortal ""We're not getting out of here. We're all going to die."" The great Hollywood idea behind making movies based on computer games seems to be 'Neither acting nor development is important, just do some action scenes, and the unwashed masses will be happy.'  Here, even the action scenes disappoint.  Kicks and punches are unconvincing, the gunfights mind-numbingly boring.The tension and gore that are supposed to sell a film in this genre are at least attempted.  The basic problem with tension is that we feel no empathy for the characters, and don't particularly care if they live or die.  The problem with the gore is, like everything else in the film, it is presented in an entirely meaningless way.  The film doesn't even set up the basic threat properly; if the zombies are so hungry, why don't they feed on each other? That is the only plothole that I will mention, because if you are ever unfortunate enough to be made to watch this film, perhaps playing 'spot-the-plotholes' might provide you with your entertainment for the evening.Oh, and at the climax, the director unleashes some of the worst 'special' effects I have ever seen in my life.  I nearly cried out in horror at how poorly done it was.  Oh, perhaps the director is employing his special 'irony' again. Silly me.2.0 / 10",Resident Evil
751,hskrwiz,One of my favorites!,9,7 September 2004,"""Resident Evil"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. It ranks up there with the ""Matrix"" trilogy, the ""Bourne"" series (""Bourne Identity"" and ""Bourne Supremacy""), and ""Kill Bill"" volumes 1 and 2. As soon as I got out of the theater after seeing it for the first time, I knew I was going to buy it as soon as it hit DVD.It is definitely a very ""cool"" movie. I liked how the plot developed. It didn't just go in shootin' up everything. It had a story to tell, and told it well. The characters are cool. The music is great! It is well placed within the movie and adds to the atmosphere of the film. I really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. There is an uneasy and spooky feel. There are some classic moments that help make it a unique zombie movie. Plus, the explanation of why there are zombies is better than any other one from the other zombie movies.The ""brief sexuality/nudity"" is not graphic or tasteless. It actually helps with the story. Plus, it is very ""brief."" The gore is not excessive.It is a pretty spooky movie the first time you see it. It remains ""cool"" every time you watch it.Since ""Resident Evil"" is so ""cool"", I am extremely excited about its sequel, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse.""",Resident Evil
752,Kamillo,I really like it,10,10 November 2004,"Oh the truth is that I could watch this movie, and watch it for hours. In my opinion it is the best movie adaptation of a video game that has been made so far. I like all of Paul Anderson's movies (Event Horizon was great!) but Resident Evil is his best one. The scene with cutting lasers was so amazing that I had to go to the cinema twice to see it. Acting was great as well. I liked Michelle Rodriguez as Rain most. The sequel however, was not so good. It wasn't bad but lost the climate of the first part. For me it was not a horror but rather a silly action movie. I hope that Paul Anderson will direct the third part.",Resident Evil
753,Vakarai,Everyone in this movie that really deserves to live dies.,10,25 December 2004,"Why did that ""one"" guy die.The leader of the commandos was so awesome. He would have been so awesome if he had lived. I do think that Rain died in a very cool sort of way. I like the whole idea of Rain's death. I don't like one's death because it was too early and it was not well deserved. The poor guy certainly did not deserve to be cut into mincemeat. I think J.D. probably deserved just what he got because he was kind of a jerk. The lesser commandos like the medic and the other two guys that were killed by the red queen were not on enough to pass judgement on. Kaplan deserved to live. At least his death was quick and painless, unlike Rain, who suffered much. The second movie would have been so awesome with Rain, Kaplan and One. The red queen might have deserved to get fried but she was kind of cool.",Resident Evil
754,tigervispa,Awful and boring.,1,5 February 2006,"A really boring and dull movie. Cheap and unconvincing special effects. Lame actors. No plot. An awful soundtrack. Simply put, this is a very boring movie. There is nothing to say about the plot, because there is none. Almost no gore, and no suspense either. Doesn't deserve to be called a zombie flick. It almost feels like Uwe Boll directed this crap. It was almost as boring and lame as Alone in the dark. The first ten minutes the movie feels a bit interesting, but it goes downhill after that. There are no characters to care about. Nothing. At the end of the movie I totally lost interest and nearly didn't make it through the ending.",Resident Evil
755,ninjedi,"A fair action-film, but a poor shadow of the game...",4,30 January 2005,"Relatively fun to watch, Resident Evil, is a decent enough action film. Hard to take seriously and lacking in atmosphere, suspense and any real depth is does not, however, do the games justice. The games are cinematic in quality and create an atmosphere and potential for adaptation into a truly great film. Why the venture was given to Anderson i will never know, adept at action, he appears to lack the depth of creativity and understanding that is needed to develop a truly good film. Resident Evil had the potential to be one of the scariest films ever made and instead it has been violated and torn apart until all that has been left of the masterful composition of the game is a few lousy references and a distant memory of an engaging story. It is as if someone has played the games, seen the cinematic potential, then thrown all that out the window, focusing on creating a self-involved 'cool' film that tries to hard, yet fails more often than succeeds. The replacement of the atmospheric music with the noise-like 'angst ridden metal' is laughable and becoming a touch clichéd. Whilst it has its moments, Resident Evil, does not live up to its name and frankly should have be made by someone with more respect for the games, their creators, their fans and film-making in general.",Resident Evil
756,ellis-31,Superb Fun,9,11 February 2005,"Although I've played, and enjoyed, one of the games (RE2), I didn't really fancy this movie, certainly didn't make the effort to see it at the cinema, but a friend offered the DVD to lend...This is a superb bit of fun; I'm not sure what was in the first game, but the memory loss idea is great: you don't know who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are until about half way through, and the fact that they don't know either adds real suspense.Certain scenes reveal their game origins; there's a scene with some zombie dogs that is both chillingly atmospheric (like RE2 was), and exciting, as the situation keeps getting worse every time you think it's over! The pace never really lags, and yet it's not overwhelming.I can't really fault the acting, given that this is an action movie with not much scope for performance; no-one is wooden, and everyone seems to be fully 'into' their role.The special effects are convincing, the zombies look great, and the CGI effects still stand up, given that this is now a 3-year old film. And, of course, Milla looks great, especially when she's kicking zombie head! In summary, if you like zombie movies, like good-looking female action heroes, and want some not-too-mindless escapism with a few little twists to keep it interesting, you'll love this movie.",Resident Evil
757,ShadyEpics2004,Loved It,10,14 February 2005,"I have to say i really enjoyed Resident Evil, Milla Jovovich was excellent in this and the whole movie captured what Resident Evil is about. I loved the Zombie Dogs in this it looked really cool and i have probably seen this movie like 30+ times already.I liked the Red Queen as well i mean the use of that was awesome with Alice fighting off the UN-dead as well as dealing with a computed hell bent on making sure they do not make it out alive.I remember catching this for the first time with my girlfriend and she enjoyed this to. To me there was nothing missing from the movie what so ever except i feel that it could have been made a little longer.I would encourage anyone to go ahead and take a look at this movie and check it out for themselves.",Resident Evil

I can understand that you who didn't play the games on playstation and didn't know what to expect, hate the films... For those of us who DID play and still play the games, they are nothing but fantastic.. For those of you who criticize Resident Evil, you really cant be into horror flicks. If you aren't, don't see these kinds of movies! Resident Evil has everything for people who love horror.. A story, nice cast and a lot of suspense!

759,PaulMcGlin,They think we're idiots!,1,1 December 2005,"I think the reason this film went so wrong is that most people neither understand nor respect games. They assume that they're all about shootin' commi's or appealing to a persons blood-lust. But that's not why I play video-games, I play them because of the participatory plot-lines.When I was watching the special features for the Resident Evil2 DVD they all had that gung-ho ""we're gonna whoop some zombie butt"". ""This is the ultimate fight against the power"". ""I love Jill's impatience"". Bull sh*t! Jill is not a super-heroine! She's a coward! The first time she sees a zombie she runs out to Barry shouting ""It's a monster! It's a monster! Shoot it!"" It's not that I think women can't be heroes it's just that ... Jill isn't. She's on that team for her investigatory skills, not her battle readiness.Both movies were complete failures. If anyone on the project is reading this remember; We aren't idiots.",Resident Evil

Especially if they had such an actor as Martin Crewes, i mean he's better than most Hollywood actors! The zombies were better than most movies and from a actors point of view it was a quite artistically directed. anyways, that's my opinion. still, this movie did the game justice.

761,spike_spiegel40,Disappointing for fans of the RE video games.,5,27 May 2005,"I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil video games, and the movie disappointed me. When I first heard about it I thought it would revolve more around the video games. The only thing that the movie had to do with the games were the T-Virus and Umbrella. I only liked a few of the scenes that were in the movie, mainly the one when the Umbrella Special Forces were on their way to reboot the Red Queen and they entered this room where lasers killed them all in a matter of seconds. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I'd recommend renting it before you buy it. If you're also a fan of the games then this movie will most likely let you down, so don't get your hopes up.",Resident Evil
762,lebbercherrie,rather good film,7,7 June 2005,"I'm a big fan of horror, and I thought I would hate this film, as most adaptations from games tend to be b*llocks, but I found it very good. The story itself is quite meager, but hey, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't written by Tolstoj either. Action is good to very good, and tension is well kept throughout the film.I'm not easily impressed by overwrought fighting or action scenes (e.g. The Matrix) but the scene in the hallway with the lasers is great.Being fond of Romero's work, it was fun to see the zombies back in action. Especially the zombie-dogs (mutant, zombie, infected, whatever).Don't expect grand insights, moving scenes on the subject of the human mind, or being moved to tears. This one is a roller-coaster, baby, nothing more, nothing less.Hang on and enjoy the ride.",Resident Evil

About the only relationship this movie has to the games/books is the zombies. I think I would've appreciated it more if they put in even one character with a relation to the games/books.The effects were interesting but used in a totally unappreciative attitude and the moves that the 'ultimate warrior' makes are noticeably computer animated; I would've liked some back story on the reason why she was so 'warrior' like besides the fact she just woke up. I found the attire on the main character was quite moronic as well. Between the red dress and the white clothes, I'd have chose the white clothes - maybe they should stuff her bra next time.The next installment, I have yet to see, but I might just wait until its down on the lower priced rack before picking it up. This movie has effected my influence on Resident Evil movies greatly.",Resident Evil
765,im238904,Didn't do the Video Game Justice,7,1 June 2006,"Thats all I have to say. The game plot was much better when cut into parts instead of mashing all games into one incomplete movie. If they took their time they could have made it a successful trilogy.Since there is a 10 line minimum, I'll have to go into a little more detail even though it pains me to think about the atrocities. I will start that I and many of my friends love the Resident Evil video games with a deep passion. If that video game were a woman, I would make sweet love to her. If. That may sound extreme to some, but if you can get past the lame Decalogue with no emotion of the original you will be in good shape. The game goes into much more detail than you would think so that you learn a little more each game and the conspiracy unravels slowly. But in this movie it basically goes 1) underground lab 2) outbreak 3)survival 4) open ended ending. Very vague, very very vague. If the original plot was kept intact ( isolated incidents of outbreaks being tracked to the mansion then a STARS team going in with one member being a part of the Umbrella corporation then fighting their way out and destroying the mansion leaving Raccoon city in chaos, setting up the sequel) But instead, they mash up all the plots from 1-3 and mess everything up trying to get the whole story told.

768,TheWraith77,Nice Video Game to Movie Translation,8,7 August 2002,"Having seen just about all video game to movie translations, I was hesitant on seeing this movie.  It's apparently not that hard for Hollywood to mess up making movies based on video games (i.e Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, etc...).  But I must say I was greatly pleased with the outcome.  Resident Evil is loosely based on the first game of the popular franchise of games.  It sort of takes place between part one and two.  The acting is not Oscar worthy by any means, but it is not supposed to be.  What Resident Evil comes down to is that it is a great horror movie with plenty of gore (gotta LOVE that scene with the room full of lasers!!!), scary moments and even a little nudity thrown in for good measure.  The soundtrack kicks major butt as well.  Paul Anderson did a great job (he also directed Mortal Kombat, one of the few actual good video game movies) and I hope he does as well with the sequel due next Summer. If you're a fan of the games or just a good horror flick, give this a shot.Overall:  8.2 out of 10",Resident Evil

The acting was ... adequate... the plot was a stretch, but, since I'm a fan of films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"", I guess this plot was acceptable... :)
The special effects were average (for the films of today). As with many action films, the special effects did have their ""matrix moments"" but all in all, it was a ""fun"" film.The one thing that I did enjoy about the film... (from a staunch male chauvinistic position) was 2 hours of watching Milla Jovovich. She may not be the world's greatest actress, or have the world's best body, but DAMN, she has a beauty about her. As the stories of ancient Troy said...

Both feature masses of monsters (zombies in RE, possessed settlers in GoM), lack of story, practically same type of film end and a female protagonist (Milla Jovovich in RE, Natasha Henstridge in GoM). Even that armored train from GoM shows up in RE again.Differences are that GoM does not take itself as seriously as RE does. There's just *a bit* more story in RE. I think RE's setting also looks a bit better.Dislikes: Computer game-like transitions in RE (""Party is on level x, entering red queen chamber"").

This is nothing like the game and the dialogue is crap sure there is some good special effects but the zombies suck. Theay could have made this movie sooo much better if theay had made exatly like the first game it would be perfact because the story line in that is 10 times better.

777,maulrat-3,"This Movie is just Evil, Not in a Good way!!",3,15 March 2002,"The makers of the games should be weeping on the keyboards right now, because one of the best video games in history has been turned into another cursed video game film (see also Double Dragon, and Mario Brothers).  Paul Anderson has taken a perfect shot at making a great film and ruined it with poor makeup and even poorer plot.  Number 1, i feel bad for George Romero (originaly slated for this film) for being dropped from this project, because he would have done a great job, because in the end Resident Evil is at its core a game about ZOMBIES, not super-computers.  Who knows zombies better than him???  Well after seeing this movie this wednesday at a sneek preview I can firmly say not Paul Anderson.Ideas from the game were kept, but they were re-worked into something perverted from the game, its as if the movie isnt about the game, but more about making people jump and trying to get a hip teen crowd.  Of which it is missing a key element to that thing which it trys to be...gore.  There is hardly any blood at all in a movie in which zombies are supposed to be eating the people.  Black Hawk Down had 4 times the gore this ""horror"" film did.  Even the game involves much more blood.  Dont get me wrong there is plenty of violence, and lots of 'splosions and guns, but there is no saving grace.  The most disappointing thing is the makeup and effects in the film. The zombies look just like normal people with a bad limp, barely any had any facial or body appliances to create effect of decay.  Some of the computer effects were laughable, and the main creature reminded me of the computer alien from Alien 3 in 1993 (not a good thing)! The acting is about as bad as the first game so thats the only thing close to staying true to the game.  Michelle Rodriguez contunies to be type cast as the snarling, tough female which she seems to excell with.  Even Milla Jovovich wastes her time trying to attempt to act through this one.  The rest of the cast is just kind of there, lucky them. In conclusion, ha i know ive rambled enough, if you are looking for a true survival horror film then rent something like John Carpenter's The Thing, but if you want to be throw into a world were the only survival horror youll have is to try and not walk out of the theater go see Resident Evil.  My only question is why did the drop George Romero...so sad, lets tell the man who made the films the games are based off of he cant direct the movie based on the games...good job Hollywood, Good Job.",Resident Evil

Warning - SPOILERS AHEAD --->Milla Jovovich was sexy as can be, and made an outstanding performance.  I would have liked to have seen more of the team leader, I was actually sorry to see him go so soon (but, boy did he die good).

The idea of bringing the dead back to life would be awesome.. if only they didn't eat flesh and weren't so ugly. The mansion where the first of the movie is, was where the first Resident Evil game took place. The bad thing was that they never put enough blood and gore in. When the girl lost her head from the elevator, it should have showed. All the blood, all the gore, would have been amazing. The creators of Resident Evil Are amazing movie creators. I say though if it were Rob Zombie who created that movie, would have been amazing. Another downfall is that they have Slipknot as a theme song. Its also stupid how Spence and Alice don't introduce themselves to each other, but in the middle of the movie, Alice knows Spence' name. Another thing is, it doesn't show what happens to Matt. And also, with 2 years in the difference of both movies, it kept fans in tight suspense.

Although it has everything it needs to be a ""resident evil"". Ubrella, S.T.A.R.S, t-virus, zombies, lickers....an the story takes place indoors. That gives you the feel of resident evil's 1 mansion. The screenplay is good and comparable to resident evil's 1 game, for example there is a traitor who walk among them just like Wesker! It could be more scary with suspense and one or two riddles like the games.The movie ends perfect for an excellent sequel, raccoon city seems to be dead! Everything is destroyed, blood everywhere and milla jovovitch alone with a shotgun in her hands!",Resident Evil
783,mediocriticlovesnintendo,I'm Torn...,6,26 August 2019,"My opinion on this film is very split, because on one hand certain scenes are very subtle and subvert expectations. But, on the other hand the effects used in this movie, especially the laser scene are so badly cg. It makes my brain cringe when i have to see enemies from some of my favorite games butchered like this, the licker especially actually looks worse than the games at the time. A large portion of what makes this film so bad at times is that the narrative is ripped from a different form of story telling. you get about the same experience from watchiing a compilation of game cutscenes. However there are some good things about this film. as previously mentioned it subverts expectations and has good reason for you to be filled in on the story without it feeling forced. The story isn't masterfull or anything but it has its moments and some of the later characters you get attached to. so i guess if you don't mind phantom menace level bad effects you can get some very decent entertainment from it. In conclusion, should you watch this movie? my answer is if you're a fan of the cult genre or a die-hard fan of the games. go in with low expectations and it could be fairly decent.",Resident Evil
784,nippon71,Big disappointment!,3,8 April 2002,"I had very high expectations on this film, but I found out that it really sucked. Paul Anderson did a rather god job with Event horizon (violent and scary)...which R. E did not have...I mean juicy gore and a creepy mood. Now do not get me wrong..this film has quite a lot of action...but there are no gory action and this is supposed to have zombies in it. Just when your´re about to see some cool special effects, they cut those parts off. Lack of money or what? I wish they had not kicked George a. Romero out. Secondly there are a lot of holes in the story. Thru the whole film I sat and wondered what was really happening. Is this just a film for those who played the game? And for the last why is this rated R...it should be rated PG -13 or something. So if you like films such as John Carpenter´s Ghosts of Mars...you will enjoy this one.  I rate this 3 out of 10.",Resident Evil

The zombies were not the main point of the story though...the writers were actually smart in the fact that there was a certain step to follow in the movie to survive. There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal, everyday woman will think. OK, I might not be normal, but I generally have good opinions about movies. The women in this movie show power, and the men were intelligently resourceful. The zombies were well played out and were not over-shown.

The only things worth been seen are Michelle Rodriguez´s in-your-face-attitude and Mila´s gorgeous dress.The movie was a sequence of almost isolated scenes, at no time able to captivate and thus not creating ANY suspense at all. I felt like the director had wanted to just ""mention"" every character of the game. Zombies, dogs, etc. all showed up for some minutes contributing no forthtaking effect to the plot. Bad publicity for the computer-game and, most of all Paul Anderson. Less could have been more for this one. Resident Evil had the possibility to become an entertaining pop-shocker. Unfortunately it turned out to be not only a bad game-adaption, but a really worthless piece of crap, one of the worst pictures I´ve seen so far. Sorry folks...",Resident Evil

The movie started off a little slow, but picked up pretty quick, Milla Jovovich ruled, Michelle rodriguez played her ""tough chic"" role, but pulled it off, I kind of wanted a little more out of Eric Mabius, I think he has potential as an actor but all and all the acting was pretty good for this kind of flik.  The biggest fear I had going into this movie was that I didn't think it would stick to the same formula as the games, but it did, almost to a key.  The movie's score was done by Mr. Marilyn Manson which was excellent, added extra creepiness to the atmosphere.  All and all I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to fans of the games and to anyone looking for a wild ride. 10/10",Resident Evil

Indeed, I expected ""the best movie made from a video game to date"". I don't really know if if was that, but ""Resident Evil"" was quite good. After all, I got what I paid for, or expected, in the first place: A fast-paced action movie which truly made fun. The body count was great (on the zombie side), the soundtrack was well fitting (from Techno to New Metal), Milla Jovovich was eye candy (as was Michelle Rodriguez, at least in the beginning) and all in all, ""Resident Evil"" was well worth the 4.50 EUR.

In the  game you were suppose to kill Zombies and solve mindless puzzles, which the movie clearly did. The choice of actors was excellent, the only problem I had was they went and killed Rain( Michelle Rodriguez), she was outstanding. They could have had both her and Milla's character in the next movie. Speaking of ""RE 2"" they have to make it, cause the ending for RE left it wide open I can't wait.",Resident Evil

Now for the but...What makes this movie hard to get behind and really enjoy are ALL the mistakes in the movie. From Milla wearing clothes one second in the shower to not wearing clothes, to the microphone boom in every other shot. Its hard to believe the intensity of all the shooting and killing if right when someone talks the microphone comes down and almost hits them in the head..

Alice is a copy of Alexia Ashford and Jill Valentine, and making her the MAIN character, and with powers and stuff like that, just damage the Residenr Evil saga, because it isn't even close to the Resident Evil storyline. Making a guy called Spence the responsible of the outbreak its even more stupid, no one was the responsible in the actual storyline. The squad that went to the mansion it's just plain wrong, and contradicts the sequel, because in it they talk about Jill Valentine being right about the zombies, but... in the storyline movie Jill never went to the mansion!!, that was in the Resident Evil original video game!, not in the first movie!, the S.T.A.R.S. went to the mansion in the first game, but in the movie it was some kind of squad, that, like the rest of the characters, came out of nowhere. One more thing... the Licker its just a mutant zombie, the mutation of the Crimson Heads, that are already mutated zombies... and... here is like a mutant of some kind that has the NE-T Virus in it?, well, another mistake and a waste of the good Tyrant, the monster boss of the original Resident Evil. I forgot some mistakes, but if i put every mistake of the movie here the message would last forever Concluding: well, the movie its not really bad by itself, but using the name of an awesome video game saga and telling a whole different story its like Tomb Raider, Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter being good movies... but the aren't, they are just movies screwing up the whole history of their respective sagas... and that's exactly what happens here: Regular action movie; Horrible, Awful, Stupid Resident Evil movie",Resident Evil

Fast, modern and very well directed, Resident Evil is fun and smart. It´s no masterpiece, of course, since it´s focused on action and adventure. Therefore, it presents a convincing and unpredictable plot, what´s indeed rare in this genre. Milla Jovovich is great as an action actress. Perhaps she finally found her ground in movie-making.

806,dragon_boi2,resident evil,8,10 July 2007,what resident evil lacks very much was more action. the reason why i say this is because in every scene it told somethings that we already know.i also felt that the movie should have been longer because of the missing details that they don't feel us in with. Resident evil is a good action flick but it does not have the horror or(edge) that a real horror movie has. take dawn of the dead for instance it brings a mostly good story line and creates suspense and horror.RE picks up at the mansion in raccoon city where everything is a blur to her and her husband.Alice is then trapped underground with a few other soldiers. but i will not tell the whole movie that would ruin it for other RE fans. the first time i saw this was on com cast 5 years ago.I was very satisfied with it to the end. RE still have could have better for all the gamer fans.for Imb fans you should enjoy it but don't expect it to be cream of the crop material.i rate it a 7.5\10.,Resident Evil

Milla is in top form in this movie. I didn't catch her C's name but she was a good stand-in C for Jill. Though the hellhounds were a tad off, the rest was perfect.",Resident Evil
810,Graystorm,Certainly one of the best of the genre!,9,10 March 2002,"I didn't know much about Resident Evil except that it was based on a Computer shoot-em-up and made into a zombie-splatter-flick. So when the title came up on the screen at the Sneak Preview, I was prepared for a bit of action filled onscreen-slaughter in which the brain can be safely turned off. The film eventually exceeded my expectations and managed to impress me on many a level and proved to be at the top of it's genre ? and immensely entertaining to watch.Now don't get me wrong ? ""Resident Evil"" still wants to be a splatter movie and provides everything that is expected: The group of ""good guys"" getting smaller and smaller, torn apart Zombies and other nasty creatures, blood and gore, shock effects that will have a good part of the audience jumping (and some screaming) in their seats, the girl (in this case the main heroine)not dressed in much, bullets flying left, right and centre.But this film has much more to offer than that:The directing by Paul Anderson is quite impressive. The choreography of the plenty of action scenes not only lets you keep a sense of what's going on (as opposed to the ""let's-just-use-a-shaking-hand-held-camera-and-give-the-audience-a-headache"" kind of film) but is also nice to watch. (Sometimes also when you don't see the critical second on-screen. But don't worry, you will still see plenty!) Sets and effects create  the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere, with the undead dogs being my favourite bad creatures ? they do the best job in looking disgusting yet dangerous.The Story, by Anderson too, is also a major point that raises this flick above the average standard of the genre. Sure, the whole design of the ""hive"", the super-computer, the virus etc. lack any real-life logic, but this is hardly what you came looking for in a film about zombie-bashing in the first place. So once you're in the right frame of mind to accept that, the story in itself is quite complex for it's genre. There are a couple of sub-plots, flashback scenes, deadlines and plot twists, so to successfully add suspense and surprise moments to all the shock and fright scenes. The film avoids using all typical cliché-scenes, never getting totally predictable and boring. A couple characters also have there individual background and escape the trap of becoming two-dimensional monster food. You even begin to care about them, especially the Soldier played by Michelle Rodriguez. The actors are convincing and do a very decent job. Note that even for smaller roles, ""Resident Evil"" casted ""real"" actors instead of ""zombie food extras"". (i.e. Dr. Lisa is played by Heike Makatsch, a quite well known actress in the German-speaking regions).The pace of the film is a very fast one, which is not a bad thing normally, as it doesn't get boring, but ? and here we go with the first point I criticize ? now and then, you get the feeling that longer parts have been cut out and are now missing. The story then jumps ahead  and leaves the audience with a ""there-at-this-point-all-of-sudden?-that-was-fast!"" feeling. I wonder if there'll be a directors cut on DVD. The music in the first part of the film is a bit too loud and disturbing. Nothing is really going on yet, but we already have the sound that would be worthy for a showdown scene. It gets better after a while (maybe because the action starts fitting the music). With all the positive points though, the later ones can easily be overlooked.All in all, if you like the Zombie-slaying kind of horror film, go see ""Resident Evil"" ? it's a prime quality example of this genre and you won't be disappointed.P.S. I'd really like to see the original crew come back for a sequel!",Resident Evil

813,frankencelery,"Ooogh, I think I'm going to be sick!",1,15 March 2002,"I went into this film with very low expectations.  I enjoyed director Anderson's sc-fi horror movie 'Event Horizon', but 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Shopping' were just terrible.  I then heard that they had rejected horror mastermind George Romero's script, and that Anderson's script used amnesia as a major plot device.  Tip: Amnesia = sucky script.I was pleasantly surprised, however, as I began watching the movie.  It was by no means great cinema, but it was entertaining.  It was definitely familiar ground, ripping off Cameron's 'Aliens' and Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', among other films, but you could easily get into the stylish, mtv-speed movie.  The only distraction from enjoying the movie was the way the team got separated and then back together again for no logical reason (""Where's the rest of the team?""  ""I dunno, we lost them!"").  The only distraction, that is, until the ending.SPOILER WARNING:Then, when I was really enjoying the movie, the ending happened.  Remember the ending to 2001's summer blockbuster, 'Planet of the Apes'?  Remember how it felt convoluted, like it had been tacked onto the end of the film? 'Resident Evil' has an ending that makes that ending look predictable.  It makes no sense!  It was Twilight-Zone-esque, except that it was really very stupid.  We're supposed to believe that several days have passed between her falling asleep and waking up?  Why did Umbrella take her to the public hospital?  How were they able to take them at all?  Why weren't there zombies roaming the streets?  How did the virus get out?  What happened to the hunk?The whole ending felt like they were trying to shock the audience, and pave the way for a sequel.  Lame, guys!  Just because an ending is predictable doesn't mean it's bad!  It can be comforting to see the guy get the girl (or in this case girl get the guy) and save the world.  Oh, I'm all for surprise endings, but not when they don't make any sense!  This movie left a bad taste in my mouth.",Resident Evil
814,Loyal_Xander,I went into the movie expecting it to suck...it was amazing!,10,15 March 2002,"When I saw trailers for this film they all drew attention to what some will think or see as ""Matrix-like effects"" the 180-off-the-wall kicking the dog scene, and the bullet trail scene. But really those are the only two effects in the film that have that ""style"" and really they don't. The kick was a simple 180, slowed down. The film is great if you loved the games, and could be equally good if you didn't I suppose. I'm the former, and can say there are SO many little things you'll notice. It doesn't rehash old plot from the games, it doesn't play like the games, it's fresh and new. The trailers do NOT do the film justice, when I left the movie I was begging for a sequel and of the mind that Capcom (R) should use the film as a basis for their next game, it was that good. It might have even surpassed its source material. The horror genre has been stale lately, and the video-game movie genre has NEVER worked right, this could change BOTH of those. The irony is I saw a trailer for Jason X at the screening, and that's just what I don't want to see, and what Resident Evil is not. Here's hoping for a sequel!",Resident Evil

816,wataguanut,Enter the World of Survival Horror!,10,15 March 2002,"When I walked into the theatres today, I wasn't expecting much from the director of such classics as ""Mortal Kombat"".  There was still, though, that lingering part in me that wanted the movie to rock.  Well, my friends, I can safely say that it does.Milla Jovovich (besides being scantily clad atleast three times) is excellent in her role here, even with a trying plot device in the ""Amnesia Sufferer"" bit.  Michelle Rodriguez mainly looks like somebody took a wiz in her corn flakes; hats off especially to James Purefoy and Eric Mabius, who deliver a fine performance when most thought they'd bomb horribly.Contrary to most reports, Resident Evil is not as gore-filled as sold on. In fact, the low-level of gore compared to other horror flicks might be a knock off for some die-hard zombie killers out there.  Still, this movie suffices as a true zombie-flick in every sense of the word.  And hey, the lazer deathtrap near the beginning was pretty neat as well.As far as movies go, Resident Evil wont be an Academy Award winner, nor will it likely make history in any sense of the word.  Still, as far as entertainment and Game-to-Movie adaptions, Resident Evil is head & shoulders above the rest to date.  Thus, I christen it with the 10-* vote.  Now, against other horror movies & films, I'd be more inclined with giving it maybe a 7 or 7.5, but I'm a RE mark so sue me.",Resident Evil

They needed to be more gory and bloody. The plot was great and I am looking forward to the sequel. Also they could have put more puzzles like the game does, ask questions, riddles, find these items and put them together to make a lighter or better gun, stuff like that.I hope the sequel improves these problems.

Despite the differences, I was not disappointed and think the movie is a well-done adaption.Resident Evil is a kick-ass, tension-filled, action-adventure experience just like the game.  Excellent visual and special effects, plenty of moments full of terror, anticipation and panic that starts right from the beginning. Let's not forget the carnivorous zombies and vicious dogs as well as a new loathsome creature that will make your skin crawl.  In all that hysteria, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez' characters rock!(If you've seen Thir13en Ghosts, this is similar but better although not as eerie and gory.)This movie is just as entertaining to watch as the game is to play.

IT had me on the edge of my seat most of the movie and had many parts that mad me jump half-way out of my seat too. The only reason I can't give it a perfect ten is because they didn't give much background information on any of the characters and no tyrant. Otherwise I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the R.E. series. One thing though is that it doesn't follow the game so dont go in expecting it to. I can't wait until the next one comes out if they make another one. I know i will be there opening day to see it!,Resident Evil
822,7starmantis,"Wonderful film! Very well done, suspensful...overall great movie!",9,16 March 2002,"I almost didn't see this film on opening night, I didn't think it was going to be that great...was I surprised! This movie was well made, the acting was great (of course anything Milla does is terrific). There was great action, adn the suspence was amazing. This is deffinatly a movie I would see again at the theatre, and that doesn't happen very often! The Story was well thought out, the cenemotography was great, they made a movie about flesh eating dead people and still made it realistic, GREAT MOVIE!! If you haven't seen it, go get your keys and run to see it........",Resident Evil
823,J1978,Closer To Reality Than You Might Think,10,16 March 2002,"I've been a fan of the game series for a long time, and I think the movie is an excellent addition to the franchise. If anything, the story is explained better in the movie because it is condensed and presented all at once. Of course, there's nothing like a romp through Raccoon City with your own shotgun to discover the hidden screts of Umbrella. Clearly there is room for both the movie(s) and the games, even if the stories differ slightly in some places.The scariest thing to me, though, is how possible the incident at Raccoon City is. As a Cellular and Developmental Biology major, I have seen how easy it really is to manipulate the genetic code of organisms, even with basic laboratory equipment. One of the first experiments performed by biology majors is to transform (modify the genetic code) of E. coli bacteria. The bacteria are typically given immunity to a specified antibiotic, in addition to a gene that allows transformed bacteria to glow when exposed to UV light. While bacteria are particularly easy to modify, it is certainly possible to modify other organisms as well. ""Transgenic"" food, as well as new advancements in pharmaceuticals have proven this. Will we ever see human experimentation or an outbreak like in Raccoon City? Hmm...",Resident Evil
824,YoYoPeepHuh,BEWARE R.E. FANS! THIS ONE IS NOT FOR YOU! THIS FILM WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD BASED IT OFF OF R.E.: SURVIVOR!,4,17 March 2002,"When I first heard abot a studio making a Resident Evil movie and that there was a George Romero (KING of ALL living dead movies) script floating around, I was totally psyched!  Then, I heard they got rid of Romero's script, but was still keeping him to direct. Despite getting rid of his script, I was still very excited to see this film.  As long as Romero was directing the film, that meant there would be as little CGI made gore as possible.  Then, they got rid of Romero all together, and decided not to make a Resident Evil movie bsed off of one of the games.  This is when the trouble began...For some reason, some stupid studio decided to let Paul Anderson do YET another video game movie.  Now, this guy has never made a good film in his life.  Event Horizon anyone?Anyway, as for the film itself, is was just plain horrible (actually not al of it, but I'll cover that lter on). Anderson decided to make the film as a prequel to the original Resident Evil game.  Now, that isn't why this film is bad.  In fact a prequel could have made a very good movie.  But alas, this was not to be.  Ironically, the film began to decline when the zombies began to appear.WARNING: THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH IS SOME WHAT OF A SPOILER!The film begins very good.  It shows the slaying of the employees of the evil Umbrella Corporation (something not really explained in an ofthe games).  Then a sweet introduction of a naked Milla Johokavich in her shower, which is followed by a sequence involving cool looking soldiers (borrowing the costumes from H.U.N.K. characters in the second game).  Then there's the basic explaining of the plot.  Then, the zombies show up.  The part that should of been the sweetest part of the movie.  More on this later.  Then, after the meat of the film (which even included a sappy sub-plot of hitman for hire), there is the ending.  Now, I'm no pervert, but who doesn't want to see Milla Johokovich wearing nothing but what looks like a napkin?  Anyway, there is an opening for a possible sequel (including the possibility of a Nemisis creature in  the sequel).  Now, this is all fine and dandy, but unfortunately an opening for a sequel doesn't really count if the actual movie was so horrible.""We tried to use as little computer animated gore as possible.""  A quote from writer/director Paul Anderson in the April issue of Play Station Magazine.  He pretty much lied.  The zombies where so fake it was scary. And the licker?  Holy dirt, it looked more computer animated then the one in the game!  It was like a cartoon!And, last and DEFIANTLY least, the acting.  You could tell all of the actors were in it for the money, and Michelle Rodriguez was especially horrible (she also had the worst one liners, but that's just bad writing courtesy of Paul Anderson).Now, if you are a fan of the games like myself (my favorite being Code: Veronica),you will probably want to go see this movie, and by the end will want your eight dollars back.  Also, you'll notice that whenever any of the other IMDB users say that they thought the film as good, you'll notice, they always seem to claim that they don't really like or never really played the game.All in all, I give this game four stars out of ten, and it only deserves this for the beginning and end.",Resident Evil
825,dragonlord58,This film was VERY surprising.,9,16 March 2002,"The most surprising thing about this movie was that fact that it DIDN'T suck. Actually, it's the best sci-fi horror flick I've ever seen.I was expecting much less after seeing crap video game to big screen translations such as... ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Tomb Raider"". Unlike most moviegoers, I am also a huge fan of all these video games, and seeing those movies made me wonder what kind of crack someone had to be on to completely ruin a (potentially) great thing.Resident Evil is the complete opposite. I went to see it with my girlfriend, who is also a fan of the Resident Evil games, and as soon as we saw the ""Licker"" we just looked at each other and said 'SWEET'.There's enough jumps and unexpected surprises in this movie to keep anyone satisfied, and every time this movie seems to be straying into cliche, it turns 180 degrees into something unexpected.Kudos to you, Paul W.S. Anderson! Thank you for an amazing movie!NOW WHERE'S THE SEQUEL?!?!",Resident Evil
826,nvderzm95,"Better than I thought it would be, Awesome flick!",8,16 March 2002,"I just want to say that I thought Resident Evil wouldn't be that good, considering it was different from the game.  But I was wrong.  It was a really good flick, and while it didnt follow the game religiously, it was based on them.  The writer did a great job developing the backing plot, with the virus released in the Umbrella Corporation's underground headquarters. I really liked the effects, especially the zombies, the dogs, and the Licker.  I'm going to sound weird in this, but I thought it wasnt gory enough.  It's rated R, so they could have gotten away with a lot more blood. In a certain scene, it was unrealistic at the shortage of blood.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want some ultra-violent gore-fest, but at least realistic. Resident Evil has good action, a few good scares, and good effects.  I definately recommend RE to fans of the game series, zombie movie fans, horror movie fans, or simply movie fans.  I'm probably going to see it at least one or two more times in theaters.",Resident Evil

But a movie always has to change to appeal to the overall public and that's what Anderson did, he did not only make this movie for the Fanbase but for the overall people who don't know anything about RE. And damn, he succeeded well into doing that ! now for my scores : CG quality : 8.5/10, not the best i've seen but still great !!!!! Acting: 7/10, Jovovich gets my darn 10/10 ! :) Soundtrack : ABSOLUTELY GREAT !, great choice of music, it doesn't happen very often to have a complete Metal soundtrack for a moviebut the combination of the horror + metal is F**king great !!!!

If Paul Anderson decides to make a sequel he had better put enough ""back tracking"" plot and story-line for those who don't understand the deep rooted connotations of Umbrella Inc and the entire game series in general.

829,THORKHAN29,Evil has been unleashed!,10,17 March 2002,I have been waiting for this movie to be released for along time now.  As I went to the opening of Resident Evil I was worried that the film would not equal my expectations.The film surprised me by being better than expected. Before going to see this film I want you to ask yourself these questions. Is this happening below my city? Can this kind of research actually be going on right now? Would the military and the goverment try to create the ultimate bio weapon? If this won't send chills down your spine then your probably already dead! Enjoy the movie and pray for your salvation.,Resident Evil

After that they provided a nice up to date explaination as to what was happening for the unenlightened viewer.  Then the rollar coaster ride started and never stopped!!!  Excellent suspense and gory scenes and often NOT predictable were the highlights of the film. I really enjoyed the movie and would recomend it to anyone who is not squeemish:)",Resident Evil

Probably the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Don't listen to any of the negative reviews...this movie is good.  Overall, it's very well done and and Milla Jovovich does a great job at playing the lead character, ""Alice"".  Definitely worth checking out.",Resident Evil
832,debusk,Better than average...,10,17 March 2002,"This film is actually decent. Don't listen to the critics who'd rather be watching art house films.

I am not counting The Others or the Sixth Sense as high level horror movies though I liked them a lot.Finally, here comes a very good horror movie, not stupid, about zombies and without stereotyped teenagers.  For the past 3 years, I've rent movies and I was looking for a good zombie movie.Resident Evil, the only movie that surprised me after seeing The Matrix. Good luck for the sequels!",Resident Evil

835,SavannaWolfpup,Bores-ville for all game lovers,1,17 March 2002,"This movie is sapossed to be about the game. One thing is, is the zombies were a whole lot scarier in the game then they were on the ""silver screen."" The ""licker"" didn't arrive in the game until the second one, but they sure did leave out the big guy that JILL was to fight, the Tyrent . . . Does anyone remember him? I sure do. Where were S.T.A.R.S. Alpha and Bravo Team? Where was Jill, Berry, Chris, Wesker, Brad, Kenneth, Enrico, Rebecca, and Richard? And where was all of the weapons? It wasn't Racoon City, that doesn't come up until the second and the third one, it is set in Racoon Forest. I would think that if George A. Romero (Dawn of the Dead) did the movie it would would have been a lot better. At least when they did Tomb Raider it stayed with the game.

The story itself was not exactly like the game but, it was from a different point of view.  It still had all that was the game and more.

It has parts that'll make you jump, scream, and feel sad. I especially liked this movie because my favorite actress, Michelle Rodriguez, is in it. She is a great actress and she is the one that inspired me to want to act because of the roles she plays. She shows how women can achieve anything, as in her movie ""Girlfight."" She's a great inspiration and I hope I see her in other great movies.This is why I highly recommend you seeing the movie ""Resident Evil.""",Resident Evil
838,bigvevil,My Pro Opinion...,9,18 March 2002,"As a Special Make-up Effects Artist for motion pictures I'd like to give my opinion and review of Resident Evil. First off I'd like to say that the movie wasn't that far off from the video games. The seamless use of pieces from all the games are very well tied together in this action horror. The cast delivers a non stop heart pumping ride from beginning to end. The use of special effects was in my opinion some off the best to date. Bringing the older Remero style Dead movies to the 21st century, with style I might add. By far the best adaption from video game to film. I rate it an even 9/10 A must see for action horror fans of film and video games. Don't let negative reviews keep you from seeing this picture. Judge for yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed.",Resident Evil
839,DJ Chass,A solid thriller that ACTUALLY FITS INTO THE SAGA!!,10,20 March 2002,"I've been expecting this movie since I first heard of the plans to make the games a motion picture, and as (I'm sure) we all know, that can lead to high expectations.  This movie did not disappoint me at all.  While it is true that the fans who have played all the games (myself included) will have a little bit more fun recognizing the situations and characters (so THAT'S where Nemesis came from!), the movie is a wonderful opener to the entire story line, and hopefully will introduce many people to the games, as they are all truly exceptional chunks of programming.  There was also a lot of symbolism in the movie that I found genuinely interesting.  If you're familiar with Alice In Wonderland, you might know what I'm referring to:
-Main character's name is Alice...-Evil Computer is called the 'Red Queen'...-The scene with somebody having to be sacrificed so the Red Queen will give them the code to escape, and the method is a proposed beheading (OFF WITH HER HEAD!)... and I'm sure there's more...Overall a totally enjoyable movie, with quite a few good scares to boot. Go see it, and you should not be disappointed.",Resident Evil

I however played the RE games and I hated the changes that were made to the plot. The movie had some good points. It keeps your attention.  Lots of action and a not too complex plot.  Not the greatest, but worth seeing.",Resident Evil
842,Devouring_One,"Hey, the first game to movie that doesn't suck!",10,21 March 2002,"Though definately not an Oscar winner, Resident Evil is an enjoyable zombie flick. Though it mostly borrows it's material from other horror flicks, it does have something original. A heavy metal track. In a horror movie. Heck, if it wasn't called ""Resident Evil"", I would have thought it was an action movie. Of course, this sometimes causes trouble. Like how the music sometimes totally drowns out the dialog. Then again, there isn't much dialog. Since the characters are pretty much storyless, when one of them dies, you can't even remember his or her name. Kinda sad...However, the zombies were awesome! The extras actually looked liked the living dead, with CGI making it seem as if they were missing skin. The zombies waddled around (like they should, by the way) more or less aimlessly, trying to eat the people (nobody can remember their names anywho). The Licker was something else, though! The amount of time they must have put on it was extensive, because it moves swiftly and, in a strange way, gracefuly.I guarantee you that this movie will make you jump a couple of times. Thinking about it, I remember how every time something scaring would happen, everyone would jump out of their seat and land with a ""poof"". Kinda funny...As for RE fans, only the ""Hardcore Fan Boys"" should be disappointed. You know, the ones that wanted an exact recreation of the first game. But wouldn't it be lame if you already knew what would happen? As a final note, go see this movie if you like zombie flicks, RE, horror movies and movies in general. It won't disappoint.",Resident Evil

Except the fact that Millaaaaa (YESSSS;)!) doesn't remember who she is, there aren't many new fresh ideas to see. But that's not bad in this case. This movie doesn't try to be innovative, it is consequently straight. There are no senseless talkings, no absoutely stupid love story and noone acts like a fool just to make something bad happen. But bad things happen, and every bad thing that happens is made with much love. There is this really nasty Horrormaincomputergirl which shows a really beasty behavior, there are those lovely undying zombies, those really dangerous looking creepdogs and this odd monsters from these crates. Sounds really ridicoulous but its good mixed and everything fits.I think it's like eating at Grandma ! You get the food at every cheap restaurant, but from Grandma it just tastes better.Ah and I like the really fine end.

Red Queen is one of the meanest villians ever, i mean sending a laser to prepare the elite group for the feasting zombies later. Milla Jovovich clad in a dress a jacket kicking a doberman's ass and snapping the neck of a zombie between her thighs is down right awesome. The Licker is just how I imagined it, much more gruesome than the one from the game. Special effect and graphics were all right but they needed to improve on the movement because you could barely seen the details of the Licker.

Set at the beginning of it all in Racoon city, you are eased into the shady world of the umbrella corporation's illegal research into viral weaponry, and we all see the horrific results of this folly. Ok, it has to be said that horror films are by definition, clichéd and generally formulaic, this is no exception BUT, it has been made true to the games, In so much as none of the games ever compromised there 18 certificate, and never held back on the splatter and gore and the film is no exception.Set in a secret underground research facility, the film starts with an act of sabotage. The story really starts moving with the arrival of a crack team from the umbrella corp, who's task is to get in and find out why the facilities main computer has gone homicidal and killed everyone inside. Let the fun begin.....This is a tense, atmospheric horror with plenty of twists and turns, some great effects, plenty of mincing zombies, dark corridors and surprises around every corner.Fans of the game will not be disappointed, horror fans won't be disappointed, and all film fans should see this top film.

The action's pretty good but i think it's more of a horror movie - makes jump quite a bit.  I would definately recommend it if you've never played the game, but if you have, this might be a disapointment.  The zombie's look pretty real, but the licker thing, just looks too 3D'ish.  And also, I don't see why this is rated R, it's MA here in Australia, but the point is that there's not even much gore at all!!!!The sequel looks like it's gonna be pretty damn good though!",Resident Evil

It is set in a very hi-tech underground lab with lots of dark moody lighting to set the mood for the evil to follow.  Without giving too much away of the story line I loved the methodical destruction of the team. Milla Jovovich was very believable as the heroine/zombie killer and even though it's a bit sparse in the plot department it chugs along at a fair pace, with the fright factor very high.The thing that impressed me the most was the special effects and prosthetics used. The fight scenes were particularly believable and the zombiefication of the humans was excellent (but look out for the doberman's with the metal teeth and no hair - way cool!)Just a word of warning though, this is NOT a date movie or even something to watch with your wife. MY poor leg was left bruised from my wife clamping my leg at every spooky or scary scene ( and there is quite a lot in this flick).All in all a good ,gory, kill the zombies movie with a twist.",Resident Evil

This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat staring at the screen with your mouth open. After coming out of the theaters,I was amazed. This was not what I expected. A must buy!!! Also a great score by Marilyn Manson. Looking for a great horror movie? Well this is it!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Resident Evil
860,Ashley Pickard,I was so very disappointed with this film!,1,26 May 2002,"What can I say about this film, apart from it was terrible and I hated it!I loved the games and was looking forward to seeing the film, and I was bored throughout the film, but not throughout the WHOLE film. One or two half decent scenes and one scene of action that will stick in anyone's mind (you'll know which scene I mean if you see it), but unfortunately that is it! Most of the scenes or either too wordy and bored me, or the room is that full of zombie's that you can't pick out the characters! And the flashback scenes are also far too abstract!!!I left the film feeling as though I had wasted 1hr 40 of my life and it could have been better used down the pub or even standing in the rain for 1hr 40 would have pleased me more!I have seen the film twice (to my disgust!) and STILL I don't know character names, only one, and I have even looked them up on imdb.com before watching it for the second time! I STILL don't feel any empathy for the characters and basically I didn't care if the made it out or not!
I prey to God himself that the sequel is better (Resident Evil: Nemesis [2003]) and I hope that it does the games the tiniest bit of justice, unlike this movie.",Resident Evil

863,pyss_11,this movie is great,10,6 June 2002,This movie is the best i have seen i awhile. I am a resident evil fan and I had ben hoping they would come out with the movie. When they did I was there the 2nd day it was out. Like I said it was a very good movie. If you have not seen the movie find a way to see it it will be worth your time .If you are needing pics of resident evil the game or movie contact me and i'll send you some.,Resident Evil
864,darkanar,I really loved it!!,10,7 July 2002,"I'm not a videogame's fan, so I can't say how the movie is near to the game. Apart from that.. what can I say.. I really loved it!! It's not Romero's Zombie but thinking at the latest teen-horror movies (bleah) I would say that Resident Evil is a come back to the '80!!! Yes! It's an horror movie in pure eighties style with bloody heads, hands, and more. And what about the Zombies... how many Zombies! I really loved the end-scene too. You gotta see it! The eighties are coming back!!!",Resident Evil
865,adamsandlerfan1,Best Video game To movie,10,2 August 2002,"""Resident Evil"" Is the best video game movie. Though the movie has no characters from the  games it still holds true to what the games are all about. The acting was perfect for the situations that the charactrs were in, and they kept it kind of light at some points. If you liked the games you'll like the movie more.",Resident Evil
866,SeiferRX,This is the best video game based movie ever made!!,10,13 July 2002,"Resident Evil is a great movie and it even adds to the plot of the game series. The movie answers many questions that weren't answered in the games and is like a prequel to the first game, showing how the T-Virus escaped into the underground lab in the first place.  It also has plenty of action throughout the game and will make you jump in your seat atleast once.",Resident Evil
867,csmckenzie,Not Too Shabby,8,13 July 2002,"I saw this movie solely on the point that I was a huge fan of the games. I went in expecting a movie based on resident evil but was surprised to find no relation to the games, not even the characters or the infamous Raccoon City. Instead they opted for a new set of characters, and comes off looking like an alternate beginning for whole series. Resident evil has some great special effects and of course fight scenes but the real star of this flick is Milla Jovovich (Alice). As the main character in a horror movie its her job to get the people clinging to their seats while she is being attacked by a assortment of monsters, and pulls it off flawlessly (though I think she would have made a wonderful a Jill). Any fans of the game will want to watch the movie just for the last camera pan out (trust me), but for everyone else this movie does hold its own and is worth a look. I would recommend this to anyone loves a good horror film or just some senseless violence, as for me I cant wait for the next one. (Its in Raccoon city I hope)",Resident Evil
868,nihilism666,Awesome movie,10,17 July 2002,"As I have been following the computer games since 1996 I was highly anticipating the Resident Evil Movie. Though after Tomb Raider I worried that it would turn out to be rubbish. However...Resident Evil turned out to be the best film I've seen this year. The movie starts at a very fast pace, missing out on lenghty conversations and concentrating on plenty action. A very good thing. Infact, the movie rarely does stop for talk as there always seems to be something going on to keep your interest. The movies excellent techno/ rock score really brings out the drama in the scenes and theres the odd scare throughout the does make you jump. The plot wasnt lame, managing a few twists that builds up to great ending. Whether you like Resident Evil or not, watch this movie, you wont regret it.",Resident Evil

I just cant understand why its getting so poor reviews! Its not about amazing chit chat. Deep plots. Its a well directed, tense horror movie. Its really very well directed and stylish. Very tense, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Im looking forward to Resident Evil 2 :) Oh and one last thing I have been boiling in me for YEARS! The famous Romero moives. THEY ARE NOT INTELLECTUAL OK???? Those movies have NO sub plot. They are just cheap horror films about guys roaming around going Geeeeerrrrr...brarrrrrraaaaaaaains.

Fortunately, my opinion was to change! Movie was great, actors were good enough, and there was actually a plot (whoa!). Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie. I have played both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and recognized many of the scenes which were kind of similar to games. What can I say? For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. For regular people the movie might be above the average. This was one hell-of-a-movie, and I'm waiting for the sequel.",Resident Evil

Excellent special effects, gorgeous Milla Jovovich, perfect, expertly directed musical score... and the storyline is actually pretty good too!Videogame to film adaptations are always infamously bad, but this one sets the standard for all to come.

874,wallys_world_10,The Best Movie ... EVER!,10,12 August 2002,"This has to be one of the most stunning, well done movies I have EVER watched. I love the featurs in the film, they were simplying breathtaking. Yeah sure some people might be disappointed that the characters dont relate to the game, but who cares? Why watch the same old story from before with the same characters we already know a ton about? This new unique characters keep you hanging on whats gonig to happen next with the all important T-Virus that all us gamers know about.The Actors deliver a stunning performance for a fairly decent casting job. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Milla Jovovich (Alice) are both awesome in this film. But I really admired the performances by Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Eric Mabius (Matt). Martin Crewes should have a really good career in front of him, and it looks as Eric will be back for the second film. Besides that you had James Purefoy who also had a decent performance. But The Casting was just a little of how aweosme the film was.
Now I'm not going to spoil the film for those of you who havent saw it so I really cant take about some of the kick ass things involved with the film. Your going to hear alot of rememberable quotes from both the Red Queen, Kaplan, and Michelle Rodriguez. I gave this movie a perfect 10, and I wouldn't give many movies an 8 let alone a 10. But this movie really deserved it. Paul Anderson is definatly a good director.Rent, Buy, What? You ask this qusetion, this movie is a definate must see. I bought the movie the second day it was out, after already watching it 2 times, and I've probably wasted the last week or two of my life away watching this film over and over. Id say ive watched it a goo 20 times. So even if you dont like the general thriller, this movie is for you. Its packed with action as well and has a few ""scary jumps"" along the way! Go Get It Now!",Resident Evil

880,iamsplodge,Thrilling from start to finish !,8,3 August 2010,"Resident Evil is a well written , well acted and well directed horror film which holds the viewer's attention from start to finish . However it is too short in my opinion and lacks a few minor details which prevent it from being a classic .The film is quick to start and carries the pace well throughout . A brief account of how the virus is spread and the fate of those affected is given at the start . As the plot thickens and tension is mounted we begin to realise that the ""Umbrella Corp."" know no limits and are prepared to risk anything for success in their dangerous and highly illegal experiments . The only question is; are the team sent down to fix things going to make matters better or worse ? Resident Evil is no masterpiece, but is most definitely worth a watch !",Resident Evil
881,Andy_Moonshadow,Loved It!,10,19 January 2003,"I love the plot of this movie; exciting, fast pace, and with more than a few ""freeky parts.""  I've played the games and I think they could have stayed a little bit more faithfull to the them, though I am perfectly content with the way it is.  Contrary to what is said above, Milla Jovovich is my favorite actress and I like what she brought to the screen.  As if zombies weren't enough, the Red Queen adds a little something special.  I was a bit surprised and taken aback by the ending:  wasn't really expecting that.",Resident Evil
882,guslg,Well...I liked it,7,25 January 2003,"I've got to write something to at least slightly counter the bad vibes people are putting out about this film.No it's not the scariest film ever made, I'll give that, and maybe it's not like the game, but who gives a shit.  But the production values are great, the acting is good.  Milla and Michelle kick arse, look good doing it and they can act.  It's a pity the only strong male character, the squad leader (name?) got sliced and diced.  Oh and the CGI isn't top of the line, but who gives a rats, seeing the strings in Blakes 7, Dr who, Thunderbirds or the matte lines in the Star Wars never stopped anyone except the anal from enjoying them.  I didn't even know what this film was about before i saw it, so i was rolling around on the floor in fits when i realised it was a zombie film, but i quickly composed myself and got into the swing of it and enjoyed it.Yeah, I liked it and there I stand.",Resident Evil
883,theclassiccrush,My GOD No,1,12 August 2009,"ARE YOU F*CKING RETARTED??? That movie was a waste of space, time and money. All of the resident evil movies are sh*t. It doesn't make the cut as a movie let alone a as a video game based movie. It belongs on the sci-fi channel at 3 am on a Sunday night not the big screen. This movie just sucks even if you didn't play the games. And if you did it sucks more. I pray God finds pity on your soul. Jesus YOUR RETARTED. Ugh I threw up in my mouth a little. I put a 1 out of 10 but if I could I would have put a -10 because I don't even want to recognize it as a film more like a truck stops hard nasty toilet paper used to wipe the a** of films that actually do get a 1 out of 10.

884,Da_Ladd,**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**BEST VG/MOVIE,10,22 February 2003,"**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**
In my opinion I would have to say this is the best video game to movie transfer ever. The story is good (5 games make that obvious) but you don't need to play the games to enjoy the movie. One of the biggest factors to this is the main character Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. So you learn only what she does throughout the movie. Also it does have bonuses for those who have played the games. For example there are many subtle seens and dialogue that only gamers of the series will pick up on. One I do wish was more noticeable. As pointed out in the trivia section for the movie on this site. Is at the ending  where the newspaper reads ""The Dead Walk"" there's a article about the S.T.A.R.S. team and the mansion. Which I swear you couldn't read with the Hubbel telescope. Another thing is I don't remember anyone saying Alice's name throughout the whole movie. Which would make all the  Alice in Wonderland references  stand out more.The only thing I wish would of been different is that they had a Tyrant or Hunter as the big bad monster instead of a Licker. Hopefully they will in the next movie (RE: Nemesis) but I doubt it since it will be Nemesis. Also I wonder who they will get to play Jill Valentine since Milla looks like her in my opinion, but is playing Alice again.",Resident Evil
885,Plex-C,My review is heavily based on the movie/game relationship,1,31 July 2010,"I saw the trailer for Afterlife and i got to thinking, ""People need to know how whether this series is good or not."" So here's my opinion. I think the Resident Evil movies are a waste of money and time. My opinion is based on mainly the relation of the Video Game series, yes the movies are based on a video game series, as well as the movie itself. Well the story is completely messed up, the story has next to nothing to do with the games. They took the games titles as well as the names of some of the characters, without successfully portraying them properly, other than that, they took the name of the town, and that's pretty much it. There was no hive in the games, and Alice (The protagonist of the films) isn't even from the games! They got the virus all wrong and never got anywhere close to the plot of the games. Some people may say that, ""Both the games and the movies are about a Zombie apocalypse, they got the story right."" Wrong, The story is much deeper than that. If the movies were not named after the games, i would have passed of the things they actually took from the games as simple allusions. If you don't play the games, you might actually enjoy the films, the plot may be a little messed up and simple, but the action is OK and i can't complain too much about the acting. With relation to the games, i give it a 1/10, without 6.3/10. If your curios about the real storyline of the games, please watch a retrospective. I'm sorry if i come off as rude or biased, but it's hard for someone who loves the games so much. Peace to you all.",Resident Evil
886,wesker_Snake,It's awful!,1,8 May 2010,"This is a movie that shouldn't have been done if it was made right. Even as a stand alone movie it sucks. The storyline is just like this: Stop the Red Queen (A evil computer hologram that unleash a virus that makes these people turns into zombies), that's it! Even the actors/actresses was a pain in the a#¤ to look at. The story sucks. The acting sucks. It should have followed the game instead. Paul WS Anderson should stop making movies. I don't know why they decided to make it so un-faithful to the game, but even if they made a movie different from it's source material they should at least make a good movie. But they failed.

I am absolutely blown away...it's very spectacular!Everything is right in the movie...the cast selection, the story, the environment...everything.

In addition, even once the generally poor quality of films computer games (Tomb Raider!), I expected the worst when the sneak the title ""Resident Evil"" appeared.In retrospect, I must say that the film was not against me. Good: it is a little thirteen-in-a-dozen in terms of action but overall surely not badly made. The characters remain two-dimensional and very little attention to relationships, the movie is certainly a next level.The zombies were simply laughable. I thought of Michael Jackson every time 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night / and no one is going to save you from the beast about to strike.However, it was opposite that it is not tedious to Milla Jojovich half hours in a short skirt around to see running. However, if you like this movie then expects a sequel.",Resident Evil
890,Warlord101,This wasn't an accident...it's another Anderson film! GAH! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!,1,24 July 2003,"Resident Evil. Ahh, such a good videogame collection. I got into Resident Evil about 3 or 4 years ago, when I played Resident Evil 2. Then Resident Evil 3. Last Christmas, I finally played Resident Evil. Easter, I played Resident Evil 0. I know, that's not them all, but those are what I have played. An absolutely great videogame collection.Why am I saying this when I'm supposed to be reviewing the film? Because I just want you to know that I love Resident Evil. The games that is. The following review may make you think I don't like Resident Evil. I only hate the film. I love the games. Shall I begin then?Now, I warn you here that there are Spoilers, but in case someone misses this line:Okay, when we start, we get some labs and some idiots getting themselves killed inside a lab. This can almost make you think that we're about to get a good film. The scene is relatively well done but with the dash of stupidity in it here and there. Not bad this scene though.Sadly, once we get to the Mansion, this hope slowly dissipates. Now we get the overused ""Black Opps come in to do their thing"". They want to go to the Labs and do some stuff that I can't really be bothered to remember because if you've seen it once and didn't like it, you won't want to see it again.Once they get there, they couldn't come up with any ideas about how to kill off the only good characters in a scene creuly ripped from Cube! And not only that there is a MAJOR goof up in that scene! There is space at either end that could be used to hide in so as to not get killed by a Laser! But they kill the character's off anyway.The rest of the film sees poorly crafted Zombies with what looks like bits of vegetable stuck to their heads and other poor effects. I wouldn't go into detail but I feel I want to.The Zombies we see look like malnourished staffworkers and don't even have the decent Resident Evil Zombie stumble. They don't even have flesh hanging off! I'm sorry if this is too vivid or soemthing, but I've got a Resident Evil Remake Poster and I see a Zombie with skin flaking. The fact that Romero didn't Greenlight it cost it. Greatly. Romero is, in my opinion, the god of Zombie Films, especially when teamed with Tom Savini's high quality special effects. Sadly, Anderson had neither.Anderson claims that they were to look like they were desiesed and that by putting make-up on the main areas of the body and to make them look like they inhaled tyhe virus and yadda yadda yadda. They aren't diseased anymore, moron! They're dead! They died! The chemical has kept them animated! They aren't diseased anmore, they're descesed!But back on the subject of effects, you must recall the sound effects of the Zombies in Resident Evil, the Games. The raspy moans, the sound of mutilated flesh merged with torn cloth being dragged along a corridor. Suddenly, we have a bunch of people wearing special effects rediculously (Wounds that look like they cut deep into the Flesh but completely clean around it doesn't look right) that make hissing, not groans, hissing!Now, I have to say something about the actual plot. Okay, not even a reference to a Character from ANY of the games in this film. There's barely a reference to Resident Evil. Racoon City is mentioned about TWICE in the entire film, despite this being the one of the places we see most of. Look at it this way:Resident Evil: Okay, this was set on the Outskirts in a Mansion that Anderson never heard of.Resident Evil 2: It starts on the streets of where? Why, Racon City. Where are you most of the game? The RPD Building, ofcourse.Resident Evil 3: You spend most of the game wandering and figthing on the very streets of Racoon in RE3 and you don't leave Racoon until the end.I don't know about Resident Evil: Codename Veronica really, but I think it is set elsewhere so my point is not of use here.Suddenly, we have this Secret Lab under Racoon City that was never mentioned or visited in a game. Did Anderson even play Resident Evil 1 for longer then 5 Minutes?""So this here is the Hive under some Mansion that suddenly exists in some Mountains. Don't know what the Mountains are called cos I played the game for 5 miutes. I'm sorry, what? Spencer Estate? What is that? Ar..klay...Moun..tains? Are they part of the Andes or something?""
And we also have someone who is about as close as we can get to everyone's favourite G-Virus Securing Guy, Hunk. Obviously, the guys who made this film had't played Hunk's Bonus Scenario, but heard a little about a Black Commando securing a Virus. Now, may I point out that these people obviously got killed by the first Licker in Resident Evil 2 and assumed it was a boss so stuck a Licker in and made it look awful in appearance but scare the characters. And I admit to this. Lickers are scary. But most of the time, people are smart enough to shoot them, removing the fear, unless they, for example, jump through a window the first time you've played Resident Evil 2. And how come we haven't even a mentioning of Wesker or Birkin, who not only did much work on the T-Virus but also (Brikin) worked on the G-Virus, yet no mention of the G-Virus or the T-Virus?Now, I'd like to have my say on the Special Effects? *cough*bunch-a-hacks*cough*. They stole from Cube to kill off probably the only good Character/s in the film. But I won't dwell on that bit. I want to dwell on the pathetic creature effects. Creature effects are present? What the hell? Running up a wall to kill a Cerberus by kicking it in the head?""Er..Plot Hole Designer Guy, you did a good job of explaining why this gal can run up walls and rip off the Matrix! Here's a bonus!""And it kills the dog! Easy as that! How stupid can you get!?Now, she goes through 1 Clip and kills ALL those dogs? That's about 2 or less Bullets a Dog. Now, I don't recall EVER having the pleasure of only using 2 shots to kill a Cerberus. Ever. Another thing is that 1/3 of the time, the Dogs looked like Dogs that had been covered in Tomato Skins, another 1/3 of the time, they were horribly shiny turds of CGI that never once looked real and the final 1/3 they were just heads on sticks (They're supposed to be growling. All they do is stay VERY still and stare which can only really mean heads on sticks). The Licker didn't even look realistic. It was too shiny. And too...non...Lickery. It barely looked or acted like a Licker. Licker's are smart, stealthy and dangerous. Remember in Resident Evil 2 when you're in the interogation room? One (Or two, I think) jumped through the window, scaring the hell out of you and showing they're smart enough to use the Camoflauge of the mirror to catch you off guard. Hmmm...Licker just hits at the window. Later it has its tongue stuck down? It's tongue is strong, I beleive, and acutally may have torn itself off insted of just getting stuck there. And it's Claws did what for it's escape? It didn't try attacking anyone, pulling the thing out or tear through its tongue. And what it did? Pulled and flailed a bit. Pathetic. Fullstop.
The end of the film is even worse. Why would they want some moron who I don't even think has a name and I couldn't care for the Nemesis Project just because he got a nasty scratch on his arm when the Red Ape (It doesn't deserve the title of Licker. Lickers scared me. This thing looks more like a mobile piece of muscular jelly) cut it. I got cut loads of times in Resident Evil 2 by Lickers. I must have been scratched atleast 8 times by Lickers through the game but I'm not turning into Nemesis. And why wouldn't the other anonymous character (According to Behind-the-scenes her name is Alice. Not that I noticed. I don't recall her name being used in the entire film) just get the Vaccine into him? And Umbrella are better at getting subjects, they don't use failing, flailing actors.I hated this film. These people don't deserve to ever make a film together ever again. I absolutely refuse to watch this ever again. I would sooner boil my Head in a Deep Fat Fryer, stab myself in the Chest wth a Turkey Carver and then watch Coronation Street insted of phoning an Ambulance whlist my House was on fire then watch this film again! It is akin to NotLD 30th Aniversairy Special. It was utterly awful . And it had something it was based on that was simply excellence (I own the original NotLD, both in Black and White and Colour). I kid you not though, Resident Evil the film is THE worst film I have ever seen apart from Total Reality (And that sells on DVD for about £1.29. And it is shoved into Computer Games Sections at Game just to get rid of the damn thing!). I apologise to any fans of the films (NothLD 30th Anniversairy, Total Reality and ""Resident Evil"") but that is how much I hated this film.If you were thinking about buying this film, take your money, save up, and buy either the Resident Evil Remake or Resident Evil 0 (It may leave a few Plot Holes but this is Good! VERY GOOD! I know, I've played it.) and if you don't have a Gamecube but love Resident Evil, buy one and never regret it. Resident Evil (The Film) deserves to be only found pushed to the bottom of Bargain Bins for 99p. And that should only be worth the Empty Box. The Film itself is worthless. This isn't Resident Evil. This is just a bunch of useless idiots trying to cash in on a well loved franchise by using Zombies and Models wearing pathetic clothing amongst bad actors and pathetic looking Zombies. Never, ever, ever watch this film if you have EVER played a Resident Evil Game or even seen a Zombie film and liked them. And the only really good film Anderson made was EVENT HORIZON. Atleast that was any good.0 out of 10. I'm even inclined to say 0 out of infinite!",Resident Evil

From its slow moving undead antagonists to its creepy soundtrack (The Theme By Manson Still Sends Chills Down My Spine and Makes me Cringe!)Milla Jovovitch Is Almost Instantly Unforgettable from her kick ass fight sequences and sexy dress. Resident Evil Is Everything A Video Game Adaptation Should Be.. Smart, Scary, Sexy, Action Packed and Bloody! Michelle Rodriguez Makes a perfect performance also with just as much zombie killing action as Milla. I didn't realize this until after i watched the movie like 10 times, but the under story to the film is actually Alice In Wonderland. Milla (Alice) is trying to escape wonder land (The Hive) with the help of the rabbit (a white rabbit is seen being experimented on in a lab) and well the red queen actually is a computer instead of an actual red queen as in the story. its a clever idea actually haa...

There are points in the movie that has really a scary effect. How they made the zombies is fantastic. If you like action / thriller movies, you absolutely must watch this one!! The actors play there role very good. The story about a virus that turns people into zombies is very strong to think of. This movie is the first of the trilogy.

I started playing the game a few weeks later, I loved everything, the story, the graphics, gameplay, environment, everything ! Most important was how the game pulled you into the Resident Evil world, creepy !... When Resident Evil II (game) came out, I played it 'till the end in one night... Same goes for the other RE games... Then, the movie, I just hoped they followed the tag lines of the games... and... They did ! Just beautiful to see the underground labs, the umbrella squad working, the zombies... and, most important, the feeling that the games gave me while playing them, just giving in to the movie and letting you think you're in Resident Evil world, just like the games did. Ofcourse you can only feel this way about the movie when you've played the games. If you haven't played the games, and you like the movie, it's a must to go and play them now ! Go deeper into the Resident Evil world :) Can't wait 'till the second movie comes out :)Peace,Marcus",Resident Evil

So I went to see it, and for the first five minutes hopes were high, the slow zoom in with the crunching industrial soundtrack was amazing, but it was downhill from there. Mila Jovovich finding herself in a strange place was intriguing, as was the lead up to her returning to the underground city (despite screamingly awful dialogue) and all seemed good. It was when the zombies appeared that this film disintegrated into awful cliche ridden vacuousness. After that, it was just an awful, suspence-free regurgitation of superior films and videogames. I do not want to spoil the plot for those who have not seen it, but when a zombie based movie does not use the word 'zombie' once, and takes an hour to realise the aforementioned undead should be shot in the head, something is really wrong!",Resident Evil

The Licker is the coolest creature in the movie. This movie scared me the first time I saw it in theaters. The movie's zombies even look like real zombies you can't get that out of Dawn Of The Dead or another zombie movie. I loved this movie and I always was a fan of Resident Evil.

I found the movie to be completely awesome!!!!!! No, it did not have many similarities to the game, but I think that is what made it great! The setting was the same, but if you wanted to see a replication of the game, then replay the game. That's my opinion. I believe that adding different characters was a very good idea. The best part is that they added the dogs and the licker. I can't wait to see part two now!!!! Resident Evil was really matched with the game.

The first time I herd this film was going to happen i was Extactic I thought that this was going to be a film based on the game.The computer game holds a simple story which leaves you guessing what has happened, This film doesn't keep you guessing you can almost tell who is going to die and what is going to happen that a virus has spread through the facility and these people who go in are heading for trouble, which can somebody tell me how the hell they could of built that under a city. This film is all over the place If a was directing this movie a would of shot everything again or scrapped the project all together.

901,lpdream,Really a good film besides the video game,8,11 March 2005,This title is very good and the scenes are very real. I like it besides the fact that the video game are much better. When i see it i really scare about the zombies and the evil present in the dark ambient of Raccoon City and The Hive. If you like the video game you perhaps disappointing a little seeing the movie but... this is not enough to call the film as horrible. The story is not all bad and the spirit of the game was catched by the director. Maybe a little more stars at the roster and a little more look in the direction of the real history and then ....eureka! one of the greatest movies ever made was the result. Truly impressive the beginning and the end. Definitely a very entertaining movie and a wise choice.,Resident Evil
902,campdavid_,"Pure, unfettered, sh*t",1,4 March 2005,"This movie was terrible by any standards. As a stand alone film it just lacks any dramatic tension or suspense. As a film of the game it doesn't work on practically any level. It has a completely different atmosphere, cast of characters and plot to the game. With most computer games you might think that this is acceptable, but resident evil was so great because it actually had a good plot and atmosphere, it was a pastiche of zombie horror movies such as dawn of the dead and evil dead (old mansion out in the woods). This movie has none of the values of the original games or movies, its a true popcorn movie, by the end you feel like you have eaten so much rubbish that your burps smell funny and you feel like you are going to be sick.

Marilyn Manson's score is simply the best score ever and will keep you glued to your seat looking sideways and feeling your heart beat race. I understand the fans of the video game mostly don't like this movie but I guess they failed to realize that the story of this movie is about how the accident that caused the infestation of zombies happened, it's a PRE-QUEL to the first Resident Evil game. The director actually took the time to explain (commentaries on the DVD) about how he came up with this movie's story - as he did do this movie because he was a fan of the video game in the first place. Also keep in mind that as a movie maker, he couldn't make a movie exclusively for the fans of the game and I guess all are forced to agree that if he did a movie intended exclusively for the game players that would really limit the audience - and I am betting that if any of the hard critics of this movie where to make one, they would end up also realizing there is no way one can make a movie to such restricted audience. I sure hope Paul W. S. Anderson is coming up with lots of sequels to this movie. With that said, sit back (if you can) and enjoy this wonderful movie.",Resident Evil

Then again I am not a very big game freak, but still. The movie was one of the most interesting I've seen. yet the film maker seemed to think it was a good idea to have Alice in a tight red dress all the way through.... it was very strange, but I should say I would admire anybody who could stand wearing that dress and those shoes and still kick those zombies ass. :) I hope they make a resident evil three in fact! =)",Resident Evil

906,fallout2029,"Horrible, absolutely horrendous.",1,29 September 2012,"I'm embarrassed that people liked this film. The success of this disgustingly bad franchise really symbolizes cultural decay and the triumph of the room temperature IQ movie goer.Paul Anderson threatens audience with a sequel at the end of this film and follows through...with 4 of them.There is a lot wrong with this film, I don't even know where to begin. Paul Anderson took the original Resident Evil story line and concepts and totally butchered them.There's the premise of ""well why tell the RE story."" Well why the F*CK call it resident evil if your going to butcher the classic story line? Why not call it something appropriately stupid like ""Paul Anderson's Death Metal and Machine guns House of the undead""?How about when they remade godzilla they made it a movie about killer clowns from the evil giant dinosaur planet or something completely irrelevant/ridiculous and been like ""Oh well we didn't want to just re- tell the original godzilla story line.""You can follow through with the original story, and build on it. Hone, out make it better, add more back story to characters, add side story and remain true to the original story without completely mangling it.There's no character development. Actor dialogue consists of commands, exclamations. I was actually glad when they were systematically/predictable killed off. No depth, Anderson cops out by giving the main character amnesia and a 2 minute filler explanation by the Umbrella team comander. Figuring well hey if I just get milla to flash her tits and pull her dress up a little, I can out of having to write a script that contains any substance and just blare death metal to machine gun fire and call the movie a hit.You could literally play the scenes in any order in this movie and it'd make no difference. Go into room A- shoot zombies with machines guns Room B- Karate chop kung fu kick zombies Room C- get killed by evil computer-The fight sequences were stupid, exaggerated and unrealistic. Alice Matrix kicks a dog, kung fu punches a zombie and snaps a zombie's neck with her thighs at blaring sound of death rock metal. -Machine guns that do not need to be aimed, and apparently never run out of bullets.If you're shot with a machine gun in this movie you go airborne like superman, so yeah, it's one of those movies. -The virus escapes from an AIRTIGHT room where people are wearing bio- suits connected to hoses to even enter.....through an air vent.The game story line was actually survival horror and unfolded the story line in suspenseful way. Characters have limited ammunition, and focus mainly on uncovering umbrella plot while developing a deep back story. We gain insight into who these individuals were and what they were doing while developing this virus which turned them into zombies. While doing so, they are separated from each other a extremely low on ammunition and simply trying to make it out the mansion alive.Paul W.S. Anderson's version is essentially a group of people with machine guns blasting, matrix kicking, kung fu punching their way through ""the hive"" to the sound of heavy metal death rock and occasionally inserts a snippet from the original concept as if to remind you what could have been.",Resident Evil
907,gingygamerrocker,It would of been so much better if it followed the game,2,1 August 2005,"Think about it. Wasn't this movie supposed to be scary? The mansion was scary and Jill, Chris, Barry, and Wesker would have been prefect characters. Instead of the big, tough, stupid military losers. Resident Evil is about puzzles, traps, less zombies, and big monsters. Not hot girls, big guns, and loads of action. I still enjoyed this movie a little bit but its not Resident Evil. It would of great to see the big snake, the hunters,the tyrant, and the original characters. And the story would have been much better. The acting wasn't that great. The editing was horrible. I still had a little bit of fun with action scenes but with all the monsters looking as cheap as they did it took me out of the experience.",Resident Evil

Deep and well build characters, stunning action and a script worthy of the video games. It's a perfect mix of personal drama between the main characters and the horror that awaits them in the underground complex they must investigate. The movie starts nice and quiet but after 10 minutes the roller-coaster ride starts and it lasts till the very end of the movie. Even though the movie is almost perfect it does have a few flaws, like the lack of blood and the amount of naked girls you'd expect from a horror movie involving undeads. Despite these flaws Anderson delivers a masterpiece to the masses and if you like this you'll love Resident Evil 2. A definite 10 !",Resident Evil

I would like to encourage the actors, directors, writers everybody who had anything to do with this film to keep up the good work. I think the Resident Evil After life is in pre-production. Oh... And if Milla will ever read this comment. Your great, love you! You look good, act good, a fantastic woman. I can also speak Serbian, so if you will ever read this mail I would like to talk with you, just to ask how did you manage to succeed in your life.

911,the_heart_breaker_kid,Resident Evil...Coulda been Better,6,1 September 2005,"The thing that killed me the most about this movie was how it strayed so far away from the foundation. It stroke no resemblance to the game at all, except they used Umbrella, Raccoon City, and the T-Virus. Nothing else. If this movie could ever be remade, it would be a hell of a lot better if it was about the game, because that is what brought the Resident Evil franchise so much fame. But anyways, given that the movie wasn't like the game, it was still a pretty solid action movie. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez made pretty well with what they had to work with. However, some things still felt unrealistic and very campy. I mean, I don't mind seeing some girl kick the crap out of mutant dogs, but could that really happen? Also, could a group of elite soldiers become zombie food that easily? I mean come on, use your head. If a zombie is WALKING towards you, are you gonna sit back and let it bite you? It feels that it was rushed too much through production, but people really don't have high expectations for games-turned movies (Street Fighter...Good lord).

I was in the military for 12 years and ""One"" reminded me of so many team leaders, he was outstanding. Me and some of the other guys always complained why so many zombie flicks never had anybody well equipped for battling those gruesome beasties, well we finally got it and it was friggin great. I thought the reactions of the characters was on point, and for once, and this was the best part, they were actually thinking on how to get out, instead of just panicking and laying down to die. I have no problem with the movie being different from the game, I really didn't want to know what was going to happen next, and if they had just followed the game, well, how dull that would have been? All in all, this movie makes you want to lock n load your M4 and go zombie hunting. Now my only problem, the computer mis-identified weapons, sorry, i was an armorer and notice things like that, and their ammunition load was totally inadequate for any situation when you are operating with no hope of support. Besides that, loved the action and suspense, and totally loved Milla! Keep your powder dry guys! Good hunting.",Resident Evil
913,aa_2ntbaxxc,Resident Evil: The Movie is just a waste of what could have been a great adaption if stayed true to plot of the original game,1,16 September 2005,"This movie is pathetic. Anderson has bought to life a boring, stereotypical 'blockbuster' type film which is an insult to the original games. Being a huge fan of the games, by the way, dating back to 1996 when it was first released, I know what I'm talking about. In this film, Anderson has developed his own ideas into the world of Resident Evil and created what's known as 'The Hive'; a 'never heard of before' top secret laboratory located in a beehive-like facility under Racoon City. First off, I must admit, that the beginning of the film is impressive - with the suspenseful clip of the virus being handled by a white suited scientist provoking fear and excitement. Also the introduction of the 'Umbrella'Corporation is pretty interesting. The whole idea could've worked, I suppose, if Anderson had made the trademark zombies look moreterrifying than just using extras with bluish coloured skin and tomato sauce slathered across their face, uttering 'Ohhh, Ahhh' and walking like they're either elderly or disabled. The 'Licker' in this movie looks like a bloody cartoon! I almost laughed at the image of it eating that dude on camera, it looked ridiculous. Also, Anderson used what looked like Dobermans' covered in a layer of barbecue sauce to portray the 'Cerberus'; which again, I laughed at when I saw it at the cinema. There's not even mention of a Tyrant in this film, which is again, a total disappointment, as Tyrant's are the the ultimate enemy in each and every Resident Evil game. Anderson should have based this film upon the original video game. Somewhere dark, haunted, in an old mansion. He should have used zombies that looked like decomposing corpses, which sound like a bag of crushing bones with each step they take, instead of stupid people with blue makeup running around sounding as though they're having an orgasm. Characters from the video games would have also been nice in this film, however Anderson, in his own little stupid world, creates 'Alice' and a bunch of commandos who invade 'The Hive' and then just try and escape again. In conclusion, I'd like to state that I truly believe this film (and later its sequel Apocalypse) could have been a lot more successful in they stayed true to original plots of the first and second games. I would have enjoyed to see that Spencer mansion explored much better than the Hive, and would have been more excited and scared by watching zombies that actually look dead and that are frightening. I don't think it was necessary for Anderson to make this into another stereotyped blockbuster film, as it already had an incredibly strong fan base and would have become a cult classic if it told the story of Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield's survival within the Spencer Mansion in Resident Evil 1. I wouldn't recommend it to any one who is a fan of the games as it's insulting and you'll only end up being frustrated at Anderson's lack of respect to the games' honour.",Resident Evil
914,Curmudgeon76,O.K. at Best...,6,22 October 2005,"I am going to keep this short and sweet, and without spoilers.The video game, Resident Evil, changed my life. It was the first video game that I had ever played that brought the experience of ""living a horror movie"" home on my Playstation. The game is exciting, dark, unnerving, original, and generates incredible atmosphere with it's blend of sound effects, eerie music, engaging storyline and characters, and innovative game play. The game succeeds in every way, and this movie fails in every attempt it makes to recreate the experience.The movie retains about 30% of the original premise of the video game, and fills the void with a bunch of characters, events and locations that have nothing to do with, and never appeared in, any of the games. This is pretty much ""Resident Evil"" in name only: there are a few monsters that appeared in the game, and the film merges some of the aspects of the Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 games.The sequels in the Resident Evil video game series that followed, and continue to follow, range from fantastic to mediocre, but ALL of them are better than this movie.First of all, I agree with my brother when he says that ""Anderson is a hack"". If you need proof of that fact that Anderson is NOT a good director, just observe how can take wonderful, engaging stories and turn them into lifeless, generic, Hollywood-friendly steaming piles of crap that he can peddle to the masses who need only a an action-packed, brainless film to lure them, salivating, to the box office.If you are a huge fan of the games, and have followed their story lines closely, you will most likely HATE what Anderson has done to this series. As it stands by itself, this movie is OK at best. As a part of the Resident Evil phenomenon, it's pretty much just crap.",Resident Evil

It isn't even a character of any from the games! what is she and the other crappy team doing in a film based on the game? and the licker? common, he is so unrealistic. the game contains a creature, sneaky and deadly and silent. the Anderson made it a giant, growing monster wit a long tongue. the script was : Let's put some elements from the game in it, put bad music in it and ... ow yes, let's put lots of zombies in it, because... aren't there zombies in the game? Anderson didn't play the game I think.If you haven't play the game, I think this is a very amusing film with good horror scenes in it, a beautiful actress (why does she show her boobs? to get more viewers? crap!!) and some good action scenes.Conclusion: If you are a fan of the games, do not view the film. if you aren't a fan, please, go ahead and amuse yourselfNils",Resident Evil

I suppose if you'd never seen a zombie movie before, this might offer some surprises, but even by the logically-challenged conventions of the genre, it's hard to take seriously.Mysterious mega-corporation that has 90% penetration into the consumer marketplace but nevertheless relies on military research for its income invents death-reversing virus that defies basic physics in lab run by AI computer that somehow manages to be HAL 9000 and Forest Gump simultaneously.

However to my surprise I really liked it.Yes the zombies still walk round at a snails pace and have the brain of goldfish, but the fact that crew are confined underground means that they simply can't just run away. Which is what I have always thought when I have watched other zombie films. To add to this you have the whole world off genetic engineering thrown in. So instead of just blood thirsty zombie's you also have the added bonus of some very nasty man made creature's.Therefore overall I would say that providing you are not expecting a carbon copy of the computer game, Resident Evil is an good choice if you enjoy the thrill of the creepy horror movie.",Resident Evil

The game itself has a pretty decent plot, not to mention the game play keeps you interested and coming back for more. The movie does NOT fall short of entertaining those of us that love the game - and even some that have never played the game but understand that it is based on one. The star of the movie, Alice, played by Mila Jovavich, is a phenomenal character. Not only is she sexy as hell, she can kick ass better than most male characters in zombie movies I've seen! And she only gets better and better as the movie progresses. The plot outline makes sense and you'll find yourself rooting for Alice as she blows zombie after bloody zombie to pieces. As far as the gore factor goes - its there. IF your wanting a 'suspense' movie - I'd say look elsewhere. This is definitely more on the side of a gore action zombie flick. Not only will you have the pleasure of watching the zombies die a million deaths - we also get to see members of the crew die in many creative ways....just to mention - one of the crew gets sliced into a million pieces by a laser net down in the pits of the Umbrella Corp. This flick is NOT only for teenage boys and male adult equals as some would say....this movie is for those that appreciate a good gore action flick with a sexy heroine!",Resident Evil
920,hootenleehay,Resident Evil,3,26 March 2006,"This movie was awful. Paul Anderson took an amazing storyline from an awesome game, and did what ever the heck he wanted with it. In the first Resident Evil game you have an option of choosing Chris or Jill to play with in the beginning, not Alice. The game contains great music and a brilliant storyline. The only downfall of the game is the not so good dialog. I would have much rather had the movie follow the game exactly even if the dialog was mediocre. The movie would have been much much better if they had followed the game. Every person I have talked to about the game loves the game, but when I ask the about the movie they say it sucks. I hate how this movie starts out. She wakes up in the mansion in the movie, in the game, she is running from hell hounds and seeks refuge in the mansion. Alice, then goes out of the mansion into the hive, which is underground. Cool new idea, NOT! Alice starred in the fifth element before this. She gives no element of surprise in this movie. Zonbies are cheesy, no good storyline, a bunch of new retarded characters, and a horrible director. I am sorry to all the Resident Evil fans for the existence of Paul Anderson.",Resident Evil
