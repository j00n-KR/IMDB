0,SAMTHEBESTEST,Shershaah leaves you in tears as well as celebrates hardcore patriotism with commercialized jingoism in War Drama.,6,12 August 2021,"Shershaah (2021) :
Movie Review -War Drama is one of the biggest genre in World cinema since last 100 years or maybe more. Hollywood celebrated this genre like no one else with World War 1 and & World War 2 subjects whereas foreign language cinema focused more on the realistic effects and horrors of the same. In Bollywood, 'Haqeeqat' set a benchmark which hasn't been crossed yet by any other film and for the commercial and massy elements 'Border' became a landmark. Even Border had that unrealistic jingoism but for 90s audience it was overwhelming stuff and the film still enjoys a cult following in TV audience. Recently, the biggest thing came in this genre was 'Uri : The Surgical Strike' which wasn't a great film at all but the timing was so accurate that people just went for it without thinking about anything. Those actual events happened around its release left people with anger and the outburst was already captured by the film hence the box office numbers surpassed all expectations. Shershaah is as good as Uri, so yes it also repeated the same mistakes but again, the same commercialized outlook has saved the film. A shocking thing about Shershaah is, it's extremely emotional film in those last 10 minutes which leaves everyone with teary eyes.Tracing the life journey of Param Vir Chakra awardee and army captain Vikram Batra, it stars Sidharth Malhotra in a double role, as Batra and his identical twin brother Vishal, while Kiara Advani plays the role of Vikram's girlfriend Dimple Cheema. The film does not have any defaming material as we have seen in few films recently and that's why the clean image of army and soldiers fills your chest with pride. Having a burden of relating to biographical genre, the film struggles to establish few important things and in between the love story and the songs do irritate a little bit. Thankfully, that's not too irritating so one can easily pass those moments to enjoy some great moments later.Performance of Sidharth Malhotra is the best we have seen so far. Actually, this is his only 2nd or 3rd acting oriented role while other times he was busy playing a cool, funky guy and here he gets that potential role to showcase different side of his talent. Kiara Advani is more of a powdered doll and if you exclude songs then Shershaah is like a cameo role for her. The Army gang is decent, nothing great which includes Nikitin Dheer, Shiv Pandit and Himmanshoo Malhotra in major roles. Music is fine despite having a misjudged timing in the screenplay. Editing and VFX are okay, though, more accuracy would have been better. Shershaah never bores you because it's a pacy film, the credit should go to the well written screenplay.War Genre is an open genre, it does not limit you with anything so it can be used for anything you want. Hollywood used it for patriotic films, for musicals, for biographicals, for controversial films, for hard-hitting dramas and for sensational theories. Even recently Hollywood made Masterpiece films like 'The Hacksaw Ridge' and '1917'. Well, Bollywood is far behind. When Hollywood made a film like 'Patton', Bollywood was not even making mainstream war films and what a freaking amazing classic Patton was and is even today. That high-quality filmmaking is missing now days and for bollywood it's like, almost 50 years ahead from Today. We can be happy with films like Uri and Shershaah as our masses and TV audience would never complain about it so Yes, Shershaah is definitely watchable. Director Vishnuvardhan has certainly made a watchable film. But never forget that the potential for Biographical-War drama is always unlimited, and like I said not every film can be 'Patton'. So, overall Shershaah has everything one can expect from a commercial patriotic drama and i strongly believe that it deserved to be viewed on big screen.RATING - 6.5/10*",Shershaah
1,shakercoola,Patriotic war melodrama lacks nuance,5,25 September 2021,"An Indian Hindi war biopic drama; A story about the life of Indian Army officer Vikram Batra, awarded for valour for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War, an armed conflict fought between India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir. The film outlines the affable and brave life of the soldier and pays homage to the hundreds of lives lost in Operation Vijay. However, it channels patriotism that limits the film's dramatic reach. The writer pounds the audience with dialogue about hero status when showing them would have sufficed. The surplus of scenes showing Batra facing ordnance and enemy fire forced spectacle to be the casualty. There are moving moments though, and nicely captured humour too, albethey confined to romantic interludes in Batra's civilian life. As for the war itself, there are some beautifully photographed landscapes and the action set-pieces are well choreographed in foreground. All in all, the film is watchable, flourishing in parts and the performances are all very good, but the direction is uneven.",Shershaah
2,ketgup83,Every Indian Should Watch Brave Story Of Vikram Batra Brilliantly Portrayed By Sidharth Malhotra,8,12 August 2021,"When ever there is a war, natural calamity or a terrorist attack, the first people to come out and protect is Indian Army, who selflessly support us with their act of bravery. With never-ending tension going between India and Pakistan, so many sacrifices are being made by our Indian soldiers whose duty is to save the citizen from the scum of the Earth. To honor the soldiers who have laid down their lives to serve the country, there are few movies being made to tell the stories of gallantry. One such movie is on the Vikram Batra biopic drama, Shershaah, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani.Shershaah chronicles the life and story of the brave soldiers Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra) who led a very difficult operation in Kargil War against Pakistan and even managed to pull down the enemy soldiers in hand combat, ensuring a solid victory for our motherland.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right from the beginning till the electrifying climax. The powerful true story of Vikram Batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed and struggled to ensure that safety of Indian citizen is their top most priority, The makers have done a fabulous job in portraying the stress, blood and sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers. Couple of scenes did caught my attention - Pakistani missiles hitting the Indian base in a surprise attack, the action scene at the police check point and last but not the least, the final showdown - which is the climax scene showing the ultimate sacrifice by Vikram Batra when he exposes himself to the enemy fire trying to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot. We get to see the real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought for their country, sacrificed their family and could not even return back to their motherland. Thanks to films like Shershaah speaks the true events of making of a soldier and the hardship and struggle these war machines go through.The initial reels had romantic track showing how Vikram Batra meets his fiancee Dimple hampers the momentum of the biopic drama, though the chemistry between Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani is sparkling. Also, it is high time, Bollywood can start making biopics without songs and melodrama which sometimes play the spoilsports. Nevertheless, writing by Sandeep Shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded. Technically, Shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is mind-blowing while background score creates more tensionTalking about performance, Sidharth Malhotra essays the role of Vikram Batra with T. The actor successfully shows diverse expressions of Vikram Batra right from the beginning when he joins the Indian Army as a rookie to the gallant soldier who fights for his country till his last breath. Shershaah might be a turning point in Sidharth Malhotra's career who comes up with a brave performance. In the supporting role, Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Nikitin Dheer have acted their part with equal justice.So overall, Shershaah is a spellbinding tale of a brave soldier which should be lauded and appreciated for its genuine attempt. Very good 3.5/5.",Shershaah
3,MuviFan73,A nice movie on someone who has Param Veer Chakra!,8,12 August 2021,"Story: It's Vikram Batra's Biopic, his wish to be in army right from his childhood, his love life, his life among friends and family, his life as an army lieutenant. Apart from that it's shown how he is a pioneer in catching terrorist Haider and finally what role he plays in gaining back control over Mount Kargil.Cinematography: Justified. The family, the friends, the residence, the mounts, the base, the flowing water, the gurudwara, etc add to the viewing experience.Direction: Justified. The character of Vikram is shown playful. If that's true Director has done good job in portraying it. If not it makes me uneasy.Acting (& music): Acting is average. The music goes well along with the movie. The songs are well above average. You will find couple of them among your favorites.Final Verdict: When Dharma productions put their sweat into something, things turn out mostly well.The result is entertaining. Same being why you would choose 'Shershaah' over 'State of Seige: Temple Attack'. To be peculiar, when just motion picture is considered over brand of content.The movie is nice, do watch it, if you have time.",Shershaah
4,nadkarnisumeet,Durge Maa Ki Jai!!,8,13 August 2021,"Shershaah review :After watching Karan Johar's Student of the Year (2012), I had put my bets on Sidharth Malhotra over the other two debutants. Later, Varun and Alia raced ahead with successful films while the Malhotra dude lagged behind. With Karan Johar's latest production Shershaah which released on Amazon Prime on Friday, Sidharth proves his mettle as a fine actor who can shine under the right script and a competent director.A biopic on Param Veer Chakra awardee Kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra, Shershaah has some awe-inspiring battle sequences giving you a feel of actually being right there with our Indian Army jawaans as they take on the Pakistani infiltration of 1999. The technical aspects are first rate, the background score perfectly suits the context and the presentation consciously avoids unnecessary jingoism. Director Vishnuvardhan makes a super Bollywood debut and full credit to him for making a touching film which will make your eyes moist in the end.The performances are top class - Sidharth delivers his career best as Capt. Batra. Kiara Advani is earnest playing his lady love. Nikitin Dheer looks convincing as Capt. Batra's senior. So does Shiv Pandit. As the end credits roll, we get to see all the real life heroes of the war and it is then you realise how the actors playing them on screen are perfectly cast in these roles.Shershaah deserved a theatrical release but has made it to OTT in these covid times. I recommend a watch with family and friends. The film is truly inspiring and makes you feel proud of our army bravehearts for whom India is above their own life. Durge Maa Ki Jai!!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Shershaah
5,katyayan-12892,Shershah,8,31 August 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe film Shershaah is based on the real life story of Captain Vikram Batra. He was an officer of the Indian Army, who got posthumously awarded with the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest and most prestigious award for valour, for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.It's not just a typical war movie but is a life story of a national hero. This movie showed different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He was more than a war hero. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Climax had me in tears. The love story was unique and beyond expectations. Really felt a big respect of Dimple mam.Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed.Surely his best performance so far.Acting out a real life character is not an easy task.Talking about Kiara Advani, Kiara has done a good job and I am quite impressed with her accent particularly the Punjabi speaking skills she has shown in the film. Worth taking a note of it.Lastly I would say, you can watch this film more than once. So good is the film. I would also thank the makers for displaying photos and names of the original war heroes in the end part of the film. These army men deserve their glory and honor. We are all proud of them.",Shershaah
6,SoumikBanerjee25,Yeh Dil Maange More!,8,14 August 2021,"""Yeh Dil Maange More""Movies on Nationalism are often castigated for their commonly seen melodramatic appearance or the redundancy in the specific pattern they tend to follow. For a film that appertains to Bollywood's mainstream lineup; Shershaah is comparatively more grounded and respectful of the source material!Technical competencies aside, the Director (Vishnuvardhan) ensured that the film stays on the path of verisimilitude. Regardless, it gets ever so slightly exaggerated at certain points but for the most part; Vishnuvardhan's vision has been hell-bent on doing it in the most believable way possible.Sticking with my earlier statement, I find the technical sides to be pretty darn impressive. Given the fact that it is coming from Bollywood (They don't have as much budget as Hollywood or other foreign film industries); Got to admit, I was stupefied just looking at all those expertly choreographed combats, further intensified by an incredible Score that truly elevated the anxiety as well as the fervor in a few.Moving forward to the Performances...Since the day of the announcement; fans were eager to witness Siddharth Malhotra as Capt. Vikram Batra. Needless to say, he seized this opportunity and rose to the occasion! I firmly believe that this would be remembered as one of Siddharth's career highlights. On the other end, despite having a somewhat less important, short-lived role; Kiara Advani played her part with complete dedication and full commitment. Not to mention, the great chemistry these two seem to share.I see some reviewers are arguing about the Non-War segments; especially referring to the Love Story. I think they are completely missing the point. This isn't a film about Kargil War or Operation Vijay, it is utterly dedicated to Captain Vikram Batra's courageous feats. It was rather a necessity to rightly establish Batra's personal life so that we as the audience could connect to him at a more personal level.And I have to say, they did very well in that regard!Before I conclude, I would like to pay my respects to all the Soldiers, Army Personnel who have sacrificed their lives just to keep us safe. They do all that is necessary for the sake of protecting our beloved country from the enemy forces. I, as a responsible citizen of India, couldn't be more proud of them.Thank you for your service!",Shershaah
7,ridi-arahan,Maybe sometimes we don't just die especially when we truely live by our values and believes,9,16 August 2021,"What worked:
So what makes the movie a very enjoyable watch is the narrative that flows smoothly, with layers of the tales of the main character, not just as a movie making scenes but as a very fine well of storytelling. So I would say the director,editor and the screenplay writer deserve an applause for their extra hardworks that's visible in the narrative. I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography and the score of the movie, such a nice treat. Personally, I am happy for Siddharth for this opportunity to explore his craft and proving that he has lot more to provide as an actor. I have always loved him and so maybe my regards for him might have been subjective but still the movie left a mark for him. The supporting casts are good in their roles. Overall, a fine movie that hits the right node as a Bollywood entertainer. It's always a pleasure to see the real footage and the people that the movie bases on so it was an appreciative tribute to the real heroes. Even as a non Indian movie lover, I approve the message that the movie hits its audience in right sentimental values
What did not work:
Maybe I would have been happier if the movie had paused on the main character's introspection, his vulnerabilities, his moments at the camp or the training scenes so that we could gather more depth of his principles and his way of life as an army. Just an open suggestion.Final verdict: highly recommended. I would have been happier for Siddharth if the movie was released on theaters because it would have definitely banked some long term investment for him.",Shershaah
8,dy38493,Great movie to watch,8,12 August 2021,Good movie to watch for especially the war and super VFX scenes the movie has been brilliant shot the movie has got some good war drama.,Shershaah
9,waqassaleem-85201,Wow,9,23 August 2021,So much better than I thought i my would be. I knew siddharth malhotra would be good in this and he proved it. The music is absolutely outstanding. The direction and visuals are also amazing. I don't usually cry in movies but in the end I felt the tears coming. A must watch.,Shershaah
10,vjnambu,Sid's career defining film,10,24 August 2021,"I like sidharth malhotra personally since ek villain and truly wanted him to rise in Bollywood. While varun and alia(with whom he debuted) became superstars with various critically acclaimed and commercial blockbusters, sid still remained struggling to find his place. Though he was versatile in film selection, he never got any role where he could prove his talent or charisma. But with shershaah, he showed that both.Shershaah is a biopic of PVC kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra. Well, captain batra was already portrayed by abhishek bachchan in loc kargil, but here we get to know his life and career in detail. Film portrays the rise of captain batra in the Indian army and his contribution and ultimate sacrifice in the kargil war. Also, it showcases his love story with dimple cheema.What I liked the most about shershaah was its minimal tone of jingoism and patriotism. Its not overdone like those jp dutta war films. I liked its first half more than the second half because it was the right mixture of fun, romance, emotion, action and thrill. The love story of vikram and dimple was decent. War sequences were pretty good.Coming to performances, sidharth malhotra gave a sincere performance as Vikram Batra. For the first time, I saw his charisma on screen, thanks to vikram batra's heroic personality. He easily got into the skin of the character. Kiara advani also gave a very memorable performance as dimple and both sid and kiara's chemistry was good. Rest of the supporting actors had small roles and they did it well. Tamil director vishnuvardhan's direction is good.On the whole, shershaah is one of the best biopics which ever came in Bollywood. Its not only relief for sidharth malhotra but also for karan johar and dharma productions who received lot of flak last year.",Shershaah
11,tushargupta-27286,Patriotic,10,26 October 2021,Shershaah movie is totally awesome and amazing concept .I love patriotic movie and interesting story overall movie is totally nice must watch this . I give full 10 🌟,Shershaah
12,msunando,About a brilliant life and a tale of national pride,9,12 August 2021,"""Shershaah"" (for the uninitiated, it is the codename for Captain Vikram Batra of the Indian Armed Forces, who led his unit to thwart the Pakistani army infiltration in Kargil) is a remarkable film that ticks all the boxes. It keeps the viewer glued to the screen, runs focused and taut, is an edge of the seat thriller with excellent production values, and is supplanted on a mammoth commercial scale. It is sleek, boasts of superlative editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi, music by Y. S. Raja, and of some spectacular VFX by a team that should easily qualify for top awards. Shershaah, helmed by Vishnuvardhan is undoubtedly a film that's out to grab a whole lot of attention, admiration, accolades and leaves a strong imprint on the hearts and minds about the life of a fearless and exemplary individual.Shershaah achieves a lot more than just that. It doesn't waste time on gimmicks like Pakistan-bashing and remains steady on the biopic of Captain Vikram Batra, its key objective. It has an understated glamour keeping in tune with the protagonist's background, education, family, love life and his one dimensional determination to achieve his objective. It races down to the finishing line at an admirable speed, that left me at least with a an emotion of ""yeh dil maange more""! Shershaah could play for a few minutes more, and I wouldn't complain.Siddharth Malhotra comes to life with perhaps what I would label as his best performance. He is uninhibited, impulsive, expressive in an understated manner and immensely likeable. I am certain that Captain Vikram Batra would have been proud and happy to see that Siddharth Malhotra has done justice. Shataf Figar as Col. Y. K. Joshi adds gravitas and is impressive as the officer who had faith in Batra, allowing him to lead a strategic fightback to retrieve lost ground. Kiara Advani has a brief role but is delightful. Shiv Panditt, Raj Arjun, Nikitin Dheer and Pawan Chopra are great support. In the end, Shershaah leaves you teary eyed and emotional, filled with passion, stirring up patriotism and a renewed appreciation for the armed forces. Don't miss Shershaah, it's perhaps the best film of the year.",Shershaah
13,aastikhimta,Go for it,9,22 August 2021,It was really an emotional biopic . A great story with lots of emotions and heartbreaks. Salute to a great hero of this nation. Jai Hind!,Shershaah
14,ragingbull_2005,Brilliant. The best thing to see this I-day,7,15 August 2021,Quite a visceral viewing experience. Unexpected. My world view before this was that everything with Siddharth Malhotra in it must be in the nether regions on the scale of quality cinema. That has gone a quantum change after watching this.It is well made and sincere. The characters are appealing. The war scenes are shot well. Liked the acting and the editing.Wish there was a way the ending could have been different.,Shershaah
15,shovonbhattachrjee,Best Movie of This year,10,12 August 2021,"This movie is based on a real event, the way of presenting this movie is just amazing. The recreate of the real story is just amazing. Acting is just superb. Must watch Movie 🎥.",Shershaah
16,MandalBros-5,A MUST MUST WATCH For everyone.,10,12 August 2021,"This is the best bollywood film not just of this year but in the last few years. It basically focuses on the war moments because there are 6 action sequences which have been choreographed with perfection. The movie is very engaging, you can't skip a moment even the romantic ones because it was beautiful and so the songs.Undoubtedly, this is the best performance of Sidharth Malhotra till now. The film is full of spirit. There is no showing of forceful patriotism which was all over there in Bhuj trailer. After a long time I watched a movie that completely dried my throat.A Must Must Watch for everyone to understand what our army going through everyday in the field.Available on Amazon Prime Video.© MandalBros.",Shershaah
17,pranayjalvi,For the brave soldiers of Kargil War 1999,8,12 August 2021,"After a quite some time (to be precise, after URI), I have seen a film well made based on one of the prominent personalities in Kargil War.Shershah was well casted, well acted and directed movie with Siddharth helming the character true to it's nature. The pacing was a bit fast. At just 135 minutes, I felt that the movie could have displayed the heroics a bit more if the runtime was 30-40 minutes more. But nonetheless, this film was totally amazing, and yes, do not miss the end credits of our real life Shershah.JAI HIND🇮🇳My Rating : 8/10.",Shershaah

19,nidhunmoviebuff,A tribute film deserving of the great war hero Captain Batra!,8,13 August 2021,"When the movie is based a real life Kargil war hero like Captain Vikram Batra, there was no room for error for makers Karan Johar and Vishnu Varadhan. And thankfully, they have made a superb film that will really resonate with audiences and pay due homage to the Param Veer Chakra awardee.Siddharth Malhotra's limited acting chops is adeptly managed by the director by using body language and a fantastic supporting cast that includes the brilliant Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Raj Arjun.The iconic Barkha Dutt interview and the legendary 'Dil Maange More' catchphrase sequences are delivered with enough punch and verve to get your adrenaline pumping. This has to be the best Indian war movie yet in terms of production value with the high-elevation fight sequences shot with Hollywood-level panache.Director Vishnu Vardhan deftly switches between the soldier's life in the army and his budding romance with his college sweetheart, giving us a glimpse into both the warrior and the human side of the legendary war-hero.A special shout out is needed for the fantastic music and BGM from maestro Yuvan Shankar Raja that really elevates the narration, especially in the emotional sequences. The climax song will hardly leave a dry eye in the house.Captain Vikram Batra was a true braveheart and I am thankful that this is a tribute film deserving of the great man. Recommended!",Shershaah
20,gk303007,Worth a watch,9,15 August 2021,"Definitely it defied the totem of starcast to hit a movie; go and watch Bhuj and you would cry out your heart for its that pathetic. On the other hand, this movie had almost all the elements of a war/drama movie: environment builtup, cinematography, vfx, war scenes, a benign love story, good acting skills, and of course, screenplay. Amazing.",Shershaah
21,rahul000994,An Inspiring War Drama Of Braveheart's And Victories !!!,10,12 August 2021,"The Kargil War, 1999 - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC), disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause.But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. While this build-up depicts the character's journey, it doesn't do so very sharply to merit so much screentime. In fact, most of the times, Kiara Advani's track and the romantic songs featuring her, feel like a distraction from the heavy-duty subject at hand. This also impacts the pace of the film that suffers from a slow first half.Of course, director Vishnu Varadhan had a mammoth task of doing justice to the copious amounts of data and milestones from the Kargil war, but the bulk of it is dealt with, in the second half. Sidharth Malhotra shines in the war scenes and his performance evolves through the film. His earnest efforts to recreate the aura of his character's larger-than-life persona shows on screen and this is one of his better performances. Kiara Advani looks her part as a resolute Sardarni, who loves her man with all her heart. But she doesn't have much scope to perform.Shiv Panditt is very aptly cast as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal, who is tough on the outside, but emotional from within. Nikitin Dheer is impressive as the cheerful Major Ajay Singh Jasrotia and so is Shataf Figar as the straight talking Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi. Together, these men make for an able team that you will root for, at all times. Among the many other character actors, there are a few stereotypes and clichés too, especially on the Pakistani side.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks high than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax.",Shershaah
22,vinayshri,Amazing! Must watch!,9,4 September 2021,"A perfect tribute to the Captain Batra! Must watch. Some fake scenes were added though, it's not a complete and actual life story of Capt. Vikram batra. Still you can enjoy this. Thank you.",Shershaah
23,nikree,Better than URI,8,22 October 2021,"Hatred towards enemy (is not equals to) Love for country
URI was almost as fundamentalist as insurgent.Even they went to an extent to malign the whole country and the govt. There may could be some truth to it, but linear and black-and-white perspective never helps except polarizing people even more. And that is never a solution.URI disturbed me with it's army-mentality and millitary-bravado. Glamourizing wars!Because of all that, I was very hesitant to watch this movie.But Shershah has what URI lacked, i.e. EMPATHY and Heart.Also, I differ with people critiquing Kiara or her character for lacking depth. But I sincerely disagree. She has a character and a personality. She warns, disagrees, takes initiative and much more.Point being. This is a Vikram Batra movie, NO Character except the protagonist is given any extra screen time. The movie revolves around it.I respect and appreciate that the whole second half of the movie deals with the war only. But that half could've been better and felt underwhelming after the first half (jus too much firing and grenade).Of course, I could be biased here, as I'm anti-war. And also, battleground is serious business and not* supposed to be entertaining.Needless to say that, the music jus takes your heart away. And you'll keep humming it for days to come.Genuine doubt- why only Indians climbing the mountain are using grenade and cannon. Where as it's much convenient for the Pakistani who control the base from the top.",Shershaah
24,matrixdukenukem,Yeh dil still maange more :(,7,12 August 2021,"Something is missing here. I was so hyped up for this and Bhuj ever since it was announced. Biography on Cap. Vikram Batra? Come on. He is one of the if not the most popular heroes of Kargil war. This movie tries it's best but the unseasoned director and writer failed to rise to the epicness that Cap. Vikram Batra was.What lacks here is the thrill that was present in Uri or LOC Kargil. Despite knowing the outcome, if you're still able to keep your audience on edge of the seat ... That's film making. Though the action was shot beautifully, due to lack of character development the stakes feel so low because we know we have won.Thankfully cinematography keeps you hooked to the screen. Never have I seen beautiful but deadly valleys amd mountains of Kashmir captured so beautifully. I wish I could see this movie in theatre. Another thing this movie misses out is the sound design,which Uri excelled in. The background noise of war, bullets, explosions were very one dimensional.VFX was good but shabby in bullet wounds. Background score was underwhelming. Acting of leads and support cast was strictly okay. Sidharth Malhotra delivers his career best but not apt for the legend he is playing.I cried tears of pride and loss when I watched Uri, LoC Kargil ...even Border. While I came close I didn't feel as much as I did for those movies. Unfortunately I won't be rewatching this but I liked it for one time watch. Hope someone else will re do and do justice to the hero Cap. Vikram Batra was.",Shershaah
25,TreeFiddy53,"Good 1-time watch, but the real-life story - much respect!",8,15 August 2021,"I try to look at movies based on heroic true stories from two perspectives - the actual real-life story and the actual movie + the storytelling.The real-life story:
The tale of Captain Vikram Batra, his and his team's role in the Kargil War are very inspiring. Makes you take a step back from the ""busy life"" and appreciate the sacrifices that armed forces and their family members have made and continue to make. It's one thing to watch a movie and say that, and a totally different thing to live that life. Simpletons like us would never know what it actually feels like to be on the frontlines or in the shoes of their families.The movie + the storytelling:
My initial thoughts were that, AS A MOVIE, it was a tad too filmy, but after reading about Cpt. Batra, I understand why it was made this way. Turns out, his personality was filmy and a lot of the dialogues/quotes in the movie were actually stuff that he used to say. I don't think this should be watched like it's a war movie, but the movie about the life of a soldier. And I say that to tame your expectations because you might leave with the feeling of something missing/not satisfied.The Good:
The music was good, the I really liked the VFX - loved this one scene in which you get an aerial view of a missile being launched on to the ground, the visuals must have been hard work. Looks like they've also filmed parts of the movie in difficult terrain, so props for that. The acting was also well done by everyone.You can tell that you're watching a movie about the real-deal until the final few mins and the montage that was well done. It hits you like ""Damn, I can't imagine what it must be like!"". It serves as a good transition to some real-life footage.The Bad:
The language, the accent - the characters saying the first few words in Punjabi and then abruptly switching to proper Hindi for the rest of the scene was very distracting. I get that you can't make a Bollywood movie with proper Punjabi, but too often movies seem to have this issue and I wonder if the writers can help in fixing this?The dialogues between the Colonel and the Captain sounded weird. Compare this to the chemistry that Amitabh and Hrithik have in Lakshya and you'll get what I'm talking about. This actor made made the orders sound like he was asking for too much, vs Amitabh's dialogue delivery sounded more authentic.I also didn't like this one particular scene around the 1:57:30 mark, like ""Come on, movie makers! Really? You've got to make it filmy NOW?""
Overall:
The story and the storytelling take me back to Lakshya, and I wonder if that was ""inspired"" by the story of Shershaah along with a bunch of changes? And because of that, I am unable to like this movie as much as I'd want to.Overall, as a movie, this was a good one-time watch but the real-life story though, much respect! Shoutout to the Armed Forces!",Shershaah
26,madanmarwah,"Fit tribute to a brave Indian Army officer, Sidharth scores",8,16 August 2021,"This movie is a fitting tribute to a brave young Indian Army officer Captain Vikram Batra who had set high standards for sacrifice for the nation. Stories based on Army like this one will always have mass appeal if made well, as in this case.Fans of Sidharth Malhotra have reasons to celebrate because this is one of his finest performances and is easily the highlight of the movie. The scenes of his college life, his wooing of Kiara, and his interactions with his seniors/ colleagues are enacted well by him. Though a biopic with the customer stipulation that some real life incidents may have been modified for dramatic purposes, such variations are minimum because the inputs to the screenplay have come from living relations and Army officers who were close to Captain Vikram Batra. The movie is interesting and does not drag anywhere. The jingoism is kept under check.Since Vikram was a lively and humour loving lad, his character in the movie is sketched accordingly. This is in sharp contrast to a serious Army officer portrayed in "" Uri"". This is the different aspect of the film and director Vishnuvardhan needs to be complimented for making a likeable and realistic movie. The emotional scenes are sensitively handled. Is there an excess of war scenes.? Not exactly since the screenplay required it.",Shershaah
27,WorldMovie99,Only for the War sequences,5,1 September 2021,"Sometimes I think, from where does movies like SavingPrivateRyan or FullMetalJacket or Prahaar gets inspired from ? They are the war masterpieces. Indian movie mindset must understand that.Shershah is good only for the impressive war sequences. But not for the entirety. The story was good though but its presentation missed the depth. The loose grip includes the love story, the family issues, the emotions, the songs, the performances. The narration is immatured ignoring the depth of events, even the dialogues of the characters. The acting is attempted to be real but didn't went upto the mark. And the songs doesn't needed to be sentimental masala type. Only good portrayal is of the war scenes.The 10 raters are biased. They are not the real movie lovers and doesn't understand reality gripped movies. Also dear, try to understand the meaning of 10 out of 10 in IMDb.",Shershaah
28,mynameritesh,Commendable Story of Valour but execution is partly inspiring.,6,12 August 2021,"Shershaah is a commendable effort by Vishnu Vardhan and team to give a befitting tribute to one of India's Bravest Soldiers Captain Vikram Batra's sacrifice during the 1999 Kargil War, but to be honest, Shehshaah, though well-intended is still a pretty average final product which may not be that inspiring which it might have intended to be. Still, it packs some well-choreographed gunfire sequences, exhilarating action set pieces, catchy dialogues , a few soulful melodies and a solid, gritty comeback performance by Siddharth makes Shershaah a stream-worthy watch.Thoughts
Shershaah is average. A film dedicated to a braveheart of India and the intensity drastically keeps drifting due to the commercial elements and sometimes irrelevant conversations. As long as the film stays focused on relevant true facts it stays grounded and on top but when the commercial dramatization comes into play it shatters the screenplay. The film packs some beautiful songs, action set pieces in the second half is quite exhilarating and tension filled to watch too. A brilliant effort by Siddharth to regain his mane as a leading actor. Kiara has a limited but very impactful performance. She keeps improving every film. Nevertheless the commendable effort by the team to bring a much needed story is truly compelling and praiseworthy.",Shershaah
29,nitishkumarmohanta,Hmm! Probably it will SAVE Siddharth Malhotra's Bollywood Career!,6,17 October 2021,"After some serial of flop movies here Sid Malhotra did a Historic War based patriotic movie. And he did a good job here to be honest. The screenplay was good but direction was somehow mediocre. Music was the best part of this movie and of course War sequences were too good as well. Overall you can watch it with family, apart from 2 kisses and 2/3 mild offensive words everything was manageable to watch with whole family.",Shershaah

OTT - PrimeDurga Mata Ki Jai !!!Shershaah is undoubtfully a beautiful movie, a tribute to Kargil War veterans, not just Captain Vikram Batra, the whole 13 JAK RIF of Indian Army.Eventhough we learned about Vikram Batra through news, documentaries, this movie is totally serves as a good biopic of him.The movie takes us to the path of Captain Vikram Batra and his success stories of Battle point 5140 & 4875 , which sums up Operation VijayVishnuvardhan , gave us best commercial tamil and telugu flicks like Pattiyal, Billa, Sarvam, Panjaa, Aarrambam.After below average Yatchan, he took around 6 years gap to gave us his debut hindi movie Shershaah, which he done his best.Direction, VFX, Stunts been amazing.Sidhard Malhotra, tried his best to fit into the role, I wont say this has been the best cast selection, but somehow he didnt failed to make it to Captain Vikram Batra.Supporting actors did their role at finest. OST is beautiful, especially ending song.On the whole, it was meant to watch it in big screen, if it was in theatres, the feel would be much greater.A good tribute to the kargil war heros !8 out of 10

Director Vishnuvardhan has made it very perfect and realistic. The war seens give us goosebumps. Sidharth Malhotra has played this character so perfectly that it is impossible to imagine anyone else in his place. This is the best movie of his career till date. Every supporting cast did their role perfectly. This is a must watch movie for every Indians. Nobody can miss it. This is the biopic of Capt. Vikram Batra. We salute Vikram sir and all the Indian soldiers who take part in kargil war.",Shershaah
34,anikb-87099,A treat to watch!,9,12 August 2021,"First, do not compare this film to LOC KARGIL! This film only focuses on Capt. Vikram Batra's life and his heroics in the war whereas LOC KARGIL was made to focus more on the war and all its major soldiers in detail.Second, do not compare Sid's performance with that of Jr. AB from LOC KARGIL. Sid has given a terrific performance and so did AB Jr. Then. The difference is that in this film, Sid is in main focus whereas in the latter case, he wasn't the prime focus.Third, the VFX! Well executed VFX was always needed in a war film and the makers have done a commendable job in this field. The explosions look real, the fires look real but the only thing that bothered me was the wallpaper like background in the mountains.Fourth, the action! Well executed and keeps you engrossed in those final moments.Fifth, the romance! Dont complain as this is an integral part of Capt. VB's life and it was pretty decent.Sixth, the emotional connect with the other soldiers which i felt was missing a bit and this is where a slightly longer film would have helped.Lastly, the climax. Very Emotional as the B Praak song plays!",Shershaah

36,Prince-the-cat,Propaganda movie at its best,8,13 August 2021,"As a movie it was very good, action, emotion, Pakistan bashing which illetirate Indians love. The true cost of war was seen at the end, how the family and loved ones of the deceased suffer.The notion of war is an interesting premise for me, Corrupt Politicians inciting war for God knows what agenda and the brave soldiers of any country carry out their dirty work. This movie has been released just after USA leaves Afghanistan, they achieved nothing other than destroying lives, a country and its civilisation.Siddharth and Kiara acted very well, the movie is worth a watch.Anyone who believes the propoganda of war is a fool, India is notorious of hiding facts from it people, fact is a few points were captured, they took a beating and Pakistan was forced to retreat due to USA pressure on the corrupted PM Nawas Sharif at the time.",Shershaah
37,grarunkumar1994,Finally..!!,8,12 August 2021,"Indian film industry- Hindi, Tamil,Telugu, Malayalam- even having made a hundred war films, have always lagged behind in terms of the combat reality. 'URI' was an exception, but it had an artificial patriotism injected into it.Shershaah/Lion King has the authenticity of a biopic, devoid of fake Hindu-Muslim unity and artificial patriotism and ofcourse a world class making.Vishnuvaradhan who propelled Tamil actor Ajith into stardom with his 'Billa' a decade back recreated his magic of flawless story telling- with no unwanted sequences, even with a romatic side plot, this does keep the audience engaged with a very believable screenplay and a subtle yet strong patriotic feel. Doesn't matter the story arc, this must be how an army film is to be made.Siddharth Malhotra who came into the limelight a decade ago with Karan Johar's 'Student of The Year' failed to achieve stardom despite being talented and carrying his model looks. This film surely does justice in casting him and he did justice in depicting Captain Vikram Batra.The music score and VFX is by far the best in any Indian made army films. Pleasantly surprised how the film makers finally grew a brain to hire talent instead of cheap labour from south for stunt coordination.This film is good. May not be everyones cup of tea. But definitely a step ahead of any war films ever made in India.",Shershaah
38,nitsvirusboyz,Recommended 👍🏼 by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,7,12 August 2021,"Shershaah is a great tribute to our brave Indian soldier PVC Vikram Batra, who laid down his life during the 1999 Indo-Pakistan war. The title comes from Batra's codename in Kargil. Vishnuvardhan's direction is top-notch and he makes an impressive debut in the Hindi film. He handles the film very well when it comes to the war scenes as well as in the emotional scenes it does not look overdramatic.The inspirational story is well-researched and the writer did not just keep their focus on Vikram Batra's achievements as an army officer but they also explored his romantic and emotional side. Sandeep Shrivastava's screenplay is fast-paced and gripping which keeps viewers hooked till the climax.The movie starts on a promising note with a war scene that will set high expectations for the audience. Sandeep Shrivastava's dialogues are good and go well with the scenes. And some dialogues are clap-worthy too: ""I would come back either with the Indian flag or draped in it"". ""We live by chance, we love by choice, we kill by profession"". ""There is no other status greater than the status of a soldier, there is no greater glory than the glory of a uniform, there is no religion greater than our country"".Sidharth Malhotra delivers the best performance of his career and his performance evolves through the film. He shines in the war scenes and completely done justice to the titular role. This film gave him a lot of scopes to showcase his acting chops. Kiara Advani gets an underwritten role and she doesn't have much scope to perform. The parallel love track between Sidharth and Kiara has some light moments. Shiv Panditt as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal is reliable. Shataf Figar, Anil Charanjeett and Raj Arjun were good in their supporting roles.Kamaljeet Negi's cinematography is eye-catching and he beautifully captures the locales of Kashmir. The war scenes need a special mention here and the production design was impressive too. All the action sequences are very well choreographed by Stefan Richter and Sunil Rodrigues. Especially, the terrific scene where Vikram infiltrates into Haider's hideout and kills him. The battle scenes where the Indian army captures the two critical points Pt 5140 and then Pt 4875.The music is average and the songs are well-placed in the film. John Stewart Eduri's background score is impactful. Do not miss the end credits, the makers beautifully pays an ode and list out the names of the soldiers in Vikram Batra's regiment with the photographs and the accolades won by them.Sheershah Movie Rating:
Direction 3.5/5
Acting 3.5/5

42,varuna12,My dil too maange a little more from this film....,6,12 August 2021,"Not taking anything away from the heroic story and courage of our hero legendary Captain Vikram Batra and the great efforts made by the filmmakers, I felt not so satisfied at the end of the film.Don't get me wrong, it is shot beautifully, army is depicted quite marvellously, action is very good but I wish the film had more about the struggles of the jawans as they went up. For me it felt very rushed; their hardwork and efforts and risk-taking was painted rather loosely. I wish these sequences were executed in more details and more grit.Siddharth Malhotra performed very nicely and this is the second performance of his that I have liked after 'Hasee Top Phasee'.One major dislike I have about this film is the spoken Punjabi. It was simply terrible and a bit cringy. But I can ignore that cos most of the audience won't feel it.My major problem with this film is that it needed more time to develop and showcase all the hardships our soldiers, our boys went through. At times the film felt a bit cliched; same old Madhuri Dixit bit, Pakistanis were the typical caricatures.The best thing about this film is the depiction and look-costume-feel of the armed forces; very seemingly authentic. And the telling of this legendary story that is needed to be told again and again.My ratings: 6/10 ******
Definitely worth watching at least once. I wish it was so much more.",Shershaah

Vikram Batra!In the movie, during the final assault I saw a Pakistan flag lying on the ground and our Soldiers were jumping over it! Why?They should have STUMPED THEIR FEET ON THE FLAG of the TERRORIST nation! Why show respect for the flag of the barbaric enemy of Bharat Mata? Why?Our soldiers also SHOULD NOT have buried the dead bodies of Pakistan soldiers, with full honour! Why do that? Shocking! This is Unnatural respect shown to the enemy!Please watch this Patriotic movie & please feel proud of our Indian Army! Audio-visually the film is well-made! Love the soulful background Songs! Siddharth is Ok as an actor. A better actor might have shown more intensity.Probably, the film should have been named as - Capt. Vikram Batra: Yeh Dil Maange More!PS: I watched the film within 6 hours of the release on Prime Video! Never done that before nor commented so early! After all there is a first time for everything. Isn't?",Shershaah
44,ravenus,"Follows a standard biopic template, missed opportunity for greater dramatic potential",6,18 August 2021,"I can't evaluate how true Shershaah is to its subject, the late Capt. Vikram Batra who showed exceptional bravery during the Kargil war. But as a film, it comes off formulaic and pat. As played by Siddharth Malhotra, Capt. Batra's character has FILMI HERO written all over him - he makes cute wisecracks, is loved by all, barely breaks a sweat while putting down bad guys, and has an unimaginative romance track (Kiara Advani trying to make the most of an underwritten part, but then everyone in this movie is). Overall Shershaah has the shallow feel of a feature-length ad film rather than the emotionally involving saga of a brave warrior.Just skimming over the wiki article on Batra, I'm actually puzzled at the interesting things that were left out from his life to make it fit the generic hagiography template. POTENTIAL SPOILERS DISCUSSED AHEAD.Vikram and his brother Vishal were twins born just minutes apart. This could have made for an interesting running element in the narrative, but it is only kept for a poorly conceived last minute surprise (especially since it is Sid Mal's voice heard doing the voiceover for the eulogy at the start). Vikram's relationship with his family is depicted in a perfunctory and cliched manner, not even having the emotional attachment that classic Bollywood could be so good at.In a more important dramatic omission, before his last battle (for point 4875), Vikram was physically unwell, down with fever. It was when he saw that the enemy was gaining over the Indian forces, that he volunteered despite his illness to fight and several of his colleagues pleaded to go with him. If true, this was a much more intense narrative than the bland tick-marking manner in which his Kargil conquests are depicted on the screen.",Shershaah
45,cooldwijen,A good watch,8,3 September 2021,"It's neither a 10 starrer nor a 1 starrer movie. I don't think the movie does justice to the persona of Captain Batra.

The sluggish pace let's you down and you aren't able to connect with the main protagonists.",Shershaah
46,puranjanbasak,Shershaah!!,10,12 August 2021,"Shershaah is a biographical war film on the famous martyr capt. Vikram Batra. Here are the positives and negatives:
Performances:can i just say that kiara is too cute and sweet. She looks even more cute while crying. Apart from this, her acting is top class. Shiv pandit, sahil vaid, and every other cast member has given commendable performance in their limited screen time. Kudos to the casting director as well.Sidharth malhotra:this man has given every inch of his craft into this role. A preparation of five years has brought the result. A standout performance , nothing less. Especially in the war sequences, his eyes speak the most. That valour, that glory, that happiness is conveyed so beautifully. He has silenced all his haters astoundingly.Bgm amd music:the bgm is top notch. The tension, the thumpbeat is so well crafted. Music is excellent. Soulful and meaningful to ever last word. Personal fav remains 'ranjha'.Action choreography and combat sequences: one of the highlights of this film is its action sequences and war scenes. Wonderfully designed, detailed and masterfully done. The hand to hand combat is good as well.Vfx and special effects:special mention to red chillies entertainment. They in the whole vfx portion are by miles ahead of any other production comp. Realistic and believable vfx and special effects.Accent:sidhart's accent was good to be honest but kiara's accent looked a bit odd at times. It was evident that she was trying to be natural but could not. My only gripe with this film.Jingoism and patriotism: there is a fine line between these two things and thankfully shershaah does not try to be jingoistic and does not promote chauvinism. There are small details involving the pakistani flag which is worth noticeable. Patriotism beautifully portrayed.",Shershaah
47,msundari,Worst movie,1,17 August 2021,As expected biopic of cap.vikram batra by karan johar became a total mess with the help of overacting siddarth.

Shershah is merely a marketable product without any emotions. We need to take a leaf out of hollywood when make such movies without diluting the real purpose.Shershah tells the story of Capt Vikram Batra's exemplary courage during the Kargil war. The movie could have been much more effective if it would have been crisp and avoided unnecessary songs .Biggest drawback of the movie is no connect with the viewers as it lacked the soul, emotion or essence that a war movie and a great martyr s story should induce. Poor direction and screenplay does not add to the movie. Acting is average and Siddhartha Malhotra is not able to spark the exuberance and charm of Captain Batra which can be felt by his original clippings towards the end of the movie. Moreover, Karan Johar has taken care his love for Pakistan. The whole movie gets over before you realize who was the actual culprit .A movie that could have been a great treat on the eve of our Independence Day has been merely reduced to a poor commercial flick.",Shershaah

Dharma Productions is again having an Independence Day release after Gunjan Saxena and Vishnu Pradhan, the director, has given them a well made biopic of posthumously Paramveer Chakra awarded , 25 years old , Kargil Hero , Captain Vikram Batra .This is so far the best performance of Sidharth Malhotra and he has been able to replicate the passion and bravery of Vikram Batra. His undying enthusiasm and softness to fellow soldiers were nicely narrated but the script doesn't tell you who made him like that. Still the cinematography and music supplements the script . Why Producers engaged a bunch of music directors for a war film , I didn't understand.Kiara Advani completes the love angle of a soldier and the Bollywood touch is visible in few scenes and in the dialogue, 'soldiers live by chance, love by choice and kill by profession' . Other cast have done well as per the storyline.In any view, a sure watch , if you haven't on 15th of August.#amazonprime

I've no idea why Kiara advani is caste in any movie at all, after her disastrous performance in Kabir Singh (Watch Arjun Reddy with subtitles, you'll know what I'm talking aboutt). Sahil Vaid was as expected, wasted in yet another film. People are yet to see his immense potential. Shiv Pandit did a spectacular role as Lt. Sandeep Jamwal (now Col.), so did Naib Subedar Bansi Lal and Subedar Raghu's portrayals. I'll still keep Abhishek Bachchan's character of Capt. Vikram Batra in LOC (2003) zillion miles above this.",Shershaah

70,sourya-mukherjee,A prefect tribute to Capt. Vikram Batra!,7,14 August 2021,"Shershaah is the best movie on Kargil War that Bollywood has ever made. It's factually accurate (for the most of it) and is a perfect tribute to our Braveheart Captain Vikram Batra. It's very engaging and takes you through various emotions throughout the length of it. Time will just pass by as you watch it and at no point do you complain about the length of it. Siddharth Malhotra is brilliant! Kiara Advani is good and so is every member of the supporting cast. Another highlight about the movie is its music. It is original & very good. I loved the song Raataan Lambiyan in particular. So if you do not have much planned this Independence Day weekend, Shershaah is a must watch.",Shershaah

There is obviously that creative touch given to make it more exciting for a movie so some scenes veer off from reality but that's okay. War scenes don't look fake.

Snow, Few explosions, fire were poor, few blood splatters. Bollywood is coming close but still, they need to work on CGI to make it look real. Next, background music during the fight scene was like hyping which makes the fight look poor. The sound of an actual fight is lost because of blasting music. It's something that 90% of movies do to make people feel excited but if someone looking for real touch then they won't feel it. The real story should be told in a way it feels real. Our soldiers did the ultimate sacrifice for their countries and when their story is told with help of hyped music, slow motions then it feels disrespectful to them.",Shershaah

The combat sequences are the ones which I loved the most, finally someone actually made good combat sequences with nice practical effects, thanks, the planning for attack and defense, the VFX was very on point except for the muzzle flashes, but the bullet hits, the bodies and especially the sound design of the war scenes are very chilling, the explosions looked so tasty, and little details which made this feel a little more real with the body language they shared on the Warfield was such a treat to watch, made my whole body charged up during the action, the songs in this movie are so good, I cried listening to them. The antagonists in the movie are fleshed out a little as well, they have a reliable backstory and correct motivation, who know what to do next, but the Indian soldiers were the ones who stole the show, the Indian soldiers were given very well justice, and there was no agenda in this movie whatsoever which felt forceful. Real names and locations were used, the dialogues were very real as well.",Shershaah

91,djpa-76657,Surprisingly F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C,9,15 August 2021,"Wasn't expecting much from a Siddharth Malhotra starrer due to his previous box office records, but this was exactly opposite of what I'd expected! After disastrous Gunjan Saxena and Janhvi's pathetic act Dharma productions did redeem itself to very well, this was definitely one of the best war/patriotic/biopic film to have come out in recent times.As we all know the story of Captain Vikram Batra's life, this film translates it onscreen very well. Be it his time on field, in romantic avatar or Kargil War Shershaah neither drags things out, nor does it rush it too soon instead follows the pace very well. And the biggest risk factor about this film was casting of Siddharth Malhotra, not only he gave he redeemed himself well but also gave his career best performance in his career best film! Hoping to see more of Sid in future, he's definitely bounced back compared to his other student fellows(Varun and Alia with 2-3 consecutive disasters). While Sid was definitely carrying the film on his shoulder, shouldn't ignore the support cast at all. Kiara Advani too supported the film beautifully, her chemistry with Sid was heart warming and didn't seem forced at all. Shiv Pandit, Nikitin Dheer, Anil Charanjeet, Sahil Vaid and Raj Arun all of them did equally fantastic job! My only complain remained was I wished to see more of Vishal Batra(Siddharth again in guest role and narrator) to give more insights into love of both the twins, sadly it was used only in childhood days.The best thing besides Sid's performance was its pacing, direction, screenplay, VFX shots, action sequences everything just looked pitch perfect! Despite of having some usual cliches like over the top patriotic dialogues the way how they were delivered was equally realistic. And just when I thought Bollywood directors are getting better, I realised it was directed by Vishnuvardhan, a Tamil director known for Tamil films like Billa etc, this might as well be even his best as I haven't seen his other work yet. I really wished this film was a theatrical release and not an OTT presentation, imagining this film releasing in theatres already gives goosebumps! Going with 9 stars as not every film is perfect.",Shershaah

97,hamaid-khan,Good movie minus love scenes,7,12 August 2021,"Anything based on the Indian Army should not be given a score of ten out of ten. The film was nice, and it was wonderfully done, but it was a little sluggish towards the middle. There were instances in the beginning where the terrorist's leader slaughtered his guys because having a soft spot for soldiers didn't make sense, and it is an age-old technique to prove the other group has no compassion. If that's the case, why are so many people siding with them? Instead of depicting flimsy bad people, a more fair and honest approach might make the film more engaging. Of course, the film is about the Indian army, and the camaraderie is brilliantly depicted. The battle sequences are excellent, and the romance element was unnecessary; if it had been omitted, the film would have been tighter, more organized, and shorter than it is now.Overall, it was a one-time viewing, and the final scene, in which the real Vikram Batra was seen, was quite moving. Siddharth's acting was excellent, as was the performance of the other troops. I finished the entire movie in 50 minutes due of the love sequences.",Shershaah
98,amitkray,Excellent movie after long gap,10,13 August 2021,Its an excellent movie which brings out incidents of kargil war. One fact missing in many of the kargil movie is air force attack by mirage 2000 which changed the game. No doubt Vikram Batras valour is unmatchable.

This movie showed different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He was more than a war hero. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Climax had me in tears. The best cast I must say...their expressions were on point. Everything looked really authentic, raw and real. The love story was unique and beyond expectations. Really felt a big respect of Dimple maam.Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra! He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed. He deserves a national award for this performance.Surely his best performance so far. So proud of this man! All the hardwork he has put in is seen in the movie itself.Acting out a real life character is not an easy task. He truly has out done himself in this.Sid-kiara chemistry felt almost real and had a rare purenes which enhanced the bond between dimple and vikram.Kiara Advani did a great job.If Sidharth was the soul of the movie; Kiara was the heart of it. &Their combo rocked.Kudos to the whole Shershaah team; specially the director Vishnu Vardhan, thank you for bringing this alive.All their 5-year-hardwork has really worked out. Get ready for all the love and hopefully loads of awards team Shershaah!If this was released in theatres, this could've been EPIC! But yet this a truly is a blockbuster movie.

125,meenotigoswami,Long live Vikram Batra,10,12 August 2021,Shershaah one of the most anticipated movie of 2021 finally has been released on ott. Does it lived up to the expectations? Undoubtedly Yes. The movie is solid as rock. The message in the movie is deeper than the ocean. The movie will touch your heart. It is better than the movies of Salman Khan in his entire career. Siddharth Malhotra has given his career best performance. Shershaah is even better than the every war movies in Bollywood. Salman and Akshay should learn some acting skills from Siddharth. Kiara looked beautiful in the movie. All the supporting casts have done commendable job.Overall SherShaah is a treat for the Indian audiences. It is made for both the masses and classes. Being an Indian you can't afford to miss this movie at any cost. You will get to see the sacrifice of indian soldiers for their country in the best way. Blockbuster.,Shershaah

137,itzakkunwarak,For the first time in a war movie I enjoyed the romantic portions !!,8,12 August 2021,"Comes with the usual army-movies cliches, Sidartha Malhotra as Vikram Batra in #Shershaah nails the character's tone but also his quirky personality. Watch the end-credits, which has an interview of Vikram Batra & you'll realize how amazingly well Sidharth has embodied him in the film's same scene. Kiara Advani's cuteness gives her character Dimple an alluring touch. I am so happy with the supporting characters they won my heart.As this is a biographical movie of Captain Vikram Batra known as Shershaah in army, this movie takes you to a journey of a young filmy Punjabi boy who wants to serve his nation as an army officer, how he fell in love with Dimple, his journey from university to army and celebrates his bravery in army.The screenplay and direction of the movie is sharp and engaging. Usually I don't like songs in movies but the timing of songs in this movie, the tune, lyrics made me fall in the love with the songs too. This is probably my first time where I loved the romantic portion in a war movie. Kiara and Sidhartha's chemistry is something to praise. The VFX of the movie is so properly done that the blast scenes looks so real and the cinematography adds more beauty. I was so invested in the action scenes, the visualization of the movie that I wept out when Vikram was shot dead.There are also few drawbacks in the movie like its predictable, character's fake Punjabi accent and whenever a character talks about going home or his family he dies as it happens in almost all war movies.This movie undoubtedly deserves your time, watch it now on Amazon Prime.",Shershaah

150,indrajitbagal-83079,Average movie. Main war and valour has been given very short screen time !,5,12 August 2021,"Negative points 👇🏻
1) Putting aside valour of our soldiers and reviewing as a movie 'Shershah' is not graphically up to the mark of expectations.2) The main war movements and strategic developments are not covered and given comparatively much less time.3) The hardship in climbing the mountains in night hiding from the view of enemy is not shown.4) Sequences of bravery and sacrifice of Captain Vikram could have been shown in more interesting and detailed way with more screen time.5) His emotional connections with his love has been shown but connections with his family like mother, father, sisters etc has not been shown.Positive points 👇🏻
1) Acting of all the actors is good.2) Encourages patriotism and respect towards our army men.3) Other than war sequences screenplay is good.If compare with movie Lakshya which came 17 years ago this movie lags behind.Even though you have to watch this movie for our real Heroes not for the filmmakers.",Shershaah
151,Vishboy,Commendable Tribute To An Indian Army Legend,8,17 August 2021,"Kargil War in 1999 was the first ""televised"" war that Indians experienced. Tales of valour and sacrifice against impossible odds were broadcasted every day to millions of people across the country. When the conflict ended in late July 1999, the towering peaks of Kargil and surrounding areas were immortalised with legends who continue to inspire today.One such legend is Capt. Vikram Batra of 13 Jammu & Kashmir Rifles who was awarded India's highest military decoration- Param Vir Chakra. While an earlier movie in 2003 (LOC: Kargil) had paid tributes to his ultimate sacrifice within a broader script about the Kargil war, SHERSHAAH is a movie made exclusively on the late Captain's daredevilry during which he led one of the most difficult mountain warfare operations in Indian history. His codename during the battle was Shershaah.What adds credibility to the narration is the late Captain's family involvement and also inputs and anecdotes of his life through his twin brother- Vishal Batra. The movie is very well made and touches on many aspects of the legend's life. This without doubt is Sidharth Malhotra's finest performance and will go a long way in resurrecting his career. In the second half of the movie and especially in the war scenes, he fits into the role of Capt. Vikram Batra amazingly well.The highlight of the movie is of course the execution of the battle sequences that will make the viewers understand the magnitude of the Kargil War and the next to impossible odds the Indian Army was faced with. The ending sequence of the movie will stay with the viewers for a long long time as it is so moving- captures the essence of the biopic perfectly and a great tribute indeed.As for the rest of the cast, Kiara Advani performs well in the role of the Captain's love interest. Shiv Pandit as Vikram Batra's colleague and friend- Capt. Sanjeev Jamwal is good. Also, Nikitin Dheer as Maj. Ajay Singh Jasrotia and. Shataf Figar as the commanding officer- Lt. Col YK Joshi are commendable.Overall, a very well made movie and a great tribute to one of the legends of the Indian Army. Like Capt. Vikram Batra who immortalised a cola slogan, I hope the viewers too have the feeling of ""Yeh Dil Maange More"" when the movie ends. Jai Hind!",Shershaah
152,jonn-en,Best movie based on war/real events from Bollywood,10,14 August 2021,"I can't remember a better movie on war/real events made in Bollywood. The movie is extremely subtle, no jingoism, no unnecessary nationalism, nothing, yet never boring or felt like a documentary, full marks to the makers of the movie for that. Siddharth's acting could have been better in a few areas but overall, he's good and shine in all his scenes where he's not romancing Kiara. Kiara is good in her small part & so is the rest of the cast, I can't find fault in at least the main supporting cast. The one romantic song is melodious and thankfully there's not many songs in the movie, which is how a war movie should be.Wish I could watch this in cinema.Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a good, close to reality movie.",Shershaah

Politics and war apart; there is immense love between both the countries! When will the war stop ????What happened to movies like Bajrangi bhaijaan; where we could see the ultimate India Pakistan love ????Although I know Karan johar does NOT have the balls (everyone knows it) but SOMEONE should start producing about the 2 countries' love which is divided by politics since 1947 !!",Shershaah

160,RazielSHN,Somewhat Okay.,5,26 August 2021,The movie is good but it waste too much time with a useless romance plot that goes no where. For a movie that has the biopic name of Shershaah it seems to be in no rush to race to its military aspect. It has no urgency or any politics behind it. Its just Pakistan exists and Indian exists so war must somehow happen. And obviously the bravery of Indian soldiers are shown and Pakistanis are shown as sneaky weak cowardly soldiers. A balanced portrayal would have been nice.5/10.,Shershaah

Vikram Batra, his journey of how he became an Army officer, small snipers of his life as told by his brother and family have been put together nicely.At times the story has become a little slow or the love scenes make it slightly boring. But a good acting by Sidarth Malhotra in potraying the charater.But baring that at a few places, it's a good movie to watch.This is actually a Real story in the world of REELS.To sum it up:Shershah is one of the best patriotic Hindi films you should never miss.

198,Neindude,As long as there is 'saneema' (cinema) in India...,4,20 August 2021,"Now I dont know what kind of person he was, so I cant really judge Sidharth's portrayal of him, his acting did not have any effect on me. Now, the worst part is how they've presented his story. It's intercut with his personal life and military scenes, but a little too much emphasis is laid on the drama of it, and it's very commercial Bollywood. It feels plastic. I wish either the director went full melodrama like Border (1997) or better yet he should have tried a more realistic style like seen in some Hollywood productions like Lone Survivor. I'd love to see an Indian military movie that could top Uri.",Shershaah

The movie wins totally in terms of action, VFX, and sound effects. Weak strings are random plot, weak screenplay, unnecessary angles and not-so-good-actor-for-this-role.I would better watch a documentary on PVC Capt.

Nowadays, the main motive of a bolly war movie is, to come up with exaggerated masala and lack research. There won't be a perfect movie like URI or Lakshya, ever again to my belief.Disheartened, dissappointed but again, was expecting such a stumble while checking the cast list! 👎👎",Shershaah

Truly, I have not at all expected this amount of content and screenplay from the movie. The role of Liet (and later Captain) Vikram Batra played by Siddharth Malhotra was so much impressive. I can't imagine any other actor playing this role.Siddharth has always been my favourite actor of this generation, although many of his movies didn't went well in box office but this time he proved his every hater wrong.When I was watching this movie, I literally heard the shouting in the cinema hall.This movie consists of both army life and love life of Vikram Batra, and both were beautifully portrayed. Also rather than showing an army officer as a robot always saying Yes Sir and No Sir, this movie showed the life as an army officer, that a soldier too laughs and have friends. This movie had beautiful dialogues and many emotional scenes.In this way, I would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars ...",Shershaah

He was living PVC Vikram Batra all through out.And all actors have done justice in bringing the characters alive.In the end sincerely "" yeh dil manage more""

A movie that clearly showcases the challenges and sacrifices made by Indian soldiers while battling Pakistan Army and terrorists in higher altitude mountain ranges. The movie also covers the various dangers faced by soldiers in counter insurgency operations.Siddharth Malhotra has done a reasonably good job in depicting Capt Batra role. Must watch. Do not miss. I do not understand why many of the media/news reviews are not favorable to this movie. A definite watch for all.Few things do go wrong - trailer was very cliched and this had set wrong expectations. Romance angle in the movie is TOTALLY unnecessary. Soundtrack would have been lot better.But still, this is one of the rare war movies made by Indian filmmakers. Even rare is an attempt to showcase counter insurgency operations with realistic action sequences. Good watch overall.",Shershaah
238,karamdhillon,Ending song is the only low point of the movie,9,22 August 2021,Excellent work or I would say one of the best and career saving performance by Siddharth Malhotra. It seems like no other actor would have done better than Siddharth. True patriotic and the best biopic movie.Supporting staff done their part and Kiara is excellent as well.The only point which I didn't like is the 'Mann Bharya' somg at the end. They would have taken the favor to add 'Teri mitti' song sung by the same singer B Praak. Romantic sad song at the end didn't make any sense. I didn't feel the emotions.,Shershaah

294,abhijit_dutta2003,"Good, watchable movie",7,23 September 2021,"This is a good, watchable movie. The IMDB ratings are highly inflated though, I think people rated it based on their patriotic feelings rather than the true quality of the movie. Even though the war scenes are good, there is a observable CGI feel like computer games at places. The love story part also felt a little too stretched. Overall it's a one-time watch movie, unless of course you want to watch it for getting the patriotic vibes.",Shershaah
295,mr-debasishsen,Rate by choice !!,10,24 August 2021,"The film is based on a character and a story, a story that is real not reel. The character is someone who is a hero of Kargil war and the story approximately matches the incident.Now Sid no doubt did a justice to the character for sure, Vishnuvardhan on the other side did a splendid job to portray the story in such a way that I got engaged to it. Now if I agree that romance could have been a little less in the movie, so how will I justify the tears came out in the end with Mann Bharrya?Lakshya was one of my best movie based on Vikram's valour but Shershaah is the best.Vikram Lived by chance, Loved by choice and Killed by profession so I choose to rate by choice ignoring it's a Dharma prod.

Especially the last half an hour is extremely solid & mind-blowing. And the ending will leave you with heavy heart. This movie deserved the big screen experience.

305,ashwathama_199,These patriotic films are getting stale,8,16 August 2021,"Don't call me an anti nationalist for this review, but the films of this genre need to step up their game. Not that I didn't like the film, I don't understand the reason of giving this movie a perfect score when it doesn't seem like getting one. I watched the film uri and if you analyse both carefully, the pattern was almost the same - an Indian Army aspirant is shown, his love life is shown, he is depicted as a saint ( as if he never did anything bad in his life). This is followed by a sudden attack from militants ( whose side of story is never shown) and the hero's friends die. Then the hero gets agitated and pledges to kill every last one of them. Then there is sone covert ops where they slay the enemis... End of the story. And not to forget about some random patriotic slogans which fire up the viewer's heart and then he/she goes on to rate the movie 10/10, pff. I like movies like Haider where they show their side of story and tell how they end up being their own worst enemy, how they actually are pathetic, and how some of them are just dragged into this against their will. Shershaah has also shown some of such elements which I appreciate. I respect Indian Army but, doodh ke dhule shudh toh woh bhi nahi hain. Please don't get me wrong for this, the film was great, but a sound mind will get what I am trying to criticise here.",Shershaah

They don't understand the difference between a Hero's Life + his Sacrifice Vs a Faulty movie made on his life!Okhayyyy... so you decide to make a movie on one of the most respected & celebrated War Heroes of the Country in the last three decades.. Mount the movie on grand scale with budgets & stars and yet manage to fall so flat on the face!!1. Why dialogues are so clunky ? Why everyone keeps repeating the obvious things without any depth in sentences?2. Why such poor VFX when the base gets bombed by enemy or certain fire scenes? Literally got reminded of AJOOBA movie!3. Why is everyone worshipping him since childhood as if they all knew what he will accomplish ?4. Why his entire battalion and 3 levels of senior officers behave like his fan boys from the moment he arrives at the base?5. Were the romantic songs really needed? Did you not see how misplaced they were in 'LOC Kargil' or even 'Border'?6. And last .. why our Protagonist keeps hand grenades in front pocket of his shirt? And keeps taking them out like a pen to give autographs..!!!!I can go on and on.. but seriously pathetic attempt!!A biopic on a Real Life Hero's valour and sacrifice need to be celebrated but you guys turned entire exercise into a Caricaturish Attempt !!Sheer disgrace literally..PS Siddharth, Kiara and Shiv Pandit performed really well but how I wish overall script and execution were better thought through!",Shershaah

Vikram ji will always be remembered for the generations to come.Salute to the family for their sacrifice and Dimple ji's decision to remain unmarried, makes her the symbol of supreme sacrifice.I find such heroic movies could have been mix of documentry and some movie scenes. It is '99s story, with little more effort you could bring his battalion members and seniors to speak about the brave soul. So that we can feel that essence more.Kudos to Sidharth and Kiara for taking up such project. It was a huge responsibilty and both did a great job. As Vikram ji was saying ye dil mange more, the movie definitely needed a little more push. Ended with a good closure but yeah wish Vikram ji was alive to witness and celebrate the great victory.

Regardless of how good or average Siddharth Malhotra as an actor is, I as an audience was not able to digest him him as Caption Batra which was irritating and kept on distracting me from the movieThe war direction displayed in the movie seemed horrible.

The main focus is on the direction which was good but not up to the mark, it felt like they were trying to rush the movie, and also fighting scenes could have been more realistic.Most of the people will not agree with my review but it is what I feel about the movie and I believe the movie could have been better.Finally, one could watch the movie and will come out with no regret in most cases.",Shershaah

385,carikkybhartia,A Perfect Tribute to Shaheed Vikram Batra The Tiranga Man,10,12 August 2021,"Shershah is A real & perfect tribute to Shaheed Vikram Batra The Tiranga Man. The movie had & gave everything, smiles, tears, dreams, shattering of dreams, victory, pride, love, friendship, family, sacrifice, determination, confidence.It showed the worst of war where soldiers see their mates dying but still all set to go for hunt of enemy. The movie showed the pain the family, friends and love of a martyr goes through when they can't even cry on his death as he deserves much more than tears. The movie has good war visuals, effects and sound. The movie showed the respect a martyr deserves and receives. It shows how a soldier doesn't remember anything at war except the target and victory.It must be probably Sidharth Malhotra best performance. He really played Vikram very well, and he must now be known as Shershah of Bollywood like SRK is known as Baazigar and Mr Bachchan as The Sehanshah.Apart from war movie Kiara Advani and Sidharth showed a great chemistry in this movie. Loved the songs & scenes of your love, the proposal, the first talk, the marriage, the stand-up against dad, the hug, the separation & the final breakdown. U guys made a war martyr story well versed love story.It's a must watch movie for all and I had tears watching it..",Shershaah

Everything is relevant and fits the purpose of the script.There are no additional species ""massala"".Performance of all characters is commendable. Kiara and Sidharth were excellent performers. While Kiara's role is short but those scenes were performed absolutely great.The only part where this movie is felt like tipcal Bollywood, is the last scene of Sidharth as the hero.

I was having immense respect for him. So there was this interview of Dimple Cheema on YouTube i think on The Quint where she shared her love story with late Vikram Batra and i had tears in my eyes and couldn't believe such kind of love still exist. There love was so pure and am sure he loved her with all he has and made her feel so secure that his memories are enough for her to live the rest of her life.Coming to the movie i had least expectation since it was karan johar's movie they ruined some major facts in Gunjan Saxena and i was expecting the same with Shershah. Since, i am already a fan of both (Vikram and Dimple) and convinced myself to give it a try. I was in tears in mid of the movie where he held her duppatta for parikarma. It was exactly the same or even better i have imagined the two of them together. And through the ending what to say I was all in tears. Couldn't believe someone was so sure to be in army, dedicated and sacrificed his life for the country at the age of 24.Its surely siddharth's best performance but also the best acting i have seen after so long. Was so convinced and was so into the movie that made me feel he is real vikram batra. And Kiara with such a small screen time you made an impact, you are perfect Dimple. No one could have done better than you and we all cried with you in the last scene.For me it was 100/10 and its a must must must watch.",Shershaah

No adrenaline and realism as you feel in a real war movie like Border, Uri, Dunkirk or Hurt Locker. Very very poor casting as Siddharth Malhotra is expressionless and is unable to depict a serious, war scene and keeps on acting like a bot next throughout the movie.

Actors are not even trained on how to handle weapons properly.Check out movies like Hurt Locker or Black Hawk Down and see what real war scenes look like.Unlike in Bollywood movies Soldiers don't act spontaneously out of emotions - they act decisively, and with a plan.To the Director -
Lack of realism is an insult to viewer's intelligence, especially if they come from army background. And it makes general public dumb by giving them an emotionally hyped and poorly executed missions.The story is unnecessarily stretched out to fill 2 hours.Movie Makers - We don't live in the 90s anymore.

There is no great pride than wearing a soldier's uniform, and there is no religion greater than one's country.This movie does excellent job of portraying how difficult of a job being a soldier is. Those who we don't know sacrifice themselves for our sake.My girlfriend was crying after interval when she realised that Captain Batra will not be able to fulfill his promise to his beloved.One of the best war film ever made in bollywood just because this movie didn't care about the pseudo secularism that has destroyed whole Hollywood and slowly now destroying Bollywood.",Shershaah

Simple and innocent and so loving. Sid has done a great job. It doesn't even feel like he isn't the real Captain Vikram Batra.

685,kkaran_karank,Definitely a must watch war movie in recent times!,10,17 August 2021,"To my surprise, after so long Bollywood has given us a movie with such brilliant cinematography and screenplay, good music, and splendid performances by all the actors. A beautiful and healtfelt biopic of Late Captain Vikram Batra, martyred in 1999, during the Kargil War. The film totally justifies the character and bravery of the Captain. Also, it brings to light his jolly nature and his love life. Kiara Advani's performance is top notch throughout the film. Though she had a limited screentime yet she managed to bring out all the emotions perfectly. Be it the emotion of longing when he left for his military training or the feeling of grief and sorrow when she waited for years and he came back, wrapped up in tricolour, it made us weep like a baby. The soulful music and Bpraak's notes also deserve a huge applause and appreciation. I can vouch for him that no one else could have done it better. Did I miss anything? Yes, Siddhartha Malhotra's performance! He was ofc at his best. The way he portrayed the life of Captain is beyond praise. Best part is all the dialogues were inspired from real life and it felt so unreal. Yes, true love exists and Dimple is a living example. She's still unmarried and teaches kids. More power to her. We need more such films!",Shershaah
686,kumarsaurav953943,7/10 - 1 star only to counter idiotic emotional flooding by Indians,1,25 August 2021,"1st of all, one should very cautiously and only after personal review believe 1 or 10 stars because such raters are obviously big time stupids, who don't know what 1 or 10 actually means? About the movie, it is not boring at all, but also not the best ever as portrayed by fake internet world today. It is a gripping movie but acting and content wise, it mostly seems to be a typical bollywood drama, without any research. And lastly, Siddharth's acting doesn't show jolly nature of Vikram Batra but only oversmartness and overacting.....so he was and still is a poor actor.",Shershaah
687,arijitmondal1,one of the finest biographical movies than has been made in India,9,14 August 2021,"""Shershaah"" is undoubtedly one of the finest biographical movies than has been made in India. Here is my take on it. Remember before watching that it is more a biographical than a war movie so pls don't compare it with ""URI"" or ""Border"". The film it can be compared with is ""Lakshya"" as a journey of a common kid from small town to become a legend.The Goods
Excellent directionRealistic approach. Simplicity is in its core.Siddharth Malhotra will be remembered for this film for long time to come. Other casts are good and does justice.Cinematography is breathtaking specially the war scenes.Background music is good. The music(songs) are fillers but does not hinder the story.A proper homage to the martyrs of Kargil War and their sacrifices-
The Bad
As i had feared in the movie the dare devilry of Capt Vikram Batra was far more heroic than portrayed here. Maybe the director thought that if they follow the details it will make the viewers not believe in the story.It seems that the movie was forced to be kept around 2 hrs run time. A little more run time would had been better.A bit more details on the operations of peak 5140 and 4875 would have enhanced the viewers understanding of heroism of PVC Capt Vikram Batra.A bit more insight of Kargil war was required.Having said that ""Shershaah"" is the movie for large screens and OTT platform doesnot do justice.",Shershaah
688,roy0512,Awesome...Salute to Captian Vikram Batra,9,16 August 2021,"Really Salute to Captain Vikram Batra for his Journey.Every Indian and Cinema Lovers should watch this movie.Sidarth Malhotra's portrayal of Capt.

I bow down to this man for the courage and valor shown for the country. He should be reverred by Indians often and must be made mandatory a chapter along with other martyrs in primary school textboox for coming generation to be inspired.Sidharth Malhotra beleived in the story and didn't back down to take this on silver screen. He was associated to this film from way back 2016 and trained hard to get into the skin of the character. The man deserves every ounce of appreciation he is receiving right now. His 5 years of fruitful prepration has given him the result today.The movie is exceptionally well made and technicially brilliant. The supporting casts show great brotherhood in the army and the film depicts the personal loss when they are martyred is great in all aspects. The vfx, war scenes, combat scenes in Sopore, combat scenes on road are just brilliant.Kiara Advani shines with Sid and adds great layer to the story. They look great together. The love story is all that had really happened between PVC Captian Vikaram and Dimple. She's excellent in emotional scenes and climax nervous breakdown.The movie standouts for it's racy screenplay, to the point story and no meankngless scenes. This movie deserves repeat watching.

701,sarkararhan,A very good potential wasted on narrative style,6,19 August 2021,"The acts of our army at the Kargil is simply exemplary and cannot be surmounted. Cpt Vikram Batra, the country's highest military recognition awardee has been immortalized once again with this film. This review will be about the film and not the dogma of the incidents.This movie like any other has good points and bad. The story is told through the eyes of Vikram Batra's twin brother, Vishal Batra. Vikram is a brave and full of energy right from the beginning and doesn't back down from a challenge be it relationships or terrorists. The depiction of army tactics, communication methods were on point. The outfits, gear, weapons being used at that time is very authentic. The visual effects were realistic. But unfortunately that's where it ends.What i didn't like about the film was the narrative style, given that it had been engineered more for a Bollywood loving audience so there were obviously many cliches which I don't want to discuss (One of the lead producers being Karan Johar). The story felt disjointed, almost no connection in first half military conflict with the second half full fledged war. Could have used more background on the Kargil War. The whole environment for war was what i felt was missing the most, since the real bond between army brothers wasn't established properly but rather hastily, which is very important in a war film because it makes the action scenes/casualty scenes more real and visceral. There should have been more screen time to show the actual struggle behind the extremely difficult mountain fight scenes. I understand this is story is based on Vikram Batra and not the Kargil war, but the war is a big part of his story. The ending was very rushed and due to lack of drama and tension, my adrenaline wore off really fast.This movie is a mixed bag for me with a little bit of what i wanted to see and a whole lot of what i didn't want to. Story was really good and would have done wonders if it had used the right creative direction.",Shershaah

704,rishabmahajan1,SHERSHAAH TRIUMPHANTLY ROARS,10,12 August 2021,"After viewing the first initial trailers, I was overwhelmingly excited for this biopic. However, at the same time, I realized that Bollywood is exceedingly inconsistent with quality. For example, in an industry where exceptional films like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Uri are created, underwhelming projects like Radhe and Coolie no. 1 are also produced. Fortunately for the industry, Shershaah is masterclass of storytelling, which expertly highlights the life of the late Captain Vikram Batra. Moreover, the film has been keenly edited in a manner that never allows it to drag or appear self-indulgent. Furthermore, the cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi shines in illuminating the grim war scenes, which are extraordinarily created by Red Chilies VFX. The VFX were another concern I had for the film since most Indian films lack in this department; however, Shershaah delivers on this end as well. Overall, with remarkable directing, editing, cinematography, and performances by the cast, this film has emerged as the finest Hindi film of the new decade. Sidharth's performance alone is enough to warrant this a watch. 10/10 Masterpiece.",Shershaah
705,anishaalluru,Absolutely Brilliant!,10,12 August 2021,"Shershaah is easily the best film of the year. Sidharth Malhotra absolutely nails the character of Capt. Vikram Batra. After watching the film, you truly understand why the Batra family chose him to play their son.5 long years of blood, sweat and tears have resulted in this absolute masterpiece.The screenplay flows seamlessly and even single aspect of Vikram's personal and professional life have been represented so accurately. Action scenes on the tough Kargil terrains and VFX are amazing.Sidharth and Kiara's chemistry as Vikram and Dimple is adorable. Both of them do a good job speaking Punjabi as well!By the end of the film, the audience is truly left saying ""Ye Dil Maange More""!Kudos to the entire team of Shershaah and most importantly a big thank you to Capt. Vikram Batra and the Batra family for everything they have done for our country. May God bless you.",Shershaah

1. His growth as a soldier and role in war
2. The love story.If you connect with the emotions, not only on the basis of the role played but also with the real life story, you'll feel the Sacrifice done by him and her in their real life and will realize that only the ounce of it is depicted on screen.The representation of various expects of war

This movie allows him to potray an enthusiastic person is what i would say he has somewhat justified the role but i believe he could had done a little better.I really feel having a snack in between a war torn location where there are bullets being fired was silly to even predict. Secondly, no engineers are allowed to enter the enemy territory for the sake of re-capturing our lost peak. It was as silly as showing Kulbhushan Karbanda in border who was a cook picking up a gun in an hour of need. Similarly i felt there were many such instances.",Shershaah

755,garg4269,Must watch for every Indian,7,23 August 2021,"This movie shows the passion and love (late) Captain Vikram Batra had for his country. It shows the extent to which a soldier can go to defend his country and to take back his country from his enemies. It shows that a soldier won't back down despite having completed his assignment and months of battle fatigue. It shows how a true leader will risk even his life to save his troops.The movie Shershaah (Captain Batra's codename in Kargil war) is the life-story of Kargil-hero late Captain Vikram Batra, who played a great role in getting back important peaks from pakistani infiltrators/terrorists during kargil war. This is his coming of age story from a happy-go-lucky school boy to a lover, to a passionate soldier to great leader who gave his life to see the tricolour planted on the last barrack on point 4875 during Kargil war.The movie isn't an out-and-out war movie. The movie is over 2 hours and the war really kicks in the last 45 minutes or so, but the movie is engaging throughout nonetheless. In fact there are plenty of action scenes before the war showing how Vikram was crazy and fearless from the get go.The only boring scenes come when Kiara Adwani is on screen as Vikram's love interest. She hams through her entire role as she always does.Siddharth's acting is effortless. In fact, he is the only character who will stay with you weeks to months after you have finished watching it. This is his best performance by a big margin.The movie also does full justice to the war story. It does cut some corners in story and takes some liberties, but otherwise it tries to stick very closely to the real events and dates etc. The action is very realistic too, but something it makes you wonder how Vikram Batra never gets shot even once despite being in line of fire so many times, except until the last scene where he does get fatally wounded.I am giving it 7 stars of 10. The things that could have been improved: The casting (all except Siddharth had better alternatives), music (could have been much better, remember Border?), movie's pacing (could have been cut short by 15-20 minutes by cutting some unnecessary scenes like love-related scenes, childhood scenes (which go on for too long).",Shershaah
756,rampandya-87133,Watch it for the Braveheart who gave his life for his country.,8,13 August 2021,"What a fitting tribute to late Captain Vikram Batra sir! Sidharth has given a memorable performance. Might as well be the best performance of his career till now. The movie steers away from the jingoism, doesn't romanticize the war, but more importantly gives the Brave soldier a tribute he deserves. The VFX doesn't disappoint either. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about the movie, don't fall for that. These type of movies should be celebrated so that the sacrifices of those unsung heroes don't go in vain. It's very cliche thing to say but imagine giving your life for your country, not even thinking for a split second. Takes a brave soul to do that.",Shershaah

Beautifully potrayed the role of Late Captain Vikram Batra. The good thing about this movie is that they tried to be real and not glamourised the story like bollywood do. Rather they have shown how Vikram was as a son, a brother, a lover and a soldier. This movie is not meant for Oscars but for the army and the countrymen. This movie honors Vikram and countless others who give supreme sacrifice for the nation. The combat scenes were fantastic and VFX are damnn good. The songs of the movie touches the soul. The background score is too good. It's dialogues bold yet hits the heart. And tbh the last 15 minutes of the movie were very emotional. I was unable to hold my tears. After seeing this movie, I can proudly say ""yeh dil maange more"".Jai Hind 🇮🇳",Shershaah

One can clearly see that he has worked so hard for this role. He's truly an underrated star and deserves more recognition. Kiara Advani too, has acted very well and their chemistry is too good. The direction of this movie is superb by Vishnu Sir.

918,sanjev-24589,Bollywood viewers need an honest review,1,7 September 2021,"This movie is totally hyped due to an ultimate sacrifice made by Mr Bikram Batra. The character development is unnecessarily dramatized to the extend that it looks unreal because the lead actor shows no character of a real Soldier. There is no combination of fear and valor whatsoever. He is made to look invincible until his death scene. Infact the movie was so into the bravery of Bikram that every other Soldier is portrayed as coward. This isn't how you win a war or you justify the contribution of a brave martyr.Initial battle scenes shows no military strategy, fear, or risk at all.And here comes the worst part: The final battle scene is so rushed as if the actual war had lasted for an hour or so and the story moves like the soldiers are going for some kind of picnic at a hill station. Plus it lacks the intensity of a realtime war where nearly 600 men died. Perhaps to show that less gore is primarily due to Director's ego to show less damage to the Indian military.All in all the movie seems like someone is telling me the story rather than living through the movie itself.Instead try watching Dunkirk or 12 strong. You will know how the real war is like.Karan Johar will absolutely make huge money with this movie by cashing into patriotism but it brings the quality of bollywood cinema fairly down.I'm giving 2stars for few average scenes here and there. Rest is completely irrelevant and forgettable.",Shershaah
919,shivrk-18647,"Good movie, average actor",7,15 August 2021,Siddharth needs to work on his acting: john abraham or ajay devgn would have been better for this role. Movie lacked substance. Rest ok to watch .,Shershaah
920,harshitha-64473,Over hyped.,1,21 August 2021,"One more movie made by bollywood just for making money. Well, can't expect more from Dharma productions. It has got more attention for the storyline. But the movie makers have failed to showcase the life of a soldier in this movie. Screen time for love story is too long and didnt get the feel of 1995 college days. No deep conversation with the family. Too much dialogues. Only last few minutes war scenes were watchable, but story ending was worst, too dramatic. Didnt feel anything after this movie.Reading wikipedia page about Captain Vikram Batra was more interesting and informative.Please stop making such movies if cant do justice for the characters.Do as usual rom com fictional movies. Its so disrespectful to characters in non fictional movies if the the movie is not done right.And why cant indian audience judge the quality of movie properly. 8.9? Seriously?",Shershaah

942,patilvaidehi,Detailed analysis,10,19 August 2021,"Everything is noteworthy in this film.Beginning with the storyline, it sticks to it cruz and doesn't deviate. Close to reality with a very minimal amount of fiction.Secondly the cast of the film. It's worth an applause. Everyone play their part so well. Not a single frame exists where you feel it is going ott. Not just Siddharth and Kiara but others as well. All the supporting characters also make a mark.Thirdly the album of this film. Every song is new. No remakes. Tunes are catchy. Originality clicks. Also they come into the movie at an appropriate situation making their mark. The Mann Bharraya sequence hits at the right note and unexpectedly. Every song is amazing and stays in your mind.The direction of the film is noteworthy. Every shot that is captured shows the vision of the director and his demand for that perfect shot. The amount of hard work put in and the vision of the director is very clear. The thought process of showing a particular thing in a particular manner is visible and is an evident factor why the final cut has come out so well.The next part, the cinematography of this film is so beautiful. The locations and shots make it so appealing to your eyes.Coming to the action sequences which are bang on. Choreographed well and filmed brilliantly. All are portrayed in a realistic manner and make you feel as if you are just present there in the moment and witnessing them live.The best part is the VFX. VFX made the film more attractive in a way that no where you feel it is caricaturish. Doesn't look dramatic at all.The dialogues are the most important ingredients in the film. They are written so well. Connecting aptly with the audience and making you feel as if they are being communicated to you.The screenplay is flowing in a beautiful manner. Every back and forth switch between the war and flashes from the past are in a perfect sync.Shershaah is a must watch for every movie lover since it has an element of everything you would love to see in a film apart from the fact that this was actually a real story and Capt. Vikram Batra had actually lived this life with his family, friends, colleagues and Dimple ofcourse.It has the perfect balance and blend of romance, emotions, patriotism, comedy, etc. And the best thing being no emotion or portrayal overpowers the other or takes over the other. They are all in proportion.Definitely a 10 rating film.",Shershaah

978,ferdousnazma,A life or two worth celebrating,8,24 August 2021,"The Shershaah team did great justice in depicting Capt. Vikram Batra's life on screen, who was rather too good to be true in real life, because they were very honest in telling his story, no grand standing needed. At age 24, he had etched a fine example of being a Braveheart for his country, a son/brother one can be proud of for 2/3 lifetimes for his family. But I wish, he came back, if not for anyone else, for Dimple Cheema and saw her in that wedding outfit and set another rare example of a true love story that was lived. After watching the movie, all I could think of was her, who never got any official recognition, never wanted or sought anything, but has been living the life of another Braveheart quietly for last 20+ years. Her valor may not have been came to light in the battlefields but it certainly shown its true self, in her utter devotion in keeping their love story alive for these many years. Hats off to you Ms. Cheema.",Shershaah

Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) stays with his parents in Palampur, Himachal and his twin brother, Vishal Batra. Since the time he was a child, he was interested in joining the army. At college, he meets Dimple (Kiara Advani) and falls for her. She reciprocates his love and both start a relationship. At this point, Vikram decides to join the merchant navy instead of the army as it pays better. One day, when Vikram drops Dimple home, Dimple's father (Bijay J Anand) catches them red-handed. He tells Vikram that since he belongs to a different caste, he can't marry Dimple. Dimple, however, protests and even tells her father that Vikram would earn more than him since he's going to join the merchant navy. Meanwhile, Vikram starts getting second thoughts after his best friend Sunny (Sahil Vaid) insists that he should not give up his dream of joining the army. Vikram tells Dimple about his change of plans. This infuriates Dimple and she requests him not to make any more changes in future plans. Vikram then enrols himself at an army institute and passes with flying colours. In 1998, he gets his first posting at 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles at Sopore. Vikram is now a Lieutenant. His regiment comprises Lieutenant Sanjeev Jamwal (Shiv Panditt), Naib Sudebar Bansi Lal Sharma (Anil Charanjeett), Subedar Raghunath (Raj Arjun), Major Subrata Mukherjee (Abhiroy Singh) and Major Ajay Jasrotia aka Jassi (Nikitin Dheer), etc. In no time, Vikram proves his worth when he manages to capture a dreaded terrorist, Attaullah (David Browne), who's a part of the gang of an evil militant, Haider (Mir Sarwar). Vikram also befriends locals, unlike other soldiers. This proves to be of great help as a friendly local, Gafoor (Zahoor Zaidi), informs him that his son Arslaan (Afnan Ashia) has joined Haider's gang but wants to leave them. Meanwhile, Haider attacks 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles while they were moving as an act of revenge for capturing Attaullah. Naib Sudebar Bansi Lal Sharma loses his life in this attack. Arslaan helps Vikram as he tells the latter about Haider's hideout. In a risky operation, Vikram leads his team to the hideout and manages to capture and eliminate Haider. Before his death, Haider however warns Vikram that something big and devastating is going to happen soon. What happens next forms the rest of the film.",Shershaah

I don't watch much of Bollywood now, like for last two years, but couldn't resist watching it full. I am not going to compare to Hollywood, which I watch lot more, but that doesn't mean it's not comparable. Get this straight, this movie is great and will not give you a moment where you feel like, 'I should stop now'.Overall, liked it quite a lot. Now will show my parents too.Oh, by the way I too didn't expect that it was a Dharma Productions, got to know only after watching it.And many people who feel like it is the worst movie for various reasons, it's okay. But some went too far saying that they don't know how can Indian audience not see or do justice to the movie and are trying to make it super duper hit. Hear it from me, straight, 'Mind your language, and maintain the limits'. You're not our representative, first and second that you are no-one to ask such a dumb question. Everyone has different taste, and they can like to see different things from different point.Anyways, glad I found this movie through my brother on Prime Videos.And thanks to everyone who has taken part in its creation.

Its absolutely fine to use Hindi if that's what the actors speak well than actually ruining the accent of other regional language and trying to woo the audience on half baked cookie. Sidharth has spent decent time in the industry to deliver a sensational performance but I don't think he delivers to it in the movie. In fact if you take Vikram Batra's name out of the movie, the whole weightage drops. I still haven't figured out why 'Bharat mata ki jai' didn't roar in the movie when the movie is actually all about that. At lot of places, its made to look like there is no strategy required to attack, seniors' orders can be optionally complied with, I'm sure Indian army is much more about rules than that. It felt like a movie to develop Sidharth's fan following as an actor by playing nation sentiment similar to what we have seen in the past.",Shershaah

1134,rohitthakur-rafa,A perfect war film!,10,12 November 2021,"A film that topped my watchlist for a long time now, and I'm glad that I finally caught up with it.I don't remember when was the last Hindi film or even a film in the war genre which was so well-made, a film that ticks all the boxes and hits all the emotions there could possibly be.The last time a film in this genre was so refreshing to watch was Lakshya, and I feel this tops it in a lot of ways, even though both have their advantages and there's really no need to compare them.The biggest focal point of the film is Siddharth Malhotra, how good has he characterized Capt. Vikram Batra, the work that he has put in, and you can obviously see the outcome. If you weren't a fan already, after watching this, you sure will be.Kiara Advani was fantastic in her role as well, along with the other cast members. As the film proceeds, the writers and the director ensure to focus on each character, which makes you feel for them at various points in the film.As I said before, the film ticks all the boxes, right from the element of war and action, to the element of love, the background score and the music, the cinematography, everything is just right in this film. Brilliantly led from the front by the director, Vishnuvardhan. Overall, the film is fast-paced, plus you're invested in it right from the beginning, I couldn't find nor think of any flaws that would make the film less lovable.Shershaah is perfect. An exemplary example of a well-made war film, a Hindi film, a Siddharth Malhotra film. This film just took my breath away, so much so that even after 24 hours the film has definitely stayed with me and made a mark too. Couldn't recommend it enough.",Shershaah

We need to grow up and start rating movies critically. The only thing that dharma productions does best is to milk people's emotions. And they will continue to do so.

His team instead chose to hoist the Indian flag and rejoice victory as their captain taking his last breaths lying in front them. That was stupid execution only because the history states that Vikram becomes a martyr in the Kargil war . Show that his team tried to save him at least and not dance infront of him.In another scene, Vikram started running infront of the Pakistani bunkers to save his army man. He holds his injured friend, pulls him to safety, all while the Pakistanis continuously fire at both of them and no bullet hits them even when they are in direct range of 10s of Ak47s. That scene's execution also could've been done better.Lastly, Being a Punjabi Kiara's Punjabi hurt my ears.

One thing that bugged me a lot was, over 80% of the enemy soldiers were killed by protagonist, which is slightly unrealistic.3. Another complaint that I have with bollywood movies, Why does every movie has a female supporting actress whose only role in the movie is to be a love interest of the protagonist. Why a movie about war can't be just about war.4. Instead of focusing on portraying Vikram Batra as a human being, the movie goes on to show that he was aAll in all, if you don't use your brain a lot while watching this movie and don't question the reality of what would have happened then you would enjoy this movie.

1171,hemmigekiran,From REAL to REEL,7,14 August 2021,"There are only 2 reasons for writing this review. One - being a fellow technician in the film industry from another language (Kannada), the value & significance of how making a movie equaling a penance is not lost on me and the other - an acute lack of ""film appreciation"" by even the most mainstream reviewers.Not being one to watch movies based on reviews (where on the other hand, most people seem to form their opinions based on one and even decide whether to watch or not), I do go through them after in a bid to identify if grasping something was missed during my watch (the first watch is always to ""feel the movie"" and soak up the experience however, I do watch them again in case of compelling instances). The reviews by a few so-called mainstream reviewers seemed unduly harsh warranting this write-up.Let me try taking on a couple of common gripes from the scribes about SHERSHAAH.1. ""Too similar to many other war movies""If a cricketers' biopic is made, it would be like saying ""the cricketing aspects are too similar to ones found in other cricketers' biopic""!First things first, this is not a war movie. This is a BIOPIC and with the person being from the armed forces, war is a given. So, the backdrop is the most distinguished achievement of this individual, which was the Kargil war. As such, there is no getting away from the war zone. After all, the man is a martyr and at a tender age of 24 - when, most of us would still be trying to figure out how not to screw up our life!Technically, the film is very immersive during the war scenes. The locations, action, VFX and most importantly, the on-ground procedures followed are very impressive to say the least. Standing apart are the tactical gestures depicted, which clearly indicate that they have been thoroughly researched/consulted with. Such aspects are usually a casualty in the name of ""cinematic liberty"" as found in many other ""so-called films made in India that are based on the armed forces or even the police"". As such, a definite credit where it is due for sure.It is the camera work, editing and sound design that really takes one inside these scenes. Personally, for me, the RR (re-recording (mainly the BGM) was a mixed bag though.2. ""The love story track""Yes, that is supposed to be an integral part of this movie since, the aim is to celebrate the man called Captain Vikram Batra. He is not a fictional character and hence, if he is shown sporting a smile, a bit of hair style, mannerism and a bit of persona that seems to mimic a certain Shar Rukh Khan then, that is reflective of the times he grew up in. If the on-screen love story seems to plain could the real life story be blamed for it? It need not be omitted for, that was the essence which kept the then adolescent chap's heart beating while safeguarding the nation's borders. Thankfully & correctly, things haven't been blown out of proportion to make it a ""filmy romance"".Coming to the good bits, a run time of 2 hours is a major plus. Also, the deliberate avoiding of ""high pitched jingoism/Pak-bashing"" by the makers is a relief too. There was a time when ""Doodh maangogey toh kheer dengey, Kashmir maangogae toh cheer dengey"" resonated with the audience however, an approach of dignified depiction works in favor of the movie here.Clear vision regarding the purpose of the movie is a good indication of the abilities/skills/craft of it's director. This clarity establishes that the most important language that a director should be aware of are the nitty-gritties of story telling. The makers need to be lauded for staying true to it through this effort.The point of cinema appreciation becomes relevant in such scenarios because, as viewers (general audience & reviewers alike), movies need to be watched for what they are and not what one ""wants them to be"". Yes, a reviewer can surely be constructive to indicate ""what could have been"" but surely not lose sight of what the movie is intended to be about in the first place. In that sense, SHERSHAAH is certainly an endeavor to authentically capture incidences visually that are documented in public domain with a mix of real life instances (which may not necessarily be too exciting). Being a biopic, it suffices if the family has found the movie to be graceful in saluting a martyr and true son of the nation. Together, we can all proudly say ""Durge maata ki jai""!",Shershaah

1173,kpkartikpurohit,Not good movie but Great take on real life superhero.,5,27 August 2021,"It's a great take at a real life superhero, but it should have been kept realistic.Don't get me wrong but telling a real life superhero movie is a homage to him, but movie feels like bollywood masala.It's gives a vibe where main actor does everything and whatever he's doing is heroic,
for example when he went for joining his post, things like slow-motion walks, heroic music in background, people gathering around him, walking in line-of-fire.Feels like over exaggerated a simple thing.Why director have to show everything he's doing is heroic.When moving for war post Shiv Pandit playing capt. Role who is going for very important mission, for which they have given code name, talk to malhotra's character by calling him his name.Dying of Anil charanjeett character is so pointless and emotionless. He's an army naib subedar, a trained soldier, not a kid walking on street.Nowhere in movie they show big brother of malhotra's character who is telling itty-bitty thing of malhotra's character life, without being there.Switching punjabi to hindi whenever a important/complex dialogue delivering and then move again to punjabi when its over.Not feels like malhotra's character is from Himachal, feels like from amritsar.No point putting army canteen scene where malhotra's character buying liquor. I mean whats the point.No point of Sahil Vaid character.",Shershaah

There is hardly any realistic war looking scene or even the gun fights, unlike old war movies. A large part of movies is around romance and Punjabi songs. A critical part of Captain shaping up into army man is completely missed and so is his army life. This is where movie doesn't have any heart and soul since the beginning.Sid seem to be copying SRK in most part, though a failed attempt.All support actors and leading actress are like forced entries by virtue of a poor script/story.Music and Songs are useless.VFX is kiddish.JP Dutta seems to be the last of genuine director/ producer to do justice to war movies with utmost honesty!",Shershaah

It is unfair for the rest of the families who sacrificed their blood in the war. And there is definitely lack of talent in filmmaking industry to justify such stories of bravery.

Sounds and visuals beautifully composed to immerse the viewer into the environment.The dialogues were perfectly written to blend into the character of Captain Batra. One of the things I've noticed was Siddharth shaking his feet into a rhythemic, restless tapping- a trait of Captain Batra which Dimple Cheema described in an interview, the reluctance to sit idle, to tap the table with his hands and when told not to, tapping his feet.If someone is here for the love story, it is cute and nothing overblown. It plays an integral part towards the core plot and again doesn't feel out of place or forced into the plot.",Shershaah

1202,adityakhatri-80962,Blockbuster,8,12 August 2021,"The protagonist's identical twin is the narrator of the story but he, like the rest of the soldier's family, is relegated to the periphery of the plot, a creative decision that prevents Shershaah from becoming an overarching tale that straddles the exceptional courage of the martyr as well as the fortitude of his parents and siblings.The pace of course picks up with the action sequences. Cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi's camera captures the urgency and tension, a lot of scenes shot in dim lit frames convey how hostile the conditions are. These are parts that grip us, some we can't help but see with moist eyes. It's commendable that the tone remains steady and never loud and jingoistic.Best part is the climax with a surprise song!That, to a certain extent, is how the film is.

As he is one of my fav. Actor i'm really got surprised and happy for his unlocked next level in his acting.Kiara Advani also done a great job. She potrayed the character of his gf to perfection as supporting his faugi bf.Director has well presented the movie without the unnecessary gruesome of patriotism, he made it simple,plain and realistic.

We need such movies to actually live those heroic moments. When we read that someone received Paramveer Chakra, we can't imagine the actual heroic, it can only be lived through a documentary or movie on it and without changing any facts of it.

But that goosebumps waala vibe was just not there.By just reading about Vikram Batra you will literally get goosebumps but in this movie that thing was missing. Whole field team did a great job indeed, Pranay, Shataf, shiv and especially his friend Sahil.But a big thanks for choosing Siddharth for this role as I believe nobody else could've done better than him.

At beginning of the film it seemed even this one was just an other such films focussing patriotism, but just as you commence forward you'll get a very huge perspective of a army person and making war isn't the best result of victory. War costs many brave lives and and no one chooses to loose their one and only life for the sake of nonviolence, so this movie has done a great job portraying the consequences of real life war and the immense loss of a family member and the cast of course have given their maximum to enact the actual person.

1936,renorocks,A mediocre watch of a rather potential Blockbuster war flick,6,12 August 2021,"Watch this movie for strong patriotic flavour, near realistic action scenes and amazing cinematography. Sid Malhotra's portrayal as the jolly yet fearsome war fighter Capt Vikram Batra was good. He has vastly improved in emoting to crucial scenes but somewhere I think that finesse was lacking. Kiara was OK. The rest of the cast members did their job fine to the extend they were given their respective roles Direction and lack of punchy dialogues are the achilis heels of this film. He had to put more emotions and up the suspense and thrill ante. This was my take on Shershaah. Now I know many of Sid Malhotra's fans and probably jingoist minded fans would bombard me with verbal abuses but one thing I want you all to know that I love the movie for a fitting Tribute to Late martyred captain Vikram Batra. No doubt in that. But taking into consideration about the other aspect of this film which is Entertainment-I have to say I am not satisfied fully rather to an extent disappointed. It was a mediocre watch.",Shershaah

And one of the top indian war movie.It's not just a typical war movie but is a life story of a national hero amd his heroics. This movie tells us different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Everything looked really authentic and good amount of detailing was put on the making of movie..Thanks to the maker of this movie to bring us heroics of our own Captain INDIA... PVC Vikaram Batra..
This story has to be told.... This story has to be remembered..
To be 24 and show such courage is something unparalleled.. I am not sure and can,t what inspires an human being to do so for his own country...Thsi has something to do with the upbringing definately... salute to the parents and the family..🙏Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra! He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed. He deserves a national award for this performance.Surely his best performance so far. So proud of this man! All the hardwork he has put in is seen in the movie itself.. He truly has out done himself in this. He has such a charming personality which makes him pefect person to potray this role which needs a out of the top charm.Sid-kiara chemistry felt almost real and had a rare pureness which enhanced the bond between dimple and vikram.Kiara Advani did a great job.If Sidharth was the soul of the movie; Kiara was the heart of the movie.Other supporting actors were on point..Niketan Dheer specially has good moments in the movie.Get ready for all the love and lots of love..
If this was released in theatres, this could've been EPIC! But yet this a truly is a blockbuster movie. A must watch! And thss will make you feel the value of a soldier's so many twist and turns come in their ..

2231,shivb-03752,Love & Emotional Movie,9,15 August 2021,Vikram Batra was a valiant soldier who lost his life in the Kargil war. This aspect has been taken as the backdrop and director Vishnuvardhan showcases it in a good way. He starts from Vikram's younger days and shows how the soldier fought for his country and what kind of an attitude he had. This aspect is portrayed so well by Siddharth Malhotra who plays the sheet anchor in the film.The love story between Siddharth and Kiara Advani is slow and there is not much to say about it as it keeps dragging the film time and again. The emotional bonding between the family and lover of Vikram is not established well and does not move you emotionally.,Shershaah

The VFX, dialogues, action sequences, Warfare, are all International level and can easily beat any Hollywood war film. A must watch for every Indian to remember our heroes and realise the importance of Independent Air we breathe.",Shershaah

2236,siddhimathur,Good One,10,15 August 2021,"Cetainly the best movie of a war hero. Its silly to compare Shershaah with Lakshay.

2239,manishopenreach,faming and defaming at its best,2,15 August 2021,"Vikram batra was great soul and movie gives a very good insight in his life and the supreme sacrifice he made for the nation
but being a son of an army officer I would say the movie defamed the army setting just in the beginning by portraying a N/B subedar driver to the adjudant of the unit that too in a infantry ,which is very disturbing
a niab subedar never drives a captain around , which ended up spilling filth around
to end I would say Indian army has a very good culture and division of Power
which movies like this end up soiling.",Shershaah

2310,ThomasRaspberryNominee,Overrated and barely watchable,4,17 August 2021,"Sidharth Malhotra starring Shershah achieves what it set out to achieve, monetize the story of an young army officer who bravely laid down his life for his country. The story line is linear and potrays the young officer as a monochromatic chracter whose only ambition is to go to war albeit being borderline insurbordinate and reckkless. The movie glosses over how his superior officers send his company out on back to back difficult mission without regard to troop wearout.The performance of the cast is 7/10 with requeried bollywood cliches and dance numbers. In the hands of a better director, the moview could have been about the tragedy of loss of life of a promising young man in the name of war but here it is glorified into a masala flick ready to mint box office gold. 4/10.",Shershaah

I already knew about the Kargil War with Capt Batra and his brotherly soldiers alongside, about their brave sacrifices and victory by our fathers and their fraternity. But still, Capt Batra's traits and charisma as we had learnt was excellently pulled off by Siddharth Malhotra to the maximum extent! The style, the Charisma, from a romantic filmy flair to this exceptionally brave fauji! Everything seemed so original! There was no too much fauji-giri or too much of romance. Everything on point. The action sequences, ambush scenes, defence/firing formations and ways too good. Other soldiers and officers of the battalion were also played very well! Great display of similarities. Dimple, uff, her innocence, originality, simplicity just everything made us fall for her. Dimple Cheema aka Mrs Batra is our unsung hero! Kiara was absolutely the best! The songs, damn. You still can't get over them. Right choice of the singer and music! The very fact that 99% of this movie is totally true makes us all cry and praise at the same time. I can bet you, if you can't survive last 20mins of the film without tearing up or goosebumps with a heavy heart.The best part I felt was, the makers really should be appreciated as they honoured the battalion's officers and soldiers who were a part of the war too!Just felt that the scenes especially the funeral ones, the ones with dimple or while Capt Batra watching the tricolour unfurled, could be a bit longer so as to give us a lil extra time to cope up with it allAll in all, this was one of the greatest, best, heart-touching films till date, I bet you won't be able to get over it so soon
From a fauji kid to you- always appreciate and remember what the soldiers sacrifice for you! It's just 1 film but narrates a thousand legacies of a thousand soldiers from our country.",Shershaah

The direction, of course, was fantastic. Some scenes left me crying and with goosebumps. That's just how good everything was. Kiara did a great job too. Towards the end of the movie, her performance is guaranteed to make you cry.

The movie doesn't only revolve around the main character but gave equal limelight to the soldiers of Kargil War. The scenery at Kashmir was so beautiful. Siddharth Malhotra really outdid himself and he lived as Vikram Batra Sir. What a natural actor he is. Been watching him since SOTY and he just keeps on amazing me. Kiara was so simple yet elegant and portrayed Dimple Cheema the best. Director VishnuVardhan once again made all of us so proud. I was amazed when I get to know he's the director because the movie didn't had any South Indian touch it was as if some Bollywood Director directed the movie. Amazing job from the entire cast and crew. So good to see Shiv Panditt as well. Been watching him since Leelai Movie and he too really outdid himself. For me 10 Stars are just not enough to express how much I love this movie. Songs are just soul soothing that I'm listening to them on loop. Yeh Dil Maange More.,Shershaah

'SHERSHAAH' the story of such a devoted man, seeing whom the feeling of patriotism will be possessed for once in your heart and passion to do something for our country will be racked up. The 'SHERSHAAH' movie fabricated under the direction of Vishnuvardhan was released on 12th August, 2021 at the OTT platform of Amazon Prime Video in which the main cast of Captain Vikram Batra played by the very versatile actor Siddharth Malhotra.Vikram batra (9 September 1974 - 7 July 1999) was born in a middle class family of Palampur, a small district of Himachal Pradesh. From his childhood Vikram had the ambition to join the Indian Army. His love for Indian Army inspired him from a serial Paramvir Chakra which telecasted on Doordashahan and this reverence transfigured into a passion. He met with Dimple Cheema( role played by Kiara Advani , lead actress of film) in college and their love story transformed from friendship to marriage. Then he joined India army at the age of 23 after completing the training of one and half years at IMA as a lieutenant in 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles.This person's stubbornness to do something for the country and the definition of love in a right way has been showed to audience by the film Shershaah. From nonage, Vikram was always set to fight and take risks for his rights and this type of attitude aided him and Indian army in the Kargil War and in search operation of Kasmiri terrorist, Haider. He had a congenial behavior to his fellow soldiers and Kashmiris and this made him successful in completing many missions. The best thing about this movie for today's youth generation is when the Vikram decides to sacrifice his dream to join Indian Army for his love and then his friend, Sunny (role played by Sahil Vaid) told him the very right thing, ""jab koi dusra banda aake sapna todta h na too banda sambhal jata h koi problem nhi hoti.........aur jab khud tu saare sapne todega na apne to aadmi mar jata h"" and this words is for those teenagers who do anything for their love and don't know the wack consequences of it. Dimple Cheema said, ""How do I describe a lifetime of memories, though made only in four years of association? I could go on and on, and the memories would still keep coming Not a single day in the past 17 years have I felt detached from you. It feels as if you are away on a posting. I know in my heart that we are going to meet again, it's just a matter of time"" and that is the definition of love in real life in which you sacrifice everything for your partner but in a right way which have nothing bad impact on both.Siddharth Malhohtra acted all the dispositions of Vikram Batra in a very realistic way and he suited in this character very much. Shershaah was the name given to Captain Vikram for secret talk in Kargil War and that'why this film was named as SHERSHAAH. This film is a salute to that country lover who called ""ye dil maange mor "" as a victory sign which means he wanted to get these all enemies out of country, this is a salute to a soldier who is ready to lay down for Mother India at all times.I request you to watch this movie once and whoever has the slightest desire to do something for his country take inspiration and courage from the life of Param Veer Chakra awarded Captain Vikram Batra.",Shershaah

How a story can make the strongest of the human cry. Is it possible? Yes. But the difference is here we can't specify whether this are the tears of satisfaction of how vikram conquered the death with a smile or it is about regret of never to see Vikram alongside Dimple, The love story of lifetime.

But in THIS MOVIE? Damn, Sidharth, you cannot be more spectacular. You are not acting in this movie, you are living it, and it is as if you are the Vikram Batra himself.Man, the highest appreciation for you. I have no idea about Indian history as I am Indonesian, but watching this, I feel myself as the part of the whole history. Gosh, Sid, how come this is happening. IT IS AMAZING. I wish the vote didn't stop at 10, I and so many people could give you MORE than a 10 in vote.This is my very very first time writing a review on a movie THIS LONG, let alone writing on IMDb.Sid, I wish I could meet you in person and tell you this.And Kiara, madam, what a performance. This is the first movie of you that I watch and you have captured my whole heart. THANK YOU for doing it so so so beuatifully. We couldnt ask for more.

Mentally and emotionally, it teaches you something or inspires you.Shershaah is one of those movies. Never have I ever felt a surge of patriotism in me. I think last patriotic movie which all of us remember is Uri: the surgical strike.Shershaah is totally realistic and original. I thought some of the plots might have been taken from Uri, but I was wrong. This movie is very original in itself.The one thing which I really loved about it is that it not only shows the brave and audacious side of a soldier but also the human side of him.The location, the storyline, the casting, the songs, the way the movie flows and holds its audience till the very end, is just brilliant!!The cast has also played their roles very beautifully. Sidharth Malhotra, though an underrated actor in Bollywood has done a great job! And the way he has performed shows that he really did put in his sweat and blood to bring out the true character of Captain Vikram Batra. Even, Kiara Advani has played the role very beautifully. I can't even imagine anyone else playing the role of Dimple Cheema other than Kiara.Over all a great masterpiece!!",Shershaah

You feel all the lyrics and you get every feeling, whether it be love or courage or admiration, and it's amazing! Absolutely amazing! The music and their acting makes it seem as if you lived every moment with the characters and that shows just how authentic it is. Both lead actors have nailed it with their characters. They couldn't have chosen a better actor for Captain Vikram Batra's role, as Sidharth Malhotra portrays it perfectly with both his dialogues and the mannerisms. Kiara Advani has also done a wonderful performance in this movie as lead actress and I hope to see more of Sidharth and Kiara's chemistry on screen.And of course, Salute to the real Captain Vikram Batra and his real-life story that is being brought to the big screen. This is such an inspiring story full of courage and bravery and will certainly stay with me for the rest of my life.This is the best movie I have ever watched and this film will always have a special place in my heart.

I am very moved by his story. Coming to the movie...Siddharth played Vikram's character flawlessly. I started feeling as if he is a real soldier. He did commendable job. Kiara also acted well. The last scene when she cries seeing last rites of Vikram Batra is extremely touching. Most importantly the movie is not just about KARGIL. Its actually about Vikram Batra's journey. Some people may say that first half is slow but that pace was necessary to build his character especially, portraying how he turned from a civilian to a lieutenant to a captain to a martyr.

I can't even think about he efforts the team took to do the research and present it so beautifully on the screen. And Sidharth Malhotra damn he was fab, I can't imagine any other actor other than Sidharth playing Captain Vikram Batra.

2798,kingshrey,An Amazing Patriotic Film,10,17 September 2021,"Film Review of ShershahThe first thing that springs to mind as Shershaah unfolds is this: a war hero deserved a far more engaging and energetic film. It is a suitably solemn, restrained account of the brief life and career of a 25-year-old Army Captain who died fighting in the 1999 Kargil war, but it takes inordinately long to get anywhere near full throttle. Shershah is a biopic movie dedicated on the life of the brave Indian soldier Late Captain Vikram Batra, an inspiring war drama of bravehearts and victories. It is one of the best war realistic films ever made in Bollywood. The film was released on 12th August 2021 on the OTT Platform Amazon Prime. The film consisted of Siddharth Malhotra as Captain Vikram Batra, Kiara Advani as Dimple Kapadia, Ankita Goraya as Nutan Batra, Raj Arun as Subhedar Raghunath Singh, Shiv Pandit as Army captain etc. The 2hrs 15 minute film was directed by Vishnuvardhan, Produced by Dharma Productions Karan Johar.Talking of the story, The Kargil conflict - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the LoC, disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause. But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. I won't be revealing the full story to spoil your mood.The film was a total justice to an army man's life. The film showed how the army is committed for the safety of Kashmir people, countering the terrorists, gathering inputs, the coordination, teamwork and how brave our army men are. Film was mainly shot in Kashmir and I was stunned by the way the film was shot and edited, especially the gun scenes and the way it was shot at high altitudes. It was incredible. The songs of these movies were so soothing and lovely that I can't express my words. Raataan Lambiyan by Jubin Nautiyal and Ranjha by B Praak were so good that it became an instant hit while Instagram was flooded with reels of these 2 songs. The film even had a touch of romance of Siddarth Malhotra and Kiara Advani for which bollywood is famous. I felt personally that the way Siddharth Malhotra acted in this biopic was truly the best. The way he delivered the dialogues like ""Dil Mange More,"" ""Live by chance, love by choice and kill by profession"" were epic.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks higher than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax. For me this film is a 5 on 5.",Shershaah

The movie is all about Shershaah. He has simplicity, and obviously he is emotional. I can't describe how Siddharth Malhotra has portrayed the Shershaah. He is definitely up to the mark. May be no one can do this character so very much good as Sidharth. So as Kiara. Vikram's father was too good in his part. Overall its a complete package.

His contribution was significant in allowing India to win the war. The film ends with pictures and videos of the real heroes of this story.This film was superbly acted by all, in particular Sidharth came across very sincere and I felt he connected with his character very well.

2855,amulyajamwal,Pls Avoid...an insult to Capt Batra.,2,13 August 2021,"Such a lovely topic so poorly handled. Trust Karan Johar to bring romance and drama in a story that should be handled exclusively for the substance that the main subject of the movie should bring. The movie failed to inspire as it should have and it was a drag in the middle.The character building for the protagonist missed highlighting critical aspects of how Capt Batra joined NCC and was adjudged the best NCC Air Wing Cadet of Punjab and later was promoted to Senior Under Officer (SUO) and subsequently was selected for the Republic Day Parade (which is a matter of great honour) all leading upto his decision to join the Indian Army. However, he has been shown as a 'happy-go-lucky' guy who nurtures this boyish dream to join the army without any disciplined efforts towards that, which is of course not the case. Vikram (not then captain) trying to get liquor only meant for the army, was so misplaced and seemed so disjointed as a scene. Looked like it just had to be crammed in. Important aspect of character building was missed where he went for a commando course to Belgaum and got the highest grading possible and excelled in it. Clearly a part of character building, which has been ignored in favour of showing some other drama and romancing.The movie is factually wrong on minor accounts and for a biopic, it is unforgivable. Not sure how Capt Batra's family accepted some of these fallacies, if at all permission was sought from them.All in all, this movie, while a poor attempt, is an insult to a soldier like Capt Batra. Could have been made so much better, with the right intent.This move is avoidable and if you want to see a movie which has the capacity to inspire, watch 'Lakshya' or 'Prahaar'.",Shershaah

Portrayed a hoax about IOK in the first place and then a dreamy story about a soldier, who is so dumb that he thinks death is bizarre during war.

Salute to director VishnuVaradhan direction and acting by Siddharth and Kiara. When movie starts, it takes you to final battle scene and then it takes you to life of PVC Batra starting from his childhood with his twin brother and shows how he was patriotic since his childhood. Movie captures terror incidents in J&K and followed by Batra returns to his love for short period and during which Kargil war starts. His final good bye to his love gives goosebumps. He then posted in area where heavy bombing happens from Pakistan which kills his knows seniors. That incident triggers his battalion to engage in Kargil War.

After watching interviews of the family I realized there was nothing added to for masala to spice up the story and what happened was exactly shown doing justice to the national hero's life!Another excellent portrayal was of the Pakistani soldiers and how skillful they are too unlike other movies that show their incapability and how pure evil they are.",Shershaah

He was/is/will always be an inspiration to all Indians. This movie does such a huge disservice to his heroics and legacy.

2889,arvindchandfri,Good but not best,7,8 September 2021,"When the Shershaah's trailer came, I was very much impressed with that. The movie came out and people gave it great reviews making me more eager to watch it. I had only one question, that would it be able to surpass the near perfect standard set by Lakshya, who inspired thousands to join Army. The first scene of the movie itself reminded me of lakshya. Starting from the kargil, the movie went to college days. The movie progressed almost like lakshya. The movie didn't lost it's momentum at any point. The battle scenes and Army discipline was what I missed in the movie. Sidharth did good but was bit dull in comparison to Hritik in lakshya and even to vicky kaushal of Uri. The background score was also not so inspiring. The casting director also didn't gave importance to the actors for supporting cast and had an average supporting cast. But one thing I liked more in this movie, I.e., Army is not only about officers, it's also about jawan and the director showed it.Overall, I will say it's a watchable movie which is all about gunfire but nowhere near Lakshya, a masterpiece.",Shershaah

The best part of it many Indians are looking for army jobs while another part of youth is holding IT, and other money making sectors. Its not that they wont get jobs other than Army, its their decision not to go any jobs other than Army.I have personally seen guys attend those interview until their age bars and live with that dream and pass it to his/her child to get in to Army
A good movie to release on Independence day and its proudful moment to remember all those who lost their life or injured just to keep the flag to fly

He acted soooo dull, none of his dialogue were hard hitting or raised goosebumps. Let's face it, The only reason this movie is getting all praise is bcz it is based on Late Captain Batra. The direction and combat scenes were soooo lame, half of the time director has shown the love story, which I agree is partially important, but was too much to handle. See the direction of Lakshya, Border, Uri the surgical strike, the direction and their actors made us feel soooo incredible, jump on our seats. This movie and this Student of the year failed to do so.... Abhishek Bachan played a better Batra in LOC tbh.",Shershaah

The problem was with the screenplay and also I believe this war drama needed to be more energetic and length of the film could have been increased so as to create more built up about the kargil and also tell about one of the most toughest mountain warafare.

Kiara and Sid were too good, their story was so pure and true and I really liked how they have kept the movie so real... Sid when asking his team to fight and was telling plan it was real, as during war no one will have those filmy dialogues and that's what this movie depicted.

To show a legacy of such a personality who's still fresh on the minds of people of India for his exemplary service to our nation among all odds. To show this on screen needs more than just a moviemaking and rests squarely on the lead man who's playing this role. Watching Siddharth Malhotra was like watching how Vikram Batra was and the line was so thin you forget you are watching a movie.Well made, well researched and worthy of all the accolades.

It shows how alive and charming personality Captain Vikram Batra were. This movie knows when to make audience laugh and when to make them cry. Songs are perfectly placed. Nothing is out if place. In the last scene it is going to make people cry. Only two issues I find. Firstly the punjabi spoken by actors was out of place. I'm not a punjabi but i could see how they were not native punjabi speaker. It would be better to stick with hindi then using ithe uthe kithe tauda. Second is last song didn't match the moment. Otherwise 10/10 from my side. We can say that bollywood has made something to match Hollywood war movies. Must watch movie.,Shershaah

2983,kunaltudu,Yeh dil mange more is line that many of us would like to say for this movie!!,9,12 August 2021,"Shershaah an epic movie (biopic) about the life of Capt. Vikram Batra. Well this movie gave justice to his story. Many were complaining about love angle of this movie from trailer and that shows the lack of research done by the audiences about our great hero Cpt. Vikram Batra. This movie is first biopic and war genre. And Capt. Batra 's romantic life is essential part of it, so it will obviously be there. Coming to the movie Sidharth Malhotra was extremely promising as Capt. Vikram Batra which shows that he obviously has more than his looks . This is his turning point of carrier and I hope he chooses more out of zone characters to play. Kiara Advani was also promising. The thing were she lacked for me was her punjabi accent and fluency. It was good but not as promising as I was expecting it to be. But overall she was great too. This movie has some interesting cast choices and I liked it. Actors were quiet similar looking to its real life person which was good they all did there jobs well. Another thing I liked about this movie is its sound design. Sound designers did great job. Vfx were also nice. Thing that impressed me about vfx was muzzle effect and grenade. Vfx guys have done there research. Literally most Indian movies have got these things wrong. Fight choreography was also nice. Only place were it got fucked was in fight scene with haider those puches really looked fake. That was the one of the little faults that I found in this movie. Overall great film definitely must watch. Hands-off to all actors and crew members for making this great film.",Shershaah

2988,zohrab_singh,Not a masterpiece,5,10 September 2021,"About the story:
Many people consider this movie a masterpiece. Don't know why. Whenever you are making a biopic of a real life hero, it not necessary to make it crispy or more dramatic as if it is a fictional story. The script should be written in a way that a viewer gets more information about the main character on whose life the movie is being made and his/her surroundings. This whole movie is made to make to make the audience emotional, sentimental by the songs. How you can say that a movie is masterpiece biopic when the makers are getting cuss words out of main lead's mouth (Sidharth Malhotra as Captain Vikram Batra). Does these kind of scenes really make a real life hero a hero as he was is real life.About the acting:
Sidharth Malhotra's acting was not good enough as it was required but Kiara Advani's performance was somehow good. The actors were really poor at speaking Punjabi. Vikram Batra, on whose life the movie is about, was a Punjabi and Sidharth Malhotra who portrayed his character didn't even had the basic accent to speak Punjabi on screen. The actors could have done some workshop on this matter. The supporting actors (Shiv Panditt, Sahil Vaid, Nikitin Dheer, Mir Sarwar, Raj Arjun etc) were good at their work.About the VFX:
The VFX was not really a great thing in this particular movie. Some scenes were good in terms of VFX but some were really a disaster. Can't say anything much about the VFX since it was just normal (not looking too real). URI had 10 times better VFX sequences in terms of action, fighting scenes, gun shots, background etc.",Shershaah

3059,manojkumarrapelli,Shershaah review,3,20 August 2021,"A good war film leaves one with fostering disgust for war. But Sheershah glorifies war, it even has a moment where Siddharth Malhotra say's ""Har fauji ka sapna hota hain kam se kam ek baar war mein janeka mauka mile"". Ik this is not exactly glorifying war but I'm pretty sure that no soldiers walks and serves with carrying that as a desire. Film has nothing to offer which ain't been already served, there are ample of articles about Capt. Batra which has more to offer than this film, this film is no doubt a subdued tribute to Capt. Batra. The elements of Capt. Batra 's life had so much potential for multi-layered storytelling but 'Sharshan' missed it's shot. The war front sequences were good especially the first hill recapturing, as it had lil details to offer but the rest were mediocre at it's best.",Shershaah
3060,rashmibelguam,Literally can feel every emotion from the film,10,21 August 2021,This is such a realistic movie.. Nowhere in the whole film you will feel bored.
