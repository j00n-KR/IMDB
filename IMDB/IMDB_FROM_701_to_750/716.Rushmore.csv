0,MartinHafer,"Like most of Wes Anderson's films, this really doesn't make a lot of sense.",6,25 July 2013,"Wes Anderson's films are confusing, strange and seemingly pointless. They feature EXTREMELY interesting characters--folks who are very, very unique but strange. As far as the plots in many of these films go, they really seem unimportant--like the film is more a platform for a character study than a traditional film plot. This is not necessarily a criticism--more an observation. And, if you don't mind these sort of meandering films, then by all means see ""Rushmore"".""Rushmore"" is a character study of an ultra-bizarre high school student who is probably nothing like any living person. Jason Schwartzman plays Max--a seriously strange guy who is impossible to adequately describe or classify--though he is really creepy and becomes a stalker. He is super-involved with a zillion school activities and clubs which he started, yet his grades are abominable. He seems like a nice kid at times, but later seems emotionally disturbed and potentially dangerous. He's also thoughtful and nice and yet incredibly thoughtless and a jerk. Do these combinations make sense? The same could be said, to a lesser degree for the other characters--as they often behave inconsistently and are confusing.So did I like the film? Well, parts of the film were good and I enjoyed them. But the plot just left me very, very cold--as did the extremely deadpan performances (something typical of an Anderson film). My advice is to first see an Anderson film with a more traditional style and plot. While ""Moonrise Kingdom"" certainly isn't conventional, compared to all his other films, it really is! Try it and if you like it, then try ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and THEN ""Rushmore"". And, if you are really a fan, by all means try ""Bottle Rocket"" and the rest. But start slowly...your brain will thank you for this!",Rushmore
1,SnoopyStyle,quirky characters and wacky Wes Anderson style,8,4 February 2015,"Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is an odd friendless teen at a private school with lots of useless extracurricular activities. He get put on academic probation, and falls obsessively in love with elementary teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). He befriends an equally odd wealthy Herman Blume (Bill Murray), the owner of a pipe company. She dates Dr. Peter Flynn (Luke Wilson) which raises the ire of Max. Then Herman becomes infatuated with the lovely teacher and Max gets kicked out of private school.These are truly uncompromisingly odd characters. They are a quirky unconventional group. They are not immediately hilarious but funny in how wacky Schwartzman gets. The dialog is sharp with a lot of unusual Wes Anderson takes. Bill Murray extends his range starting an acting relationship with Wes. It's a wonderful move forward for Wes and friends.",Rushmore
2,Prismark10,School daze,6,10 September 2016,"Wes Anderson's second feature film continues with his off kilter style with a twist of French New Wave cinema.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a 15 year old student who managed to get into an elite primary school, Rushmore but spends all his time on extracurricular activities than actual studying much to the chagrin of the headmaster Dr Guggenheim who is concerned about his grades.Herman Blume (Bill Murray) is an industrialist wit an unhappy marriage, twin sons who cannot abide him and befriends Max. Both fall out over Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a teacher. Max becomes infatuated with her and Blume starts to date her.There are times you actually feel like slapping Max as he comes across as obnoxious. I kept forgetting he is only 15 years old. Max is a person who has intellect, ability but lacks the emotional maturity that comes with age. He slowly realises how rude he has been to people around him and decides to make amends.The screenplay by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson has plenty of offbeat moments underlined with a dark melancholy which we experience in Bill Murray's face but it is not always consistent. However this film marks out Anderson as a talent to watch.",Rushmore
3,lee_eisenberg,I guess that school just sucks for some people!,10,19 October 2005,"OK, I don't mean that seriously. It's just that when you see what Max Fischer (Jason Scwartzmann) goes through, you're truly going to be shocked. He's a student in a prep school in Houston whose life is about to get irrevocably turned upside down, more or less through his acquaintance with the school's main benefactor Herman Blume (Bill Murray).With ""Rushmore"", Wes Anderson started what proved to be his troika of great indie films - followed by ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" - which of course all starred Bill Murray. Murray's character here is much like his characters in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Life Aquatic"": a burnout on the verge of a major shocker in his life. A real treat of a movie.",Rushmore
4,jboothmillard,Rushmore,7,17 September 2015,"I had heard about this film a little bit, including one of its stars, then I found it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I looked forward to whatever it had to offer, directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel). Basically Max Fischer (Saving Mr. Banks' Jason Schwartzman) is a mature and eccentric fifteen year old scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston, he is the most extracurricular and least scholarly student, he spends most of his time running many school groups and cares little about his grades. Herman Blume (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who is unsatisfied with his multimillion dollar company's operation, his marriage failing is frustrating him, and his two sons attending Rushmore are brats, he becomes close friends with Max, admiring his cocksure attitude, Max admires Herman's success. Max quickly develops an infatuation with widowed teacher Rosemary Cross (The Sixth Sense's Olivia Williams), the new arrival at the academy, he attempts to court her many times, she slowly realises his obsession for her, Herman tries to convince him she is not worth the effort, but Herman, without Max's knowledge, begins dating her himself. Without the school's approval, Max tries to break ground on an aquarium, he ends up getting expelled from Rushmore, forcing him to enrol in Grover Cleveland High, his first public school, he has mixed results engaging in outside activities, he pays little attention to fellow student Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka) who tries to engage with him, but he has support from Herman and Rosemary. Max's friend Dirk Calloway (Dennis's Mason Gamble) wants payback for a rumour Max spread about his mother, he discovers the relationship between Herman and Rosemary and informs Max, therefore Max and Herman go from friends to mortal enemies, engaging in back-and-forth acts of revenge. This includes Max ending Blume's marriage informing his wife of his affair, Max putting bees in Blume's hotel room, Blume destroying Max's bicycle with his car, and Max getting arrested for cutting the brakes on Blume's car. Max eventually gives up on any more revenge, knowing that whatever he tries Rosemary would still love Blume, he becomes depressed, stops attending school, cuts himself from the world and becomes an apprentice at his father's barber shop, one day Dirk comes by to apologise to Max and give him a Christmas present. Max is tricked into reuniting with Herman by Dirk, going to hospital where his old headmaster is, they are courteous, and Max finds out that Herman and Rosemary broke up, shortly after Max returns to school and develops a friendship with Margaret. Max makes one last attempt to get close with Rosemary, soliciting her affection pretending she has been injured in a car accident, but she finds out the truth and rejects him harshly, so Max makes it his mission to get Rosemary and Blume back together. His first attempt at this fails, but then he invites them to a play he wrote, making sure they will sit together, in the end Rosemary and Herman seem to reconcile, Max shares a slow dance with Rosemary at the wrap party, but ultimately he finds himself a relationship with Margaret. Also starring Brian Cox as Dr. Nelson Guggenheim, Seymour Cassel as Bert Fischer, Luke Wilson as Dr. Peter Flynn and One Hour Photo's Connie Nielsen as Mrs. Calloway. This is the first film for Schwartzman, he gives a good performance as the odd megalomaniacal nerd, Williams is likable as the British teacher, and Murray does steal most of the scenes he is in as the depressed millionaire being quirky and edgy. It is a rather simple format, the unconventional outsider teen hero who may have the ability to turn those who laugh or are against him, it has intriguing characters and interactions, and a witty script, I did find myself laughing at the right moments and it was interesting, it's a black comedy drama worth watching. Very good!",Rushmore
5,rmax304823,Refreshing.,6,26 November 2012,"I don't know if an adolescent audience is going to find it easy to identify with Jason Schwarzman as the terribly bright, candid, and assertive kid who quietly gets himself into trouble by breaking the rules at Rushmore Academy and at the same time falling for one of its math teachers, the appealing Olivia Williams.For one thing, the kid loves the prep school. He has an academic scholarship, even though his Pappy, a neurosurgeon, could probably afford to buy the entire school. He stages hit plays. He's an alternate on the wrestling team. He's a genius when he's not being driven mad by his love for his teacher or the stings of the jocks or the competition from Bill Murray as a mogul who, with no explication, falls in love with Olivia Williams too. Nowadays, he said despondently, academic work elicits a big yawn. In a sociology class I was describing the ways polls have gone wrong and was interrupted by, ""Is this going to be on the test?"" I can understand the appeal of Olivia Williams. She's luminous. And I can understand why a high-school kid might be desperate for her love but, after all, if he's so smart he should be able to figure out that the slight difference in their ages, perhaps twenty years, might be an impediment.All the parts are pretty well written. (The story seems, in part at least, to be based on the experiences of Owen Wilson -- actor, writer, and all-around handyman.) Bill Murray, for instance, plays the role in his stiff, robotic mode, with few changes of expression. When he realizes he's falling for a younger woman he proves his boyish recklessness by launching his shapeless body from the high diving board. He hits like a cannonball and immediately sinks to the bottom and stays there. At another time, he leaps to the top of a chest-high hurricane fence, rolls over it, and falls helplessly to the ground on the other side.I didn't much care for the central figure of Max Fischer. Not that Schwartzman plays him badly; he doesn't. But the ambitious and sometimes obnoxious character, given to casual bragging and insults that are supposed to pass for honesty, is powerfully repellent.The film moves at a casual pace. There are just the right pauses between utterances and before cuts. The audience can not only follow what's happening but can savor the moments if they're any good. The sound track is mostly easy-listening rock instead of an electronic jumble. It's so nice to watch a comedy about kids that you don't need a Xanax to prepare for.",Rushmore
6,dbdumonteil,This movie is OK but I expected better,6,25 May 2003,"Like ""American Beauty"", like ""le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" I think ""Rushmore"" ranks among the most overrated movies of these last years. But, unlike the two quoted movies, this movie rather pleased me although I don't regard it as a masterpiece. I thought that some sides of the screenplay were inconsistent. Jason Schwartzman plays a student who's got a very active imagination: he fancies himself as a great man of the theater and the founder of several fanciful associations. However, he's a hopeless and poor student. As far as I'm concerned, I think he should be a brilliant student but it's not the case. So this side of the screenplay doesn't work.Nevertheless, the movie is especially worth for its clever dialogs and for its dazzling performance; beginning with Jason Schwartzman, outstanding in the main role and behind his big glasses and Bill Murray, entertaining in his role of weary millionaire.Another positive side: Wes Anderson introduced a slight, discreet humor that is never vulgar, unlike plenty of American comedies (American Pie, There's something about Mary).At the end, a good time but not a masterpiece.",Rushmore
7,Quinoa1984,"Good film, but a tad over-rated",8,7 November 2000,"Wes Anderson's Rushmore is a quirky, well meaning and sometimes funny satire of prep-school life that takes a good look at an oddball who run more student clubs than there are oil drills in Texas.  It is usually on target and works well, but it isn't as perfect as the majority thinks.The story follows a weird kid (played by Jason Schwartzman of the Coppola family and son of Talia Shire in a fine debut) who is content in being a academically bad student, but then finds the apple of his eye, a teacher (Olivia Williams) who changes his perspective.  But, he is contending against a millionaire (Bill Murray in one of his finest roles) who wants her just as much.  Some very wise moments and looks on school life and love, however, the lulls lower the standards just a tad.  Still, worth seeing for the performances alone, especially Murray.  B+",Rushmore
8,michaelRokeefe,A boy dares to dream.,6,25 May 2002,"This comedy offers some very deep moments. Thought provoking and humorous. A precocious, preoccupied 15-year-old(Jason Schwartman)prep school student develops a crush on a teacher(Olivia Williams)and befriends an unhappy, eccentric tycoon(Bill Murray). The friendship between the prepster and the big money man starts falling apart when it is learned that both want the same thing...the teacher. The development of relationships outweighs the story line. Young and old can ease into this romantic comedy. A diverse soundtrack featuring the likes of Cat Stevens, The Who and John Lennon add to the enjoyment of this flick. Highly recommended for repeat viewings.",Rushmore
9,LeonLouisRicci,Sincerely Smug,8,25 January 2013,"This movie has a charming quality of sophisticated sophomoric silliness and is offbeat enough for the art and intellectual sub audience that it is bound to alienate folks at flicker of frame. There are some points to it all and although elusive to some, it is delivered with an ""I'm smarter than you"" smugness and the script that demands you are with with me or not.The dry and subtle humor is sometimes very infectious but is betrayed by locker room stuff and not very funny slapstick. It is best when speaking and not so when it attempts to be visually clever or energetic. The best stuff is in the head and the heart.It is an acquired taste, this sort of thing and is usually the type of movie that the anti-Hollywood types seek out. They revel in the independent thought of it all and the low budget production. But when it comes to this type of movie, there are more misfires released then hits. Just like most of the stuff in this film. There are more misfires then hits, although there is enough to make it a diversion and a refreshing off ramp to the misfit camp of self-conscious, self-indulgent, introspective, independent, nerdiness.",Rushmore
10,lastliberal,"What's the secret, Max?",8,18 October 2007,"Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams): Do you think we're going to have sex? Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman): That's a kinda cheap way to put it. Rosemary Cross: Not if you've ever f*cked before, it isn't.Did she finally put him in his place? This was the turning part of the movie, in my opinion, where he went from being an obnoxious twerp, to someone who could consider others. Up until that point, I wanted to strangle him.I really don't know why some think that this is a comedy. It really isn't that funny. It's about class and about dysfunctional families. Even the rich have seriously dysfunctional families. Max just couldn't accept what he was and created this persona that was, well, obnoxious.The direction was great, and I really like the way Anderson uses color. It was enjoyable in that respect. The music really set the mood.Bill Murray was outstanding. His quirky humor really fit in well in this film. I think Williams deserved more credit than she was given as she really contributed to this film.I was really entertained, but. no. I didn't laugh once. But what do I know. I did't think Napoleon Dynamite was funny either.",Rushmore
11,Boba_Fett1138,You'll love it or hate it.,7,14 February 2005,"...and I guess I'm one of those who hates it. 'I simply don't get it' what it is that makes this movie so appealing to many. But seriously, best is to just go and watch this movie because it really is a matter of taste whether you will like this movie or not. So stop reading all these reviews and just pick up this movie.""Rushmore"" is a comedy but not a 'haha' kind of comedy (even though the school play Heaven and Hell was simply hilarious), it more is a social commentary. Most people just love this movie for being that but to me it just didn't appeal. I wasn't really a movie that I enjoyed watching. Still I have lots of respect for what the movie is but that doesn't mean I like it.To be honest, I would have never even watched this movie if Bill Murray wasn't in it. He really was brilliant and truly should had gotten an Oscar for his role. I also really liked Brian Cox in his role and also look out for a at the time fairly unknown Connie Nielsen in a small role.So anyway there is no point in saying for me if this movie is recommendable to you or not since it really truly is strongly a matter of taste. You'll either love it or 'don't get it' and hate it. I, for one, didn't liked it but like I said, I still have lots of respect for the movie. You decide for yourself what you think about this movie... 7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rushmore
12,george.schmidt,ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEDIES EVER MADE; MURRAY'S FINEST WORK,10,6 June 2002,"RUSHMORE (1998) ****  Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, Seymour Cassel, Brian Cox, Mason Gamble, Luke Wilson.  Hilarious comedy a la `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' as written by John Cheever: enterprising young Schwartzman (in a memorable acting debut; son of Talia Shire) as Max Fischer,a  prep school student at the titular institution  whose ambitions are only mired by his lack of decent marks, with even higher set goals in wooing a second grade teacher played by the sexy Williams.  But it is Murray who (rightfully) steals the film as a rich philanthropist who befriends Schwartzman only to betray him by also falling for his love-to-be, with a truly funny turn pulling out all the stops including slapstick falls and a great scene of depression in action at a family poolside party  (one for the archives).  Written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson (who also directed and both teamed up for their freshman gem, `Bottle Rocket') the film is smartly executed and makes even a sometimes unlikable character an empathetic symbol of adolescent anomie.  Brilliant filmmaking of the high order and Murray was robbed of a justifiable Oscar nomination for supporting actor !",Rushmore
13,safenoe,My most favorite Wes Anderson movie ever,10,11 March 2016,"I was instantly captivated by Rushmore. It marked a direction of some sorts for Bill Murray and I just loved Rushmore. I know some people ask why people like it, but I loved it!I discovered the song ""Ooh la la"" by the faces which was performed at the finale. I love the line ""I wish that I knew what I know now...when I was younger"". It's a great like to ask people to reflect upon their life.Jason Schwartzman was incredibly mature in his role, and Sara Tanaka was charming as Margaret Yang. I laughed big time at the school performance directed by Max (Schwartzman) and the send-up of Vietnam war movies. Rushmore is a movie for the ages.",Rushmore
14,The_Void,Amazing on all levels,8,8 March 2005,"Rushmore is a rare type of film. It's life affirming, but it's almost complete lack of sentiment ensures that it always gives the impression that it doesn't know it's life affirming, and is also the film's biggest asset. There's nothing worse than a drama that's saturated in sentiment, and I'm pleased to report that Rushmore isn't. The film is a coming of age story and a tale of friendship and romance, but beneath that is the real substance, and Rushmore is ultimately a film about life and, more to the point, contentment. The film follows a fifteen-year-old pupil at Rushmore private school, Max Fisher. Not content with just doing what the school has to offer, Max takes part in any number of extra curricular activities; at the expense of his studies, which has landed him on academic probation within the school that he loves. His world is turned on it's head one day when he meets the beautiful teacher with 'something you cant quite put your finger on', Mrs Cross.Rushmore is one of those films that allows you to forget whatever is bothering you at the time of viewing and just completely lose yourself in it. Wes Anderson injects his usual swinging style, but for a change - it actually works! The film gives off a sense of fun in every frame, and this is one of those films where you can smile at any time and have something to smile about. The film is really funny also, and so it succeeds in being both deep and hilarious; something that not too many films before it had done. The cast excel on every level, but the standout is Jason Schwartzman as the central character. We see him here on his debut, and it has to be said that his portrayal of Max Fisher is absolutely faultless. Olivia Williams really beautiful, and the way she is portrayed on screen aptly portrays what Wes Anderson is obviously trying to achieve with her character. Bill Murray does well also, and delivers what is one of his all time best performances. Wes Anderson's direction is another star of the show, and the way that he weaves the various emotions into every scene is simply sublime, and some of the sequences in the movie have a real substance underneath the surface, and we can feel what the characters in the story are feeling. Rushmore epitomises every reason why I watch movies; and I can do nothing but treat it with the utmost admiration and respect. One of the best movies ever made.",Rushmore
15,zetes,Nothing special,9,8 August 2001,"I don't understand the enormously positive reaction this film has had. I mean, yeah, it's a decent flick, quite entertaining, but it's nothing all that memorable. The story is generally a good one, and pretty original. It does have some major flaws, though. I didn't buy it when Max and Herman began warring against each other. It seemed false to me. As for the acting, I seem to think against the grain here. Common knowledge tells you that Billy Murray gives the performance of a lifetime and that he was absolutely robbed when it comes to Oscar nominations. Often, I hear that Murray's failure to get nominated is the fault of Jason Schwartzman, who plays Max, the main character of this film. Supposedly, his character was thought so unlikable by many critics and, apparently, Academy members that Rushmore was ignored. In my opinion, Bill Murray gives a particularly forgettable performance (he has been so much better in other films) and it is Jason Schwartzman who makes the film at all worth watching. I give the film a 7/10, but to say that it is one of the best films ever does nothing but show just how few films you've actually seen.",Rushmore
16,namashi_1,Awesome!,9,23 May 2011,"'Rushmore', Co-Written and Directed by Wes Anderson, is An Awesome Comedy-Drama, that is filled with engaging & interesting moments. The Characters get their due to the strong performances, and the script is brought on screen, with proper execution.About an eccentric teenager named Max Fischer, played remarkably by Jason Schwartzman, his friendship with rich industrialist Herman Blume, played by Bill Murray, and their mutual love for elementary school teacher Rosemary Cross, played Olivia Williams, 'Rushmore' is a treat to watch.Anderson and Owen Wilson's Writing is superb. This cult favorite, as mentioned, is filled with engaging & interesting moments. Even the characters, are so well-defined and diverse from one another. Only thing, I thought the pacing was a bit slow. Especially in the middle, the pacing becomes slow. But a worthy culmination, makes up for it.Anderson's Direction is cool, as well. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is fair. The soundtrack is wonderful. Performance-Wise: Jason Schwartzman owns the film with a remarkable performance. Bill Murray is decent, while Olivia Williams is flawless. Mason Gamble is excellent. Luke Wilson appears in a cameo.On the whole, Don't Miss This One! It's Lively, Entertaining & Different. Two Thumbs Up!",Rushmore
17,StevePulaski,"I lack the proper requirements, er, eccentricities",6,7 June 2012,"Rushmore is one of those rare movie experiences for me where I absolutely don't know what to make of it. I've seen my share of indie comedies, quirky films with cleverly subtle nuances, and an intricate focus, but this one has me truly baffled. For the first time in a long time, the screen I was facing and I, myself, had no connection. It was showing me a movie I particularly wasn't following, and I was desperately trying to comprehend why the events were happening, how and for what significance.The movie is not by any means confusing, for that matter, it is fairly simple, but I was trying to search for the comedy in its material, the delivery in its dialog, and the wit in its nuances. This is director Wes Anderson's second feature film after the dismissed Bottle Rocket, and both films share my current view of the man himself; he makes films with a certain whimsicality to them, but overall, they're not that funny and simply not that interesting as a whole. It's a tad harsh to say that, but I was not truly lifted into the zone of appreciation watching either picture. I smiled a lot, chuckled solemnly, but afterwards I felt dry and unfulfilled.In Rushmore, we follow Max Fischer (Schwartzman), a precocious Sophomore who earned himself a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore Academy. Despite the high expectations of the boy, Max is a slacker when it comes to schoolwork, but is more than willing to start up a new club or write an offbeat play. He grabs the attention of Rushmore alumni Herman Blume (Murray), and winds up becoming close with the man. It isn't long before their friendship deteriorates into nothing when Herman starts crushing on first grade school teacher, Rosemary Cross (Williams), also Max's crush.Meanwhile, while all this is in the mix, Max learns from his principal (Brian Cox) that he is will be given one more chance, but if he fails another test, he is gone, expelled from the Academy. I have no doubt that all of this could have been incorporated in a funny comedy or a relatively steady drama. I envision a drama focusing on the aspect of failing and trying your hardest only to not succeed because of an albatross or limitations to be a rather poignant subject a film could explore, yet still keep the whimsicality Anderson loves to work with.Sadly, none of that is explored, and the film feels the whole concept is one big joke. Its protagonist, to begin with, is an unlikable manipulator of epic proportions, can't give the audience a reason to side with him, and his crush on his first grade teacher is odd and unfitting to the story. What I believe Rushmore is truly trying to be is a tough slice of life, yet it is taken in such a peculiar manner that even that becomes questionable.Now there are elements that are nicely incorporated into the film. The warmth of Bottle Rocket has been traded for a rather crisp look in Rushmore, where the film occupies a very deep widescreen (also called letterbox). It's unusual, yet while the movie is shown in a smaller frame than normal, it appears with more clarity and distinction. It's also safe to say that Jason Schwartzman clearly tried all he possibly good so that the Max character rubs the audience the right way. He is a quirky character, although an acquired taste. Some will see him as a nuance, I see him as an annoyance. But that's not to say Schwartzman's performance isn't very likable. The same goes for Bill Murray, who plays the role of a disillusioned man in search of a home quite nicely.Yet Rushmore still feels a tad underdeveloped and rather vacuous. I guess I lack the proper eccentricities to enjoy such a picture.Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, and Brian Cox. Directed by: Wes Anderson.",Rushmore
18,=G=,A creative and fresh little humorous drama-lite.,6,21 January 2001,"""Rushomre"" is a lighthearted story about a 15 year old Rushmore Academy prodigy, Max (Schwartzman), who, though on the verge of flunking out, is so bright and manipulative he practically runs the school from the bottom up...until he falls in love with a beautiful teacher. The film never gets to the audience hug though it does offer creativity, humor, and a sort of stilted charm. A fun flick which has been misbilled as a romantic comedy. Romantic it is not.",Rushmore
19,MovieAddict2016,Great dry comedy,8,1 April 2005,"""Rushmore"" is a very funny movie but also a touching one. The first time I saw it, I hated it, finding it dry, humorless and stupid. However on second viewing I realized it's very good and smart, and the dry humor is just Wes Anderson's style - something Bill Murray plays into perfectly.Murray is the rich businessman who befriends a smart 15-year-old named Max, both of whom fall for the same woman, a teacher at Max's school. Max is like Martin Short from ""Clifford"" - menacing and able to turn his ""sweetness"" on and off to his advantage. It's a film packed full of perfect performances and Murray's sardonic characterization of the depressed alcoholic peaks with the pool dive scene.""Rushmore"" is aptly directed, well written and convincingly staged. Some of its quirky characters seem a bit too silly (the whole ""children are smarter than adults"" angle gets old real quick with just about every child in this movie acting like a grown-up), but that's a small fault in a movie that made me laugh, out loud, many times, and at the same time feel attached to the characters - not many comedies are able to pull that off anymore.",Rushmore
20,lasttimeisaw,a launch pad of Anderson's distinctively quirky aesthetic pursuit,7,2 December 2016,"Wes Anderson's sophomore feature, RUSHMORE is the name of an elite prep school in Houston, and our protagonist, a 15-year-old Max Fischer (Schwartzman), is the whip-smart prodigy in Rushmore, a high-school specimen of GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997), but only if it were true, that's just a figment of his imagination in the film's jaunty opening, in reality, he is a barber's son, although, to hide his deep-down low self-confidence, Max brags about that his father is a successful surgeon. Max is granted entrance to Rushmore for his playwright talent, but he flunks in almost every major subject, while a plethora of extracurricular activities corroborates that Max is not made of scholarly material. As a matter of fact, he is on the verge of being expelled from the school by the headmaster Dr. Guggenheim (Cox), but that doesn't bother him too much, he befriends Herman Blume (Murray), the father of his objectionable twin classmates, an industrialist whose life is hemmed in a lull of disillusion. Also, reaching prepubescence lands him his first crush on the newly arrived first-grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Williams), a widow from England, but she doesn't reciprocate her feeling due to their age difference, and, spontaneously they remain in a mutually agreed friend zone. Turning sour when Rosemary brings a date to his new school play, Max unveils his age-defying megalomaniac side which riles Rosemary and pours cold water on their budding affinity. Soon Max is as expected being expelled and enrolls into a public school, and falls out with his younger sidekick Dirk Calloway (Gamble). When he finds out Herman and Rosemary becomes an item, a puerile tit-for-tac game of sabotages kick-starts with the typical Anderson-esque moxie, sandwiched between those two man-children, one is too young and another is too old, and neither is proper to her taste, one does feel sorry for Ms. Cross. Luckily, in a well-intention-ed move, Max writes a new play paying tribute to Herman's Vietnam days, and finally, all the hatchets have been buried in the opening night of the play, Rushmore days are gone with the wind, Max finds an age- commensurate Asian girlfriend Margaret Young (Tanaka), Herman and Rosemary also reconcile. Playing out Max's defects and merits with deadpan but farcical felicity, a pint-size Schwartzman under-girds his stereotypical screen-image in his screen-debut, self-consciously loquacious and obnoxiously self-centred. Bill Murray, whose stalled career has received a critical boost since he meets Anderson and becomes a prominent figure in the latter's ever-expanding star-studded troupe, brings about what a great farceur can achieve, subtle humor saddled with immeasurable humanity, he is pitch-perfect.

21,paul2001sw-1,Self-regarding,5,18 February 2011,"'Rushmore' is a film about a nerdy, precocious, scholarship kid attending a posh private school in the U.S.; and as such, it seems to be based on an interesting premise. But director Wes Anderson is known for his ""quirkiness""; and what that actually means, inevitably it seems, is films about implausibly odd people with improbable amounts of money dead-panning their way through a series of deliberately flat jokes whose main purpose appears to be to assert the cleverness of the writer/director in daring to defy the normal conventions of narrative and character. Occasional moments are funny, but refusing to acknowledge your own outrageousness can only take you so far; unfortunately, Anderson has managed to build an entire career on it. Even some who dislike his later movies like 'Rushmore', one of his earliest; but having seen many of his other films first, I can only see the same self-indulgent smugness of his other films. At least we're spared Owen Wilson's goofy act in this one (although he does co-write)",Rushmore
22,gbill-74877,Dream big,8,21 September 2018,"Quirky, offbeat, and clever; everything we like about director Wes Anderson. We really don't know what's going to happen as the story plays out, in part because of how unique the characters are, and in part because the film plays as fantasy. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a teenage boy at Rushmore Academy, acts as though he's a worldly middle-aged man, pursuing an improbably large number of extracurricular activities, writing plays, and not caring all that much about his studies. Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman dissatisfied with his wife's adultery and his two boorish sons, is drawn to Max, and befriends him. However, when the two of them begin vying for the same woman (Olivia Williams), a rivalry develops. What's fascinating about the film is the interplay of these two characters. Blume begins acting in all sorts of juvenile ways, which is an interesting mirror to how precocious Max is. The disillusionment Blume is going through, hammered home with a scene at his dingy, suburban pool where he does a cannonball after downing his whiskey and then stays underwater as it to escape from it all, is similar to the angst we might associate with an adolescent. The breadth of Max's interests, his higher-level thinking about the important things in life, his audacious schemes, and the confidence he exudes pursuing a romance with a teacher or breezing down the hallway in his blazer, is like a powerful movie mogul (or adolescent dream). Anderson gives us a humanizing bridge here between people at the age of 15 and 50.Mixed in to all of this are lots of little moments that are funny or touching. I loved the message that's delivered in a subtle way amidst the fun of the film. Dream big, it seems to tell us; be brave, and don't be afraid to be different. Following the conventional path may lead to outward success, but unhappiness. It's telling to me that Max's father, a humble barber, is the most content character of all. I think the love triangle went on a little longer than it should have, and it would have been nice to see more of Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), but it was nice that the film never fell into predictability. Very entertaining.",Rushmore

24,ironhorse_iv,"This movie isn't as grand as Mount Rushmore. However, it's somewhat a great classic to watch",7,10 October 2015,"You can always tell, that you're watching a Wes Anderson's film, due to his many, now, iconic film signatures. While, the 1996 film, Bottle Rocket was his debut work; most of his well-known monikers were establish, here in his second film, Rushmore. Rushmore tells the story of a gifted precocious young student, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), whom is incredibly bright, but scatterbrained, preferring to do extracurricular activities, instead of actual schoolwork. When, an attractive new teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) arrives at his school, Rushmore Academy, he became so smitten with her, that he willing to do, anything to be, with her. Even, fight with his mentor/friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a local business, over her affection. Can Max's young heart win Rosemary's love, or will the seasoned, Herman gain the upper hand, in this romantic comedy? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, thank goodness, this love-affair movie remains lighthearted and whimsical throughout, because it really could come off, as disturbing and particularly dark, with the wrong director. After all, a comedy about two intimacy seekers, a perverted middle age man & a teenager boy hopelessly stalking after a woman, can seem a bit Erotomania in the wrong eyes and could be frown-upon, by others. Also, it's a bit hard to watch to see, two friends, nearly kill each other, over something stupid. Somehow, Wes Anderson was able to make the concept seem likable, without really changing much of the story to fit, a family-friendly mold. Often, others obsessive love-story movies for me, always seem a bit annoying & exaggerated, but Rushmore was not only, able to be, entertaining, but very well-received, kinda funny. No wonder, this quirky coming of age movie has a cult following. It's weird to think, that this was Jason Schwartzman's first film. He looks so seasoned. Bill Murray, on another hand, save his then dying-career with this film. He pretty much, owns a life-debt to Anderson. He has been in every Wes Anderson films, as of this writing, ever-since. Still, he was just alright for the most part, in this role. I love both of their off-kilter performances, here, even if it's not much of a stretch, in 'let's say, acting'. After all, Jason Schwartzman in person, is kinda an oddball, and Bill Murray, looks so wore-down by age, that it's hard to say, that he even, acting any differing. Still, I love their chemistry, together. It reminds me, so much of 1971's Harold and Maude, with their May-December friendship. Anderson has always been noted for his unique 'literary geek chic' writing style. Anderson's films are often known for its character-driven plot full of melancholic elements. Themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, adultery, and unlikely friendships are some of his best. It shows here. I love his exclusive way of fitting in, the oddest of cultural references such as Jacques Costeau & Jacque Henri Lartique in his own unique, ingenious style. Any scene with the Max Fischer Players performing on stage is a great example of that. I also love his taste in music. Anderson frequently uses a lot of British pop music from the 1960s and 70s on the soundtracks of his films. In Rushmore, Cat Stevens and British Invasion groups are used, very well. It's doesn't drown out, the visually on the screen. Much has been written about director Wes Anderson's style in filmmaking as well. Visually, his films always stand out, due to his often bright, but also limited color palette. I love, his often retro look. Anderson has also been noted for his extensive use of obsessively symmetrical compositions, flat space camera moves, snap-zooms, and slow-motion walking shots. All-well used here. His use of hand-made artwork by his brother, Eric Chase Anderson also worth-noting. These stylistic choices give his movies a highly distinctive quality in surrealism. His films has often provoked much critical study, discussion, supercuts and mash-ups, and even parody. Rushmore is no different. However, while the movie is quirky, colorful, and highly glamorous. I, personally, don't think, its director Wes Anderson's best film. I like his later works, somewhat more. His kooky European hyper-realistic imagery style is more of my taste. It was somewhat limited here, due to the films modern U.S settling, and lack of fantasy elements. Overall: While, the movie does have some faults. Rushmore is still, an intensely intellectual film worth checking out. It's compelling visually as well, as verbally. I do recommended.",Rushmore

26,The-Sarkologist,"A movie about unrequited love, and knowing when to quit",9,9 November 2013,"I guess at first I thought this was going to be a really bad, annoying, Revenge of the Nerds rip off. In fact I was very wrong. Rushmore is a very powerful movie about a friendship torn apart over the love of one woman. It is about a boy who is far more mature than those of his own age, yet he is lacking in regards, including understanding what a relationship really means. In fact it is one of the rare Hollywood movies where the main character gives up on the girl, but that is the whole point of the movie.Rushmore is about a boy named Max Fischer, who goes to the exclusive Rushmore School. He is very intelligent, though is failing in class. What he is good at though is networking and building up a base of alliances and friendships. At one assembly he meets Mr Blume (Bill Murry) and immediately sets to work forming a relationship with him. He then discovers Miss Cross, a prep teacher, after reading a hand written note in a book. Through numerous events, Mr Blume and Miss Cross become attracted to each other.Even then the movie is not as simple as that. The main focus of the movie is Fischer's lust over Miss Cross and how he comes to terms with the fact that he can never have her. Why can he never have her? Well the reasons seem simple, but mainly that he is fifteen and she is a lot older. They actually get along very well, but she sees him as an intelligent fifteen year old who really does not understand what relationships are all about. Fischer not only must come to terms with her continual rejection, but also that his friend, Mr Blume, is also in love with her.My friend commented on how this is a really hard movie to watch. I don't think so. I guess the hard thing is that the movie says, clearly, that there are going to be women which you simply cannot have. Sometimes enough is enough and you must accept defeat. The thing with Fischer is that there was a perfectly nice girl following him around, but he was too caught up in Miss Cross that he did not realise she existed. When he finally stepped back he saw her. In a way is seems that he took second best, but I think the woman that he is dating at the end of the movie is by far the best woman for him.What about us? When do we know when to quit? Well I can't really answer that question. Sometimes we just don't know if we are chasing a Miss Cross or not. Miss Cross is a mature and intelligent woman who simply could not form a serious relationship with somebody as immature as Fischer. Indeed Fischer is immature, especially the comment he made regarding his protégé's mother, but the thing is that he learnt from this mistake. The big problem is that he is fifteen, a lot younger than Miss Cross, and even though relationships of that age difference do exist, Cross was not interested in it. She wanted somebody whom she felt comfortable with, and she did not feel comfortable with a boy.I think we can take things from this movie, but we shouldn't go out with a woman because we did not get our first choice. We should go out with somebody we want to. I don't know the full thing with Fischer, but it seems that the realisation was that why was he chasing a woman that could not handle a relationship with him when there was a perfectly good woman wanting one. In my case, well it is probably the same. I really don't want to let go, especially since the woman I like is quite stubborn. But there is really no clear cut answer. I guess the key is to be patient (which is not a human trait).",Rushmore
27,Floated2,"Well written, offbeat and clever",7,22 September 2010,"""Rushmore"" is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny. It is well made, and does contain a few momentous comic fires, but never enough to recommend of that genre. Its really more dramatic though not much. Some audiences may find the material quite bleak, while others may think it is obscured. Doubtless, not many people will find it raveable.The film's protagonist is a trouble making student at the Rushmore Academy named Max Fisher, one of the greatest schools in America. He loves where he goes to school, more than anything. He gets poor grades, but is apart of many clubs/teams. In a particular scene he states that Rushmore is his life. This un-realistic lust for schooling is necessary for developing the character's personality which latter carries the dim plot though turmoil.After the Max character is fully understood, we begin to receive plot clinches of all sorts. First, Max is threatened with ""sudden death expulsion"" since he is such a bad student. Second, he ominously falls in love with a first grade teacher who also works at Rushmore. Her name is Miss Cross. Then Max begins to do very strange things, like building an aquarium in replacement of the school's baseball diamond. Not your typical student, this is how he gets expelled from Rushmore and gets sent to another school.The film's antagonist is Mr. Blume, who is an old grumpy, almost full time drunk, mentor who works at Rushmore. He also loves Miss. Cross, which eventually leads to an affair involving the two. Max then becomes jealous and serious, and at times, dangerous conflicts result. Though Max and Mr.Blume are close friends. In many scenes Mr.Blume and Max both refer to one another as ""friends"" The film starts out promising and different, then kinda downfalls. It goes downhill from the point where he meets Margaret Yang, then when she becomes more in the story. The last few scenes at the play are rather boring and dull and could have been much better. I also didn't like the ending too much",Rushmore

30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The comfort food of Wes Anderson movies,9,17 July 2017,"No coming-of-age film, before or since ""Rushmore,"" has been so intellectual and yet so gleefully immature. Wes Anderson's sophomore effort remains one of his best for its unorthodox depiction of teen angst, which sees 15-year-old private prodigy Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) deal with academic probation, fall for an older woman and form an unlikely friendship with a school parent.Anderson brings a certain indelible spirit to his work that frankly has no equal, and ""Rushmore"" stands among the finest examples of his playful attitude and wealth of artistic knowledge, if for no other reason than the familiarity of the film's school setting. Max is a rogue and a brat, but a genius in his own right; he simply puts his skills to use in all the wrong applications. He represents all of us who were misunderstood high school students, yet also the smart ass that everyone despises — at the same time.It takes a certain young man to epitomize both the height of teenage pretension and the baseness of teenage mischief – not to mention match wits with Bill Murray. A sure sign of what would be a long Hollywood career, Schwartzman goes toe to toe with Murray, who plays Herman Blume, a local industrialist who takes a liking to Max, a mentorship that soon turns to rivalry.Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson craft a familiar but exaggerated world in ""Rushmore."" Max cannot be president of two dozen clubs, or stage elaborate plays with explosions in no time at all, but the mere suggestions provide a comedic underpinning for a story of a student so extra-curricularly driven that he's failing school, and how his middle class background (unlike his wealthy classmates) factors in. And there's his blind love of Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams) juxtaposed with the fact that he lost his mother when he was young. So for as silly as ""Rushmore"" gets, at its core is about people, young and old, who have experienced loss and are trying to grapple with ""sic transit gloria mundi,"" how quickly the world changes around them. Anderson and Wilson bury this in a lot of fluff, but the fluff isn't frivolous – it contributes to Anderson's unusual (though now familiar and much acclaimed) tone.Like any teen movie worth its salt, ""Rushmore"" makes great use of its soundtrack, creating a renegade, anti-authority vibe that fittingly misrepresents what the film is all about, adding another layer of comedic value. The entire film is littered with cultural references both familiar and obscure – it's what makes Anderson esoteric but also so appealing to certain film fans.It can be easy to lose ""Rushmore"" in this thicket of style and references at times, but many more features into Anderson's filmography, it still feels among his most accessible. This is a familiar story populated with familiar people, as larger than life as it all gets, and Anderson often likes to venture out there. ""Rushmore"" is a nice home base to return to for devoted fans and casual admirers both.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Rushmore

32,Anonymous_Maxine,This is weird  a school comedy with some thought put into it.,9,2 April 2001,"(spoilers) The film Rushmore had a lot to say about relationships and loyalty. It dealt both with romantic relationships as well as friendships, and the importance of honesty in those relationships. Even more than that however, the film was about the depths that people will sink to when they feel cheated out of a romantic relationship, and the massive retaliation that may come to the person who benefited from that person's broken heart. Max Fischer, who was the subject that was deprived of a coveted partner, illustrates this idea with the noteworthy quote, `War does funny things to men.'Rushmore is the story of an extremely geeky high school kid who develops an unusually strong crush on a new teacher named Rosemary Cross at Rushmore Academy, the school that he attends. He begins to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve Ms. Cross's attention and to impress her despite their significant age difference, and after a while he begins to become preoccupied with these efforts. He wants to build a huge aquarium on school campus in her honor, and one of his sponsors is a rich businessman named Herman Blume. Unfortunately, Max's infatuation is not returned to him by Ms. Cross, who feels that they are obviously not right for each other. When she begins dating Blume after having denied Max's romantic advances, Max declares war on him.When Ms. Cross and Herman began dating, he had recently had a rough break-up, and is more than likely a little lovesick about it, and possibly feels like a victim. As a result, he seems to want to project his pain onto someone else, and Max is the one that this anger falls on. It seems as though his relationship with Ms. Cross is as much a way for him to lash out at someone else as it is a romantic endeavor. One way that this is shown is when Herman was walking through a playground where a few young kids are playing basketball. One of them shoots the ball for the basket, and for no other apparent reason than just because he was there, Herman blocks the kid's shot. This crudely symbolizes his efforts to block Max's efforts towards Ms. Cross, and also displays Herman's side of the war that love has provoked between himself and Max, who until now had no problem with one another. The other side of this war is Max's retaliation from having the object of his affection taken from him by another man. This is a major turning point in the film, where it switches from containing elements of a romantic comedy to much darker situations of anger and contempt between two people fighting over the same woman. Neither Max nor Herman does anything serious at first that could alter the other person's life; Herman runs over Max's bicycle with his car, Max delivers bees into Herman's room at one point, etc. However, Max does go as far as to tell Herman's wife that he is involved with this other woman, which may have been overstepping his bounds a little bit. Being younger, Max is not as wary of the consequences of an act like this, he just wants to do anything possible to hurt the person who hurt him. This is an example of the funny things that war does to men.
All of the characters in Rushmore do a lot of very effective acting with their faces and body language, and there are also a lot of scenes in which there is little to no dialogue. Max is always dressed very sharply, unless he is dressed up in costume for one of his plays. Also, for a fifteen-year-old boy, Max speaks with surprising maturity. Even though he is a terrible student, he is obviously talented, and seems to feel superior to a lot of the older people around him. One good example is, of course, Herman. It seems that Max feels that he is superior to Herman and this intensifies his anger when Ms. Cross denies his amorous advances and instead dates Herman.The play that Max directed which was shown near the end of the film seems to almost summarize the entire film. The play was about a military war which Max himself had a leading role in, and it represented the war between himself and Herman Blume. At the end of the play, after countless casualties (i.e. Herman's marriage, any chance Max may ever have had with Ms. Cross, etc), Max's character is faced with a woman from the opposing army, and they are pointing rifles at each other. They make a verbal truce with each other, almost romantically. Offstage, this girl seems to be the person that Max may be starting to have feelings for, showing that he has overcome his obsession with Ms. Cross. He has found someone within his reach and looks like he has finally found a way to be happy  a good ending to a great film.",Rushmore

An unlikely love triangle between a teenager, his teacher and a local business tycoon that's simultaneously funny, absurd and heartbreaking.Jason Schwartzman is great, and Bill Murray may do his best work ever - side-splittingly funny, but with a damaged, sad, sometimes dangerous edge just under the surface.As in all of Anderson's films, terrific use of songs as score, wonderfully inventive transitions and visual framing. And a lot of fun.",Rushmore
34,drqshadow-reviews,Book Brilliance and Social Struggles at an Insular Private School,9,19 April 2020,"Well, it's a Wes Anderson movie, and that alone is usually enough for most people to draw their own conclusions. He's a divisive filmmaker and it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground between those who love him and those who loathe him. Count me in the former camp. For what it's worth, Rushmore is probably Anderson at his most accessible. All the hallmarks are here - the cast is thoroughly quirky, the cinematography obsessively detail-focused, the soundtrack firmly planted in lyrically-appropriate 60s and 70s rock - but it's all somewhat toned down from his usual level; less in-your-face, take-it-or-leave-it.The film's subject, an insular private school and the odd, hyper-focused youths who proudly call it home, lends itself to such idiosyncrasies. Here we find all manner of brilliant young minds, developed well past their years in some respects but stunted in many others. That essential duality is interesting, amusing, understandable. They've been taught to solve for x and y, to adapt mature films for the stage (example: Serpico for kids), but remain remedial students of human interaction.Max, the focus of this personality-driven black comedy, is a perfect exhibit. At fifteen, it looks like his best days are already behind him and he struggles to compensate with a flood of strangely specific extracurriculars and, later, a sadly misguided reach for forbidden fruit: a smart, attractive, widowed first-grade teacher. He's accompanied by a colorful fabric of supporting characters. Plenty of amusingly unbalanced students, sure, but also a curious batch of equally dysfunctional adults. Bill Murray works magic with one of these roles, a tough mix of frustrated parent, self-loathing businessman, unexpected mentor and hopeful suitor. He and Jason Schwartzman (Max) share instant chemistry and the film wisely sticks them together like glue, even when their characters are at each other's throats.In all, Rushmore is a well-tuned, somewhat downplayed, dose of the Anderson style: funny, driven, melancholy and genuine. His films might not speak to everyone, but they usually hit the mark for me. This is one of the best.",Rushmore
35,MBunge,One of the best stories ever told about growing up,8,8 June 2011,"Rushmore is one of the great films about growing up because it's about a kid not nearly as grown up as he appears. By giving their main character so many adult qualities, these filmmakers manage to emphasize how young and immature he really is in a dear yet unsentimental way. Unique, marvelously written and remarkably performed, this film is a joy to watch.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is the heart of this story. A 15 year old barber's son who's attended class at Rushmore private school for most of his life on an academic scholarship, he's one of the most amazing teenagers you'll ever meet. Like a dark-haired force of nature, he's the leader or a member of nearly every extracurricular activity on campus, including being the writer and director of the school's theater. With the help of his younger right hand man Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble), Max is like the grand marshal and Rushmore is his parade.About the only person Max doesn't have one up on is Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox), headmaster of the school and the one who gave Max his academic scholarship. For all his cool energy and ambition, Max is the worst student at Rushmore and gets put on academic probation. With that hanging over him, Max meets what will become the two most important people of his youth - millionaire factory owner Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and new Rushmore 1st grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). He sees Blume as the sort of defiantly self-made man he wants to be and Cross becomes the first woman he falls in love with. But then Blume falls in love with Cross and nothing in Max's exceptional life will ever be the same.Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson came up with a sparkling and inventive script here, one that avoids the problems and pitfalls that plague so many small and quirky stories. While Rushmore only has a little bit more plot than the typical ""here's some stuff that happened to people"" film, it tightly focuses on the character of Max. We only see enough of the others so they can effectively play their parts in Max's story. Almost all of the important moments in their lives happen off screen and we only see the result on them when they re-enter Max's orbit. That focus sustains the connection between the audience and Max and leaves the viewer wanting to see what happens to him next. Most lightly plotted and intentionally clever tales tend to ramble, go off on tangents and fall in on themselves. That doesn't at all happen with Rushmore.The best script in the world, however, is for naught if the actors don't deliver. These performers are more than equal to this amazing writing. Jason Schwartzman does an exceptional job with a character who understands so much about the rest of the world and so little about his own feelings. Max is a 15 year old hyper-achiever, the sort who will go on to do great things in whatever field he chooses. But at this moment in his life, the most important thing is that he's still just 15 years old and doesn't know how to handle his emotions. Bill Murray is also excellent as man who made something of the success that's in Max's future, but has sort of tipped over onto the other side of his life and now has to deal with how much of it is beyond his control. And Olivia Williams is great as the center point between Blume and Max. Max sees her as his passageway to manhood, but he can only truly get there by not getting her. Blume sees her as his path back to the man and the life he once imagined he'd have, but he can only get her by embracing the man that he is. It would be easy for an actress to get washed out in that role, but Williams shines. She perfectly reflects the appeal that Cross finds in the extraordinary boy that is Max and perfectly affirms that separation between boy and woman that has to keep them apart.Rushmore is about how learning you can't get everything you want is the only way to ever have anything of value in your life, because only in moving past what you want can you see what it is you need. It's also damned funny. Go watch it.",Rushmore
36,estebangonzalez10,My favorite Wes Anderson film,10,15 April 2014,"""The secret, I don't know... I guess you've just gotta find something you love to do and then... do it for the rest of your life. For me, it's going to Rushmore.""The Royal Tenenbaums has always been my favorite Wes Anderson movie and I always thought it was because it was the first one of his that I had seen, but it can officially move over now because I have a new favorite: Rushmore. This film was so charming, the soundtrack so cool, and the characters so well developed that I was completely in love with it once the credits started rolling. Not only is it my favorite Wes Anderson film, but it also belongs on my all time favorite list as well. I am a sucker for coming of age stories and this was a great one with perhaps one of Anderson's best developed characters from all his filmography: Max Fischer. All of Anderson's films have a similar style with offbeat and quirky themes and a hyper reality where the characters sometimes resemble those we imagine in our heads when we are reading a fantasy book. At times they are hard to connect with because they seem to belong in another time and place, but Wes manages to draw us into his world kind of like in the same way we are drawn to a theater play. That is why I also loved the special touches from Anderson as he incorporates school plays with wonderful productions into his movies. I think Rushmore is his most complete film with a charming ending, a memorable odd couple pairing, and a weird love triangle that features some of Anderson's most romantic work (similar in that sense to Moonrise Kingdom). As much as I enjoyed his first film, Bottle Rocket, it was Rushmore where he truly defines and finds his style with those production designs that seem taken from a stage play or a colorful children's book (especially seen in the scenes where Max visits the principal's office). I absolutely fell in love with Rushmore and this will be the measuring stick for Wes Anderson's films from now on.This wonderful and witty screenplay written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson begins with a dream sequence where Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is in math class solving an extremely difficult equation and thus saving his classmates from ever having to open a math book again. His friend, Dirk (Mason Gamble), awakes him just before a millionaire industrialist named Herman Blue (Bill Murray) is about to begin his chapel speech. He has two sons in Rushmore Academy, one of the most expensive and prestigious schools in the country. Max is fascinated by this man's speech and so at the end he introduces himself to Herman and the two form a special bond together. Max is in love with Rushmore and his entire life revolves around the school and he finds in Herman someone who has achieved the success he's aiming for, while Herman is a disillusioned man who has lost his purpose in life and sees in Max someone determined who enjoys life. Up to this point one would think Max is the perfect student, but the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox) explains to Herman that he actually is the worst scholarly student due to his involvement in dozens of extracurricular activities (such as being the editor of the school newspaper, president of the chess, astronomy, beekeeping, and French clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play). Unlike the rest of the students, Max isn't a wealthy kid, his father Bert (Seymour Cassel) is a barber, so he's a scholarship student that is about to lose it due to his bad grades. Max and Herman's friendship is tested when they both fall in love with the widowed first grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). This is were the thin line between friends and enemies begin as Max and Herman begin a feud over Miss Cross.What makes Rushmore stand out above other Wes Anderson films (I have liked all of them) is the great pairing of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray's characters. Both of them, despite having completely opposite personalities, complete each other because they see in each other what they want to become. Max aspires to be successful in life and doesn't want to become a barber like his father (that is why he always lies about his profession), while Herman despite having it all is completely disillusioned with his marriage and spoiled children. Max's passion for life is what captivates Herman because it is what he has lost. This bond is broken once Rosemary enters the picture and they both become infatuated with winning her love. Max will do anything for her, including building a giant aquarium in the school's baseball diamond or directing a successful play. Max is my favorite character despite not being entirely likable, while Murray's portrayal of Herman is sensational. He delivers one of his best and most memorable performances and shines in each scene he shares with Max or Rosemary. There are several hilarious lines and quirky moments that also balanced out perfectly with the more subtle emotional and romantic ones. This film has a lot of heart and Anderson really delivers here with his unique style (a lot of his trademarks can be found here like the slow-motion and wide angle shots, the inclusion of at least one Rolling Stones song on the soundtrack, the underwater shot, and the influence of the Charlie Brown cartoon). It's an inspired film and Anderson creates a unique world that at times seems distant from reality, but somehow he manages to create these rich characters that are easy to identify with or relate to in such a way that they manage to touch us without being overly sentimental.",Rushmore
37,jimbo-53-186511,"Its 'easy to relate to' premise is what's likely to win most people over, but for me Rushmore is only a partial success (MINOR SPOILERS)",4,4 January 2016,"Schoolboy Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman)and millionaire Herman Blume (Bill Murray) are both on a collision course when they both fall in love with schoolteacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams).Normally I'd write a bit more of a plot summary for most films that I'm reviewing but I think the above summary pretty much sums up the entire story for the film. Essentially it's a very slight coming-of-age story with a slice of The Graduate thrown in for good measure.I think the biggest selling point for this film is that it's a very easy film to relate to - I'm sure there are many people who have had a crush on a teacher at some point in their lives (I suspect this applies to more people than will care to admit it). It's this aspect of the film that makes it very easy to identify with Max - all the schemes that he plans and the numerous ways that he tries to impress Ms Cross are quite amusing and daft, but are mostly believable given the fact that he's besotted with Ms Cross. This essentially is what I'd class as the good parts of the film so I'll now address some of the issues that I had with the film.....First of all there's Bill Murray's character Herman Blume; I didn't think that he was developed particularly well - the film occasionally hints on problems he's having with his two sons, but never really expands upon these problems. Also unlike Max, Herman isn't as easy to identify with. I also struggled understanding why Ms Cross would be drawn to Herman quite so easily - the film never really shows him 'wooing' her so I didn't really understand how he ended up hooking up with her. Therefore I was given no reason to care when they broke up.I was also disappointed with how little I laughed whilst watching this film; it's one of those films that contains many awkward scenes, but doesn't manage to make many of these awkward scenes funny. Therefore the film contained many awkward moments, but very few funny moments - the only scene that made me laugh was Max's drunken outbursts round the table.Nearly all the cast put in fine work; Schwartzman is excellent here and makes many of his scenes memorable. Bill Murray was also good here (even if his character is a little underwritten). The supporting cast (consisting mainly of teenagers) were all superb as well.Rushmore's 'easy to relate to' premise should have made it a winner, but to me much of it was a bit too quirky and awkward (it's almost like Anderson was so focused on these two aspects that he completely forgot about number three - HUMOUR). Rushmore deserve some praise for it being accessible to a wide audience, but for me there were way too many problems with the film and nowhere near enough laughs for me to truly be able to enjoy it.",Rushmore

39,alansabljakovic-39044,Wes Anderson is underrated,8,10 December 2018,Genius movie about teenagers in high school and their problems. I love Wes Anderson because he has his own style and doesn't copy anybody. He doesn't do sequels and has original content which is amazing. His obssesion about details is amazing and his centered shots are breathtaking. This is his early work and yet one of his best. Bill Murray is great as always and Schwartzman is amazing in all Anderson's films.I will be watching all Wes Anderson's films( he has 9 of them but I probably won't watch Bottle Rocket). 5/8 films watched so 3 more to go. Please comment if you have watched Bottle Rocket and tell me if it is worth the watch.,Rushmore
40,ferbs54,"Quirky With A Capital ""Q""",7,14 August 2009,"Far from the riotous laff fest that I had somehow expected, Wes Anderson's 1998 offering, ""Rushmore,"" turns out to be rather an idiosyncratic and quirky film...with a capital ""Q."" In it, we meet Max Fischer, a 15-year-old at a prep school called Rushmore Academy. Max is an underachieving student who nevertheless finds time to participate in some dozen-odd extracurricular activities. His life is turned around when he falls in love with the school's pretty 1st grade teacher and competes for her affections with a millionaire industrialist in a triangle that grows progressively more nasty and uncomfortable to watch. In the three leads, Jason Schwartzman is very fine as Max (it's hard to believe that this was his film debut), as is Olivia Williams as the British love interest and Bill Murray as the increasingly besotted but always likable Herman Blume (another Blume in love!). The film itself--though its story never seems to completely gel and several scenes peter out pointlessly--consistently defies expectations; I will admit that I could never tell where the darn thing was heading next. And it has been beautifully shot, with an interesting, eclectic soundtrack to match the oddball proceedings on screen. (Like another film that prominently featured songs by Cat Stevens, 1971's ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Rushmore"" seems a likely candidate for eventual ""cult movie"" status.) Though I was initially disappointed by the picture's lack of big belly laffs, a repeat viewing proved much more satisfying for me. Perhaps it is the type of movie that requires a few watches before growing on its audience. Like Max himself, the film has lots of hidden charm beneath its whackadoodle surface....",Rushmore
41,Agent10,Fine archetype of the dark comedy,9,14 May 2002,"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson were complete unknowns to me before watching this movie. Now, I will do anything to watch one of their films. This was easily one of the more unique films I have ever watched, simply because of the dreary comedic effect this film portrayed. It was a throwback in a sense, with smart comedy and 70s style cinematography and clothing, it was an interesting piece of history within a long and endless stream of garbage flicks and gross-out comedies. This film will forever stay in my head, and its one that will be hard to top.",Rushmore
42,Boyo-2,Nuts about it,10,21 December 1998,I love this movie to the point of pathology.  It stands alone in my movie-going history.  I will never forget Jason Schwatzman's performance as long as I live.  Can't wait to see it again.,Rushmore
43,rbverhoef,"Different, but good",7,25 December 2003,"'Rushmore' is different from most movies. I know you can say that for a lot of movies but with 'Rushmore' you expect one thing and something completely different happens. Early in the movie student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) meets a teacher named Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). I thought the movie was about to give us a strange romance between them, but the romance here is only from one side and therefore not exactly what I expected.The private school where this happens is called Rushmore. Max never studies and doesn't pass any subjects but is the leader of almost every extra-curricular activity. Too bad for him he is expelled after he has done something the principal was not so happy with. Since Rushmore, and Rosemary Cross for that matter, was his life he is not very happy. Mrs. Cross doesn't love him back but she is his friend. His two other friends are the much younger Dirk (Mason Gamble) and the much older Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Unfortunately for Max we see that his friends Rosemary Cross and Herman Blume fall in love with each other.Again, from here on you think you are able to predict a lot of the story but with 'Rushmore' it simply isn't so. It is one of the great things in this movie. I was also very surprised about the performances. Schwartzman and Williams are very good and Bill Murray does an extraordinary job. In a movie like this he finds the perfect note for his character. May be this movie is not for everyone, the funny moments are not right there on top, but it definitely is a good movie.",Rushmore

I'll have to get my hands on some in-depth reviews on this to understand more, maybe I am missing something in fully appreciating it.In the meantime, here is a 1 rating for thoroughly boring the hell out of me.",Rushmore
45,onepotato2,Funny & profound,10,6 May 2007,"I write this as I play hooky from two term papers that are due in two days.I won a copy of Rushmore on Ebay for very cheap a few weeks ago. I last saw it about 2 years ago. I watched it again when it arrived last week. For all the grief I've given Wes Anderson over the precious, overwrought Tennenbaums (and the equally despised Bottle Rocket) I have to say all is forgiven for making Rushmore. I now think it's the best movie I've seen in the last 20 years. I came late to the movie and have never seen it in a theater. I had the following conversation with a girl at work before seeing it.Her: I saw Rushmore this weekend ----- Me: How was it? ----- Her: It was OK.... ----- Me: It's a comedy? ------ Her: (thinking) No.Let's just say she's not acquainted with dry comedy. That mischaracterization and watching the movie after the Columbine event shifted my initial perception of it. It seemed like it could go some place violent and psychotic, like the similar ""If..."". Only after finishing it could I safely reassess it as a comedy, but now after seven or eight viewings I find it uproarious, which is not to say it's not also poignant.Anderson's style is breathtakingly accomplished for a 2nd feature (!). And the movie reveals more each time I see it. The structure that a viewer can't see, is being orchestrated masterfully by Anderson to pull it all together. It has an extraordinary range of characters none of whom are cheated by the script. The overarching absurdity of the movie is: Though there is concern over Max's bad grades, his classes are supposed to prepare him for life, not further classes. The accomplishments of his impressive extracurricular activities have already insured he's been supplied with a range of experiences and mastered them. He's more ready to be an adult than anyone. The movie forgivingly captures how dumb, driven and confused one is during adolescence, and has a lot of fun with it, but there's also room for a reconciliation with a defeated Bill Murray that's extraordinarily touching. Ultimately the movie you can't figure out on the initial viewing turns out to be a testament to friendship and forgiveness.After so many unworthy projects, Murray finds his perfect director, and is immediately transformed into a national treasure. The performances Anderson gets out of him, Schwartzman and Mason Gamble suggest a very attentive student of human behavior. Murray and Schwartman's performances deserved accolades. But one can't expect the blue-haired MPAA to know what time of day it is. They blew it ...as always.Here are my favorite thoughtful remarks from other reviews: ""With only his second film Anderson proves himself a director so in command of his medium he can ignore convention and make films his own way."" (Jeffrey Westhoff) ""Rushmore is often touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious."" (J.D. LaFrance) ""There's a thin line between homage and ripoff, and watching ""Rushmore"" walk that tightrope for 90 minutes could be as entertaining as American cinema has gotten in a long time."" (Desert News) ""Anderson has nothing but affection for his damaged characters, and he treats them with the dignity they deserve. From Bert, Max's unconditionally loving father, to Magnus, a gregarious Scottish thug, it's a genuine pleasure to spend time with these people."" (Edward Johnson-Ott) ""Now and again there comes a time when, part-way through a film, you realize that you're really enjoying it. Each scene opens to a sense of anticipation at the delights it will afford your world-weary soul, and when the closing credits finally roll you feel renewed"" (Andrew Howe)Lastly, I never use the word 'masterpiece' because it's a pretentious exhausted word used by people to express their own self-regard, but here's the closest I'll ever come: ""Three years ago Anderson and his writing partner Owen Wilson produced Bottle Rocket. But even fans of that film (which has a cult following) won't be prepared for the masterpiece that is Rushmore."" (Westhoff again)I could blather on, explaining why precisely this is such a great movie but I've said plenty. Thank you for this movie W.A.. It is an exhilarating piece of art.",Rushmore

The film follows Max when he meet two persons that will change his life: Herman Blume (Bill Murray) , a disillusioned millionaire who has an special admire to Max, and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed teacher who Max and Herman loves.""Rushmore"" is the second film written and directed by Wes Anderson, who right now is one of the bests American filmmakers working and this film is just another great one from his same team. I just love Anderson's style, that works in the same perfect way to all of his films, with all the strange characters, the beautiful colors, the titles of the things and all of those things that when you watch them you will know that is a Wes Anderson film. In this film, i love the character of Max who is a genius for all the extracurricular activities but nothing is appreciate by the Rushmore Academy. I love too how Max has every little thing under control until he feel love for the first time, his behavior suddenly change when he most compete with Herman but actually he is competing for a lady that can't love him because he is only 15 and the lady is a teacher. In the end Max returns to his regular behavior, having again Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble) as a friend and accepting Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), a girl of his same age who meet him in Grover Cleveland High after Max was expelled from Rushmore, as her girlfriend. Because after all, he and Herman did all those crazy things just for a lady that was their Rushmore.The cast is perfect; with Jason Schwarztman in his very first role making a memorable character, Bill Murray in the beginning of his ""new"" career in which he seem that is not acting, he is just always with the same expression making that his character looks boring of life. He is just terrific for those type of characters. And with the lovely Olivia Williams making a great performance as the love desire of Max and Herman. Also i like the cameo of Luke Wilson ,as a friend of Rosemary Cross, and the one of Kumar Pallana who plays Pagoda in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and appears in almost all the films of Anderson.Conclusion: it's true that this particular style of Anderson is not for all the people, i mean, or you love all of his films or you hate all. I love his style so i really love this film that is my second favourite of him and a total original comedy that might be a little slow for mainstream audiences but trust me, you will enjoy every second. For films like this one, i can say that Cinema is my Rushmore. 10 out of 10",Rushmore
48,framptonhollis,possibly the best wes anderson film out there,10,10 March 2017,"I often indulge in watching cinematic landmarks and milestones, and I praise these films for their groundbreaking achievements of both large and subtle scales. However, every now and then I come across a film that is even better than these milestones, but isn't truly a landmark. Simply put, some movies can just be really damn good, and ""Rushmore"" is one of the damn-goodiest movies I have ever seen.I have praised a lot of films that contain a perfect balance of plot and character, and ""Rushmore"" is among the best examples of this. Each of the main characters is likable, but still multilayered. There are moments in which you despise the two male leads and (highly unconventional) romantic rivals, but you can always understand and forgive them. The characters are as quirky as the story, which is simple, yet complex. It could never go over one's head, but it still requires some patience and attention. The story is a mish-mash of humor, quirk, and (for some) surprising relatability. By the time the film is almost over, it has exploded into comic chaos, but there is still always room for heart in Wes Anderson's world. I may have gotten teary eyed from laughing, but also from nearly crying; not because this is a sad movie, but because it is a powerful one with a huge heart. The last shot sums it all up perfectly; it is poetic, comic, quirky, and lovely all at once.",Rushmore

His grades aren't the best, but he's the king of extracurricular activities. He's put on academic probation and falls in love with a teacher, Miss Cross. Although, he's not the only with an eye for Miss Cross. Herman Blume, a wealthy industrialist also finds his heart to be stolen from the teacher. Now Max finds himself in a love triangle he can't seem to get out of.Wes Anderson's films are usually quirky, funny and brilliantly written. Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums manage to fall under all three categories. Life Aquatic also managed to have these elements, but not to the same level as the previous two. Rushmore, unfortunately only offers us one good thing out of the three, it's script.Rushmore is a great film, on paper. It gives you the sense of a smart film, it's just too bad that the brains behind it is all bark and no bite. Anderson and Wilson are great writers, when they are together they can pull some pretty neat rabbits out of hats. Rushmore gets a lot of praise which has me scratching my head. Do people really like slow, boring, and a main character that you simply want to beat the crap out of? Maybe everyone liked Bill Murray so much that they just had to rave about the film, because it's Murray who shines in this overrated piece of cinema.Jason Schwartzman plays his character very well, but his character is so dull and will make your eyes roll more then once. We are suppose to like the main character, but with Rushmore, I found my self begging for something interesting to happen. I was hoping that Max would suddenly stop being an uninteresting character, and someone that I can enjoy on the screen. Alas, this never happens. Bill Murray on the other hand, single handily saves this film from disaster. He is so wonderful in this film and this role belongs near the top as one of his best. All the characters, with the exception of MAX, are interesting. If Schwartzman's character only had one tenth of the charm that Murray pulls off, maybe I could have liked the film a bit more.The film soundtrack is quite good. It helps bring it's depressing mood up a little bit. Anderson always seems to have good music littered throughout his films and Rushmore is a good example. From Cat Stevens to The Rolling Stones, you'll probably end up liking the soundtrack more then the film.Ultimately I can't give this film a recommendation, but I can give it a 7. It may be a contradiction, but the film is well made. Everything flows well with it, the characters, the music, the directing and most of all it's script. But when you have such a talented cast and director, you'd expect to enjoy the film a lot more.

But there isn't as much of his normal focus on visually interesting sets, and the characters feel more lovable. Their flaws aren't as self-destructive as the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums or The Darjeeling Limited. Young Max (Jason Schwartzman, cleverly handling a character who somehow manages to be both an underachiever AND an overachiever), his chosen infatuation, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), and his disaffected older friend Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) aren't perfect, but Anderson chooses to make them less quirky than is his usual habit. It's an interesting decision which changes the tone of the movie somewhat, but if you like most of Anderson's other work, this will probably be right up your alley, too. It's an endearing little movie about life and finding what makes it all worth it for you, and I enjoyed it.",Rushmore

52,DeeNine-2,"Clever, original and droll, but why all the cigs?",8,12 December 2006,"Wes Anderson has a nice light touch in the comedy department. He also has a unique style. Whereas most prep school coming of age stories attempt a kind of been-there realism, what Anderson achieves here is something close to a kid's fantasy framed in realism.Jason Schwartzman stars as 15-year-old Max Fischer whose claim to fame is flunking most of his classes at Rushmore prep while being a boy genius who leads a dozen extra curricular activities including writing and directing his own plays. He's a kind of dark browed Woody Allen in the making. Bill Murray, slightly subdued and under comedic control, gives support as Herman Blume the millionaire entrepreneur who is impressed with Fischer's accomplishments and style. Olivia Williams is the grade school teacher they both adore.Well, if you are a slightly nerdish boy (or were one) this movie is going to just pop your tart. So wish-fulfilling is the story that at any moment I expected Max Fischer to hop into a phone booth and come out in leotards and cape. Even the plays Max writes embody a boy's dream of being a man: Serpico as played by teens, Platoon (or Apocalypse Now) in the high school gym. But I have to say anybody who watches this movie and doesn't feel a bit of nostalgia for childhood needs to have his bedpan changed.Max is a slacker who doesn't slack. Max is to be preferred to Blume's own idiot kids. Max can lead the boys at public or private schools. It doesn't matter. Max can almost win the girl, even though she is a dozen or so years older and six inches taller. Max can take a punch. Max has inexhaustible energy. Max is a leader and liked and respected by all but the school bully (whom he wins over and puts to work). Max probably will get into his safety school, Harvard, by scoring a perfect 2400 on his SATs. Humm, maybe that's a good idea for a sequel--oh, too late for a sequel, and anyway The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) certainly is better than any sequel.Well, how about Max grows up and becomes an astronaut, the first man on Mars? Or better yet, Max grows up and becomes--Wes Anderson! I have one MAJOR problem with this movie. What is with all the cigarettes? Wes, did you get some backing from Phillip Morris? I am so tired of cigarettes in movies where they serve no plot or character purpose, where they are planted merely to entice young people into a lifetime of addiction. Wes Anderson, now that you have found some fame and fortune, please remember: smoking cigarettes causes cancer and taking money from cigarette companies is, at the very least, Bad Form.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

53,sme_no_densetsu,Quirky and memorable,8,28 October 2015,"Nowadays, Wes Anderson's trademark style is well known but back in 1998 he was almost a complete stranger to movie audiences. It was ""Rushmore"" that gave most moviegoers their first glimpse of the quirky auteur's unique way with story and visuals.The movie's central character is teen Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a student at Rushmore Academy whose focus on extracurricular activities has put his scholarship at risk. Troubled by the prospect of leaving his beloved school, he falls in love with widowed teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). However, he soon faces competition for her affection from middle-aged steel magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray).The story may seem relatively simplistic but Anderson & co-writer Owen Wilson managed to construct a screenplay that was both unique and accessible. Mixing comedy & drama, the movie has its fair share of laughs along with a surprising amount of dramatic heft.The cast is one reason for the movie's success. Jason Schwartzman shone in his first film role and Bill Murray nearly stole the show in support. Meanwhile, Olivia Williams was exquisite as the female lead. Other notable supporting players include Brian Cox, Luke Wilson & Seymour Cassel.Wes Anderson's visual panache is evident here, though the approach is a bit more subdued than in his later films. Still, the film's look is constantly appealing and interesting. Also worth noting is the stellar soundtrack which concentrates on British invasion acts of the 60's & 70's. Especially memorable are the uses of the Creation's ""Making Time"" and the Faces' ""Ooh La La"".Overall, ""Rushmore"" is a thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama whose uniqueness makes it stand out. Both well acted and well constructed, it shows a sophistication that is lacking in most comedies.

54,wisewebwoman,Now I can see what all the fuss was about,8,6 January 2002,"This movie is a little gem.  I saw it on the basis of the Royal Tenenbaums being so good and was delighted at its quirkiness and eccentricity. Having read other reviews, I think that some people just don't get this type of off the wall stuff, this exaggeration of character which often dwells within us but is rarely expressed due to the constraints of society and the lack of risk taking by most of us. Max is a delight, a gutsy, daring adolescent, who embraces all of life and takes risks: his grades suffer because of his extra-curricular involvement with all the school clubs and his play writing.  He falls in love so inappropriately with a teacher, he gets involved in a mean funny little war with his rival for her affections, he has this little fan who is just there, like a worshipping kid brother, he lies about his background, etc. He takes all of this so seriously and is a marvellous actor to portray this complex character so well and believably.

55,leftbanker-1,A Judge of Character,10,30 April 2011,"I was making a list of my favorite comedy movies for a Spanish friend when I thought of Rushmore. For me Rushmore is not just a great movie, it has something that few movies possess, something few works of art possess. It has originality. Ironically, the film borrows heavily from a number of films including Good Will Hunting, The Godfather, Serpico, and Apocalypse Now (remind me if I have missed one or two) but this doesn't take away from the fact that Rushmore stands alone. I also think that whether or not someone likes the movie is a judge of character. I'm not saying that if you don't like the movie this means that you're a bad person; it just means that you probably stand on the polar opposite from me on every significant issue in life. I realize that there's a bit of hyperbole in that statement but this is what Rushmore does to people.The film is positively laugh-out-loud funny in many places and it has something that makes the humor even more special. At the very core there is a sweetness that only very few films can pull off without being saccharine or maudlin. I think that this sweetness is also evident in the soundtrack (someone gave me the CD as a gift) which has a song called Kite flying society; what could be sweeter than that? Rushmore is so completely unlike any other movie about teenagers that it can't even be put into this category. I don't know if I speak for anyone else but more than anything else the movie makes me wish that I could go back to that age and be a little more like Max Fischer, something I think the director had in mind with the closing song in the film with the chorus, ""I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger."" I remember hearing a reporter ask a celebrity if there is anything good about growing older. Without a breath of irony or sarcasm the 50 something star answered, ""Absolutely nothing."" I suppose this would be true if—like this celebrity—you have made no effort to become smarter or more interesting as a person over the course of your life.",Rushmore

The focus, if a focus can be determined, seems to be on the sometimes rocky relationship between Schwartzman and Murray.  Too little is done to explain the motivations of the male leads, and the film lacks continuity, cutting from one vignette to the next.  Williams does grow on you through the film, and the story does have its moments, but something is missing here.  Not a bad rental, but a little too bizarre and/or unconventional for my tastes.",Rushmore
57,blott2319-1,Same old Wes Anderson stuff,5,17 June 2020,"I don't know if there's any director who is quite like Wes Anderson. He has this way of making every single movie he makes feel exactly the same. It doesn't matter how different the plots are, how diverse the characters are, or even if it's live action or animated...they all share the exact same tone. It's so pronounced that I swear you could shuffle scenes from all his movies together and it would take a long while before you would notice something was wrong. If you're a big fan of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, then I imagine none of this bothers you, and Rushmore is one more wonderful treat. However, I'm not that enamored with it, and therefore I get somewhat bored with most of his movies (when I'm not actively annoyed by them.) I've said before that the style of his films make them feel like they were made by an alien who is trying to imitate their perception of life on Earth. It has the bones of a human story, but no one acts normal, and there are oddities in the way the movie world functions that don't quite line up with reality. Of course his movies look amazing, because Wes Anderson is all about painstakingly working out the details, but they lack humanity.Rushmore is more of the same, and doesn't bring anything new or interesting for me to enjoy. Thankfully, it's not one of the Wes Anderson movies that frustrates me, because most of the characters are pleasant enough and the plot is harmless. There are certainly moments where I find Jason Schwartzman to be irritating, but the story is presenting him in a negative fashion in those scenes, so that's acceptable. Bill Murray doesn't get enough to do in order to save the film. He has some moments of comedy that work, but this is more Schwartzman's movie. Rushmore is such a strange film because it never seems clear whether the main character is a good student or a bad one, all we know is he's overly ambitious and likes to organize extracurricular activities. When we see him getting a C- I don't know whether that's good for him or terrible. I'm also a bit puzzled by how he has avoided constant bullying since he is such a tedious know-it-all. As with many other Wes Anderson movies, I find Rushmore to be an acceptable way to pass the time and nothing more. It's certainly not a movie I'd ever need to revisit since I've seen plenty of his films before, and can get the same experience from any of them.",Rushmore
58,sharky_55,Sic transit gloria.,8,7 February 2016,"This is where Anderson really got into his rhythm. Bottle Rocket was admittedly a little mellow; the characters were petty criminals but it felt like we were being pushed to like them, to embrace their endearing qualities. Here, Anderson toes the line ever so closely with Max Fischer, the 15 year old subversion of the teacher's pet who is one of the worse students at Rushmore Academy, but gets an A+ for extracurricular activities. He's a bit of a pompous asshole but he thinks he's god's gift to the private school; ""We don't offer it yet,"" he so quick-wittedly corrects the headmaster. He didn't gain acceptance at the prestigious academy because of academic success, but because he wrote a ""little one act about Watergate"" and has since taken over the drama club. Max Fischer seems to think that because he is the president of so many successful clubs (in his mind), because he can speak a few lines of Latin, and because he brought Cross' classroom to life with her own little aquarium it makes him mature enough for an relationship with her. This is of course not true, but still he persists pass the boundaries of appropriateness. What Max seems to be doing iv vicariously overcompensating for his lack of parental support; he is like a stand in parent himself, giving haircuts, making conversation with the mums of the students, bossing around his actors like rowdy little children. He convinces himself he is not like the ramble that is Herman's children. His father is only a lowly hairdresser, so he constructs his own little world to replace his disappointment. He tricks Cross with fake blood in order to stage a moment of intimacy. When Margaret Yang casually admits that she lied about her science project, it visibly shocks Max into a change. Would Max, up to that point, ever admit something that he perceives as vulnerable and disarming? There is no place for weakness or underachievement in his life. When he joins his cast on-stage for the round of applause, with the pseudo-artistic broken nose for good measure, the moment is slowed down to soak in all his glory. When he gives a cordial speech to his new public schoolmates, the camera slowly zooms until he is the only one occupying the frame. This is the Max Fischer show after all.What Rushmore excels at is balancing the two dilemmas of Max and indeed the older Herman Blume. They both are chasing the same woman, but while their ages are years apart, they are both remarkably childlike and immature about the whole affair. They descend to tricks and sabotage and underhanded gestures in order to get ahead of the race, and are both quite self centred. There's a moment when Max introduces Herman to his father and his barbershop, after all the lies about him being a hotshot surgeon (""My father may only be a doctor, but we manage""), where Max finally shows some humility and unveils what his life really is like, and Murray's reaction is just fantastically telling. It's an obvious turning point for the man who seems to be a perfect prototype for an older Max had he not gone through the film's events - crotchety, lonely, for so long basking in the shallow vanity of his own achievements until he hits breaking point and begins self-loathing. 10 million? Guess so. It's not until Max admits his flaws that Herman can too. This is also the film where Anderson really embraced his own stylistic tendencies. The opening montage of all the different clubs Max is part of, with matching text, is as vivid and engaging as any introduction to a Wes Anderson character. There are only brief snapshots but he uses the compositions of those group portraits to their fullest extent in order to portray Max as a person who isn't in it for the enjoyment or camaraderies but for personal achievement. It is also his first film to use the intertitle to chop up the segments of time; parting stage curtains emblazoned with the passing months creates a sense of precise direction, as if it was Max overseeing the production with his own obsession with perfection and control. It just feels a whole lot more confident than Bottle Rocket. There's the lateral and horizontal camera movement at hard 90 degree angles that he has become know for; see the long-take follow shot unveiling Max's takeover of the baseball field as if he owns the place and is entitled to it, and his many lonely wanderings in the school hallways and ground. See how Max and Rosemary stare down the camera as they talk to each other, with a feigned sense of intimacy that I'm sure is very real in Max's mind. The slow motion and curtain close is used in the final scene. It is serenaded by The Face's Ooh La La, which I think is very fitting. This also marks, in my opinion, Anderson's blossoming ability to choose the most appropriate song for his films. Max is a different kind of mature now, but don't we all wish we could return to that one moment with the knowledge and experience of now? In his first kind-of-romance, he learns some harsh lessons, but is able to take those with him into the future. Glory fades, but underneath is a 15 year old boy with a lot more to him than just the clubs he heads.",Rushmore

But then it seemed as if the movie couldn't focus on the point it was trying to make.  It was telling its story, but was it a comedy or a drama?  I know good movies can be a bit of both, and so is Rushmore.  But in Rushmore the comedy and drama cancel one another out, leaving a gaping psychic hole.  Like matter and anti-matter cancelling one another out.  Many reviewers seem to believe that this is a very cool 60s thing.  Not really, just amateurish movie making.Bill Murray is the one shining light in the movie, and he saves it from utter disaster.  I'd give it a C+.",Rushmore

Maybe the script, maybe the stories, I'm not quite sure... Wes has the talent to create bizarre-nerdy characters (that's his strong point) such as Rushmore's main character: a big time freak obsessed with out-of-school activities. The other strong point of Anderson's cinema is that he's always counted with the great Bill Murray. OK, Bill looks like he's doing the same role all the time: this middle-aged man, bitter about life, that has seen it all before, and with the most sarcastic sense of humor ever... but I love that guy!!

63,FilmOtaku,Exquisitely endearing,8,18 May 2005,"""Rushmore"" directed by Wes Anderson (and co-written with his friend Owen Wilson) is a wonderfully executed tale that depicts both teen and adult angst, all the while offering clever touches that help categorize the film as a dark comedy. Named after the beloved school that Max Fischer (Schwartzman) attends, it involves a trio of characters that, without circumstantial incidents, probably would never have gotten together in the first place. Max is a student whose grades are so poor that his scholarship is in jeopardy; his academic career has been completely left behind for an enormous amount of extracurricular activities that Max both participates in and, in some cases, either founded or leads. When entrepreneur Herman Blume (Murray) comes to speak at Rushmore (his twin sons are students there) Max seeks him out and begins a dialogue, creating the beginnings of a strange but strong friendship. In Max, Herman sees someone with drive and spirit that he is lacking in his unsatisfying life, a life that is filled with wealth, but also with a philandering wife and two obnoxious sons, none of who care about him. Soon after, Max encounters a teacher from the elementary portion of Rushmore named Rosemary Cross (Williams) and he immediately falls in love with the young widow who treats Max like an equal (though with some bemusement) but seems to be cloaked in a large amount of sadness and loss. When Herman and Rosemary begin an affair, Max starts an all-out war with Herman, who retaliates, amounting in some pretty hilarious situations.For anyone who has seen another Wes Anderson film (Bottle Rocket, The Life Aquatic, The Royal Tennenbaums) the presentation of ""Rushmore"" won't be a surprise. Anderson obviously studied theater, as is evidenced by the blocking of the film, use of theater curtains that ""present"" a scene, the vivid colors, and, for the most part, a wardrobe that has so much character that they actually look like costumes. Other Anderson traits are present, such as the ever-present montage scene complete with punk music, brief underwater shots and precocious children. Max Fischer is an excellent character, richly written and portrayed wonderfully by Schwartzman, who makes his acting debut in this film, though you would never imagine that from his brilliant performance. Anderson has a knack for employing excellent actors who, despite their long respective filmographies, are able to take a role and (please forgive the expression that has now become overused by American Idol judges) make it their own in that you cannot imagine anyone else playing that part. Murray's character Herman is the epitome of this. It has been said that Murray read the script and was so taken with it that he offered to be in the movie for free; it is also one of the first times that Murray took on a role that didn't involve slapstick, simple humor or bodily noises, (though I did think he did a wonderful job as Bunny Breckenridge in ""Ed Wood"") which led to a mid-life career of real respectability and (gasp) an Oscar nomination. Murray is now one of Wes Anderson's regular actors, and though I enjoyed him in ""Tennenbaums"" I think this was a slightly better role for him.Though Wes Anderson is one of my favorite film directors, I can understand how some don't like his films. However, I think that the reasons are pretty much identical to why I, in fact, appreciate his films with a lot of regard. I've heard the terms ""quirky"" (overused in my opinion) and ""weird"" used. To an audience encapsulated in the mainstream, this is absolutely not going to appeal to them. I've also heard the term ""depressing"" used, which is correct to a certain extent. While Rushmore has its comedic elements, (though it is mostly dark comedy) the underlying messages are quite sad; a man who has a crappy family, a woman who recently lost her husband and a young man who is having his entire world yanked out from under him. Anderson likes to address the high points of his characters' lives in a quick montage, or as an aside in the beginning of the film. What he does with the rest of the film is roll up his sleeves and dig into the difficult times that follow the highs of his characters, whether it is financial, personal or spiritually success. And that is what I like most about Anderson and the film ""Rushmore""; underneath the stylish presentation lies a plausible, effective and emotional story that, coupled with his wonderful troupe of actors is simply exquisite. 8/10",Rushmore

67,Movie-12,Bill Murray is the only funny thing. **1/2 out of ****,6,6 June 1999,"""Rushmore"" is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny. It is well made, and does contain a few momentous comic fires, but never enough to recommend. Some audiences may find the material quite bleak, while others may think it is obscured. Doubtless, not many people will find it raveable.The film's protagonist is a trouble making student at the Rushmore Academy named Max Fisher, one of the greatest schools in America.  He loves where he goes to school at, more than anything. He gets poor grades, but is editor of the newspaper/yearbook, founder of the debate team, the dodgeball society, and president of the French club, German club, chess club, and may more things. In a particular, scene he states that Rushmore is his life. This un-realistic lust for schooling is necessary for developing the character's personality which latter carries the dim plot though termoil.After the Max character is fully understood, we begin to receive plot clinches of all sorts. First, Max is threatened with ""sudden death expulsion"" since he is such a bad student. Second, he ominously falls in love with a first grade teacher who also works at Rushmore. Her name is Miss Cross. Then Max begins to do very strange things, like building an aquarium in replacement of the school's baseball diamond. Not your typical student, is he.The film's antagonist is Mr. Blume, who is an old grumpy, almost full time drunk, mentor who works at Rushmore. He also loves Miss. Cross, which eventually leads to an affair involving the two. Max then becomes jealous and serious, and at times, dangerous conflicts result.The two characters battle out their envy in many ways. Cause: Max plants a bee hive in the room Mr. Blume is resting in. Effect: Mr. Blume secretly cuts Max's bicycle from a protected rack, and runs over it with his car, then kindly puts in back in it's place in the rack. Cause: Max cuts the breaks for Mr. Blume's car, causing him to involuntarily roll around the schools property. See a pattern forming here.The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, with lots of style, jest and energy. Unfortunately, a movie can not run of those things alone. The film often was side-tracked with un-necessary sup-plots and side effects.The performances were of various degrees of greatness. Newcomer Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer debuts wonderfully with an upward movement towards success and character development. This will not be his last role. He has much potential and material to work with. Olivia Williams as Miss Cross disappointed me a great deal. Her acting job comes off as a seemingly half hearted and detached role for her.The performance by Bill Murray, as Mr. Blume, is the only character who generates any laughs whatsoever in the audience. He acts clumsy and cute, realistically drunk and without dignity. If he isn't nominated for a supporting actor Award of any kind, the academy needs to re-check their databases.""Rushmore"" does have some nice moments in it. However, I can't recommend the film. The performances win but a battle, but the movie itself loses the war. If my predictions are correct, if you do chose to see the film, you wont walk out with a sense of enjoyment. Regarding the fact that the performance where I saw the film was a near sell out, and at the end there were precisely two people clapping, I counted.",Rushmore
68,alice liddell,Gorgeously faithful evocation of an adolescent's mindset.,9,6 September 1999,"Overextended rather than overlong, this is still, along with A BUG'S LIFE, the best American film of the year.  Sadly, this has been an atrocious year for movies, so that isn't saying much (being Europeans, we still haven't seen EYES WIDE SHUT or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, so there's still hope). There has been no outstanding, awe-inspiring, terrifying, beautiful, blow-everything-out-of-the-water film this year, no PULP FICTION, THE USUAL SUSPECTS or HEAVENLY CREATURES.  The main problem with new films is style. Because style has been reduced to empty, showy Lelouchisms, intelligent directors, like Solondz or Labute, have rejected style altogether; and their rather flat, dull compositions can detract from the undoubted brilliance of their content.RUSHMORE has style in spades.  RUSHMORE is (on the surface at least) a very intelligent film.  It is the kind of film my spouse would dismiss as 'a young man's film', but then so, apparently, was A BOUT DE SOUFFLE.  The comparison is not gratuitous.  There is a glorious, gleeful, freewheeling joy in cinema here that carries the film for the first hour, reminiscent of the early Nouvelle Vague, and Richard Lester.  It's odd how these old devices - and there are also echoes of Chaplin, Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Tati and Woody Allen in here too - should seem so fresh and new.  Has cinema stagnated so far?  Most modern US (indie) film is stagy, rigid, overcomposed.  This film uses all the old tricks to show life being lived, not an imposed thesis.As I suggested, the film is probably intelligent.  I say probably, because this is not its main interest.  It does interesting things with Oedipal conflicts - there are at least five father/son relationships in the film (Max/Bert, Max/Dirk, Max/Hermann, Hermann/sons, Max/Edward Appleby), most of which are put under pressure, if not outright hostile, but resolved in unexpected ways.  There is the influence of the dead on the living, unwritten stories intruding on those trying to write their own lives. There is the idea of Rushmore as a conservative, Brideshead-like arcadia, wherein also lies betrayal and death.  The whole Ivy League (or whatever second level's called over there) system is debunked: whereas Rushmore will accept any trash as long as they're white, Max's multi-racial public school seems a much more vital place.What is great about this film is not these things, but its understanding of and sympathy for adolescent experience.  The most obvious marker of this is self-dramatisation, and there is strong evidence (the theatre curtains that open each section; Max's facility as a playwright; the repetition of portraits and framings within the film) that this is not an 'objective' story, but Max's highly mediated view of his own life.  The film is sprightly, energetic, hilarious and inventive when he is on top of life, sluggish and dour when he is depressed.  This actually makes his pain even more moving, and why he can sympathise with Hermann throughout on an emotional level, even when he needs to hate him on a narrative one.Bill Murray gives the year's outstanding performance, which will hopefully be ignored at the Oscars - there is such depth to his angst, such humour to his self-lacerating millionaire, a self-made man who tragically sees himself as a loser.  Few actors today can be so heartbreaking while seeming to do so little.  And people still think Meryl Streep is an actress.It is Jason Schwarzmann, though, who must carry the film, and he is perfect - brave, enterprising, irritating, vital.  His romantic object is rather a drip, as adolescent idealisations generally are, and her swearing wake-up call is suitably shocking.  Brian Cox is hilarious as a gruff, though sympathetic, headmaster, whose fate again suggests youthful wish-fulfillment.  The use of music is as inventive as any great film I've seen.  The film is actually quite bleak, and we can only thank our stars that Max isn't a goth - his doomed inventiveness staves of  despair. Wonderful.",Rushmore

71,movieguy1021,Rushmore: 5/10,5,18 October 2004,"So here I am, listening to Dick Dale and his Del-Tones, while trying to think of a way to open my review for Rushmore. I could go about the cheesy way and pretend to write a letter to director/co-writer Wes Anderson. I could go through ""it would/wouldn't win these Oscars"" routine. Or I could just list everything I didn't like about the movie. Instead, I'll just go through a basic routine of my usual reviews, while occupying the majority of the first paragraph with no substance whatsoever. Hey, that's just like Rushmore-something that leads you into thinking there's going to be some big outcome, but instead winds up with no value whatsoever.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a fifteen year old overachiever at preppy Rushmore High. He's started most clubs at school, does loads of extracurricular activities, yet fails in his classes. He's put on probation and falls for a first grade teacher as his school (Olivia Williams). He befriends steel magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray) somehow, whose kids go to Rushmore. Herman also falls for the teacher, Ms. Cross. As this crazy love triangle unfolds, we realize that we can't care about any of these characters.This Max Fischer, he's an eccentric guy. With his gelled jet-black hair, his insistence on wearing his school uniform proudly, and an odd vocabulary, you'll either love him or hate him. Guess what I though of him. I found no redeeming qualities about him, and oftentimes I wanted to yell at the screen because he was acting like a dolt and such a pampered brat I could not feel anything but contempt for him. And since this character was in most of the scenes of the movie, I wasn't really happy with seeing this character that often. Murray's Blume is more deadpan, but doesn't really have many qualities. It's just a boring character. Anderson (and co-writer Owen Wilson) seem to think that Fischer and Blume would even each other out, but one's too annoying and one's too nondescript to really balance each other out. Plus, there's the random characters who pop in, like Fischer's sidekick, the Scottish bully, Margaret Yang, et cetera. Those characters make Blume seem almost interesting.Rushmore starts off strong-not really funny, but with a good quirky atmosphere and the typical 60s British rock songs Anderson likes to put in his movies. Then, about halfway through, the movies goes into this slapstick territory. It's still not funny. Potentially dangerous thing occur to these two characters with no moral retribution or consideration for the law. But since these people are rich, we're supposed to forgive them for their actions. That's probably the worst lesson any movie can give us. As the movie goes to its conclusion (the whole movie is an excruciatingly long 93 minutes), it gets into this sap that's completely unwelcome. I guess the whole reason I didn't like Rushmore is because of Fischer. He's trying to court this first grade teacher, she's not giving in, neither is he, but it's COMPLETELY obvious she's not giving in AT ALL. Yet Fischer's idealism is so over-the-top (like all of the movie) that it's impossible to care.All of this could be overlooked if the movie was funny. It wasn't. Even The Royal Tenenbaums was funnier, and I didn't think it was that funny, just a great movie. I don't really know how people can find Rushmore funny at all. Or, in that case, how they could like it. It starts off on a good note, but then descends into quirky-movie hell.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language and brief nudity.",Rushmore
72,Peach-2,Odd.,7,19 July 1999,"I've watched both of Wes Andersons' films, Bottle Rocket and now Rushmore, and both films are very odd. I like the characters in both films but the stories seem strange. Rushmore is basically about a young man who doesn't want to grow up and an older man who can't blame him. The real surprise of Rushmore is Bill Murray, who conveys sadness and depression so well that I was convinced he was going to commit suicide at some point during the picture. Although I loved the characters in the film, the film itself seems pointless. I know I'll probably get some flack for thinking the film makes no sense, but I can't help but wonder what is the point here.

74,Horror-yo,Particular comedy that a director could afford to make back in the 90's (explained below),7,1 May 2019,"The first thing that's striking about this sort of comedy is how particular it is, it's almost like something that was written by a bunch of pals who share the same humor and taste and it got out to the larger public and happened to become a big hit or something of a cult classic. It's very, very difficult to find the same kind of phenomenon in today's industry as movies are made to be risk-free and highly standardized, especially comedies. So this comes across as ""very 90's"" for that alone.It's peculiar in that it's got its own pace, likes to take its time to organize its own eccentric-ish scenes: things like a purposely long scene for a very basic dialogue exchange between two characters, long silent stares and eye contact between the lines, lingering close-up shots of a character all hesitant to retort... and then straight to the next piece of plot.It does really well at somehow holding up, because there is in hindsight fairly little to work with in terms of actual story content, and although it couldn't be called 'uneventful' it seems to enjoy itself at being lowkey in a sense, the film being all about atmosphere and that peculiar feel it produces. It does well to be short enough (just 1hr30) or else it probably would feel a bit slow with that style and pace.The actors are all good and help shape that low key, jaded/ordinary daily life kind of vibe while at the same time being quite grotesque characters, a young Schwartzman and a middle-aged seasoned Bill Murray in particular - which coming together could be seen as something of a symbol for a strong period in comedy, Murray carrying the 80's/90's with him and Schwartzman representing the fresh comedy of the late 90's/early 2000's.",Rushmore
75,J. Steed,WATCH FIRST SEMESTER ONLY,5,13 February 1999,"This portrayal of Max starts promising controlled, unsentimental and funny, but halfway it deteriorates into a non-story and ends in a typical stomach-turning feel-good sentimental mode. Bill Murray stands out.",Rushmore
76,oOoBarracuda,Rushmore,4,5 December 2016,"Bill Murray wants an Oscar so bad, doesn't he? Nothing made Bill Murray's turn toward more Academy Award-worthy roles so clear as his role in the 1998 film, Rushmore. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, Rushmore also stars Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams. Rushmore is the coming-of-age tale of a college prep student who does not excel in academics who decides to be involved in every extracurricular activity the school offers. His whole life revolves around his school until he learns he is on academic probation. I understand that many people love Wes Anderson, and consider this film to be his darling, I didn't care for it, nor did I find it meaningful in its desperate half effort to be meaningful. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) the self-proclaimed king of extracurricular activities at Rushmore, a private college-preparatory academy. Max's problem, however, is that despite the number of activities he is involved in, he has no people skills and hasn't mastered the art of friendship or even decency. He uses everyone around him to his benefit and therefore alienates himself at every turn. When he learns that his academic probation means that if he were to fail one more class, Max sees his life flash before his eyes. When a personal quest to discover who defaced one of Rushmore's library books, Max meets and instantly falls in love with Mrs. Calloway (Connie Nielsen) who begins an affair with Max's friend and parent of twin Rushmore students Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Broken hearted and betrayed, Max begins a quest to ruin the lives of those who hurt him, ruining his own in the process when he is expelled from Rushmore. Bill Murray has the depth of a sheet of paper in every role that I have seen of his, and it doesn't work for me. I'd much rather see him in the stands at Wrigley than in a film. Rushmore is a film that is trying to be important and artsy yet falls flat. Every unlikable character the audience meets is given only half of a backstory preventing any real connection to any of them. I'm just not at all a fan of anything Rushmore or its director Wes Anderson is trying to do in this film.",Rushmore
77,MichaelMargetis,"""I guess you've just gotta find something you love to do and then... do it for the rest of your life. For me, it's going to Rushmore."" - Max Fischer",8,7 November 2005,"I heard mixed things about Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore'. Some of my friends thought it was pure brilliance while others thought it was jumbled crap. Having previously seen 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' I wanted to give 'Rushmore' (Anderson's first film -- if you don't count the miserably unsuccessful 'Bottle Rocket') a shot. I can tell you that I really liked 'Rushmore' but I didn't quite think it was ""pure brilliance"". I personally liked 'Rushmore' more then 'Life Aquatic' but for me it didn't even compare to the outstanding 'Royal Tenenbaums'. 'Rushmore' is a movie with a wholly original plot that is filled with quotable dialogue, unlikable characters and a strange feeling of neurosis.'Rushmore' is the tale of a brilliant young genius Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) who is failing all of his classes at a prestigious private school (Rushmore) because he is involved or the president of every extra-curricular activity the school has to offer. One day Max gets expelled from school after trying to impress a third grade teacher whom he has a deep crush on (Olivia Williams - The Sixth Sense) who falls for Max's employer Herman (Bill Murray) an unhappily married man with two moronic kids who attend Rushmore. Max tries to win over the third grade teacher, destroy Herman and make the best out of his time spent at a ""public"" school. The film also stars Seymour Cassell, Brian Cox and a small role played by Luke Wilson.'Rushmore' is one hell of a funny movie, but it's just so damn weird. Jason Schwartzman is perfectly cast as the total nerd that is Max Fischer. Olivia Williams is solid while Bill Murray steals the entire film in a performance of such comedic brilliance it should have earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination at 1998's Academy Awards. Wes Anderson does a nice job directing it, while him and Owen Wilson provide a perfectly eccentric, grim and off-the-wall screenplay. 'Rushmore' is a great film but not a masterpiece. It's very funny but it could have been funnier. One thing it doesn't run out of though is awkward moments. Oh, man, does it have enough of those. If you get the chance to, definitely make time to watch Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore'. If you have a flair for off-beat kind of cinema you may just get a kick out of it. Grade: B+",Rushmore
78,MartinTeller,Rushmore,9,30 December 2011,"My opinion hasn't changed much on this one. Once again, I'm on the fence between ""very good"" and ""great"" but am leaning towards the latter. Somewhere near the two-thirds point I get a bit restless, but it's all made right by that lovely ending. It's very sweet. The thing that makes you special isn't how impressive you are or your list of achievements, it's the people who care about you. I can't help wondering if I might like the film a little more if it was someone other than Jason Schwartzman, but I haven't put much thought into who might have been better. One terrific bit of casting is the Sara Tanaka, who projects such a restrained vulnerability. She did a few other bit parts and then apparently went to med school, so I guess we've probably seen the last of her.",Rushmore
79,CinematicInceptions,"Somewhat amusing, though flawed.",7,21 October 2016,"Watching Max Fischer go through his bold and unorthodox escapades was fairly entertaining. He's clearly studied up on how to be professional and suave, but doesn't quite know when to employ these tactics. His word choice immediately stands out as unusual, but what is also remarkable is how unafraid he is to fail. His attempts to get in good with Rosemary are doomed from the start, but it takes him months of failing to finally give up on her. Maybe he's just an idiot for throwing himself at his goal headlong and humiliating himself over and over again.As seems to be the case in most Wes Anderson films, we get an odd protagonist that creates a strange reality for themselves. The surrealism of the movie really speaks to Anderson's directing work, because several scenes convey events that aren't that strange in themselves but they feel a odd because of how they are presented. Magnus, Rosemary, and Dirk are good examples of this because they behave pretty normally for the most part, but we see them through Max's warped and stylized vision.Most of the movie consists of Herman Blume and Max fighting over Rosemary, sometimes thwarting the other's efforts to win her and sometimes assisting the other. These scenes said a lot about Herman with the childish nature that he and Max fight with. For Max to sabotage Herman is not exactly acceptable, but it is at least understandable since Max is at a clear disadvantage in this war; but for Herman to stoop to the same level is beyond immature. However, it cannot be denied that both characters are willing to have goals. This seems to be a point that Wes Anderson likes to insinuate in his work: going after your goals may have disastrous results and may cause you to do some bad things, but it is better than living without a purpose and being boring. I don't know that I fully agree with this, but it's worth thinking about.The craft that is displayed in this film is decent, but has definite room for improvement. The dialogue and content of each scene was good, but I didn't like the pacing. That may just be a personal thing, but sometimes it seemed like the story lacked direction. The style was cool, though it's clear that Anderson had not fully developed his technique at this point in his career. The acting was solid all around.This is good to watch if you're really interested in Anderson's techniques or if you want to study some good acting. I saw this at a screen writing workshop as part of an exercise in structure. Within the class it was educational, but it may not be the best resource for aspiring writers. For those just viewing for enjoyment, this isn't anything that you'll get a lot out of, but if you come across it, it's worth a try. Overall Rating: 6.9/10",Rushmore
80,AKS-6,Wicked fun,7,18 February 2000,"[Contains plot SPOILERS.]""Rushmore"" is certainly one of the most original comedies I have seen the last few years. It's main character is a fifteen year old boy who might best be described as obnoxious, although he hides it under suave manners. So, the main character is not someone you can really relate with, he's almost a caricature. But the main theme of this comedy is change. And Max Fischer does change. It is his development from the obnoxious boy in the beginning of the film, to the reformed young man in the ending, that made me like the film so much. Plus, it's full of wicked comedy, which is something I like. Very good film and Jason Schwartzman (as Max) was brilliant to say the least. (7/10)",Rushmore
81,willcundallreview,Very Good movie with good performances,8,17 July 2014,"Rushmore is a high school set comedy drama that provides laughs and also a sweet kind of strange story plus a great performance from a comedy legend. This also contains some great little characters, beautiful looking cinematography and sets that look like they were crafted for every great high school movie ever. With it's quirkiness and a style that many people may very much enjoy, I felt that it was firmly very good and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is massively fun to say it is so short, it is so quirky and well crafted, it could be said the end gets slightly more dull but generally it very entertaining throughout. I felt the comedy was maybe not massively funny but when it is funny, it pretty much is laugh out loud and coupled with the more dramatic parts, it is very fun to watch. The middle part of the movie is very fun, you will see what I mean if you see it but it at times can be very enjoyable to see it all.The main big performance here comes from Bill Murray and his very funny but different than usual acting display. Murray seems to blend his qualities in humour with a way of acting like a slob to create a memorable character who eclipses others in the film. Jason Schwartzman is the actual main actor here and he is pretty good to say he is so young and a crazy character who is unlikeable at times, Olivia Williams is also steady as the teacher in which she plays a pivotal role within the film.Wes Anderson's quality script is one of the shining lights of this film and his vision of this high school movie is seen out so well along with the performances. I liked the directing also but another massive positive behind the cameras is well, the cameras themselves in the cinematography which is at times maybe a bit strange but mostly is beautifully shot and just simple scenes without much meaning are done really well to say this isn't a film that had to do such things.Criticisms wise it doesn't have loads but the lack of comedy I think hits it, as said it is hilarious at times but a few more strong jokes could have and would have scored it higher. I wasn't too keen on the lapsing end of the movie where you can feel it has no ending in sight, it does finally end but it may make you slightly confused and possibly even bored with it. It could be said it is too short but it just about squeezes out what it wants to get out.I think teens yes may like it but everyone can certainly love it, it has that quirky style so many cult films seem to have and I believe this can be just that. If you like Bill Murray's style of comedy then I will actually say you could not appreciate him here but he brings something new and it really shows off by the end. It actually can be pretty sweet as well at times so if you want a fun quirky and at times a sweet film, this is exactly your type of film.Overall it is Firmly a Very Good movie, not quite Great or Excellent but nevertheless very highly scored. With this you just have to sit back and enjoy the stuff going on throughout, couldn't recommend it more to most film fans and I imagine some will love this much more than I did, and I enjoyed it. One more thing to add, it can get kind of busy in the middle and not confusing but mixed up so bare with it and it will pay off for you in the end.",Rushmore
82,dilbertsuperman,Stiff unrealistic dialog and a dull unfunny plot. Boo to Max.,2,11 December 2005,"Max Fischer is a strange little man who although he looks like a 25 year old Jewish man we should buy the concept that he is a 15 year old boy. After we swallow that then we can move on to the stupid love triangle between him, a teacher and *ugh* Bill Murray with a bad 'stache. THe scenes remind me of an unfunny Napoleon Dynamite. We get a real eyeful of this Max character and let's face it- he sucks, he's NOT funny he's an ugly dork and in general he's unbelievable and miscast. The woman that the two characters are yearning for is not exactly a knock out and the dialog surrounding the love triangle is generally obtuse, unfunny and unbelievable. This is the kind of movie you keep watching to see if it ever gets funny because it is always on it's way there but never really seems to deliver. If you watch this movie you will be basically waiting until the end credits for something worth watching and then realize there's nothing at all here. It's fully over rated unfunny crap.

The film is absolutely driven by its unique soundtrack, which isn't in this case, a bad thing.

85,mnpollio,"A film as arrogant, obnoxious and condescending as its central character",2,29 December 2006,"I have yet to be won over to the supposed off-beat comedic talents of director/writer Wes Anderson and his co-conspirators, the Wilson Brothers. Rushmore is a ""comedy"" centering on ambitious teenager Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), who had one stellar moment of superiority that won him entrance into the elite Rushmore Academy, where he has flourished in extracurricular activities, but steadily failed academically. When a school superior threatens him with expulsion, he stumbles first into a friendship with rich businessman Bill Murray and then into love with comely school teacher Olivia Williams, who ultimately becomes the object of Murray's affections and the cause of friction in their friendship. The plot plays better in summary than when expanded on the big screen. There is a lot of promise in the premise, but somehow both Anderson and the Wilson Brothers manage to avoid mining any big laughs. The film seems to be trying to attain a sense a bemused whimsy, but it never even reaches such a goal much less maintains it. Often Anderson resorts to the now tired gimmick of allowing a hip soundtrack and quirky camera work to carry his straining narrative. Williams is pretty if undemonstrative in a largely reactive role and Murray provides a performance of classy restraint. Perhaps the biggest problem is that Schwartzman's performance as Max is grating. Max is one of the most unlikable and unappealing characters to be the focus of a film in a long time. He is condescending, arrogant, egotistical, childish, obnoxious and finally psychotic. When he starts to go off the deep end over the blooming relationship between his kindred spirit and the object of his obsession, he demonstrates evidence that he is more the serial killer of tomorrow rather than a rising star. We can never understand what quality it is that attracts Murray's older businessman to this pipsqueak, much less why the seemingly sensible Williams tolerates the obvious advances of this undeniably deranged freak. Max is not physically attractive, but even worse, his soul is a dark one, so there is no inner beauty of which to speak. Even worse, the writers seem to think the whole world is populated by people like Max, as not only does he have a young sycophant who worshipfully follows him around to take notes, but a young female admirer who seems to be developing the kind of obsessive crush on him that he has on Williams. Like its central character, the film itself brims with arrogance and contempt and seems to condescend to its audience in a flashy way as if almost yelling ""Look how great I am.""",Rushmore
86,deepfrieddodo,Same Anderson Style Without the Output,4,18 April 2021,"Unmistakably a typical Wes Anderson film, but without any of the redeeming qualities, just his 'quirky' style. I typically enjoy Anderson's work, but Rushmore was just so dull, I genuinely cannot fathom the plaudits people are giving to this film. There is barely a plot, the main character is irritating rather than relatable or likeable, and the supporting characters are so incredibly bland. The 'dry' humour that is thinly veiled must have dried up before the script was written, and whilst there are a few good lines, it doesn't redeem the film.

87,eshwarmail,Recommended especially for ones who like simple indies and quirky characters,7,2 September 2012,"Wes Anderson always has a terrific way with his screenplay for the first half of all his movies but goes into a routine melodrama featuring the same actors that leads to a predictable ending. Rushmore is not any different. Its not that I don't like what he does, but just an observation. In someways Wes Anderson is to sweet family dramas what Coen Brothers are to comedy thrillers. Max Ficher (Jason Schwartzman) is a very smart young student in Rushmore who is just not into studies. He is the founder and president of many interesting and some trivial clubs in Rushmore and is very interested in directing stage plays finally falls for a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Though she initially warns and later avoids his advances, he takes help from his co-student's father Herman Blume (Bill Murray) who is a well-to-do entrepreneur going through a rough marriage. When Herman falls for the teacher himself and Max gets expelled from Rushmore, how they both try to exact revenge on each other and try to win over Rosemary forms the rest of the story. It is a dream role for a youngster like Jason who gets to portray different shades like bully as well as the victim, smart and dumb, popular, romantic and loner. Rest of the cast gels well with their characters with little quirkiness added by the director. Soundtrack features some generic (now) stuff from the seventies which felt compatible. Nothing special to give a shout for other departments.Recommended especially for ones who like simple indies and quirky characters.",Rushmore
88,refresh_daemon,"Quirky and enjoyable, only suffers mildly from the story that never quits",8,27 November 2007,"This film is director Wes Anderson's breakout film. And I can see why. Many of his signature elements in his style get developed here. Rich boy (or in this case, not-rich prep school) protagonists, his frequent use of center composed framing, and quirky consistent costumes get added to the kooky characters and generally great selection of popular music for the scenes.While the direction is strong, the story has a few problems going on, story arcs fade in and out and it seems at time as though the movie should be over but it continues going on. At these points, resolutions seem to have taken place, but there's nothing compelling the viewer to continue with the story except for the fact that the movie keeps rolling on although the story arc has completed. In some sense, it's almost as though we're watching three (or maybe four) short films, the latter building off the former. This isn't a terrible problem because it's interesting enough watching, but I couldn't help but think to myself ""It's still going? Isn't it over?"" multiple times through the film.Everything else is good. I like the acting, the score, the production in general and really like the characters despite their flaws. I also like how the story is in part a story of Max Fischer's growing up, forgiveness and to a mild extent, redemption. While I see room for improvement, Rushmore is a fine quirky film that I can recommend to those who like quirky comedies. 8/10.",Rushmore

Yet the social awkwardness and dysfunctional relationships that Wes Anderson films usually thrive on give ""Rushmore"" an atmosphere that is sadder and creepier than the director may have intended. The central relationship is between a male high school student and a female teacher, but the teacher is disappointingly reduced to a cipher and does precious little to discourage the inappropriate feelings of her pupil.

95,nesfilmreviews,One of my favorites,9,7 March 2013,"""Rushmore"" is a comic original. With its dry, throwaway humor and constant stream of chuckles, it creates its own category of stealth comedy. There's a sweet humanity about the picture, though it's anything but sentimental. It's odd, definitely odd. Credit the film's startling originality to director Wes Anderson, and his co-screenwriter, Owen Wilson. These friends from the University of Texas - made their debut with the independent hit ""Bottle Rocket"". It's structured like a comedy-but there are undertones of darker themes. Whether you see the film as a slowed-down farce, or as a souped-up tragedy, ""Rushmore"" is packed with richly realized characters. Max (Jason Schwartzman), a fifteen-year-old misfit in glasses and braces, a terrible student-but enjoys many extracurricular activities at Rushmore Academy. He is then befriended and then betrayed by Herman (Bill Murray), a school benefactor, when both fall for first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (the magnetic British actress Olivia Williams)--and Max and Herman make foolish attempts to get back at each other. Rosemary is haunted by her own ghosts. Her husband, a former Rushmore student, drowned the year before. She lives in a room filled with artifacts from his school days. Max reminds her of the boy she married, Herman of the man he never grew up to be. Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, a local industrialist who somehow, through the veil of his own middle-aged angst, finds himself responding to Max's personality. Like Max, Blume also is alienated. He has a family that makes no sense--a pair of dumb and vicious jock twin sons. ""Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine having sons like this,"" he deadpans. It's safe to say that Murray has one of the most emotionally layered deadpans of the century. To look at him is to recognize in Blume a fellow who, at his age, becomes lovesick and pathetic. He knows it and is sad about it, and yet sees the humor in his own sorry spectacle. This is a first-class performance. While everything is falling apart for everyone, Max brings what closure that can actually be, by delivering the most ambitious school play ever attempted. ""Rushmore"" manages to pay tribute to movies as diverse as ""The Graduate"" and ""Apocalypse Now""--and still brim over with the pleasures of the unexpected. Anderson fills each frame of his rigorously constructed fable with detail. That extends to a terrific soundtrack of British Invasion hits - Cat Stevens, the Kinks, the Faces, the Who, the Stones - that catches the anger roiling under Rushmore's placid exterior. On subsequent viewings, the plaintive subtext of even the funniest scenes becomes readily apparent.",Rushmore

I absolutely love the way Jason Schwartzman brings to life the main character of Max Fischer, he elevates and brings the charm to Rushmore for me.

Instead it's a comedy that has laughs with plot.  And both the laughs and plot are very satisfying.  Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer a student at the very distinguished Rushmore Academy.  Max is president of every available activity club at Rushmore, and if there isn't a club at Rushmore yet, Max will start one.  His grades however are bad, and he's been threatened to be expelled numerous times by his stressed principal.  Max then changes he befriends two older people, one a successful millionaire who is a alumni of Rushmore Academy  (Bill Murray), the other is the first grade teacher at Rushmore (Olivia Williams).  Max befriends the millionaire, and falls in love with the teacher, however, he doesn't realize that the millionaire and teacher are falling in love with each other. The acting in this movie is excellent, with Bill Murray standing out (he should have received a nomination for the Oscars).  And the jokes and story are also very good.  Like ""AS GOOD AS IT GETS"" the jokes are spread out, but they are very funny.  Wes Anderson does a great job directing, and it's an excellent follow-up to ""BOTTLE ROCKET.""  I also do applaud Anderson's use of ""British Invasion"" music instead of cliched modern top 40 hit music.  It's refreshing to see a movie with music by The Who, The Kinks, Cat Stevens, and John Lennon.  Instead of your typical movie with teens and more ""modern"" music.  It's a terrific film! ****1/2 out of *****",Rushmore
98,coop-16,A very funny and compassionate film.,10,13 April 1999,"I can only echo the praise of other reviewers. I have already seen it twice, and plan to see it a third time. The last film I saw three times in the theater was The Age of Innocence. Bill Murray fully deserved an academy award nomination, and he was, in short, ""robbed'( though Coburn deserved to win).I will only note five features of this film that were little commented on, though I enjoyed them. 1. The excellent performance by first Hannibal Lecter, Brian Cox, as Doctor Guggenhiem.2. The  imaginative use of obscure ""British invasion "" tunes (and Django Reinhardt!) on the soundtrack.3. The incredibly fluid camera work and editing-reminiscent of Scorsese at his best.4. The wonderful moment when Max tells Blume what his father really does for a living...that is when Max is, finally, redeemed.5.Finally, the dance at the end, which reminded me of the great finish to another film about frustrated genius, Eight and a Half.",Rushmore

100,BadWebDiver,The definition of smug mod pretentiousness.,2,25 September 2004,"This film is to me the definition of how a low-budget ""comedy"" can go wrong.A convoluted story about an 'oh so smug' precocious mid-teen (he's so brilliant he apparently wrote a scathing satire of Watergate while in grade school!?!) who attends an exclusive prep school, and literally acts like he owns the place.(Spoiler warning)One of the first heavy moments comes when he bawls into tears because the principal is scolding him for digging up the sports oval so he could build a private aquarium (oh, the poor li'l diddums!). This is apparently supposed to be the paragon of mod character humor (go figure!) Even with the admittedly brilliant comic talents of Bill Murray, this does in no way appeal to me as a comic story. I was literally wishing I could wring the little twerp's neck!!! And that's even before he develops this ridiculous crush on a kindergarten teacher, which is taken way too far.To me the actual highlight (lowlight?) of the story was when he's been banished to an ""ordinary"" school, and he gets up in front of class and made a speech saying he despised everyone there. (Geez - what a hero!) And that's not to mention the big climactic moment when the love interest asks him if he'll cope, and he replies 'with wisdom beyond his years'; ""I'll be alright."" How's that for a profound finish?! Apparently that's supposed to make him sympathetic.Honestly, this is one of the lamest excuses for a comic story I have witnessed in ages. What really amazes me, is that the plot seems like a direct spin on earlier film NORTH. And while that earlier story, though admittedly flawed, had at least a modicum of good comic timing and witty scenes; this one totally fails to deliver at anything close to a comic premise.",Rushmore
101,WubsTheFadger,Rushmore,8,20 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerWes Anderson's second feature film is a winner. It is funny, smart, and touching. The story is fast and the jokes are hilarious. The characters are well thought out and are funny in their own special way.The acting is very good. Jason Schwartzman delivers a great performance as Max Fischer. Max is quick witted, smart, and at times very charming. Bill Murray is once again hilarious and Brain Cox performs very well. Olivia Williams, Seymour Cassel, Mason Gamble, and Luke Wilson also perform very well.The pacing starts off fast but slows done towards the end.

102,len-21,6 on a scale of 10,6,21 February 1999,"Ok, presumably anyone reading this has not seen this movie. DON'T. I don't care that the 6 reviewers in Entertainment Weekly gave it an average of B+. I don't care that 70% of the people voting on imbd prior to me gave it a 9 or 10. I don't care that the person who went with me gave it an 8. I DON'T CARE!And, that is the problem. I didn't care about the characters in this movie. You know how a movie establishes A and then B builds on A and then C builds on B, etc. Logical. Well, this movie is all over the map. It was chronological, assuming you can look past the leaves being gone in October, but bright green at Christmas. Nevertheless, it attempted to give a chronological account. However, the problem was that what happened from scene to scene had little bearing on any prior or future scene. It was just a series of half-hearted skits loosely related.I knew the movie was 93 minutes before I went in, but I would have bet the house that it was a misprint. When I got out and looked at a clock, I couldn't believe it had only been 93 minutes. Does that tell you anything?It is quirky and off beat. The lead character is very unusual and strange. That is a good start. But, no script, horrible editing, few laughs (was this a comedy?), no genuine romance, and no likeable characters left me feeling incredibly empty. I will forget this movie before I'm done typing this review.",Rushmore
103,arthera09,wes anderson gets started,8,14 May 2008,"I wanted to give this movie a 7, but I cannot rate this movie poorly because it is not as good as his other ones. This is still a brilliant movie and extremely smart and well put together, but he did not seem to hit his stride quite yet. The cast of course is perfect and Bill Murray has been funny, but still classic Bill Murray. Jason Schwartmen looks really long in this and pulls off a really adult role (for any age) really well. His character is so well rounded and developed he just made the movie. The surprising thing with the movie is the soundtrack. I am beginning to think Wes Anderson knows how to soundtrack a movie better than most out there right now. The use of Cat Stevens blew my mind and it just shows how much Wes Anderson understands movies as a whole. There are so many perfect moments that surprise, but are totally appropriate. The whole scene with Jason getting arrested and the look on his face is priceless. I really with Owen Wilson wrote more and did not try to be some Hollywood star. Overall a great movie, but not his best.",Rushmore
104,Jakealope,In It's Way it is utterly brilliant and original,5,20 February 2015,"It has great characters, starting out with Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman). He's the brilliant eccentric, king of extracurricular activities but failure at classes he could easily ace, sophomore in high school. He is a scholarship student at an elite prep school. His dad is a barber not a brain surgeon as he usually tells people. He is a relentless organizer and hustler, who forms new clubs and writes and stages plays, as well as leading a younger classmate around like his personal orderly. Then, after reading a hand written note in a Jacques Cousteau book, written by the alluring English first grade teacher and widow Miss Croos(Olivier William), our fifteen year old eccentric falls in love with her. Then our hero meets an older rich industrialist, Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a big school alumni booster. He both uses and yet befriends the Bl;ume into a weird relationship, in order to get his pet project, which he hopes will woo our Miss Cross, an aquarium. But the aquarium scheme of his, which involves displacing the baseball field and trees causes the perplexed Dr Guggenheim to finally boot the trouble maker out to the cruder public school. Then the Blume hit it on with Miss Cross and that causes eruptions of jealousy and anger against the duo who betrayed him. This starts a feud which he gets the upper hand, he gets Cross to resign, Blume's wife to leave him, Then he gets dangerous by committing sabotage Blume's car, by merely sauntering into his factory and crawling underneath it then releasing bees in Blume's hotel room too. Okay, the characters and plot are totally original and interesting, no denying. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are a good talented movie team. The actors are all good too, Brian Cox, the Wilson Brothers, and the other young actors who played the students. But as a movie, it fails a level of basic plausibility. It also fails that as interesting as Max is, he is a sociopath that wiser and older adults enable, not stop. Even his Miss Cross older woman obsession yields to him in the end, They show the kid smoking on campus, and no one even tries to stop or reprimand him. And this is not a druggie movie, which is good, unlike say Spun, where Schwartzmen is a meth head. The kid does some plainly evil dangerous things yet they all get brushed off by the adults. His dad doesn't even try to give him a lecture, like do your homework so you can graduate from high school because you are a genius sort of thing. He just does cruel things but gets away with it. He shoots a bully in the ear with a pellet gun from a 2nd floor window, unprovoked, since they are in different schools, but gets the bully to star in his Vietnam war play at the public school.Clever, original but in the end, do you really like or care about a soulless hustler? The kid had some real issues, and the adults in his life didn't seem to care much either.",Rushmore

   The only two scenes (I still kinda' liked, but) didn't understand were when Max is around the fire outside Rushmore and flicks the principal off. The next scene, when, ****SPOILER WARNING****, he talks to Blume's wife and tells on him. I just didn't understand why that scene didn't really go with the movie in my mind.    But, other than that, this movie seems to be written/recorded while it was being directed/filmed. I would like to think that, in the ending, I understood right (******POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) when I thought Miss Cross was finally seduced by Max's charms, thus explaining why she took his glasses off: to see him in a ""new way.""

He is a filmmaker I always feel I *should* like, but having suffered through Moonrise Kingdom, Life Aquatic, and The Royal Tenebaums, I had come to the conclusion that he is just not my taste. Then, like a lot of other people, I greatly enjoyed Grand Budapest Hotel. So having heard Rushmore was his masterpiece, I sought this film out. It is not as good as GBH, but also not as twee or tedious as the other films I mention here. It all seems very forced and wooden, which is probably the point, or an aspect of a point I am missing. I smiled, I admired the witticisms and general sense of life as ephemeral it conjures, but most of the time I wanted to be elsewhere. If you are a Wes Anderson virgin, Rushmore seems a good place to start. Love this and you have hours of viewing pleasure ahead of you.

His best friend is Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a depressed millionaire, but disaster ensues when they both fall for the same woman, teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams).The film may prove to be a little dark and off-beat for some tastes, but it is worth sticking with it.

The story of a boy, overachiever in everything but academics, and his unrequired love inside the school he sees as the whole universe, is as fresh as it is interesting.The characters are incredibly colorful and their emotions beliavable. Their dialogs, while quite odd at times, are carried with extreme naturality. And that's what makes the movie so funny.

111,K-Slicer,"Offbeat, Atypical, and Surprising",9,25 August 2002,"This movie is one of the more offbeat that I have ever seen.  This is the classic ""two guys in love with the same woman"" scenario that we have seen in many movies prior to this and throws in many unexpected facets.  The idea of a secondary school sophomore fighting a rich, middle-aged man for the affection of an elementary school teacher is an eye-opening premise.  Throw in a few others like a Scottish bully, a naive sidekick, and an almost elderly barber who is also a father and you have the minor masterpiece ""Rushmore"".  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson did a magnificent job writing a razor sharp and tightly wound screenplay.  Anderson did an excellent in directing the film.  The cast of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray among others was just awesome.  I think both Schwartzman and Murray possibly had the best performances of their careers with this movie (Murray should have been nominated for an Oscar).  The conflict between the two male leads is hilarious and almost nerve-racking.  Halfway through the film, I despised them both. By the end I was back liking both of them.  This is probably one the best pairings of male leads I have seen since L.A. Confidential. Overall, this is a minor masterpiece that has garnished a lot of praise for all those involved.  I hated it in some parts but I loved it in many respects.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are masterful filmmakers and I hope they continue to do well.  This film gets a 9 out of 10.",Rushmore

He dominates and flawlessly pulls sentimental cinema out of his hat. Before watching Rushmore, I had only seen The Royal Tenenbaums (which I also thought was fantastic), but this secondary film to a career that will make so much more, is great. Anderson conducts an excellent cast and finds a superb Max Fischer in Jason Shwartzman.Excellent performances by Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, and Seymour Cassel. Also may I add, what a lovely woman found in Sara Tanaka! She was a great foil for Jason Schwartzman's character and came across so easily with innocence, it hurt me to see Max ignore her, but she remains an absolute favorite.Beautiful scenes are conducted and masterfully done. Superb acting across the board and the story is as unconventional as ever.",Rushmore
113,Kai-18,Not really that funny but clever and a good movie.,10,17 November 1999,I felt this wasn't really a comedy like it tried to look like in the commercials.  This was more of a romantic drama with likable characters and a touching story.  And though it isn't as funny as you might hope it is clever and witty.  No pretty boy actors needed in a film like this.  It's more realistic this way.,Rushmore
114,BB-15,Obnoxious But It Grows On You,5,3 September 1999,"Rushmore has something that I usually do not like, an in your face, obnoxious main character (appropriately named Rushmore). Check out Barcelona for a grating example of this. There were moments in Rushmore when I thought that things were getting unpleasant. But that's when the film would pull another of its unexpected plot twists and believe me this movie has plenty of them. So, I found myself being pulled deeper into the Rushmore world and that is a good way to describe it. Because, this is a full blown adolescent male fantasy but not the usual testosterone laden ""wham bam thank you ma'am"" kind. No, Rushmore is a nerd fantasy extraordinare. Nothing is beyond Rushmore. Yet the film satirizes this absurd over achievement. Then it adds the twist of achievement as a cover up for ordinary beginnings. And so it goes, one good idea after another. If there is a problem with the film, it is that as an adolescent fantasy some of the older characters, the ones played by Bill Murray and Olivia Williams in particular, have moments that are not very believable. Yet I got the message that wouldn't it be cool if it could happen. And after a while I bought into it, all of these adults revolving around Rushmore and his world.
If all of this sounds a bit strange, I don't blame you because it is. My only suggestion is that you give Rushmore a chance. And if you do, I think it will grow on you too.",Rushmore

I love Wes Anderson, his films are some of my favourites but this film only really works when it speeds up, and don't get me wrong, when the film does speed up it's amazing, but the majority of the film is so slow. I like the chemistry between Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray but both of their characters are so unlikeable. It's worth a watch if you're interested in filmmaking and the cinematography is pretty good but on the whole I wouldn't recommend it.

To all those people who could identify with the story, perhaps because you were once an obnoxious and spoiled 15 yr old kid, more power to you.  I did not enjoy this film. Bill Murray deserves an Oscar for this? You've got to be kidding me. I love Bill Murray.  I loved his work in Groundhog day, Wild Things, Stripes, and others, but this is not his best role. This movie dragged along, with few funny moments.  The irritating line: ""but I wrote a plaaayyyy....!"" is still ringing in my ears like somebody scratching on a chalkboard.Go rent ""Real Genius"", starring Val Kilmer, or the dark comedy ""After Hours"" for something that's at least as original as Rushmore and undoubtedly more funny.",Rushmore

I spent the first half of the movie bored and the last half of the movie dissapointed.  Yes, there were a few laughs to be had, but I wish there had been more, much more.  I believe this is not Bill Murray's best performance since Groundhog Day. Murray's small part in ""Wild Things"" easily bests this showing. Murray spends most of the movie barely uttering more than a few lines in any one scene.  Yet, despite this, his mere presence in odd situations seem to elicit laughter from audiences.  Furthermore, I didn't believe that the main character was fifteen, didn't understand his obsession with joining every possible school club, didn't believe any tycoon, such as Bill Murray's character in the film, would identify with such a wierd brat.On the plus side the movie did have solid acting, particularly by Olivia Williams, as Rosemary Cross, and also by a very cute Sara Tanaka as Maragaret Yang.

119,pinokiyo,Sooooo overrated. Annoying characters. No special plot. Juvenile script.,1,13 November 2008,"I just finished watching this movie, so it is still fresh in my mind. This movie was so pointless and a waste of time. Period. I didn't find it funny at all. I can't believe people love this movie. The humor was so elementary. However, I'm sure others enjoy hearing about hand jobs and whatnot. I mean, I can take stupid jokes, but there was nothing witty about it or having a point to the scene. Written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson? No wonder... an actor and a director -- they need to hire a real WRITER.First of all, how can one enjoy a movie if everything about the main character is just plain annoying and sooo full of himself. If you can't root or care for the character, there's already a problem. Not to mention he's pretty much the same in the end. Not only that, but the plot is absolutely stupid and nothing special, especially the way it is executed because it's so forced. People don't really talk or act like they do in this movie in real life. Max (the main guy) becomes best friends with Bill Murray (typical poor Bill supporting role here) and then falls for a new teacher at Rushmore. And what a surprise, Bill suddenly falls for the teacher too. We basically see Max and Bill Murray do pranks on each other, but in the end, they makeup. How cute. Meanwhile, Max tries to hook up Bill by wasting Bill's money and working on his stupid high-budget-special-effects-explosion plays. Max's play is a success and everyone is just one big happy family. Give me a break.This movie takes more time on pointless subplots than focusing/spending time on a major plot.It's obvious the director just wanted to use many of his favorite 70's songs in this movie. I think it's dumb people give high votes on the movie just because of the soundtrack.If you're one of those people who loved Donnie Darko, then you'll probably love this too because I thought both movies were just stupid and just hype. Also, if you loved the fake acting in ""Juno"" then you'll probably love the way they act in this movie too. I should have known this guy directed Royal Tenenbaums. That movie was so overrated as well, even though it had an all-star cast. I rather watch Royal Tenenbaums again than this movie, but I honestly don't understand Wes Anderson's taste.Skip it.

121,robinski34,The 'more the Merrier,8,26 July 2013,"Delighful and occasionally infuriating, 'Rushmore' is another Andersonian gem, littered with challenges to the conventions and roles of adulthood. Jason Schwartzman teeters on the brink of believability as Max Fischer, seeming at times to be straining against the physical aspects of the part, but in the end this conceit (JS was only 3 years older than Max at the time) is can be accepted as events breeze past it. All the roles are beautifully inhabited by a fine cast, Bill Murray seemingly effortless as usual, Olivia Williams quietly captivating. The smaller parts tend to flit in and out of the story, but always to great effect and staying in the memory, they contribute to a sweet and highly enjoyable piece with a rip-roaring conclusion. As expected, the soundtrack is a chocolate box of unexpected but carefully chosen treats, knitted together with original music by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh. Rushmore is a great pleasure after some initial annoyance, when parents in the audience may have the urge to react to Max's petulance, but it's nicely judged, another diamond on the already glittering path followed by fans of the Fantastic Mr. Wes.",Rushmore

A visceral coming of age story of a precocious kid lost in his own feelings and dealing with teenage angst",8,22 April 2020,"There it is again, how does he do it? How do Wes Anderson's stories move so much. With maybe not the more whimsical cinematography of the bunch, this story speaks truth about the life of the director. Although following common themes of coming of age tales, the execution of these themes are melancholic and subtle.Like with every Wes Anderson story, the movie decides to strictly follow the show don't tell rule in the treatment of each character's feelings as well as their motivations throughout it. Like with every movie of his, for me it's really hard to narrow down in specific points or aspects what is that the director does so that while it chooses unconventional ways of developing the characters it still completely succeeds at conveying the exact message or feeling.There's a sort of surrealism induced in the reality the characters live in as they confront very realistic situations in life yet the characterization of every person is absent of a logic realization. Despite how a 15 year old would be speaking to adults with that hubris and pretentiousness which would never be taken seriously in real-life situation, the adults decide to not only indulge it but also play along as part of the same world. By know, a feat commonly attached to Wes Anderson's work.Cynical and dark comedy at times, the movie portrays a characterization of a teenager that speaks in a poshy, well-mannered adult way which, while not working at first, grows on you as you get accostumed to Wes Anderson's imaginative take at whay could be considered his quintessential view at teenage angst, coping with the death of our beloved and finding our place in the world while we explore our most artistic self along the way.IN CONCLUSION, aside from the peculiarities and unconventionalities that characterizes Wes Anderson's filmmaking, the movie holds a heartfelt, troubled and bittersweet story of a charismatic and at times narcissistic teenager who is trying to understand his feelings and to make amends with his mistakes as he touches the lives of people that unknowingly needed it.",Rushmore

Max's success as a producer of plays indicates a promising future in that area alone, but he is also an organizer extraordinaire, initiating all kinds of successful extracurricular activities. But he neglects his school work, probably out of boredom, and is kicked out of school for that failure. His infatuation with a pretty teacher ten or more years older than him is nothing unusual, just ask any former teenage boy. His problem is that he becomes obsessed and obviously needs special counseling i.e. ""professional help."" In the end his quirkiness appears to be more appreciated by all and happiness is just around the corner.

125,krumski,A disappointment for Bill Murray fans,5,5 February 2000,"I'm a huge fan of Bill Murray and I have to admit that the main reason I even saw this movie was because he was in it and I'd heard how good he was. I was really disappointed; this has got to be the wispiest, most spineless, least amusing character Bill Murray has ever played in his long film career. I can't understand why all the critics thought it was so great. Herman Blume is so insular and withdrawn that he allows Murray to display none of his patented hipster irony and charm. Nor is he a very credible character: supposedly some kind of industrial tycoon, he's not given any kind of strength or determination or craftiness - in short, nothing that would make us believe that he was capable of being the self-made man he's supposed to be.  No, his prime function in the movie is to serve as a kind of patsy/second banana for the kid. It's all about how he learns from MAX, how he comes to admire MAX, how he's duped and gotten the better of by MAX -- their relationship is entirely one-sided and it soon became very annoying.Partly, that's because Max himself is so annoying - geeky, rude and completely full of himself. I have to say, however, that I found Jason Schwartzman's performance in the role to be really good. He's not afraid to BE unlikable, doesn't go wearing the character's heart on his sleeve, begging for our sympathy. As such, he achieves a kind of purity to his performance that's admirable. And there *is* good stuff here: in particular, Max's dramatic productions - of ""Serpico"" and a Viet Nam play he wrote himself - are a hoot. Also, the film benefits from a sharp and playful editing style, as well as a great soundtrack (featuring, curiously enough, mostly mid-sixties pop tunes by the likes of the Who, the Kinks, the Faces and the Rolling Stones).But, ultimately, the film just cannot rise above the fact that its central story - the relationship between Max and Herman, and their separate attempts to woo an attractive teacher at Rushmore - is just not strong enough or well thought out enough to hinge a movie on. The role of the teacher, Ms. Cross, is particularly ill-conceived and underwritten; we get no sense of what it is about her that is so endearing to the male leads. With Max this isn't so much a problem, as it can be chalked up to youthful infatuation, but what exactly does Herman see in her? And, more importantly, what does she see in HIM (she does, after all, return his affections)? The point is, the filmmakers do such a poor job in sketching out the grownup characters in the first place, that we have no real way of knowing just what kind of person or what kind of traits they would be attracted to anyway.If you want to see a slightly better than average teen flick, I suppose Rushmore fits the bill, but don't expect much more than that. And Bill Murray fans should definitely save their money. If you want to see the Mur-man in a ""mature"" performance that's truly worthy of his talents, check out Groundhog Day instead (and if you already have, then watch it again! There's no way you can see this comic masterpiece too many times).",Rushmore
126,Primtime,Very well done!!,7,14 July 1999,"Why aren't more films like Rushmore made? You know, the type of film that doesn't follow a pattern set by other films before it. Every now and then when a film with an original story and script come out, the critics drool all over them, word-of-mouth causes people to see them and yet the studios insist on making films like The Avengers, Instinct and She's All That.Jason Schwartzman plays the role of Max Fischer amazingly well. It almost seems like this role was created for him. Being a genius requires that person to move down to the levels of others, which is probably why Max is involved with so many different out-of-school activities and not working hard enough at school itself. Watching Max in Serpico (one of his plays), plotting revenge against Herman Blume (Bill Murray), in a drunken rage or bantering with a Scotsman are all pure delight and are really the main substance of this film. Others balk at his stalking of the teacher twice his age, but don't realize this is the only way a naive Max knows how to reach out (it is explained that his mother died while he was young).Bill Murray's performance was pretty good, although not Oscar-worthy as so many others have said. This is only because his performance is so one-dimensional and never really stands on his own in scenes without Max. Olivia Williams has a quiet but decent performance as Max's love interest. She doesn't really have a lot of room to vary her performance which explains her one-dimensional character.I would fully recommend this film to all.7/10 stars.",Rushmore

The one thing I liked a lot was the music, particularly the Stones' ""I Am Waiting,"" which is extracted well here (I think the original runs about 11 minutes on one of their early albums). There are a couple of Cat Stevens songs used, as well.  I thought public schools were going to get trashed after the hero gets expelled from his precious Rushmore but life goes on--I think we have a theme!

The character was based on Hal Ashby who made, among other films, ""Harold and Maude"". ""Rushmore"" is in the direct lineage of ""Harold and Maude"".Well, I never really liked ""Harold and Maude"" and I can see the limits to Kurt Vonnegut too. (And ""Rushmore"" is far from Vonnegut.) What explains the abiding connection of some viewers to this movie? I suspect that quirkiness in a character is appealing to some people coming to grips with their own quirkiness in what appears to be a quirky world. Call this a coming of age movie, redux.For me, it was a badly told non-story with adolescent characters who spoke to the audience and not to each other. The dialogue was of the ""he says, pause, she says"" variety. The movie was also boring.

It was by far the best of many good films I had seen in the whole week and I couldn't wait to see it again. Reception of the film was very favourable in the theatre and in comments I heard from critics in post-festival interviews.When it was released on February 5th, I saw it again, and enjoyed it immensely.It's a quirky comedy about a precocious fifteen year old private school student who engages whole-heartedly in too many extra-curricular activities which results in poor grades despite his intelligence.He falls in love with a teacher and fails to see the unlikelihood of a successful courtship.If the first 15 minutes don't make you want more, you may as well leave and get your money back. But if you stay, you'll be treated to one of the finest films of 1998/1999; and the sad thing is, most people won't even know what they're missing.I'm not sure whether devout fans of ""Bottle Rocket"" will like this one better or not.

Star packed, in fact there were more of them than there were laughs. Trying to be fair I gave Wes Anderson a second chance and watched ""Rushmore"". Lo and behold it was self-consciously cute rubbish. The only thing that made it slightly more watchable was the absence of Gwyneth Paltrow. Jason Schwartzman is annoying as I'm sure the intention was. Bill Murray does his standing still and pulling a face routine. The script is adolescent. Although the film is about an adolescent from supposedly adult filmmakers one would expect an adult viewpoint. Some have compared ""Juno"" to this and I can see where this view originates from: ""Juno"" at least beneath it's over-cutesy-cool surface had something resembling a heart. If you like comedy without laughs, drama without drama and have failed to develop emotionally I wholeheartedly recommend this film.",Rushmore

You get the feeling that you've known what was going to happen the whole time, you have that sense of when the movie ends, you don't want it to; you want it to keep going for a little while, to savor the silly little entwining relationships through Max Fischer's eyes.

I especially like the fact that Max is not completely lovable, but in the end you root for him anyway. I found all the various reconciliations quite touching, and there's an interesting emphasis on friendships between people with lots of differences.

Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Bentley films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman!

139,IRateFilms,"Rushmore, You can't ask for more.",8,14 September 2006,"Rushomre, the second film written and directed by Wes Anderson, but the first to really establish his style, comes across as a breathe of fresh air. The detail that is put into this film alone gives Anderson the aptitude to be one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation. Each character has their own idiosyncrasies that are both bizarre and believable. The main character Max Fischer, played by the then fresh face, Jason Scwartzman is masterfully written in Andersons screenplay. His every movement, the clothing he wears, the music he listens to, everything about him makes this character unforgettable. This film also marks the beginning of the serious Bill Murray, who plays an unhappy, middle-aged millionaire who seems to want and lack the same things Fischer himself strives to attain. Both characters although different in many ways have the same problems, and even though they work against each other throughout the course of the story, end up realizing they are more alike then they anticipated. The dry, and sometimes caustic humor in this film is priceless. Anderson knows exactly how to time a joke, both through its delivery and the cinematography itself. Almost a masterpiece Rushmore is Andersons ""Pulp Fiction"" and greatest piece to date. Rushmore not only spawned a rush of similar films (The Squid and the Whale, Little Miss Sunshine, etc. ) but perfected it at its early stage.",Rushmore

141,bhicks56,My favorite film so far!,10,16 November 1999,"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson has formed an offbeat, comically genious story filled with charismatic characters like Jason Schwartzman's Max Fischer and Bill Murray's Mr. Blume. Not to mention the angelic Olivia Williams in the middle of the odd love triangle. The most underrated masterpiece of the decade!",Rushmore
142,advaitkamat,An offbeat comedy that may not impress everyone.,6,25 December 2012,"There is a sequence in the Wes Anderson-directed ""Rushmore"" where a student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) dreams of solving a maths problem which no one in the world has the brains to solve. Watch the sequence carefully for two reasons : It's way too real and that's the funniest sequence in this comedy-drama. ""Rushmore"" is an offbeat comedy that has the power to make your day if you enjoy the genre but can leave you feeling disappointed if you don't.15-year-old Max Fischer is the most famous student of Rushmore, a private school in which he is largely involved in almost all of the extracurricular activities and flunks in most of the subjects when it comes to academics. When he's put on academic probation because of his poor grades, he finds a reason to return to Rushmore when he develops a massive crush on a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Oblivious to him, his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman, is also in love with her. The film follows the story of how Max tries to resolve the situation after he learns of Blume's feelings while trying to win Cross' heart.The film has a bit of an odd setting because you can't figure out why Anderson has so many characters in the movie if he just wanted to focus on the love triangle. I found myself questioning the need of so many characters if the plot follows the story of just three of them. You don't know where Anderson's getting at with the plot and by the time you almost stop caring, the sub-plot kicks in and the film escalates into a romance.But ""Rushmore"" has got those few moments of genuine humor that you can't help but fall for its charm. The characters, though many, are superbly etched out. The innovative screenplay, jointly written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, is supremely funny in parts. There are these moments where I allowed myself a hearty laugh, like the one where Max tries to get Rosemary Cross fired when he learns that she too has feelings for Blume only to find out that she has already resigned and his plan has backfired.Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams, in their respective roles, are top-notch. The character of Max is oddly likable although you can't shake off the feeling that he was someone you didn't expect to like or wasn't someone who was supposed to turn out the way he has. Schwartzman portrays Max as a stubborn, flimsy human-being and does it with aplomb. I'm not quite sure I understood how the characters of Max and Herman Blume develop a firm friendship. Bill Murray, one of the best actors of his generation, sleepwalks through his role. His performance is controlled, expressive and easy to relate to.All in all, ""Rushmore"" is greatly flawed but it has got its heart in the right place. There are a few scenes in the film which look as if they've been pulled straight out of your life. The plot skims through many genres but ultimately settles for a deeply-felt drama from a talented director. Watch it, if not for anything else, for those quirky moments which make you feel as if you have been in these situations with people like these saying stuff like that.",Rushmore
143,IkuharaKunihiko,Oscars are not worth 5 cents anymore,9,27 February 2005,"Let me for starters just name all the prizes Bill Murray won for ""Rushmore""; he was nominated for a Chicago film critics award and a Golden Globe, while he won the Indipendant spirit award, American comedy award, Lone star film award, L.A. film critics certificate, NSFC award, Golden Satellite and N.Y. film critics certificate. The fact that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar ( while some guys like Geoffrey Rush from the insignificant ""Shakespeare in love"" were )just proves that some awards today are not worth 5 cents.Truth be told, the first time I saw ""Rushmore"" I was confused to say the least and was quick to dismiss it. But its images somehow stayed in my head and left me thinking. There was something in this movie that made you want to see it and judge it again, and you couldn't put your finger on it what it was. I saw ""Rushmore"" again one year later and I couldn't explain to myself the following reaction; this time it seemed almost perfect. As a matter of fact, I had a smile on my face for the whole first 30 minutes.------------------------- ""Rushmore"" is a drama/comedy and is directed in its own way. I guess many will feel uneasy because its hero is actually an antihero, a person that makes everything wrong and fails, but still has the courage to continue. My favorite line is ""O.R. they?"" Two sequences stand out from the story. One is, of course, the montage of all the clubs Max founded equipped with subtitles ( Yankee review publisher/ French club president/ model U.N. Russia / stamp and coin club vice president/ debate team captain/ Lacross team manager/ calligraphy club president/ astronomy society founder/ fencing team captain/ track and field J.V. decathlon/ 2nd chorale choirmaster/ bombardment society/ Kung Fu club yellow belt/ beekeepers president/ Yankee racers founder/ players director/ piper cub club )in combination with the great song ""Making time"" and the other one is when he is doing a salto in his new school while Cat Stevens genius song ""Here comes my baby"" is playing.On the site rotten-tomatoes.com ""Rushmore"" got a very high average grade of 8.0/10, making it the most acclaimed of all Wes Anderson films. Still, the movie is not flawless; it has emotions, but I would have loved more romantic interaction between Bill Murray and Olivia Williams and a more tightened leading hand in directing. Also, sometimes the scenes seem heavily edited and over explained. And the dark touches are a little bit over the top. Non the less, everyone here can be proud of this movie, which is one of a kind.Grade: 9/10",Rushmore

How in the world did they ever get this thing made?Great performances, especially by Jason Schwartzmann and Bill Murray, who seems to bounce from really good movies (Mad Dog and Glory) to really bad ones (the movie with the elephant in it).Really interesting writing- hard to predict where it was going, sometimes even when it got there. Although it was set in a high school, the level of writing is anything but the usual high-school comedy ilk. Each of the characters has some flaw (or in the case of Max, LOTS of flaws), but each is redeemable, if not loveable, in their own way.Bizarre, but entertaining.",Rushmore

Jason Schwartzman was great at what I thought was an incredibly irritating character (is that good or bad?).  I finally came to like him by the end of the movie, but I had to endure a lot of the movie when he's just a jerk.  Bill Murray came across as sad more than funny, which also disappointed me.

But it came nowhere close to preparing me for this, his second film.  It is an amazingly accomplished and original comedy. Virtually every character and scene is fresh and unpredictable.  The movie flies by and, how rare for movies now, leaves you wanting more.  At the end of the showing I caught, the audience burst into loud applause.  The performances are all great but two stand out: Bill Murray, whose performances I always like, outdoes himself here as an eccentric industrialist.  This could be the second year in a row that a comedian comes away with the best supporting actor Oscar.  And of course there is the star: young Joshua Schwartzman as Max, the nerdy over-achiever.  It's hard to remember a first starring role that made such a great impact--you might have to go back to Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate.""  In my book, this is the one to beat for best picture of the year.",Rushmore
147,silva-w-pius,I'm in no doubt that Wes Anderson's banger should be on everyone's bucket lists of films to watch.,8,16 July 2014,"The word 'auteur' is French for 'author', essential the idea behind auteur theory is that a filmmaker exercises an authorship over his/her work as if they were a novelist. This results in their work always consisting of a stylistic, technical or narrative signature that is unique to them, allowing the audience when watching a film to instantly be able know who directed it. Since the dawn of cinema, we have had the pleasure of witnessing many auteur's doing what they do best, which is making films that are unique and inherently them; may it be Hitchcock and his ever present big twists or Tarantino and his hyper violent nonlinear narratives. But in this modern day, only one filmmaker working do I really feel optimisers the word auteur the best, which is Wes Anderson and if you read my Moonlight Kingdom review you will know I'm a massive fan. Forget Moonlight Kingdom or Royal Tenenbaums, because Rushmore in particular ranks as my all time favourite Anderson film. Every school has them, that one kid who seems to have at least 40 hours a day, while the rest of us mere mortals only have 24 to wrestle with. Then not just seemingly having more hours than the rest of us, this one kid is also able to achieve and do so much more in a week then most people do in a life time. Rushmore has one and his name is Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an obnoxious, precocious 15 year old who is just about involved in every extracurricular clubs known to man; it could be as dull as competitive box packing club, as pointless as a hopping backwards whilst blindfolded club or even as impossible as a synchronised diving whilst playing the violin club. If there is a club, I can guarantee that not only is Max Fischer the president of that club, but was probably the found of it to. But you're thinking with all that extracurricular activity, how would he have time to do well academically also? Well even the extraordinary Max Fischer can't be a part of all those clubs and still get straight A's, his failing and is in the danger of being kicked of Rushmore, which promises to make a lot of people happy, including the head teacher himself, the school bully and his once pint sized friend now turned bitter enemy . Then when you thought that was harsh on him, to top it all off, he has to compete for the affection of the beautiful yet quaint teacher Rosemary (Olivia Williams), with his much older, idol and best friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who also just happens to be a millionaire too. Sounds like trying to sink the Titanic with an ice cube or trying to accurately measure how tall Mount Everest is with a 6 inch ruler; basically what I'm trying to say is things seem pretty impossible for Max to able to both win the girl and stay at Rushmore too. But this is Max Fischer we're talking about! He can't even spell the word failure – no literally he can't, he flunked English too. Being only Anderson's second feature after Bottle Rocket, you can forgive Rushmore hasn't quite got the same Picasso-esk cinematography, that with its rich, vibrant and bright textures is so effortlessly able to set each scene a blaze with colour, that is beautifully demonstrated in his later films like Moonrise or The Grand Budapest Hotel. However Rushmore still possesses Andersons flair for creating seemingly perfect and coherent characters on the surface, but when you actually venture under the glossy finishes, you realise they are more mad, crazy and dysfunctional then you could ever imagine. And it's for that very reason why I loved the characters of Herman and Max so adamantly, who while on the surface seem so dissimilar; Max being so pronounced and well put together while Herman on other hand is always a car crash waiting to happen, but deep down they are just lonely souls seeking the honest feeling of love and acceptance. My favourite sequence of theirs was when they were trying to sabotage each other; Max by putting bees in Herman's hotel room and then Herman in retaliation destroying Max's bike. The sequence was so imaginative and provided a shed load of many great laughs, reminding me greatly of Tom and Jerry. What I also love about Wes Anderson, is that he never gets lazy when it comes to characterising his supporting characters, they are always so dynamic, unique and if we were to follow their lives instead, it will also make for a great movie. When it comes to picking the best supporting characters, it's so difficult because they all have such compelling personalities and idiosyncrasies, there is Max's father who is a barber but is always strangely mistaken for a neurosurgeon, there is the bully with the really thick Scottish accent and then there is Dirk who is so adorable that he puts Macaulay Culkin in Home alone to shame. Empire was right when it ranked Rushmore in the top 200 films of all time, because I'm in no doubt that Wes Anderson's banger should be on everyone's bucket lists of films to watch.",Rushmore

149,AW_McGOWAN,An Early Peak From Wes Anderson,7,1 December 2020,"Released in 1998, ""Rushmore"" was the first major success from director Wes Anderson. It also might be his most conservative film. For someone like me, who has always been weary of Anderson's deep stylization, ""Rushmore's"" stable nature is a good thing.The movie centers on fifteen-year-old Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a prep school student with ambition in all the wrong places. He is a member of over a dozen clubs, but is simultaneously failing his classes. Max becomes smitten with a new teacher at the school (Olivia Williams), but the plot thickens when one of his classmates' dad (Bill Murray) falls for that same woman. They vie over her affection in a story that offers a unique take on adolescent pain and joy.""Rushmore"" plays like a John Hughes movie, but with a quirky dash of genre-bending. It is part teen movie, part comedy, and part melodrama. This trifecta does not feel overbearing, however, as the tone never shifts incredulously. The characters may not be the most lovable people throughout, but we still empathize with their emotions, and their redemption in the end is worth cheering for.I also like the movie on a visual level, at least compared to most Anderson movies. For people who relish in the other-worldly sharp aesthetic of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" or ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,"" ""Rushmore"" doesn't have quite the same flare. Nevertheless, I really appreciate how ""Rushmore"" feels of this universe. Maybe this is because cameras in the late nineties were not fine-tuned enough to support Anderson's vibrant vision; or maybe the director still needed more time to become the bold artisan he is today.Still, a lot of Wes Anderson's trademark cinematographic moves are there in ""Rushmore,"" but he executes them rather quietly. Other than the occasional curtain-closing over the frame to signify a transition, there is not a lot of distraction on-camera.I actually wish that Wes Anderson remained this subtle in his subsequent movies. By-and-large, I still enjoy his screenplays, but his flamboyant style often takes me out of the stories. ""Rushmore"" is funny, relatable, and touching, supported by some spot-on performances and a well-measured degree of artistry.",Rushmore
150,mattymatt30,If you're a square peg in a round world,9,17 March 2004,"Rushmore is such a fun movie to watch, that if you are the type of individual that can relate to this film, you'll want to own it for your collection. The story is about a unique kid named Max Fisher, who seems gifted in many ways. His talents range from directing and writing live theater, to founding and/or organizing every school club- no matter how obscure.  This 40 year old in a 15 year old body is just a little out of place in school, even in his beloved private school of Rushmore. This is made clear not only by his dismal grades, but by his pursuit of a pretty and sophisticated woman, a teacher at Rushmore.  The characters of Max Fisher and the wealthy business tycoon Herman Blume, played to perfection by Bill Murray, who ends up competing with Max for the love of the teacher, are what drive this film. They are friends despite their age difference, then rivals - and it is this unusual mix that makes this film unique.  The film seems to say that people can be different and unique in life, and that they should be able to pursue love,happiness, and meaning, without giving in to society's expectations. If you feel that you're a unique person and have taken flack in your life for it, watch Rushmore, and learn to love yourself for being you.",Rushmore

Rushmore is very offbeat and very dark, which is odd because at its core, rushmore is simply a feelgood comedy. the ending illustrates this, with everyone all chummy and forgiving. this is probably the only part that i felt was a little slack, i felt the rest of the film was so unpredictable and darkly comic that this happy happy joy joy ending was disapointing. however, i didnt pick one bad peformance in this film- max is f%*^ing brilliant and a very complex character. i could talk about this film for ever and a day but i will keep this short and sweet. rushmore is one of the best films that ive seen in the past five years. i give this 9/10.",Rushmore

We can all, in one way or another could relate to one of the characters in the movie.  Max Fischer, the overachiever.  Mr. Herman Blume, the rich guy who is extemely unhappy in his life.

Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is an activity jock who resides on a scholarship at the prestigious Rushmore Academy. Max enlists in the help of lonely millionaire Herman Blume (played wonderfully by Bill Murray) to build an aquarium in honor of the school teacher (Olivia Williams) they both have their eyes on. I think the film is enjoyable, it's quirky and funny, but it's just TOO strange in spots and saddled with an ending that is COMPLETELY out of place with the film. Still, I recommend this picture because Murray gives one of the best supporting performances of the year; don't underrate this guy, there's definitely something underneath the shabby stand-up comedian persona.

158,Exeron,Wes Anderson at his best,9,28 October 2009,"Well, his done it again. Wes Anderson's film continues to please me, and Rushmore is not an exception. In fact, it is, in my opinion his best work so far. This is where it began for Wes. He and Owen managed to write a great, original, and entertaining script. The movie circles around, as many of Wes's movies, ""failure"". The people are characterized by this and i think all of his films create some sort of cozy feeling.Mark Mothersbaugh, marvelous soundtrack as always.Bill Murray, the king of dry humorJason Schwartzman, underrated actor with good timingOlivia Williams, lovely with great accent.Do not doubt to see this.

159,Michael Bennett Cohn,a nearly perfect movie,10,1 February 1999,"The story is tightly woven, the dialog clever and snappy, the characters rich and compelling. Max Fischer is at once charismatic and pathetic, brilliant and foolish. I was left in awe of just how good this movie manages to be, and wanted to see it again immediately afterwards. It's easily one of the five best films of 1998, owing to its brilliant original story and fine acting. Bill Murray, in a perfect role for his talents, is an older reflection of the 15 year-old main character, witty and irreverent but seasoned with the wisdom of adulthood and many struggles already lost and won. I left the theater with a renewed hope for the future of cinema in the United States.",Rushmore
160,noalygh,Quirky and slow-riding adventure,6,23 July 2020,"I have to admit that even I find Wes Anderson movies splattered with some good writing, memorable moments and absurdist humor, and excellent cinematography, I find the hype on his movies almost hard to believe. Maybe it was the not clean enough editing, or the extra amount of time an actor poses an angry face after a joke, Wes Anderson's style hasn't hit that sweet spot for me - the thing that makes you moan ""Wow this is great cinema"" or laugh out loud; they only give me a slight chuckle with a tint of awkwardness afterwards.Rushmore is the second I watch after Moonrise Kingdom, and it fell along in the category. The movie comes with funny, then ponderous melancholia, but it felt that there was a lot of things happening in a scene, craving to strike your attention, that none of them actually make a good, big impact enough for a lasting impression. The protagonist, Max Fischer, is an insufferable and unpaired young person, that we can feel his pain of trying hard to put on his bravado, while figuring out things beyond Rushmore. However, I never found myself sliding with him. Max's obsession with the elementary teacher, Ms. Cross (whose role Olivia Williams with extremely attractive and phenomenal in) is undying and repetitive, it seems that after times and times of being heartbroken and rejected, he still finds new ways to get her, using each and every wild trick left in the book. I love Bill Murray's character: he is a friendly, loving and worried mentor, but also a nuanced, and lonesome character who also struggles to fit in and find his place like Max.Rushmore is funny, ridiculous and good, yet I cannot take it more than a children's movie because it is a continuous and hinged series of adventure with light-hearted and downcast moments, and lacking character progression. Still, Wes Anderson's quirks are undeniably great, and his touch of melancholy and incisive theme refine a charming foothold for the movie.",Rushmore
161,Marty-G,"""with friends like you, who needs friends?""",9,24 August 1999,"I found Rushmore to be a very smart, pleasant comedy. It may not have a great deal of depth, nor is the plot line the most original thing in the world, but it's all played out with a huge amount of charm. One of the best portrayals of a 'nerd' by newcomer Jason Schwartzman - why? Well, he's full of idiosyncrasies and foibles that make him more believable than the average geek portrayed on screen. The movie has a great deal of warmth and wit, and though some of the story seems a little unfeasible and certain plot developments are just kind of 'glossed over', the performances are great, and the whole movie feels heartfelt. One word seems to sum it up better than any other, and that's 'quirky' - so if the sound of that makes you run for shelter, then this ain't going to appeal.

His grades are terrible. He falls in love with a 1st grade teacher. One of his classmates father(Bill Murray) also falls for the teacher. Brilliant right? Well, the brilliance lies in the dead-seriousness of Max and how straight he is played by Schwartzeman and all the actors for that matter. Bottle Rocket, another film by Anderson and Owen, also uses this technique where the characters are almost ridiculously serious. The characters do the stupidest or oddest things and everyone is deadly serious and plays it straight. This movie has a certain feel and rhythm to it and if you get it, will discover it's hilarious and subtle and genius.",Rushmore
165,Theoron,One of the most brilliant films of the 90's,10,19 November 1999,"WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS.Let me tell you what I thought of Rushmore: Brilliant.This film skirts the romantic commedy genre without entering into it (Thank God...) Instead, it's more of an offbeat comic melodrama that is more of a character study than a typical three-act movie.   But make no mistake: this does, as Max Fischer would require it, follow the three-act movie formula.
ACT 1:  We are introduced to Max and his cohorts who attend Rushmore academy - a private school somewhere in the U.S. of A.   We quickly come to the realization that Max is not your typical snob-nosed rich kid, instead he about the most non-conformist conformist that one would ever likely to meet. He's obsessed with his school, obsessed with writing plays (usually based on films....) and obsessed with a first grade teacher far too old and too different to make any sort of meaningful romance.   But that doesn't stop our hero Max....ACT 2:  Max, unable to win the affections of the lovely grade school teacher, goes slightly insane.   Meanwhile, his buddy Mr. Bloom (Bill Murray), without really trying, does win the teacher's heart - as well as body.ACT 3:  You guessed it, somehow the writer finds reconciliation for everyone - though I won't spoil it by going into the details.   However, I thought the ending of this movie one of the cleverest since ""A Boy and His Dog"" - a cult film which has one of the best endings ever.As I sat watching this film unfold before me, I could not help but to think of ""Harold and Maude"" and ""The Graduate.""   As other reviewers have mentioned before me, it seems that Rushmore, in it's own offbeat way, pays tribute to both of these wonderful films of the past.
I'll admit it: the reason I rented this one was because Bill Murray is in it.  Bill can put on quite a show when given the opportunity, and he does not disappoint in this film!  I fell in love with his Mr. Bloom character, and would gladly watch this one several more times just to see Mr. Murray's performance.   Also, I agree with all those reviewers that have mentioned that this is his best performance since Ground Hog Day.But the character of Max is truly the glue that holds this film together. Jason Schwartzman does one of the most brilliant, subtle performances I've seen from a non-Brit.  His characterization, even in the midst of Max's own self-destruction, is a wonderful surprise.Max is my kind of guy.  You hate his guts, but can't help but feel a bit of pity and compassion for his plight.   You want to take him by his preppy school uniform jacket lapels and just shake some sense into his little holier-than-thou head.   But one need not to, for Max is more than capable of doing it to himself, with a bit of help from his Scotch archenemies Magnus.But I must heap the most praise on the director,  Wes Anderson, who obviously has the guts to take a film off the beaten path and have some fun with it.   There's a whole slew of people who won't care for this film, but I appreciated every little odd touch the director gave this work.  There's a level of craftsmanship here that one rarely encounters in films anymore. And it is obvious that director deeply cares for his characters and their plight - something that is the mark of the truly great Hollywood filmmakers.The beauty of ""Rushmore"" is that there's a whole lot more to this film than the actors and the script.   The director actually has the GAUL to ask the audience to think and feel about that which they are watching, not just react to it.    This is the kind of film a wine loving, Shakespeare reading, cultural commando - dyed-in-the-wool film buff just loves to dive into. And this is what sets this film so far apart from the usual crap that comes from Warner Bros. and Universal...By the way, I'd watch this movie again just to listen to the soundtrack. It is a wonderful compliment to the film.   Whoever put it together deserves great praise as well.For those of you tired of the same old Hollywood refuse, ""Rushmore"" is a breath of life, and easily one of the top ten films of '98.    ( And the Criterion people must think so too,  because there is a Criterion DVD edition of ""Rushmore"" coming soon...I'm going straight to Amazon.com to reserve my copy... )",Rushmore
166,youdontsmellbad,"worth your time, love or hate.",10,28 February 2003,"""Rushmore"" is a prime example of a movie about which you cannot answer the question ""what is it about?"" without boring someone to tears. This is because it's not what, but whom it's about that is important.
""Rushmore"" is about Max Fischer, an impossibly ambitious high school student attending ""one of the best schools in the country,"" according to his friend, steel tycoon herman blume. Max is involved in the greatest possible amount of extracurricular activities and athletics he can be in and still survive, let alone maintain decent grades. He does fall in love, but love is just yet another driving ambition for Max. Ultimately he comes to terms with his own limitations without succumbing to mediocrity. Max is my hero in the truest sense of the word. You may not laugh at Rushmore, even though you'll find it in the comedy section. You especially won't laugh if you watch it alone. although you'll probably acknowledge that it's a comedy you may not be able to pick out one individual joke. I can't explain why I still love it so much, so this is meant as a warning: if you expect madcap laugh-out-loud funny, you may be sorely disappointed. I myself do laugh at Rushmore because I share that kind of sense of humor with the writers. It's not for everyone though. I judge people's personalities on whether or not they enjoy ""Rushmore."" If they don't, no big deal, but it's a girl I wouldn't marry her.
I intentionally didn't start by saying that ""Rushmore"" is my favorite film, because it often discredits a reviewer immediately. If you find that you enjoy it you may also find, as i did, that it is entertaining after numerous viewings, or in my case, viewing ad nauseum. I watch it at least once a week, and have for, i'd say, six months. although i've been watching it fairly regularly for three years this makes me crazy. i know.A friend of mine watched the film for the first time not long ago. She told me that when she looked at Max, she saw me. I wouldn't intentionally pattern my life after a movie, but apparently it can happen. See ""Rushmore"" whomever you are. If you hate it, you'll enjoy hating it. I know, because I've sat many people through it, and the discussions afterwards were at least worth their time. More likely though, if you bothered to read this entire review which was more about myself than the movie, you'll love it. ""You'll love it,"" is not how I want to end this review so I'll lie in the next paragraph in case someone only reads the last line.""Rushmore"" features extended scenes of full frontal female nudity. There is a talking apple pie, and the word ""schwing"" is said more times than in any other movie.",Rushmore
167,eroka,"Huge disappointment. 5 in my book, not 7.6!",5,15 June 2001,"Da, da, da While I am an avid film buff and love original films  and don't get me wrong, Rushmore's originality did not elude me  this films just disappointed me. It took out the DVD version (plain old setup of feature plus trailer, nothing else, and you guys at the production company  adding `Film Recommendations' which is nothing but marketing more films of the same company is not a f*****g bonus. Get a life!) and I was SO disappointed. I won't repeat the plot. If you've got this far in reading comments  you probably know more than I did when I rented it. The film is good or excellent in these accounts: mise en scene direction, photography, some of the acting, and editing. The rest  plot, soundtrack (urgh!) and some acting  was very average to bad. The script was the oddest of them all. And here is where Rushmore can claim to be original. But the problem is that it gets zero on credibility, even within its own quirky world of Rushmore. These kids do not exist in real life, and the worst thing is that the characters' motivation is just non-existent. It doesn't make sense why the teacher keeps permitting Max to come and talk to her. No millionaire lives in a small town like that town Rushmore's takes place in. No millionaire has really that kind of spare time, and no one really acts like he does with his own kids. As a matter of fact, every aspect of the plot and characters is trying to be original while staying within the lines of the general basic notion of the stereotype (jock, nerd, rich guy, minority student) or institution (prep school, public school, head principal, school clubs and activities, etc.). While it looks recognizable, the behavior of everyone in this universe of Rushmore is just not normal. And to expect to run a plot that doesn't really revolve around comedy and not bore  is very hard, and the film just fails at this. Half way through the film I kept asking myself  where is this going to?! The film ending's yields very little answer to this question. There are other original American films (I recommend every one of them) that have similarities to Rushmore  American Beauty, Mumford, Elections. All depict Americana in its quirkiest form, with odd characters and adolescents shown as real people, if indeed at times in extreme representation. But none bore me like Rushmore. As a matter of fact, watching Elections and the Virgin Suicide (yet another disappointment, just not as bad as Rushmore) last week enforced the feeling that this movie could have gone elsewhere.",Rushmore
168,zafar142007,A comedy which strikes a chord,7,4 August 2016,"This is one of the better coming-of-age comedies I have seen. Max is a troubled but gifted teenager, who is trying to make his way through school. He is a natural leader, and easily makes friends with adults twice his age. The adults around him recognize his situation, and give him a lot of leeway to adjust. Trouble begins to brew when he develops strong feelings for a teacher, and his friend Herman (Bill Murray) gets involved in it too. The performances of the three main characters are superb. The characters appear real and engaging. The story remains simple, but interesting. Max is a smart kid, and he uses his talents to get what he wants. Bill Murray's acting is laudable, because not once did it feel unreal to have a forty-something man acting as a messenger for a fifteen year old boy. Herman understands him, and he allows Max time to hate and love him. It is a comedy, yes, but it is the complete package.You tend to empathize with the lonely yet gifted childhood, laugh at the deadpan humour of Bill Murray, and hope for a happy ending.",Rushmore

(that could be good or bad mind you) and this was not subtle or clever. Its got a monster score on the rating so I watched this after being keen to see it for 2 years. It was a huge disapointment. People reviewed it here saying its funny, subtle, clever, well acted and inteligent when it certainly is none of those things. Its a huge misunderstanding. I don't know how it came about. It doesn't say anything. Its just a meandering loony plot about a teacher who regects a kid who has a crush on her and then regects his friend the steel mogul. plain and simple. The end does little to resolve the plot either. What was max going to do next? There were some nice scenes which did make me smile but overall this film really does not say anything and does not have any hidden meaning which I could have missed I watched it twice to make sure. Its rubbish, Hollywood tripe. I dig Bill Murray always and he's good in this although its hard to justify the fact that he's brilliantly playing a bored millionare who's bored with life against the likelihood that he's really confused and bored by the plot. I hope soon I can meet a person who liked this movie and punch them in the face just like Max got punched in the face.",Rushmore
171,Idolprincess,A very pleasant movie,8,19 June 2004,"When I rented this movie, I was already a fan of Wes Anderson and his film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" which played in movie theaters not too long ago. [ 2 or 3 years, maybe... ] I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I imagined it would be great because it was made by the same person who did ""The royal.."". I was right. This is not a bright and colorful movie. It's extremely subtle, and the characters have many sides to their personalities. I think this great subtlety is what makes the charm of this movie, but this aspect might repulse many viewers who expect something different. Is this a drama or a comedy? I certainly did smile and laugh several times, but like I said, it was very subtle. It's a movie that's completely filled with emotions, but these feelings aren't overpowering like in some other movies.
*** Small spoilers ahead ***Another great thing is the unexpected events in this movie. There was clearly no ""moral"". This movie tells the tale of a teenage boy who falls in love with a beautiful teacher and at the same time becomes the friend of the school principal who also loves this teacher. We already think we can predict what is going to happen. It's the same thing with everything the boy achieves. He is very obsessive about everything, and that leads us to think he's going to learn a lesson and change the way he thinks and acts, but that's not what happens at all! I was very pleased by this aspect.The characters is what really makes this movie one of my favorites. Usually, teenagers in movies are based on stereotypes. Max wasn't this way. When the movie started, I expected him to be a geekish student who was good at everything, but that's not what he was at all. He's a genius and participates in all the student activities at his school, yet he doesn't have time to invest in anything else. He's obsessive and doesn't have one bit of common sense, yet he is respected by his classmates because of what he does at the school. Blume is played by Bill Murray who is one of my favorite actors. He's bored with life and old, yet very immature. There's a strange contrast between this character and Max. Max is the smart guy who has all the ideas and no power because of his young age and social status, and Blume is older and rich but definitely not as smart as Max. Even though they aren't portraits of the typical American teenager and older man, they are genuine characters.The fact that friendships between adults and teenagers are possible in this movie is something I liked a lot. It's very unusual. Most of the relationships in this movie are.This isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. Most people these days want realism, but at the same time they want everything to be glamorized. This movie is the complete opposite of that. While not trying to be realistic, it has a very ""real"" side to it. We believe in the story, it's not far-fetched, yet it has a touch of fantasy.",Rushmore

One might expect Bill Murray to provide the comedy, but it is Jason Schwartzman who steals the show. His portrayal of Max Fischer, an intelligent, able, yet misguided teenager, is nothing short of brilliance. His warped views on how to relate to people make him the perfect match for Bill Murray's character, a wealthy and lonely businessman.  Their friendship turned rivalry reveals just how fragile both characters are, and shows how dependent even those who seem to have everything under control can be for other's attention and affection.Wes Anderson has done a fine job with this film; a film that is endearing and memorable, especially with its use of a catchy soundtrack.

177,CSM126-1,"A Masterpiece. In Other Words, a Typical Effort for Wes Anderson.",10,22 July 2005,"""Rushmore"" was the first entry in Wes Anderson's ""Searching for a Father Figure"" Trilogy (followed by ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""), and what a wonderful way to start. ""Rushmore"" tells the story of Max Fischer, Rushmore Academy's most extracurricular student, and it's least scholarly. Having devoted his time to joining clubs, starting clubs, and writing plays, Max has no time to study. When he befriends a lonely tycoon and meanwhile begins seducing a widowed teacher, Max's life gets only more complicated.""Rushmore"", like Anderson's other films, exists in a world where whimsy is the norm and everything and everyone is more complicated than you might expect. Anderson's trademark style of filling every inch of the frame with details is exhibited here and, as always, it makes repeat viewings required to be able to catch everything. Also prevalent is Anderson's deliciously quirky dialogue and character development. If you love Anderson's other films, there's no way you'll be disappointed by this one.What makes ""Rushmore"" stand out from the rest of the ""Father Figure"" trilogy is the fact that the main character actually has his dad around. The Tenenbaum kids didn't see their dad for two decades after their parents split and Steve Zissou lost his father figure to the dreaded, possibly non-existent, Jaguar Shark. Max's dad is present and loving and devoted. It's the fact that Max doesn't want to be like his dad, a simple barber, that leads Max to search for a new father figure. This is what gives the film it's sad and poignant core, another trademark of Anderson's works.The casting is perfect from the lead roles down to the smallest of bit parts. Anderson sees importance in each and every character that appears in his films, and he always finds just the right person to fulfill the requirements to bring each character to life correctly. Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray (an Anderson regular), and Olivia Willams are spectacular and dazzling as Max, Mr. Blume, and Miss Cross respectively. Their nuanced and complicated performances bring all of their scenes to brilliant life. Seymour Cassel is also wonderful as Max's dad Bert, giving the film added emotional weight.So yes, ""Rushmore"" is wonderful. It's not Anderson's greatest (that would be ""The Life Aquatic""), but it's excellent nevertheless. Alternately sad and funny, poignant, whimsical, and ultimately beautiful, ""Rushmore"" is a must-see instant classic from the most promising talent in modern cinema.",Rushmore
178,rimsey-2,Phony and forced.,2,16 December 2006,"I'd seen the Royal Tenenbaums and thought i'd give Wes Anderson another try, especially as i'd read some good reviews about Rushmore. I think i'm over Wes Anderson now. I never need to see another of his movies again. His characters are so forced. They're trying oh so hard to be so quirky and funny but they're neither funny nor believable. I've always found that the movies i love the most are the ones where the characters seem so real that you feel you know them so well that you've met them and you're interested in what they're doing or thinking. There's none of that here. I didn't care in the slightest what happened to the hapless hero Max and his quest for the elusive Miss Cross. I just sat there cringing as i waited for the next ""quirky"" moment to come up. Nothing at all in the movie rings true and nothing works as comedy.",Rushmore
179,Doug-135,A dark comedy that succeeds.,9,9 March 2001,"A great dark comedy featuring solid performances from both it's new star Jason Schwartzman (as Max Fisher) and veteran Bill Murray (as Herman Blume.) Max Fisher is a visionary trapped in the body of a 10th grader. His inability to attend to matters at hand get him expelled from his private prep school. He also enters into a battle for the affection of his teacher with his now mentor Herman Blume. Eventually Max matures, a little, and is able to deals with the harsh realities of the world",Rushmore

Max Fischer, a 10th grader with very poor grades, is captain or president of every club at Rushmore Academy who falls for a widowed first-grade teacher. His friend, Blume, also falls for her, and the two begin an all-out war to win Miss Cross. Jason Schwartzman is excellent in his debut and Bill Murray (has he ever had a bad role?) is at his best.",Rushmore
181,ryansassy1,A charming film which bears up on repeat viewings,7,31 July 2012,"Rushmore is that odd little comedy which you find yourself struggling to explain to your friends -- ""It's about this teenage kid who gets expelled from his private academy and plots hilarious revenge on his adult friend that dated his hot teacher crush by funneling bees into his hotel room and cutting his brakes. It's great!"" No way to describe the plot that doesn't sound either boring, lame, or disturbing; perhaps a mixture of all three. So perhaps we should abandon all attempts to explain Rushmore by plot, and instead focus on the character of Max Fischer, the heart and soul of this newly-birthed Andersonverse.Max is the proverbial C-student who is destined one day to rule the world. That's because he's intelligent, charming, and leadership material in a way that rarely translates into good grades; that rare visionary who's also a do-er. Max spends so much time writing school plays, learning about offbeat extracurricular interests such as kite flying and beekeeping, and fieldmarshalling grand schemes to build an aquarium on the baseball field, that he rarely considers the basics of readin' writin' and 'rythmatic to be a worthy use of his time. Everybody at Rushmore adores Max -- except of course for the grade-fixated Dean, who tells (Bill Murray's character) Herman Blume that Max is ""the worst student"" in the entire school.Max's only real obstacle to his manic passions is his own youth. He is foiled in life and in the pursuit of love by the fact that despite all of his many gifts and devotees, he is still a kid muddling through the pitfalls of adolescence and immaturity. He wants desperately to be noticed by the lovely young teacher Miss Cross, but is foiled time and again by shyness, fear of rejection, and bad judgment calls. Despite all of this, Max still manages to rally ingenious solutions to the problems he has created for himself and others.A strong case could be made that Max Fischer is Wes Anderson's alter ego. Basically, you will love this film if the character of Max resonates with you -- and if not, you probably won't like many Wes Anderson films as a rule. All of Rushmore's plotting, acting, directing, and pacing is infused with Anderson's whimsical and nontraditional style--very similar to Max's style. I have often wondered if Rushmore wasn't written with some strong autobiographical leanings in mind.Overall, I found Rushmore to be a sort of timeless, understated comedy which I enjoyed several years later as much as upon the first viewing. Rushmore has a lot of heart. Don't expect gross-out humor or crassness, because this is the gentle Andersonverse after all. If that brand of comedy appeals to you, then you're in. Welcome!",Rushmore
182,hipcheck,You heard it hear first...,9,12 March 1999,"In the fine tradition of films like Johnny Suede, this movie made me smile a crooked little smile from the opening shot to the final curtain.Let's hope this stays posted on IMDB for a while, because I want to look back at in in a few years, and remember saying that this is the type of film that I would like to make.  Not necessarily the genre or tone or anything so nearly tangible, but rather the entire feeling one takes away from it, and how the aftertaste lingers in me, inspiring me to bring my own work up a notch.Famous last words, or a brave new beginning, we'll have to see!",Rushmore
183,bill_golden,Why should we care about these tedious characters?,2,21 July 2005,"This was my first Wes Anderson film and will possibly be my last. To echo the comments of the previous post, I found the Max Fisher character to be highly unlikeable. This guy really is an arrogant jerk. Regarding Bill Murray, I kept looking for something, anything in his character to make me believe he was an ""entrepreneur"", and I found nothing. He looked by turns uncomfortable, annoyed, or bored, but never inspiring. In other words, his character didn't ring true. Not to mention also unamusing. I liked Olivia Williams as Miss Cross....she at least seemed believable. But then again, why does she continue to have anything at all to do with a self-centered egomaniac like Max? Wouldn't a restraining order be appropriate? The story had a credibility problem with me, although possibly with other actors and some fine tuning this could have been a more entertaining foray into high school angst. I did like the soundtrack....some interesting tunes you won't hear anywhere else.",Rushmore
184,jasonsurety,"Un.....even, but pretty funny, too.",7,26 July 2004,"Rushmore is a movie about Max Fischer(Jason Schwartzman): a young man who is enrolled in the prestigious prep-school bearing the movie's title.  He is far more ambitious than most.  His problem is that he spreads himself too thin.  He is the founder or president of half a dozen clubs and involved in many others as well.  He is in so many clubs and organizations, in fact, that his grades are horrible.  He's obviously smart enough to get better grades.  When the school's headmaster tells him he's about to be expelled if he fails one more test, Max thinks of ways to get around it, without ever even considering buckling down and studying. 
The story gets interesting when he becomes friends with a rich Rushmore alumnus named Herman(Bill Murray).  Shortly after, Max falls for a teacher at Rushmore, Ms. Cross(Olivia Williams).  From here, Max and Herman's friendship is thoroughly tested when Herman realizes he is also in love with the timorous Rosemary Cross, despite being a married man with two children. The movie certainly has its funny moments.  I especially liked Murray's speech in an early scene.  He urges the students that aren't already rich to ""take dead aim on the rich ones.""  I also enjoyed hearing all of Max's embellishments.  He tells people his father, a barber, is a brain surgeon.When the movie gets too serious is when it looses its way a bit.   Max becomes sinister in his actions against Herman during their dispute over Ms. Cross.  A scene involving Max and Ms. Cross also is quite staid and seems like it belongs in a different film. 
Finally, director Wes Anderson gives us a trite ending that detracts from the overall tone of the movie.  I guess I did want everything to work out for Max, but things get hunkydory to the point of silliness.  Anderson's film is mostly offbeat and should have stayed that way for the duration.",Rushmore

Phenominal characterisation as the kid who, might be in every club and admitedly is quite talented, but happens to be ""one of the worst students"" that the prestigious Rushmore Academy has.  The dialogue that springs from this young man's mouth is hilarious, talking like someone of Murray's characters age, yet filled with an endearing niavety.  The fantastical nature of this film and its superb direction and acting make it one of the more memorable teen pieces of the nineties and probably second only to Kids fro originality.",Rushmore
186,Matchstick,Most underrated movie of the late 90's,10,12 October 2006,"This is a love it or hate it kind of movie. I've watched this movie with people with a like-minded sense of humor and they always have a polarized reaction to it. Love it or hate it. Personally, it's in my top 10 movies. Max Fischer is the quintessential oddball kid. A phenom of extracurricular activities but still gets bad grades. He lacks social skills yet is bold enough to say what's on his mind. The genius of this film is how Anderson writes dialogue for his characters as adults but has kids saying the lines. Dirk steals the scenes as he confronts Bill Murray and spits on his car, plays a gun touting nun in Max's version of ""Serpico"" and is the cigarette smoking point man in the final play. Anderson has a great talent for having his characters be odd, yet still plausible. He can really balance that mix, yet still tell a story from his skewed reality. I hope I'm making sense because I just had six shots of whiskey and two Benydril and am nodding off. LOL. Anyway, this movie is about the pain of growing up, the pain of loneliness, the happiness of friendship, the ugliness that we are all capable of and ultimately for Max, redemption.The scene where Max grabs a hold of the yellow kite and starts to get it all back together is great. Back dropped by Cat Steven's ""The Wind"", it's a wonderful meeting of film and music. Anderson has a knack for that. Great soundtrack all around. The closing scene is equally terrific. If you hate this movie, trust me, I understand...I hated it too. It wasn't until I saw it a second time that I saw it in a different light. It's a pretty special movie about growing up and forgiveness. If you happen to rent this, try to get the Criterion Edition; a lot of great extras in there. One last thought, Bill Murray gives a great, great performance as well as Olivia Williams, who, IMO, should had gotten an Oscar nod as well. OK, sleepy time...zzzz",Rushmore
187,Tommy N,Woody Allen @15,8,21 February 1999,"I feel this movie may be getting a little to much praise here.  It was somewhat enjoyable, but for the most part I seem to see a lot of praise from a performance by Bill Murray that was less then special.Seeing Murray from the beginniing of his career, to actually seeing this movie tonight and then as I write this very minute seeing his less then special performance on Satuday Night Live..... How far can a career sink?With Murray, I think he has more of a career left, but it wasn't displayed in Rushmore.  I just don't see praise coming from this performance like he should have received as Larry Darrow in ""the Razor's Edge"" a movie with a great story and great characters.Rushmore's characters were interesting, there psyche's all screwed up from the travels of life, but seeing a young boy at 15 in this scenario is just a little too unbelievable.  As was the funding for some of these school plays that seemed to be the more enjoyable part of the movie.  A public school play with helicopters and dynamite? What was next, DeNiro and Pacino making small cameos in these creative high school productions? Maybe even a little special effects from Digital Domain?Max's chacter had to be some what influenced by Woody Allen, but not to detract from the performances, all held their own amicablly.It would be hard to watch this movie again, But it would be much better seeing some of Murray's other brilliant and hilarious performances that seem to be almost ad lib.

What sounds like a tired premise on paper (smart loner causes havoc at elite prep-school) plays as one of the smartest, most original movies I've seen in years. There are sequences in this film that are perfect - absolutely flawless - and always very very funny (Max emerging from that elevator in slow-motion, that shot will stay with me forever). The young actor who plays the lead is mesmerizing. All of the supporting cast is solid, including Olivia Williams who really shines here (unlike what she was asked to do in Costner's The Postman), but the most amazing and wonderful performer in the movie is Bill Murray.  It is the most subtle characterization he has ever done on screen and it is absolutely flawless. Every pause, every facial expression, every line he delivers is golden.  I have always been a huge Murray fan, but this is easily his most inspired and original performance. Rushmore is hauntingly funny: it will stay with you for a long time.",Rushmore

190,ZachDVD,"Pure genius, only way to describe Rushmore.",10,4 September 1999,"I got a new imdb account so I am posting my review from last December again: Pure Genius, the only words to describe Rushmore. Rushmore is one of the best films of 1998 and is one of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the funniest. Rushmore re-teams the team who brought us the cult hit ""Bottle Rocket"" Rushmore focuses on Max Fischer, a student at the elite Rushmore private school. Max is the founder, president of literally all the after school clubs and extra curricular activities. He's president of the Backgammon club, edits the school yearbook and newspaper, and even has his own team of actors ""The Max Fischer Players"". But what this highly involved student doesn't have is good grades. He soon befriends a local millionnaire, who is played by Bill Murrary, in which he does a brilliant job portraying Mr. Blume. He deserves an Oscar nod. He also befriends and begins a crush on to the first grade teacher at Rushmore, Miss Cross. And so begins of the most funniest and entertaining movie love triangles. Rushmore is very well done, it's funny, it has a deep good script, you don't know which way it's going to turn. This is a great follow up to ""Bottle Rocket"". I simply love this movie and was very fortunate to see in its one week release. Don't worry the rest of you, Rushmore opens nationwide in February. I can't wait to see it again. A masterpiece.",Rushmore

And no one calls him on this??? Sorry, but it's taken me days to get to the end of this film and I feel like I've been watching it for weeks in five minute increments. Unforgivable long tedious minutes.",Rushmore
193,chicothekid,The trailer is actually better than the movie itself!,1,24 January 2001,"I never thought I'd see the day where a movie trailer could actually be better than the movie itself, but here it is!  Rushmore is only an hour and a half long, but it feels more like three and a half hours.  I'll be the first to admit that there were a few mildly entertaining things to be found in this movie, but they were all in the trailer.  If I wanted to sit for hours and hours and get only a little tidbit every now and then, I'd go fishing with no bait.  This is one heck of a long ride, and for what you get out of it, it's just not worth it.Rushmore is the story of Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a student at Rushmore Academy.  He is involved in several activities around campus, but his grades are suffering, and so are his relationships with others.  He is on the verge of being expelled from Rushmore when Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) enter his life.  Herman is the father of two students at Rushmore and he really enjoys watching Max at work.  When Max and Herman both meet Rosemary, they both like what they see, and the race is on to win her affection.I'm at a loss for words on the acting and directing in this case.  Jason Schwartman was really quite good in this role, and we'll definitely be seeing more of him in the future.  Bill Murray was pretty good in this role as well, and Olivia Williams wasn't bad either.  The directing is pretty clear cut; there is nothing flashy or overdone.  The problem is that while the main idea behind the movie isn't a terrible one, the writing is just awful.  There are a few funny things here and there, but for the most part, this is about as boring as anything I've seen all year.  This could easily put a few people to sleep, so don't watch it when even remotely tired.  In fact, if you really want to see this, just download the trailer.  The funny parts are actually more enjoyable out of context, and you won't have to sift through the rest of the crap to get to them, the producers have already done that for you with the trailer.  The only time I would recommend watching this is if it were free.  If it's on cable or at a friend's house or something, maybe this isn't such a bad risk.  You might like it better than I did, but I pretty much hated it and think most other people will as well.",Rushmore

Rushmore is probably not as good as the other two, but it makes obvious Wes Anderson's talent, which he has been improving from film to film.The humor is very sarcastic and nonsense,and again very characteristic of Anderson's work. It helps that the main roles are performed by two of the best actors, in my opinion, of this kind of comedy, Bill Murray, a constant presence in Anderson's movies, and Jason Shwartzmann, who is also brilliant in I Heart Huckabees.It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're already a fan of any of Wes Anderson's movies. But if you have seen any of his other movies and you didn't like it, don't even bother seeing this one.",Rushmore
195,MightyAlz,"I suppose this is one of those ""quirky"" films...",8,6 September 2007,"Wes Anderson is perhaps the quintessential ""quirky"" director. As in, his comedies may not be particularly funny, but they always have some off-kilter edge to them which keeps you watching.Rushmore is a perfect example. The plot of the film makes it sound exactly like the kind of romantic comedy crap which I'd never get the slightest urge to watch, but it's also misleading. This is a romantic comedy filtered through a creative mind.One of the most interesting features of the film is that Jason Schwartzman's character is totally unlikeable. Traditionally, the role of most obnoxious character tends to go to the popular kids, Football captains etc. But in this case, the character is a geek, obsessed with chess and play - usually the sympathetic characters. In this case, he comes across as unpleasant; I assume this was intentional. Schwartzman's performance is very convincing and he is perfectly suited to the character he plays.Also great is Bll Murray, who plays a wealthy businessman friend of Schwartzman's character. You could argue that since he turned 40, Murray's been playing exactly the same style in ever film he's been in, but let's face it, it's a great style. Always, slightly depressed, never reacting to anything with any shock or surprised and brilliantly deadpan. As such, he is perfectly suited to Anderson's films.As such, there is always a serious edge to his films. In this case, I'm not sure what his point is. Maybe he just wanted to write a teen movie and went horribly off the point. Oh well, it's probably better that way. You can't help but be gripped by the film and you sympathise with the characters, no matter how horrible they may be.Overall, the main flaw is a lack of laughs. There are plenty of missed opportunities for humour throughout the film. I mean, it's not quite one of those arty films where you spend the entire time wondering when the ""comedy"" tag is going to come into effect, but it's not a laugh-a-minute fest either.Still, worth watching. I personally preferred it to the Life Aquatic, not that it was a bad movie either.Freak out!",Rushmore

If you don't ""get it"" after the first 30 minutes, don't waste another hour trying to figure it out.You might think the story is going to develop further. It does not. It's not plot-heavy, and the characters are forced to carry the film. But the main character isn't likeable at all! The humor is so subtle that it's almost non-existent. While the filmmaking may be technically sound, the cinematics aren't any more remarkable than your average movie-of-the-week.

""Rushmore"" is one of those movies that gets better upon each viewing. Wes Anderson had created a very unusual feature out of mix of genres and comes up with something that resembles ""The Graduate"" meets ""Harold and Maude"" with a little bit of the 'French New- Wave' added in for good measure. His choice in music is impeccable. Never have bands like The Faces, The Rolling Stones, Cat Stevens, and The Kinks been used more effectivly in a movie. The critical buzz on this movie may have turned some people off, and that is a shame, because after all is said and done ""Rushmore"" holds up better than many of the other 'critical choices' from the 90's ( i.e. American Beauty, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ). It's basically a charming, quirky, little movie without an agenda. Bill Murrey is perfect in understated role as Max Fisher's teacher- turned- nemesis turned friend, and Jason Shwatzman could be the next Dustin Hoffman. Seeing ""Rushmore"" reminds me that cinema is still a fresh art-form and luckily for us the Criterion edition of ""Rushmore"" is one of the best Dvd's ever put out, there is so much to see on this disc and the movie looks and sound great.

This movie delves into how we look at the characters and ultimately how we see ourselves and those around us. I could see a little of myself in every character.

It's a funny and serious story at the same time, which is about ambition, because throughout the film we see the protagonist wants more than he has and he desperately struggles to get to such a degree that he focuses more on his whims rather than on his obligations. Rushmore means a lot to him and he even translates it to other things, what he wants most in life, his desires, he makes small ""Rushmores"" and when someone tries to bother taking them off he does everything for revenge, as for him ""in war and love anything goes"". It is narrated in a linear fashion, structured as a comedy, but it becomes a smart comedy, even though it does not lose the seriousness laugh of what it is counting, plus it does not make the characters look as fools, but give laughter as they go through situations and how they react to them, which is always naturally. It's a film that shows the clash between the world of adults and young people, because throughout the film we see the protagonist believed he is mature enough to engage with people much older than him, no matter the age difference . It features Anderson's signature style, full of bright colors and very thoughtful plans.

208,Xanadu,B O R I N G,1,23 July 1999,"I don't understand what was so great about this movie.  What laughs, what wit?  What the heck is so funny about a grownup driving over a kid's bike? The only part that ALMOST made me almost laugh (that's almost made me almost laugh) was the beginning when we found out he was one of the worst students. Other than that, I found no humor at all.  I love funny movies, but this movie made no sense.  Ok, so some kid has a crush on his teacher.  So he does all this big stuff to get her attention.  So what?  What's so funny about that?  I don't understand why people call this witty.  A 10 year old can write this script.  I had to force myself to smile only because of the fact that this movie was supposed to be so funny.  Well, it was a waste of $3.50 to rent this movie.  I'm glad I didn't pay $6 to see it in the theater.",Rushmore
209,QAGuy,"I didn't have to pay, and I still want my money back",2,23 February 2002,"This is a plodding movie about a guy who really doesn't deserve our sympathy.  I gave up after 20 minutes.  It's one thing to have a crush on your first grade teacher when you're actually in the first grade, but in this case Max just seems like a whacko stalker.The film makers try to make us believe that Max is some sort of gifted genius by running us through a massive but brief montage of his activities, but when we actually see the guy in action, it's impossible to believe he has the brains for any one of those activities.  He supposed be directing plays and editing the newspaper, but his social skills are so lacking, he'd never be able to carry it off.In Harold and Maude and The Graduate we get the May-December element combined with the social satire in much more effective way.  Of course Ben and Harold are, unlike Max, rich kids so the outsider element is missing. Unlike Max though Ben and Harold know how ridiculous their parents' world is.  They're insiders who have become outsiders.  Even the more recent Loser (which while enjoyable isn't in a class with The Graduate and H&M), gives us an outsider who for all his geekiness comes to understand what's going on around him, and throughout the film we see his sincerity.  Rushmore just doesn't deliver the goods.Rushmore tries to hard to be clever, but never really takes a knife to its target.  It tries to be sweet, but it does so without any real heart.  Don't waste your time with this one.",Rushmore

I ABSOLUTELY laughed myself into tears in various parts of the movie.  But this is really a very serious film.  It speaks to all teenagers in their fight for inclusion, self-purpose, and security.  It is a truly unique film I can not forget.  This is the type of movie you'll need to view twice.

212,metrik7,Why won't this stupid EJECT button work?!?!,2,25 January 2002,"In the fall of 1997, my friend Bob Salari and I rented a movie called ""Bottle Rocket"", directed by ""Rushmore"" director Wes Anderson.  We had rented it because the ""If you liked _________, you'll like ""Bottle Rocket"" on the Blockbuster box, and ""Pulp Fiction"" was in the blank.  About forty or fifty minutes into the movie, still waiting for any action or laughs, we shut it off and ejected it.  It was the first movie I had ever rented and not watched.  ""Rushmore"", rented two years later on the strength of recommendations (and because I didn't know Anderson was responsible for ""Bottle Rocket""), is the second.  Many reviews I have read about this movie started with a comment to the effect of ""Wes Anderson does it again!"". Yes, he does.  He makes me reach for the VCR remote again.  Jason Schwartzmann was more grating than annoying (as were his classmates), and Bill Murray apparently got lost in the Comic Bermuda Triangle, from which no laughs can ever possibly escape. Several years down the line, when I feel like wasting money again, I'll rent ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and see if Anderson can go for the three-peat.  The only reason I am not giving this movie a 1 is the strength of its soundtrack.",Rushmore

Bill Murray is the best he's been in years, and the kid who plays the lead is heartbreakingly funny, like a child Charles Grodin.

214,TheGonzoJoint,"One of my favorite films; Max Fischer is a sensational new movie character. Endearing, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny; in that Wes Anderson sort of way.",10,1 March 2011,"**** out of ****""Rushmore"" is a clear enough explanation to why Wes Anderson is my current favorite filmmaker. While I wasn't as smart as some and I didn't start liking Wes Anderson with his most successful film, I came to appreciate it more as time went on. Now, ""Rushmore"" has come from being a film I loved to a film I will cherish. It is now one of my favorites. Maybe it's because this time around, I caught a lot of things. I found the story to be a bit more touching than it already was; and I discovered just how much I want to be like Max Fischer. The kid carries himself like a gentlemen yet he's a dud when it comes to academics. Maybe I am somewhat like him already; just not quite as fascinating (or likable). ""Rushmore"" is a truly rare piece of cinema because for the first time in a while, everything in it seems to come together to make this massive dramedy that ranks amongst the best I've seen. Maybe it IS the best I've seen. Or maybe it's too soon to tell. None the less, ""Rushmore"" will forevermore be known as one of my favorite films of all time. Maybe it's not the most historical; and maybe it's not the most well-known, but this cult favorite is a hell of a time. Not only is it funny and touching but it's also artistic as far as complex style goes. The cinematography is flawless, the soundtrack is awesome, and the characters are endearing and layered with the kind of ominous complexity that makes you want to uncover their secrets (or problems, if you prefer). I've also come to realize that all of Wes Anderson's films end with a realization. The character(s) learn to value something through the ordeals of the film, and I guess it's safe to say that their troubles will pay off. ""Rushmore"" is almost the kind of delightful feast that makes you want a sequel, but then again it's too great of a film for a second coming. I think any further continuation of Max Fischer's story would ruin the thing all-together. Besides, I like how the film ends. This is the best film of 1998 and one of the best films of the 1990's all-together. If I had a top five list of my favorite films, then ""Rushmore"" would fit the bill. That's how much I love the most well-known of all Wes Anderson's wondrous creations. With ""Rushmore"", I think he has improved a lot over the flaws of his previous ""Bottle Rocket"". While I enjoyed that little film, it's nowhere near as awesome as ""Rushmore"". And I don't care if it doesn't suit everyone's fancy; I just love this movie so darn much. I'd say it's worth it for everyone to give it a chance; whether they agree with the style or not.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/721884/reviews/?search=rushmore",Rushmore
215,another-dreamer,Wes Anderson's Masterpiece,10,18 March 2006,"AT first it's mere coming of age. It's rebellion tinged with melancholy for all those accomplishments, or involvements the intellectual so often avoids. Then it becomes a film about first love, about letting go of childhood and merging with horns blazing into the traffic of the adult world.With Wes Anderson's superb soundtrack, and thematic grace, we witness the progression of a brilliant, yet ever so ""dull"" student, find redemption in unrequited love and an existence beyond the structure that academia so readily provides.What is life other than the mutual grace of friendship, betrayal and ultimate self-discovery? We kill the child to become the man, to quote a man much wiser than myself. We find ourselves through the massive attack against our cloistered egos at high school. How many popular kids have become the clichéd remnants of suburban lawn-care? How many ""losers"" have found the medium of their success through multiple failures? What I love about this film is that it portrays love at it's most vulnerable, at it's most pernicious. The friend betraying the friend. The reconciliation, and the realization that love is transitory and a construct of the male psyche - the dominance they crave, the possession they find necessary - only to be obviated by the strict reality of real love premised on non-competition and compassion.One of the best films of the twentieth century.",Rushmore

I never found it even remotely witty or humorous; in short it was a dreary egotistical piece of drivel which was all about some twit's nostalgic wet dream and trying to justify the lifestyle of some git who's very existence could convince the Pope that abortion really is a good idea after all.Pretentious and downright horrible, I did something that I haven't done in years during a film;  I dozed off half way through.  I guess that little part of the brain which tries to protect you from horrible events (car crashes, being held at gunpoint etc.) by making you pass out was trying to protect me from an experience almost as painful.It's worth neither the time, the money nor the unnecessary wear on the retina of your eye;  indeed I will try to remember this film when next I'm having any trouble sleeping.  This is the first film I've ever seen that made me think `maybe I'd rather be seeing Godzilla'.The loudest cheer I think I've ever heard from a cinema audience was the one heard when the film finally ended, I've never heard so much joy from an audience;  that they sat through it is a testament to either their exceptional tolerance or their desire to find a dark, comfortable chair to catch some sleep prior to the commencement of the next feature.In short I resented most of all that I just gave away an hour and a half of my life which I will never get back  to anyone considering seeing this film you are suitably warned...",Rushmore

The movie is hilarious without any slapstick comedy or toilet humor.  The acting is top-notch, and plot absolutely wonderful in a surprisingly whimsical and touching way.  You are sure to walk away with a smile on your face.Writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson should be better known.  Wilson is a familiar face in cinema, often playing a memorable skirt-chasing eccentric who gets killed off half way through the movie.  Luke and Andrew, the other members of the Wilson clan get some screen time in ""Rushmore,"" and are sure to be recognized, as well.  The Baldwins?  The Wayans?  Nah, it's the Wilsons for me.Stars Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams are perfectly cast.  Quirky yet strangely familiar, it's easy to relate to the characters and root for their happiness.  Keep an eye out for Schwartzman and Williams in upcoming films, they have bright futures ahead.  Murray is as great as ever, with a more subtle performance than we usually see, and gets a chance to show a much larger range of comedy.If you haven't seen ""Rushmore"", hurry to the video store and pick up a copy.",Rushmore

Invent many many of them. Now make them incredibly flat, paper thin, someone you could summarize in a line or two... Now have lots of stuff happen. Finally make everything look retro cool. Take great care to make the movie have ""look"" and ""feel"".The look and feel go a long way. I respect the care Anderson puts into his movies. But movies also tell a story. And with Anderson, something just doesn't work at this point. It's because either the story, or the characters need to not be paper-thin. Quantity of events, ""stuff happening"", number of quirky characters doesn't a story make. What or who are we supposed to care about? In Anderson's movies this is where the films just fail us. It is such a pity too, because we are so close to a good film.Rushmore had a good premise, some characters who, if developed would have been powerful. But halfway through I found myself not caring about what happened to anyone. Pity because it could have been a very nice movie about friendship. But instead it fizzled and faded and all was sort of this nice looking thing about a large number of quirky but still flat characters.Sorry but this is not good. Just hype.

Neither personality is better, just different.  I am of the former, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It kept my attention, which is more than I can say for the majority of the normal ""summer blockbuster"" genre films.The writer (keep scrolling down) who wrote that anyone could have played Bill Murray's part and that there was no character development must have been watching a different film.  Most everyone evolves in this film.  I can't think of a character that doesn't, except maybe Max's father.I hate to critique other writers or their comments, but the line wasn't, ""Are you a barber or a neurosurgeon?""  It was much better.  It was, ""So you're a neurosurgeon?""  The barber says, ""No, I'm a barber, but a lot of people make that mistake.""Go see it.

226,Buzz-17,"Every Parent's Dream, Every Parent's Nightmare",8,21 February 1999,"Max Fisher is a combination of every parent's dreams and nightmares. In fact, despite this characters obvious social gifts, we see his teen angst rage against convention. In one sense he comes off almost as we would imagine a Holden Caufield in Catcher In The Rye. Is that a ""people shooting cap""? Max is more complicated than an angry teen, and has more adult skills than many adults (particularly those portrayed in the film). He is proof that charm can carry a person through life almost exclusively, becoming a necessity as you rely more and more upon it. This brings us to Herman Blume, his life-battered mentor who has an obvious kinship with Max by way of his dislike of social convention. Early on in Rushmore, we learn there is no place in his heart for elitist philosophy: he tells the less fortunate among the prep school boys he is addressing to take aim at the rich boys, to bring them down. Ironically enough, both fall for the same woman, Rosemary Cross, a product of the most elite American institution, Harvard. Max even claims this to be his back up for college, behind Oxford and the Sorbonne. There are obvious parallels in this film to The Graduate. It is puntuated by music perfectly, and not with tired pop tunes (as are most movies these days with music incorporated). Max at times almost seems as though he were Benjamin, stalking Elaine at Berkeley. Jason Schwartzman excels as Max, as does Murray as Blume. Director Anderson does not avoid awkward moments, rather tackling them as subject in new ways. Some of this is done through great camera work, and some is accomplished by silence. Simply, he has made a daring, original film by letting us read the characters for ourselves.",Rushmore

Director Wes Anderson has more than fulfilled the potential that he displayed in his debut film ""Bottle Rocket."" Everything about ""Rushmore"" is totally first rate.  The script (co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, who played Dignan in ""Bottle Rocket"") is as sharp as they come and defies any sort of genre classification.  The performances are top-notch.  Jason Shwartzman gives the most memorable debut performances I've seen in a long long time and Billy Murry totally shines in a role that he was born to play. Rushmore stretches beyond being a simple high school movie and moves way past those sappy coming of age dramas where the only emotions seem to be laughter and tears.  People are going to be watching this one for some time to come.  If there is any justice in this world Bill Murray will be given an Oscar nod for this film.

Wes Anderson is one filmmaker who can. His characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain. Young Jason Swartzman gives a fantastic performance.  Even nicer is the surprise turn by Bill Murray, who manages to play a good guy and a villain at the same time. In one scene he  is wearing Budweiser boxer shorts on a diving board. He is smoking a cigarette and jumps, doing a cannonball into his sewer-ridden pool. We see him curled up at the bottom of his pool, drowning himself in misery. Is this a connection to his future lover's dead husband? Who knows. But what we do know is that Anderson has crafted his film to star the most unlikely of heroes. They are the oddest of the bunch, but at the same time we know what they are going through. Their oddness aside, what we learn to see more of, is their hearts. It is obvious Anderson has wiped his heart all over this piece, and it pays off more than I'm sure he ever could have imagined.",Rushmore
230,dyserian,It's really not a comedy or a romance flick.,8,27 August 1999,"Let me start off by mentioning that I'm Bill Murray's age. Ive followed his entire career from SNL on. I never sensed any real wit just a person with a good comic sense and a deft knowledge of how to work what sells as 'humorous' to American 20-something popular taste. I think he was the first to get the kick in the groin scene in a movie. So, I expected ""Rushmore"" to be a farce. A slapstick, wise cracking, prank filled college version of ""Caddy Shack"". Boy, was I ever mistaken. (Thank God) Instead what they gave us was a wise, lovingly frank look back at mawkish Male Teen Puppy Luv and forward to Middle Aged White Male resentment, depressed rage as self pity filled isolation. Superb.Every understated expression Bill Murray, as Herman Blume, made struck home. His semi-suppressed fed up disgust with his moronic, Disney fed, brain-heart empty, spoiled sons. His trophy wife who's just a trophy. A banal, rote life of commercial wheeling-dealing where only the final ""bottom line' counts.His middle aged Holden Cauflied (""The Graduate"") character rings absolutely true. He's made his fortune, he's played by all the social rules, he has the American Dream of fortune, kids, wife, property and wealth but, so what ? In his college days, while others sought an end to the war in Vietnam he sat in his dorm room reading his National Review and smugly gloated over his collection of Brooks Bros ties. But now everything he has, everything he's done, everything he's earned is just vapid dust. It's a day in, day out stick in his craw. More of a reminder of his utter failure as a person than tribute to his socially approved role as a wealth making tycoon. Deep inside, if he had any real courage, any real character he'd scrap it all just to have a soul filled laugh, a life of meaning. But he's caught in the game. He bought into the false promise that true fulfillment  can be earned, bought. He gave up on creativity so that he could conform. He made the devil's bargain and found that the devil changed him. The devil ate him alive. He's soulless AND still living.Bummer.Heaven and Hell. Then he meets Miss Cross !
On the other end, Max Fischer, is all invention, cunning, imagination and youth filled exuberance. Hes made the same trade but from the other end of the age scale. He's a manipulator, self absorbed and In Luv. He cant be trusted. Hes funny but sinister.Hes ambition and energy without direction, common sense or, any maturity.Then he meets Miss Cross! The woman he selects to fall in luv with. She, finds him a curse and a burden.Both characters, in the end, find a higher level of existence through their relationship to her. She's their muse, their savior, their transforming OTHER. Their relationship with her is what this movie is all about. It changes their lives. It shows them a better way to be human while still being just human. To attain her attention and affection they must bust loose from themselves. To find yourself you must get beyond your self.And boy, do thse guys ever ""bust a move"". LOLSure, this movie is slow. Sure, it takes awhile to grasp the subtleties. We arent spoon fed the story line. We're asked to reflect, to think back upon our stages in our lives, our ""Max Fischer"" period and our ""Herman Blume"" period.The sad part is that while some people grow out of being Max few fail to avoid becoming Herman in the process.

235,Mike Z-2,Refreshingly Original,10,8 November 2001,"Written for my high school weekly news supplement my junior year.Rarely in this age of blockbuster films does there come along a film that is so original, so widely appealing that it just fascinates you.  A film so well rounded and interesting that you sit in the theater after the film is done to think about what you've just witnessed.  One such film is Rushmore, starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams.	Rushmore is an extremely well written movie about obsessive love.  It tells the story of Max Fischer (Schwartzman), who is a sophomore at the elitist Rushmore Academy, and is so absorbed in his extracurricular activities that he is in danger of failing out.  One day Max hears a speech by Mr. Blume (Murray), a wealthy businessman who has sons attending Rushmore, and they almost immediately befriend each other.  This oddball relationship between the lonely tycoon and the over-optimistic teenager begins to grow, but then Max discovers a beautiful young widow named Miss Cross (Williams) teaching first grade.  Max becomes very attached to her, but of course she is not as attracted to him, and things get more complicated when Max introduces Mr. Blume to Miss Cross.  I'll leave it at that.	The acting is a quality of Rushmore that contributes greatly to its appeal. I've seen a lot of Bill Murray movies, an I've always had a high opinion of him.  Saying that Bill Murray is good in a movie usually means that he was really funny (which, with a few exceptions, goes without saying).  In this film, though, there is something more to his performance.  With his facial expressions alone capturing the tortured soul of Mr. Blume accompanied by his impeccable comic timing, Murray is plainly terrific.  Jason Schwartzman is also outstanding as Max, although his appearance shows more years than the mere 15 he is supposed to be.  Olivia Williams is subtle and extremely effective as the British object of affection.  Finally, in a key role as Max's chapel partner, Dirk Calloway, Mason Gamble (from Dennis the Menace), convey's his bitterness and anger with such acuity and humor that one can't imagine that there he is actually acting in front of a camera. 
The humor of Rushmore is so delightfully offbeat, hilarity sometimes being found in such places as silent pauses with the camera directed right at the actor's face, that it might not be for every taste (but be sure to give it a try first).   In fact, everything about this movie is different.  I've seen this film twice and from the surreal use of really vivid colors to the quick-paced direction by the obviously very talented Wes Anderson, it seems destined to have cult status in the future.  Finally, I would like to mention the soundtrack, a compilation of primarily British ""invasion"" rock (along with a brilliant original score), for it almost perfectly captures the spirit and life of this amazing achievement.",Rushmore

237,saultonofswing,"The best Music, Plot, Dialogue, The Works",10,7 August 2002,"I stumbled upon Rushmore back in 1999, having heard not much about it but having always been a huge Bill Murray fan, I rented it and was blown away. Firstly, this movie has the best music soundtrack ever, with older songs from Creation, The Rolling Stones, the Kinks, John Lennon, Donovan, The Faces and a great Mark Mothersbaugh score, sprinkled through a rich tapestry of great camera shots which perfectly fit every music selection.  All the casting from the very funny Bill Murray, to the versatile Jason Schwartzman, another one of the Coppola clan, and a whole cast of believable kid actors and captivating bit parts from the janitor, Max's Dad and the principal only add in driving home some of the funnier or more meaningful lines from the wonderful script.  Completely original, with a plot which goes far beyond the original two guys fighting over one girl plot line and truly captures what it's like to be a teenager.  Because of this movie, we can never forget Max Fisher, playwrite, actor, club former and leader.  From the makers of Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, yet more polished than Bottle Rocket and funnier than The Royal Tenenbaums, 10/10!!!!",Rushmore
238,ciocc1001,Forget reading Nietzsche! Watch Rushmore!,1,20 January 2003,"I cannot begin to convey the intellectual and spiritual riches of this exquisite, almost transcendental film. I've seen Rushmore about 50 times and I'm going to continue watching it til the end of my life. It is one of the ten best films I have ever seen. It entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing.Never before have I seen such everyday people brought to the screen in such a believable and moving way. Rushmore is filled with one perceptive scene after another. It is a metaphorical masterpiece.Every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. Wes Anderson  has done it again! It is his juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius. The characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain.I love it when I don't know what is going to happen, even within the context of a sort of romantic comedy. Rushmore is a terrific look at why people stay ""together"" in the sense of being a part of someone's life even when danger lurks around every corner.Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film. This movie is about freedom -- the freedom to be yourself, to be unselfconscious, to let your mind roam and behave any way you want. Nothing about Rushmore is conventional yet--and this is important--it never tries to shock you in a cheap Hollywood way with violence, sex, or some special effects crap.This film is so un cliche that you really have to praise the makers of this film. As soon as you sit down to watch it, it oozes class. The writing is witty and never, ever falls into kitschy cliche.I think there is a lot of symbolism about art and the creative process in this movie. Not once is there a single frame of film wasted. The gorgeous visuals set a perfect backdrop for some of the greatest movie dialogue of all time.Not.",Rushmore
239,randycandy,my favorite movie,10,27 August 2003,"My favorite movie.  To me it is perfect.  The actors are right on. Everyone of them.  The main three and Dirk are amazing.  The story is classic.  The way it deals with the comedy is perfect.  The comic delivery is perfect, ""stupid"" jokes to ""smart"" ones.  The sad parts of the story are told beautifully.  The happy parts aren't any where near cheap.  ""You"" really like all of the characters and understand them.  And feel their pain. Part of what's good about this movie is how pleasantly surprised you are by it's diversity and depth.  The cinematography is subtle but brilliant.  PLUS the music is awesome!",Rushmore
240,foxpoet,"Laugh-out-loud, broad appeal",9,30 December 2010,"Easily the funniest and most broadly appealing of Wes Anderson's movies. Enjoyment of some of his movies (cf. The Darjeeling Limited) requires the Wes Anderson mindset, an unusual, and sometimes acquired taste. This movie remains distinctively a Wes Anderson comedy, while simultaneously providing plenty of belly laughs and heartfelt moments for the uninitiated masses. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it either as Wes Anderson at the top of his form, or as a great introduction to his unique comic vision. Either way, it will reward you on multiple levels.

Everything works flawlessly: the writing, the wonderful photography, and the excellent performances. Jason Schwartzman gives a stunning debut performance, he is definitely  an actor to watch for in the future. And Bill Murray has his best role in ages, so great to see him at the top of his game again. Wes Anderson has improved upon his debut film and given us a great film that is already a modern classic with a strong following of ardent fans. It's movies like this that are timeless and will be talked of decades from now. If you haven't seen ""Rushmore"", see it. Or better yet buy the upcoming Criterion DVD.

The plot leaves something to be desired. Its about a school boy obsessed with an older woman. Wow this is ground breaking stuff! haha. The movie appears to lack a genre. It's not funny at all--- ""These are OR scrubbs, OR they!"" is a good example. So its not a comedy. It's not serious enough to be a drama. Its just a miserable piece of crap. If you are VERY VERY easily entertained then rent it. Otherwise sit back and prepare to be bored.

245,debbiedowner661,Watch it again,10,9 August 2001,"When I first saw this movie, it was for Bill Murray.  Here I was expecting something like Caddyshack or Groundhog Day, but was ultimately confused at the end.  See, from Bill Murray, I had come to expect some sort of comic fluff that would make me laugh till I pee.  You know, a typical Bill Murray movie.  Rushmore is very different from other ""Bill Murray movies"".  I wouldn't say I really laughed at Rushmore at all the first time I watched it.  I wouldn't even say that I really even liked it then.  ""Bill Murray wasn't even that funny,"" I remember thinking.  I watched it again about a year ago because a few of my friends were obsessed with it, so I decided to give it another go.  The second time I watched it, I realized just how clever it is.  Upon repeat viewings, the meaning of the movie becomes increasingly naked and real.  Most people would argue that no one on earth acts like Max Fischer....and yet we do in so many ways, and it's so difficult to even detect.  That's what lends the film this sort of surreal feeling, and gradually the little witticisms become more and more humorous. I think that once people get past the fact that this is an atypical Bill Murray film, they'll adjust to the tone and style of the movie and find it quite charming.  I eagerly look forward to Wes Anderson's next filmic venture.",Rushmore
246,SigmaEcho,"""Sic Transit Gloria Mundi"": So the glory of this world fades",10,16 October 2004,"Rushmore was the first Wes Anderson film I saw, and I didn't think much of it the first time. I used to think that Royal Tenenbaums was Anderson's first good film. I thought Bottle Rocket wore its rookie status on its sleeve; I thought Rushmore was flawed; and I thought Tenenbaums finally showed that Anderson had honed his craft and he would start making great films. I then re-watched Tenenbaums and found it to be even more satisfying on additional viewings. I realized that Anderson had actually crafted one of those rare pieces of cinema that reveals itself more and more upon repeat viewings. So I of course decided to give Rushmore a second look. Now that I've had a chance to see the DVD, I've had a much different experience viewing the film. Perhaps because I saw it on Pan and Scan VHS previously? Or perhaps because Anderson's vision requires an adjustment period?Some people will never like Anderson's films. They simply will not appeal to those out there who want clichéd Hollywood fodder. Some people will love Anderson's films from the moment they see them. Others, like myself, will need to see the films more than once to truly appreciate them. Anderson breaks convention in ways no one has done before - One has to understand that his films are deep where most films are shallow, and shallow where most films are deep. This will throw A LOT of people off, as evidenced by many of the comments on the message boards. Anderson's films begin where others end. In Rushmore, we see Max's fall from grace, not his climb up to become head of every club in his school. In Tenenbaums, we see the aftermath of the child prodigies, not their glory years. Again, this will throw a lot of people off, and indeed I heard this criticism of Tenenbaums quite a lot. Anderson constructs the world of his films around a cinema storybook. They are episodic, told in chapters. Some will find Anderson at first glance to be a rather egotistical filmmaker, as I once did. However, upon second glance, you can begin to see the rich text woven deeper in the films that might be hidden beneath quirkiness or drastic breaks from convention. The first time I saw Rushmore, I felt shock, embarrassment and confusion (Mostly at Max and Rosemary's bizarre interaction). I was lost and unfamiliar with this world Anderson has created. The second time I saw the film I felt Passion, Love, Tragedy and ultimate Redemption. I found the heart in Anderson's film.If you felt Rushmore was not all it could have been the first time you saw it, please give it another chance. You'll find which side you fall on.",Rushmore
247,lionmoonfilms,"If You Love Forest Gump, You Will Love Rushmore",9,7 October 2012,"If you love Forest Gump, then you will love Rushmore, because the story of Forest and the story of Max are really the same. Both are about ""fool triumphant"", but the style is different (the former is seriously humorous, the latter is a parody). Both are social drama, but the scope differs widely (the former covers several decades of the main character's life going from rural Alabama to Jungle in Vietnam and back; the latter dots only several months from one private school to another public one in the same town). As much different as they are, the two share the same theme: it's about the authentic love being struck, lost, and gained. Although Rushmore doesn't give you as much the depth as Forest Gump, but you get the same emotional experience from Max Fischer's love to Mrs. Cross and Forest Gump's to Jenny.It moved me to tears when in the final act Max has a closure in his yet-another play with a happy ending, as it did the same to me when Forest in the closing scene said his last goodbye to his love with a sad ending. Because authentic, innocent love, however silly or outlandish, has lived in everyone's heart at least once. And in case you've forgotten it, Rushmore throws it on your face, just as Forest Gump kindles your heart.",Rushmore
248,XjwalkX,"Best Movie Ever, Man",10,28 January 2000,"This is one of those movies that totally swept me away and left me feeling altered.  Wes Anderson creates an emotional landscape populated by vivid, deep characters.  The number of these who undergo significant changes in this film is remarkable, as is the number of stylistic flourishes that add to the unique world of Rushmore.  To give two examples I would point out the little kid who manages to appear in countless scenes throughout the movie, most significantly in the final scene and in Bill Murray's glorious Graduate-esque dive into the pool.  Also, did anybody else notice just how surreal the scene where Max pretends to get hit by a car is?  If you think about it critically it could only be some strange fantasy (I mean, he climbs onto the roof...), but it works perfectly within the logic of the film.  I don't feel the need to generalize much about this film, its merit should be obvious to those who have the special knowledge of one whose passions don't win her/him acceptance, comfort, or reward. These are just two of my favorite little things that make this film great.",Rushmore
249,Madde-2,Genius! Pure Genius!,10,2 January 2000,"Isn't it odd how all the truly good movies get pushed aside by either comedies which contain disgusting bodily fluids or action thrillers with talentless goons doing things that just aren't possible no matter how much muscle tissue you've injected yourself with?Take for instance Rushmore.  A movie that was only playing in one theater in my whole area (which coincidentally was also the one furthest away from my home) and even at that didn't stay   there very long.  But, Rushmore didn't even get the credit it deserved even in video rentals.
What is so amazing about this film is just how subtle it is.  Rushmore isn't a comedy that forces you to laugh so hard that you nearly puke your guts out on the floor - it's much too refined for that.  It gets under your skin and swims up into your brain where it lies forcing you to think about it for days, maybe even weeks after - the mark of good film making.Rushmore tells a story that is both incredible and ordinary and the way it melds the two together is what is so unique.  And so much of the story can be shaped and molded without words.  Silence, the incredible musical backdrop, and the visuals all come together to create one of the most fascinating stories in recent memory.",Rushmore

I'm a gonzo Bill Murray fan, I loved the fantasies of Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, and Kingpin. But Rushmore tries to be a black mayhem comedy and tries to be meaningful heartfelt, etc. and thus does neither.As to the raves for Bill Murray's performance. He was okay, but it wasn't any big acting challenge. I kept feeling angry during the film, when they'd get to a part that required good writing to deal with emotions, they escaped by just blowing up something else or running it over. A big bummer, big disappointment. What a relief to see Replacement Killers, a comic-book visually groovy 3000 bullet movie that accomplished exactly what it set out to do, and whose 42 seconds of emotion are 42 seconds more than Rushmore exhibits.",Rushmore

Rushmore is also an amazing look at adolescence in all its messy glory. It's a telling look from the eyes of an academically challenged yet unconventionally talented 15 year old.  It's also about true friendship that crosses age barriers, and the ability to maybe find redemption and meaning in an unsure and sometimes indifferent world.  Fantastic...don't miss it.",Rushmore

You see it's about this kid, and a guy he meets, and a teacher he falls for, and goes a bit bonkers . . . But that just can't convey how deeply touching and thought provoking this movie is.  Just watch it and enjoy how it works on so many levels.  One more note - Bill Murray shows talent that has been lacking from him of late (see Osmosis Jones).

You create fully developed, well rounded, believable characters and let them tell the story.  The humor isn't derived from crass bathroom jokes and low-brow antics.

There have been slapstick hits (Something about Mary, Austin Powers) that were so outlandish in their approach that one couldn't help but laugh. Then there are cult classsics (Caddyshach, Fletch) that when watched now is more like paying respects than laughing your face off. Rushmore is a completely different animal. It brings you into the reality of the world of Max Fisher. He is a mix between brilliance and A.D.D. Every performance in the movie seems so well directed that as a viewer you never want the movie to end. Rushmore is the type of comedy that makes you laugh from your inner soul.

You actually can get to know them and see how they react.Sometimes they don't react like you think and you can tell when there is sarcasm and if they are trying to be out there. Rushmore is a good example and Max Fischer is one of the best movie characters i have seen in a while. Jason was great and everyone knows that Bill Murray has already set the bar for perfection so we know what to expect.

Bill Murray is classic, though not like he was in Stripes; more like he was in Kingpin.I just saw this movie again and have to say that the music selections are so great.

The ""hand of God"" was too clear, in that the characters did amusing things that the screenwriter wanted them to, but not actions that arose out of the characters themselves. You may enjoy the film - but you'll have no idea WHY anyone is doing the things they do.

Although it contains more or less explicit references to _Apocalypse Now_, Good Will Hunting_, _The Graduate_, and even _Heat_, you would be better off to be familiar with Cheever, among others, but especially Salinger's _The Catcher in the Rye_._Rushmore_ feels as if it has been written by someone who has had real experiences, which makes its story all the more poignant. Plus, Bill Murray gives THE performance of the year.

The characters and their actions are odd most of the time, but they do not really surprise in a meaningful way and leave a flat impression. If it is for comedy, there are hardly any comic situations - there are some strange situations and dialogs, some of them are amusing, but most of them are too undramatic and uneventful to be funny or at least absurd, and too unbelievable and illogical for being credible. All other features of this movie are just fine, but nothing to be impressed of.So again, what is the hype about?

269,sundevil-pictures,"A great, unique story of youthful imagination...",10,18 December 2000,"Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film. It takes a somewhat trite  `coming of age' story to the next level by incorporating a dry and darkly comic edge, exposing the melancholy behind youthful innocence and hopeless romanticism. This is accomplished primarily through the surreal maturity found in its young characters, but also with the tenderly problematic older ones. Overall, Rushmore dispenses a gloomy charm, as the events of the film constantly teeter over failure, yet remain focused on fanciful dreams of success. The result is the ability of the audience to overlook disappointment and cherish the love of creation: to love the actual process of achievement, no matter how impossible or unattainable the ends may seem. In essence, Rushmore illustrates a new love for life, questioning whether one can ignore consequences in spite of the trivial pursuit of fun and invention. 10/10",Rushmore

271,skeetsmiller,An Excellent Movie,10,7 April 2001,"I first seen Rushmore on Encore one night, and I knew that is was something special, when I could relate to all the characters like that. I watch this movie almost every day, and every time I watch it I appreciate it a little more. The film has Jason Schwartzman( in a great performance) as Max Fischer, a 15-year old at Rushmore, a local private school. Although Max is in about every club there is at school( and he creates many other ones), he is a lousy student, who is about to get expelled because of his poor grades. He actually only got into Rushmore on a scholarship for writing a play about Watergate at a young age. Max meets local steel tycoon Herman Blume( Bill Murray, giving his best performance to date; he should have been nominated for an Oscar), and this leads to Max giving Mr. Blume an idea about building an aquarium to please a 1'st grade teacher at Rushmore, Rosemary Cross( Olivia Williams), for whom Max has fell in love with. Then problems happen as Mr. Blume also falls in love with her, leading to lots of hilarious moments. Rushmore has three great assets that make it one of my favorite movies: 1. Acting- All of the performance here are fantastic. Schwartzman as Max gives a high energy performance that is so perfect here; Murray gives a touching performance as a man who hates his life, while Williams gives a good performance as Miss Cross, while Seymour Cassel ( playing Max's father) and Sara Tanaka( playing Max's love interest) also give good supporting performances. 2. Script- The script is so great that it's just incredible. The dialogue involving handjobs is hilarious, but amazingly not over-the-top. 3. Music- The music is so perfect that one of my top priorities right now is to buy the soundtrack, if it's avialable. It's so full of perfectly coordinated songs, that even if the acting and script were terrible, the movie would still be good. I think that one of the problems in Hollywood is that there isn't enough movies like Rushmore. Rushmore is a brilliant film, and it's a film actually about people for once.",Rushmore

It might ""spoil"" the movie a bit.A few years ago, this and the Big Lebowski were my favorite films ever, and I'd seen quite a few. Rushmore contains some of the coolest moments captured on film including the scene where a miserable Mr. Blume does a canonball from the highdive at his pool in his Budweiser trunks and the shot where Max exits the elevator after putting bees into Mr. Blume's hotel room and, in slow-mo, sticks his gum against the wall. If you don't this movie, you're not cool. Max is my kind of guy.",Rushmore

I repeat-- DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! Don't listen to the pseudo-intellectual imbeciles who say it's the funniest film ever. These people constitute about .01% of the population; unfortunately, for reason I can't even imagine, their gushing about this waste-of-celluloid may make it appear to be one of those sleeper movies (like Office Space) that bombed miserably at the box office.This film bombed for a reason-- IT'S TERRIBLE! Absolutely nothing funny about it. I rarely turn off a movie before the ending, but this is one of those rare times that I and my wife just couldn't take it anymore (we shut it off about 3/4's through).Unless you have a fascination with how oddball people's minds work, don't watch this film. But even then, you'll be left scratching your heads as to why even they find it funny.You have been warned.",Rushmore
275,scoot_laird,It grows on you,10,1 February 2003,"If I wrote this review after the first time I saw it, I would have called it boring and mediocre and I would've said that I didn't know why all the critics loved it. Now when I write this, I must tell you I love this movie! If you don't like it first, I can see why, but watch it a few more times, if you have the chance, and you will discover what a funny and beautiful movie it is. The Royal Tenenbaums is better, but Rushmore is still an amazing movie with a great sound track. Highly recommended.",Rushmore
276,greenday840,Give It a Chance,9,5 February 2013,"Since beginning, there have been many film-makers who have mastered at the art of film-making and each one is remembered by their own style. Directors like Charlie Chaplin, F.W Munrau, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Ed Wood, Kevin Smith, George Lucas, Stanley Kubrick Etc. You can go ahead and add the name Wes Anderson to this list. Love him or Hate him, there is no denying that this guy has made some interesting movies and has a completely different outlook.The movie is odd. You have long shots where characters only talk, the humour is mostly satirical and the main character is not a person to look up-to. Throw in a unusual love triangle and you have a treat.Many people may not agree with me. You can either love his movies or completely ignore them. There is a distinct style in which the movie is presented. The main lead of the movie is the script. Written by Anderson and long time friend Owen Wilson, it is the screenplay of the movie which stands out.Max Fischer is the king of Rushmore. There is hardly any extra-curricular activity he does not do. With failing grades and increasing feelings for his teacher, max finds himself in the middle of all the action. With the inclusion of Bill Murray, the millionaire, who also develops feelings for max's teacher, the situation goes totally out of hand. What follows is how max tries to sort out his life.Brilliantly directed and written by Anderson, the movie is a little gem. If you are looking for a laugh out comedy, then it is not a wise move to watch this. What you get is underlying humour and a work of art. Bill Murray steals the show with his quirky one-liners and sombre expressions. Jason Schwartzman looks comfortable in the role of a student.Recommended, only if you have a taste of experimental movies, you will not be disappointed.",Rushmore
277,rainbow_man23,Very Very Funny,10,28 March 2006,"I saw all of Wes Andersons movies but this one was by far the best! I really enjoy watching bill Murray and i think he's one the best actors, and he proved me right in Rushmore. I thought Jason Shwartzman was extremely talented and really funny and also this is by far his best movie.The story itself is very well told and worth watching plus the performances were excellent and creative.Even Luke Wilson who doesn't appear much in the movie was funny during his appearance.All i can say is this is one of the best movies of 1998 and its easy to see why...",Rushmore
278,Morpheus-5,Funny as hell,8,3 September 2000,"I love it when I don't know what is going to happen, even within the context of a sort of romantic comedy. Rushmore is like watching Monthy Python's High School Comedy 2000. The great thing about it, is that nobody plays for laughs. Most of the scenes aren't even funny in itself, it's the context and the justapositioning that's makes it funny as hell.",Rushmore
279,BrianS.,One of the Top 10 comedies ever,10,8 February 1999,"""Rushmore"" follows up on all the promise shown by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's ""Bottle Rocket"" and then some. Finally, proof that a comedy doesn't have to be a dumbed-down John Hughes knock-off for libinous teens, full of fart and/or private part jokes or in a word....stupid. I was totally engrossed in the world of Rushmore, wanting to know more about the other students, the teachers, Max's history and especially, Herman Blume.  This movie should be nominated for at least Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Bill Murray.  Murray gives one of the most tragi-comic performances ever captured on film.  Jim Carrey should be forced to sit down every day for the next year and watch this movie and see what real ""acting"" is about.Finally, if there were a Grammy-like best new performer award for the Oscars, Jason Schwartzman would win it hands down.  It amazing to me that a teenager would be capable of the emotional depth of Max Fischer. Thanks Wes and Owen for another",Rushmore

I think maybe some people didn't get it might be the problem. I guess the previews were making most people think of 'There's Something About Mary 2' only showing certain scenes missing what the story was about. I watched it and I felt sorry for Max, he spent so much time trying to impress people but driving most people insane. But in the end you forgive him. I think the acting was really good, a good performance by newcomer Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murrays at his best.",Rushmore

What is going on here???? Some of the comments in this area are taken directly from the reviews. Are these people all friends of Wes? They must be because if people rely on those reviews when spending their movie going dollar they will waste a lot of money. This film is boring and the ""obscure 60's Soundtrack"" described by a reviewer and supposed patron (one and the same?) does no more than cover the silent corpse of what should have been dialog. This movie is a regrettable experience. Period.com.",Rushmore
284,Spootnik-2,A funny little film that's at least worth a matinee,7,27 February 1999,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this film, the reduced price made it even more worth it.  It starts out a little slow, but quickly becomes hard not to laugh at.  The relationships between Max Flounders and the adult characters are well played and remind us of our own experiences.  My only regrets for the film are that it is so short, only an hour and a half, and much more could have been done with the movie.  Bill Murray is back!",Rushmore
285,Kriece,Most Original Movie of 1998/99,10,4 March 1999,"The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was that I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie remotely resembling this one.  It is very hard to categorise and I can understand those people used to hyperbole in movies not getting this.  It is very understated with absolutely captivating characters.To categorise broadly, I would say it is in the same quirky, weird characters vein as a Coen brother movie (Fargo, Big Lebowski etc).My vote for best scene is when Bill Murray dives into the pool holding the bottle of scotch and is watched underwater by the kid.  Nothing really happens but infinitely captivating.  Sort of symbolises the rest of the movie.My ""if you liked these you will like this guide"" is - Any coen brother movie, Six degrees of Separation, As good as it gets.",Rushmore
286,Redemption,A breath of fresh air,10,25 March 1999,"Rushmore is that kind of movie you just don't see enough of. In fact, it is kind of difficult to put a finger on, but from the opening until the end I had a smile on my face. Without a doubt, Rushmore is in my top 5 favorite flicks of the year. Rushmore was fantastic! I laughed more than I have in a long time. The key is that you have to appreciate dry, subtle, and deadpan humor. I assume you have all seen the film, so you know how great the whole Bill Murray poolside scene is. These kind of sight gags are what separate Rushmore from all the other comedies out there. The acting is superb, and the characters' idiosyncrasies are what make them so lovable. Max Fischer is blessed with a confidence many only dream of, and we become convinced that he could do anything he sets his mind to. The soundtrack is great too, having dug up many long forgotten british invasion groups that fit the film perfectly, like the kinks and 4+2. And Bill Murray deserves recognition for his performance. In short, I think that the majority of the US public has been subjected to low class, base, toilet humor for far too long, as is evident by those who hated this film or don't have the mental capacity to understand humor beyond fart jokes and semen in a woman's hair. Just look, ""There's ....Mary"" was a box office bonanza, while Rushmore is out of theaters in one month.That should tell you where America is at, and it should scare you too. Us Rushmore lovers need to stick together. For everyone else, it shouldn't be long before Adam Sandler cranks out another piece of garbage to quench your thirst.",Rushmore
287,Nordling,This has made my list of top ten favorite movies of all time,10,4 July 1999,"and if you've seen my list you wouldn't think I was so easily influenced. We're talking Seven Samurai, Raging Bull, Schindler's List, The Empire Strikes Back, Glengarry Glen Ross, Citizen Kane, The Godfather Part II, and others.  Yes, Rushmore is just that good.The so-called teen comedies of the 80s and 90s just didn't work for me - because I never knew those people.  Honestly, does anyone know those people? High schools in film all look like they're from Beverly Hills.   The only realistic teen comedy teen character I can remember (before this film) was Cameron Fry from FBDO.  He at least seemed like a living, breathing teenager, with conflicts and emotions like real people.Then came Max Fischer.  Max Fischer is me.  Max Fischer was High School. Max Fischer was real.I'm not going to go too much into the plot of this one - simply because just when you think it's going to go one way it does an about face and goes somewhere else.  Kind of like real life that way.  I'll just say this - I have never seen the process of ""growing up"" so accurately portrayed in film like this.Bill Murray was robbed, plain and simple.  That Oscar should have been his. Jason Schwartzman played a very complicated character and pulled it off stunningly.  Olivia Williams was wonderful.Houstonians will delight in the way our city is presented.  The Houston Heights never looked so good.  And in Delmar Stadium (the kite-flying scene) people have flown kites and airplanes for years there on weekends, and it was cool to see it like that.  I learned how to drive a car in Delmar Stadium.Man, I loved this movie.  You will too.",Rushmore
288,allan-36,Wildly original comedy,9,5 August 2000,"Though it borrows from many movies, altogether there's no movie like RUSHMORE.The film is carried by lead character Max Fischer, who's a terrible student at the Rushmore private boys school, but is a member--often founder--of virtually every club on campus.  Moreover, Fischer is a brilliant playwright, whose talents (he wrote a one-acter about Watergate) in grade two that landed this barber's son a scholarship at this elite academy.Newcomer Jason Schwartzman is wonderful as the madly-driven, irrepressible misfit Max.  Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, the rich industrialist alumni of Rushmore, becomes unlikely friends (and a father figure) to Max.  This is Murray's best performance to date.  His deadpan portrayal is laced with melancholy that is touching and surprising.  Olivia Williams portrays the young, recently widowed schoolteacher whom Max falls for.  Williams handles this role with sensitivity and grace.  The supporting characters are well-handled, all by child actors.Extra points are awarded to the writers and filmmakers for casting such a racially eclectic film in which Asians, two Scots (though one portrays an American) and blacks share the screen as complex, realistic characters.At times, Max is almost too clever for a boy of 15 and the believability of the film also strains, but sure enough the film bounces back with a fine story twist or touch of comedy to throw it back onto its twisted course.Though RUSHMORE pays hommage to films such as ""The Graduate"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" it bears closest resemblance to the black comic classic, ""Harold and Maude"" in which a young man enters a relationship with a much older woman. In this case, the much-older Murray befriends the 15-year-old Max.  In other words, two misfits find each other.  Also, the soundtrack relies almost exclusively on mid-60s British invasion bands, such as the Kinks, the Who, the Stones and even solo John Lennon, who altogether add an intelligent, hopeful feel to the film along the lines of ""Harold and Maude"".The highlights of the film are ironically staged plays of ""Serpico"" and ""Heaven and Hell"" performed by Rushmore's students.A good film has good supporting performances.  Sara Tanaka, Stephen McCole and Mason Gamble all come through as complex, believable characters.
The writing is witty and never falls into cliche.  Wes Anderson's directing is lively with good use of music and moving camera and a good grip on actors' performances.I didn't know anything about the film when I saw it, but came away championing its originality and verve.",Rushmore
289,pschwiesow,Strange to see varied reactions,1,12 July 2001,"People seem to either love or hate this film.  I hated it.  It's much worse than just mediocre or uninvolving -- it's mean-spirited, pretentious, and aggressively unfunny.  Makes you wince and squirm in your chair.  I find it very strange that one reviewer claims to be a Woody Allen fan but strongly disliked 'Rushmore' -- to me, it has the same whining, cloying, ""I-deserve-to-be-loved-because I'm such a loser and have no redeeming qualities"" kinda vibe (I despise Woody Allen).Strange that it was recommended to me by a woman whose intelligence and taste I generally much admire.  It might be decent if it had a hero with anything one might find appealing, but this one doesn't -- he's self-promoting, self-aggrandizing, cheap, manipulative, loudmouthed, chauvenistic -- just a repellent jerk.I wonder why movies like this seem to be so polarizing, and what it says about the kinds of people we are.",Rushmore

I therefore had very high expectations to the movie. As the movie progressed, however, I became more and more puzzled as to why so many people like this movie. I just found it terrible in every way. First of all it is never really funny. Furthermore, the protagonist is just a hideous person often showing psychopathic behaviour. People don't behave realistically. Why do Bill Murray's character and the teacher show so much respect for this the protagonist who obviously never cares for anybody but himself? Please help me. List the qualities of this film. Because I really can't find any.",Rushmore
291,wellesly01,The best comedy of the 90's,10,21 June 2002,"I bought this movie in a six dollar bargain bin at my grocery store. Critical raves adorned the cover so I decided to give it a try. What I got in return was the best dark comedy since The Graduate. Rushmore is a dark and powerful story about the folley of youth. It is coated in the smooth comic shell of such films as Harold and Maud or dare I say Pulp Fiction. The acting by Jason Schwartzman is a superb character display. By putting up his awkward front the viewer is allowed to view deeper into his passions, obsessions and motivations. Olivia Williams plays the perfect muse of the affections of Schwartzman and Murray. Murray however somehow manages to shine above the rest in his odd and beautiful comic performances. The other great thing about this film aside from the performances is the music. This is what gave this otherwise serious story it's comic punch. Without it, Schwartzman would have been portrayed more as some obsessive compulsive serial killer than a confused teenager. Classic tunes from the Who and Cat Stevens made this movie work for me. You may not laugh even once during this film but it is sure to give you a big wide smile. This truly is divine comedy. I hope more directors can follow in Wes Anderson's footsteps. All is fare when love is War. Give it a chance.",Rushmore
292,jboren,Rushmore is the emergence of a great filmmaker.,10,28 February 2002,"Rushmore, Wes Anderson's (Bottle Rocket) sophmore effort is a masterpiece. Anderson puts himself in a category of filmmakers who will set the pace for cinema like the legends of old.  I admit this dark comedy may not be for everyone, but if you enjoyed Bottle Rocket you should love Rushmore. By the way the academy must hate Wes Anderson. Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums should have been best picture nominees not to mention Murray and Hackman getting robbed, but who cares I guess you really can't critique art.",Rushmore
293,mrpink000,Simply Brilliant!,7,5 January 2004,"Rushmore, directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) and starring Bill Murray, is a superb, light-hearted and hilariously funny film about a boy named Max - a 15-year-old student at Rushmore college who excels and enjoys participating in all areas of the school life.Max (Jason Schwartzman) is a bright, well spoken and extremely enthusiastic member of Rushmore who organises and runs a large number of varied co-corricular school activities, ranging from skeet shooting and bee keeping clubs to directing awesome school plays. However Max suffers from a lack of study thanks to his abundance in his extra school activities and faces expulsion from Rushmore if his grades do not improve.Things get out of hand for Max when he falls in love with the Grade 2 English teacher (Olivia Williams) and from here on in Max has to battle his troubles with school and his personal life simultaneously.
Rushmore in my opinion is an absolute brilliant film. Wes Anderson tells this story with style and a unique craftmanship for his work, creating a querky, light-hearted and generally very fun film. It's hard to express the brilliance of Wes Anderson and his unique way of creating such a great film. He's a truly great individual and original film maker.I would rate The Royal Tenenbaums a slightly better film - as it's a more complete film than Rushmore, but equally funny and entertaining.I suggest watching this movie at least twice, as it only gets better the more you watch it!A brilliant film! A must-see. 8/10",Rushmore

This is a much warmer film though.While loving the film, I admit to having reservations about the ending: does it imply that Max and Miss Cross might have something going after all?The soundtrack is great, and if watching this doesn't convince you that Bill Murray is one of the best actors we have, I don't know what will.A special word for Stephen McCole as Buchan -- a real Scots actor playing a Scottish part in an American film?  Beam me up, Scotty!",Rushmore

This movie is about a character so unlikable that it can never recover- we are forced to endure the self centered exploits of a whiny youth we don't empathize with, so that he can accomplish....nothing. He doesn't reform himself, he doesn't help anyone, he doesn't do anything meaningful. He just acts like a creep to some poor second grade teacher and writes ludicrous plays (the one funny aspect). None of it meshes together, and there is nothing meaningful or original being said here. I'm sure others will no doubt disagree with me, but what can I say-It's overrated and despite how much it wants to appear intelligent, nothing intelligent is being shown here. Anderson's next film is much better.",Rushmore

It is typical of what this director has ended up doing in all of his movies though. Very small character traits or things in the shot that will set me off and make me laugh. Bill Murray is so hilarious in this (and in this director's other movies too) he deserves an Oscar for at least one of these roles and I think this one might be the best. Supporting actor for this and best actor for Royal Tenenbaums which he might have been even better in. I love all the small little story turns and how the characters interact, it's a beautiful and moving and funny movie that is uncomfortable and unpleasant at times but in a very real and funny way.

297,joshgst,Film Appreciation: Wes Anderson movie comparison,10,22 November 2015,"This film was a spectacular. It was nothing short of perfection in my opinion. When I say perfect I don't mean that the film is perfect in a category. For instance, I don't mean it's the perfect action adventure or comedy film, but that Rushmore is perfect because of it's plot, characters, and setting. I personally felt like I could relate to Max Fischer. We both try to make the most out of our high school experiences. The film Mr. Fantastic Fox was a very unique movie, however it wasn't one of my favorites. Even though I liked the character Mr. Fox an enjoyed his personal adventures and stunt; I couldn't help but dislike the intro of the film with his son and cousin. Watching these two made me think about the dilemma of growing up in to your teens, being in competitions with a someone who everything you wish you were, and being antisocial. Although, this isn't one of my favorites films doesn't mean it wasn't a very good film.",Rushmore
298,isabellelouisearif,an enjoyable character driven plot,8,4 March 2019,"'Rushmore' is the third film of Anderson's that I've seen and the oldest, the others being 'fantastic mr fox' and 'the grand budapest hotel' which are rather different. I went into this not knowing a lot about the plot but that Schwartzman would be playing a student. Schwartzman's character Max is that classic Anderson character that I would have wanted, he is quirky, comical but still has depth. That is found in the other supporting characters too. If you love a character driven story this is ideal for you. It is much different from Anderson's newer films in which they are much more aesthetic driven but there are still the symmetrical shots and 'crime-like' sequences. I would recommend this to any avid film fan who doesn't mind an unusual story about relationships with adults during that coming of age period.",Rushmore
299,asac,Excellent quirky film,10,27 February 1999,"This movie is hilarious. Bill Murray does a fantastic job as a loser. He just doesn't care, and it's really funny. Jason Schwartzman does a spectacular job also as a kid who doesn't know how old to be. The movie is really funky, with all sorts of non-dialogue moments that had me rolling. A very funny movie!",Rushmore
300,C-dog-3,I wish to acknowledge. . .,9,24 February 1999,"Rushmore is a completely engaging film that is really an arthouse comedy that thankfully made it into wide release.  Bill Murray is a hilarious and pathetic loser who strikes up a competition with another funny and pitiful failure of a 15-yr old, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman).  Both of their performances are knee-slappingly comical and at the same time very touching. This movie reminded me of a more upbeat version of Welcome to the Dollhouse.  The scene that really killed me was when Max was drunk and out at dinner with Herman Blume (Murray), Max's love interest Rosemary (Olivia Williams), and Rosemary's friend the doctor.  Max, of course, made a complete ass of himself.  What do you expect from a kid who runs 50 weird extra-curricular clubs at school.  The entire cast was enjoyable, everyone from Dirk (Max's blond sidekick) to the Scottish bully.I believe that Murray is on a real streak now as far as the quality of his performances and the quality of his roles.  Unlike most of his Saturday Night Live comrades, he has done something with his movie career.  Eddie Murphy was good in the 80's but look at the crap he has done recently. Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, and Joe Piscopo aren't even respectable.  Jason Schwartzman is terrific in Rushmore and could possibly have a future in the movie business because un-like many of the young actors of today (i.e. Jennifer Love Hewitt, the cast of Scream), he actually has some acting talent.  Rushmore is a real pleasure and is so far the best movie of 1999.",Rushmore

302,no-budget,"Original, witty, worth the money",9,13 February 1999,"Rushmore was one of the most refreshingly original comedies I've seen in a long time.  'The Truman Show' was breath-taking and original, but it was more of a drama.  This eccentric comedy just hit the right spot with me. 'Rushmore' was perfectly placed right in the middle of a string of crappy movies that were recently released ('She's All That', 'Simply Irresistible') and along with the amazing 'A Simple Plan' got right at the top of my favorite movies of the year (98/99 actually).  Bill Murray was brilliant...but he didn't even try! This movie perfectly portrays the comic genius of Murray.  With good performances by all of the other actors and well directing and writing, 'Rushmore' should have recieved a little more respect from the Academy.  Oh well.",Rushmore

Yes, Bill Murray in his Budweiser boxers was just soooo moving as he jumps into the pool to drown in sorrow.  Give me a break.  Maybe I was put off by the classification of the film.  This was supposed to be a comedy, right?  If not, it was still absolutely atrocious, in my humble opinion.  It didn't work as a drama or a comedy.  The lead character is so annoying I wanted to reach into the screen and strangle him.  Maybe I lack compassion for total jerk main characters, but for me a film is not going to work if you do not have any interest in any of the characters.  I found them all boring and a total waste of time.  I want my money back!  Does anybody else remember when Bill Murray used to make good movies?  AAAARRRRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!",Rushmore

Max Ficher, is superbly acted by Jason, and what about Mr Blume, wonderfully played by Murray. A very underated, its unffair, movie that will touch everyone who see it.But, what I can't understad, is that screws like the ultra-proamericans-conquer the world ""Saving Private Ryan"", recieved tons of nominations and awards, this superior, but smaller movies, are not appreciated, SO DO ME ONE FAVOR PLEASE,RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANY LIVING PERSON YOU KNOW, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE...........",Rushmore
305,paul_bender,Mainstream film disguised as an offbeat one,2,2 February 2000,"Films that manage to create character identification for unsympathetic characters are rare and, I find, frequently profound.  Sadly, for me, ""Rushmore"" is not such a film.  Max, the main character, is not only unsympathetic, but is almost thoroughly unlikable.  He is offensive to most people he meets, has no goals that might justify his nastiness, has virtually no interests, and really has no admirable qualities.  And the one thing he is allegedly good at (writing plays) occurs totally offscreen.  We never see him working on plays, agonizing over them, figuring out his plots and characters; in fact, his writing seems to have little affect on his life at all until he appears with a completed script.  (In my mind, the screenwriters of ""Rushmore"" used Max's writing, as well as his relationship to his dead mother, as a sort of half-baked character attribute that they never put sufficient effort into fleshing out.)  Worst of all, Max never changes (for better, or for worse.)  He doesn't really learn anything or move anywhere, and he doesn't appreciably affect anyone's life.While I enjoyed Bill Murray's performance, I was continually distracted by the implausibility of a 45 year old man forming an intimate friendship with a high school student.  Such a relationship is certainly not impossible. However, the film offers no credible reasons for its formation.  Moreover, in the days in which we live, it is inconceivable to me that a middle aged man with no adult friends can hang with a teen ager without raising some very real questions (not to mention a few eyebrows!)  Of course these are not issues that a bold film would ignore, but Rushmore does just thatc, and in my mind that is just plain laziness (or incompetence) on the part of the filmmakers.For me, Rushmore is about impotent, directionless, rebellion.  Sure it's charismatic and chock full of energy, even touching for a while.  But for those of us beyond puberty, the ""angry young man"" character gets boring pretty quickly unless that energy goes somewhere, unless something original is developed from it; and, in Rushmore, this does not happen.",Rushmore
306,morpheus?,"Excellent script, but the film didn't pull it all off.",7,20 July 2000,"I liked this film a great deal for a few reasons. The script was brilliant. The actors were all solid (Bill Murray in his first good role insome time, Jason Schwartzman in a great star debut). However... The directing didn't cut it. In many scenes the actors didn'tseem to be strongly motivated, which made the performances flat and stilted. The editing gave me problems; it seems as though sceneswere shot with very little coverage, so there weren't manyoptions for the editor (many jump cuts, etc.). It feels like the production didn't have enough time to makethis a really solid effort and had to get what they couldfinished quickly. Unfortunately, this meant that a very goodscript turned into a pretty-good movie.",Rushmore

im guessing owen wilson was the perfect blend for that balance, but anyway whatever the reason thats my fav movie. every scene is made with so much heart and skill i laughed not only for the jokes but also for the perfection i just witnessed. i laughed of joy!!!! no spoilers or clues needed, go see it!",Rushmore

310,ChaGuana,Great movie for the blessed minority of intellectuals.,10,22 January 2002,"After seeing that the Royal Tenenbaums was slated ahead of Rushmore on the user rating system here at IMDB, i feel I have to stand up for Wes Anderson's best work (Rushmore and Bottle Rocket). For those of you who loved the Royal Tenenbaums and haven't seen the other Wes Anderson movies, I envy you, because you have quite a show ahead of you! *Especially* with Rushmore, which is slighty better than Bottle Rocket in my opinion.I'll admit, the humor is out there. It is not for all. If you are in love with movies by the Farrelly Brothers, or any teenybopper comedies like American Pie - - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!! Because you won't get it.I AM SICK AND TIRED of people commenting that they HATED this movie, or that they HATED Bottle Rocket or Tenenbaums, or that they HATED other great movies by great directors (Coens, C.Guest, etc.) So, I'll repeat: IF YOU ARE A COMPLETE IDIOT WHO NEEDS EVERYTHING SPOON-FED - - just simply STAY AWAY! You don't get it, and you never will. The easiest solution to your problem is to just put your leash back on get back in your line - - and STAY AWAY FROM ME!!!!hehehe, just had to get that off my chest. .. .anyway, rushmore is a great movie if you enjoy something a little different...

312,JamesRoy,Almost the perfect movie,10,22 January 2005,"One of the criticisms levelled at JD Salinger's classic book ""Catcher in the Rye"" is that the voice of Holden Caulfield feels a little clunky at times, and very self-conscious. And yet this can also be seen as a comliment to the way in which Salinger finds his way into the mind of an adolescent creeping up to and looking over the brink of independence and adulthood.Rushmore is just like this. Max Fischer is a frustrating character, high on delusions of grandeur, desperate to be seen as a leader, determined not to be seen as a scholarship tryhard. Up until now every adult he knows has seemed willing to accept him at what he thinks is face value. But he's not who he thinks he is, and he sure as hell isn't an adult yet, even though he believes himself to be.This movie is quirky, poignant, warm and the performances are understated (especially Jason Schwartzmann, whose naive self-confidence as Max is so finely tuned.) At times it's excruciating to watch, in much the same embarrassing way that ""The Office"" (BBC TV) is excruciating to watch. But that discomfort is what makes films like this so irresistible: in Max Fischer we see a great deal of ourselves, and we cringe, and we totally understand.",Rushmore

With a bigger star cast (Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, Brian Cox), all of which fire on all cannons in this wonderful comedy about the unlikely love triangle which forms between three unlikely friends.On a personal note, I really have to say that this kind of writing and directing talent does not come along often, and when it does, it makes me remember why I love cinema so much in the first place...I cannot praise this film enough! Perfection!",Rushmore
314,abrooks0622,The main character doesn't need to be likable,10,28 March 2021,"I realize that I'm a couple of decades late in watching this film, but felt it necessary to throw my own thoughts into the mix on this.This film was well-written, meaningful, and had fantastic cinematography. The main character, while quite unlikable for much of the film, is still relatable and original. The movie is his story and very much from his perspective/mindset. While narcissistic and a bit overbearing, he has dreams and ideals of what he would like to be, and essentially embodies the concept of ""fake it til you make it"". The other adults in the story are basically reacting to Max in whatever ways they can, and I think for many of them, they are not only reacting, but relating. After all, however unlikable he is, it is not difficult to empathize with him, his struggles, motivations, or actions. In this, I find my reasoning why I feel that it's a fantastic film.There are a number of moments that I laughed whole-heartedly and for the better part of the hour-and-a-half, I was curious what would happen next and where he would go from there. Of course, this film has its eccentricities and quirks, many of the same that are present in other Wes Anderson films, and I think anyone going into this in 2021 or later will surely come to expect many of these. Similarly, I can to a degree understand why people in 1999 wouldn't know how to take this movie or how to feel about its characters.In the end, I would say it's a fantastic film. The story is full of life, emotion, and can be interpreted a number of ways depending on how you empathize with the different characters. As I said, you may not like Max, but I think anyone who watches this will be hard-pressed to say that they don't like the film itself.",Rushmore
315,sagadanielsson,"A touching journey of love, hate and self discovery",10,27 April 2020,"Rushmore is directed by Wes Anderson and stars his frequent collaborators Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. Despite it only being Anderson's second feature, it still remains one of his best and the film which opened the eyes of the world to his work. The story follows a student named Max Fisher (played by Schwartzman) on a journey of love, hate and self discovery.This film is a true testament of the strengths we have come to expect from Anderson as a director and a writer. It has clever dialogue, complex and well written characters, great music and wonderful cinematography. In addition to this, Anderson creates a story so filled with dark humor and deep emotion it is impossible to look away.Rushmore is perhaps the most realistic coming of age depiction ever put on screen and there is a few reasons why. The film deals largely with the question of acceptance and what it means to belong somewhere. When we meet Max, it is clear that he belongs at his school Rushmore, this is until he falls in love with a school teacher named Rosemary and she becomes his new sense of belonging. Later in the film when he gets kicked out of school and repelled by Rosemary we therefore learn that behind Max's confident exterior is a real feeling of disconnection and that forces him on a coming of age journey.Max and many other characters in this movie can seem too quirky and weird at first glance, but it's their unfiltered personas that makes them real. As viewers, some of the decisions the characters make fills us with love for them, while others fills us with hate. However, we learn to accept and even like them all, despite their many flaws. This is when one realises that the story brings us on a similar journey as Max's and by the end of it we can just like him, accept all sides of ourselves and recognise that it's okay to be whoever we are, as long as we are open for change. In many ways, the story brings its own concept to us, we feel like we belong in this crooked world, mainly because of how we can find something relatable in every single character in this film. Whether it's Max's dark humor, self consciousness and passion or Herman Blume's feeling of regret, self hatred and dissatisfaction.This is a beautiful film about wounded hearts latching on to each other, whether your heart is wounded or not, I recommend that you latch on to this story and keep it close. What Anderson created with this film is the kind of magic you rarely see, much less experience.",Rushmore
316,MikeN27,Hilarious,10,21 February 2000,This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Bill Murray deserved an Oscar nomination for this movie.  Just an incredibly original movie.  I can't see how it didn't do better at the box office.  Definitely a must see.,Rushmore
317,verkisto,"offbeat, unique, engaging",9,10 February 1999,"This is one of those rare films that not only had me frequently laughing out loud, but also continuously smiling. This is mostly attributable to the depth of the characters, as well as the skillful performances of Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. It was refreshing to see character portraits that were not drawn as simplistic this-is-the-good-guy, this-is-the-bad-guy caricatures. Max is not a hero, but we root for him. His sometimes-despicable actions make us cringe, and yet one can only laugh as he and Murray's Blume, after their falling-out, resort to the dirty revenge tactics typical of passionate, spurned lovers. They, like most real people (as opposed to the cardboard cut-outs depicted in the vast majority of movies), are neither villains nor saviors, just people with good moments and bad moments.  What makes them worthy of watching, though, is their spark, their desire to achieve extraordinary results from their ordinary lives. Max is a poor academic student who nonetheless craves knowledge, an idealist who disguises his introversion by being outgoing.  At his worst, he is a petty, whining brat; At his best, he strives to bring out the best in others.Bill Murray is at his finest, and left me wishing he had more screen time. He is aware of the value of an actor's eyes, with a subtly averted gaze or barely-perceptible dawning registering much more than ""acting"" ever could.I imagine those who had an intense aversion to this picture (as evidenced by the postings here) had best go back to renting Armageddon for their cinematic stimulation. Obviously, the unconventional style of Rushmore left them addled and angrily confused, and the familiar blockbuster dose of a noisy, destruction-and-debris-filled ending (followed twenty minutes later by another noisy, destruction-and-debris-filled ending) will allay their fears that Hollywood is no longer going to produce mind-numbing feature-length music video crap anymore. It's okay, anonymous, don't weep--another by-the-numbers spectacular with a trite ballad by Aerosmith with be along any Friday soon, I guarantee it.",Rushmore

319,BEARisonFord,beautifully executed.,10,21 February 1999,"while the lot of these negative reviews bewilder me (too loud?), i suppose i am not surprised. Rushmore, while a brilliant film, is not a conventional one, and while i'd love for it to succeed, i have a sneaking suspicion that word of mouth from the likes of these close minded people will ruin it's chances of being a huge success (but then again, does that even matter?). it seems nowadays if you're not a You've Got Mail or a Something About Mary, you don't even have a chance for big success in the comedy field. It's a shame that such an intelligent, fresh coming of age film such as this will probably go unnoticed for the most part. The acting was great. a superb debut from Jason Schwartzman, a ""The Postman"" forgiving performance by Olivia Williams, and of course, there is Bill. I have to say, i really DO wish, and think he deserved an Academy Award nomination. Do Ed Harris and Robert Duvall REALLY deserve that? another bright note was that aside from the principal cast members, i found the whole supporting cast to be above-pleasing as well, which is usually rare in films like these. Anyway, add in the fantastic direction and scribe from our ""Bottle Rocket"" team Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, and a FABULOUS British wave soundtrack and you've got one beautiful film.",Rushmore

Everybody I've talked to said the same thing, ""I wanted to see this movie again immediately after it was over."" Great dialogue, characters, cinematography, you name it. Anybody who can't relate to these very human and realistic characters was probably the local football jock or head cheerleader. Anybody who couldn't follow this plot probably thinks Godzilla and Titanic are great films. This film said a great deal without spelling it out for the lowest common denominator. The Max Fischers of the world shall take over!",Rushmore
323,kembry,"Strange, but affecting",9,20 March 1999,"Following in the same odd-ball vein as ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo,"" ""Rushmore"" focuses on Max Fisher, a private school genius, who feels the rules simply don't apply to him, in academics, in administration, and--particularly in this film--in romance. He defies every convention and authority with varying degrees of success. Max finds a hero in Bill Murray's Mr. Blume character who, likewise, has found a certain degree of success by violating social standards and going against the odds.Despite most reviews, this is far from Murray's best. However, he does a fine job with a strange character and you understand his plight, while not really identifying with it. He has worked his way to the top, and in the process realized this wasn't what he was bargaining for. He's in a loveless marriage, raising neanderthal sons, and entertaining and associating with people he despises. In Max he finds the boy without convention, with unabashed ambition, flawless manipulation of those around him, and boundless zeal and ingenuity to bypass every form of authority around him.This movie is unadulterated farce. Perhaps the funniest scenes in the movie come as 10-15 year olds play CIA agents, Vietnam soldiers, and members of the mafia in Max Fisher original plays. Juxtaposing these images with what children usually play in third or fourth grade plays (a carrot, a tooth, a tree, Ebeneezer Scrooge...), you understand this movie is not merely to be taken at face value but is probably more allegorical. While probably not as directly symbolic as, say, ""Grand Canyon,"" it definitely makes a comment about ambition and convention.Overall, this movie is not to be taken seriously. This is far from an Adam Sandler/Jim Carrey mindless comedy with plenty of sewer humor and sight gags. Unfortunately the story does have several (unnecessary) sexual overtones which detract from the movie's overall messages (although I'm sure many would argue with that). In the end, it's about ambition, disillusionment, convention and finding your place in the world. If those are themes you can identify with, Rushmore is worth your time.",Rushmore
324,Gogo-10,A comedy with remarkably few laughs in which an insufferable teen-ager experiences a change of heart.,1,23 July 1999,"Except for the few scenes between or referring to Bill Murray and his twin sons and those involving Brian Cox, this is a decidedly unfunny comedy. The hero is,  I suppose, intended to be viewed as irrepressible when in fact, he's insufferable. The filmmakers try to humanize him by giving him a dead mother and a good-hearted dad but they can't mask the fact that for the most of the film he's simply an obnoxious weasel. I found myself rooting against him at every turn and his change of heart at the end felt completely contrived. This is a mean- spirited little film that lacks the nerve to remain true to its own nastiness, opting instead for a safe ""feel good"" ending which is so dramatically dishonest as to be insulting",Rushmore

It was cool and original without being trendy.  It was hilariously funny without being gimmicky.  It had great, strong characters who were all so believable.  It also was a good story without a plot that punched you in the face, but rather hid behind the tree like Bill Murray in the memorable finger-painting scene.  Jason Schwartzman will be a star, and hopefully some day Bill Murray will get proper recognition for being one of the funniest men in the world.

The main character is not named Rushmore, Rushmore is the school.  The main character is Max Fisher.2.  One of the characters that was attracted to Miss Cross was already a smoker (Bill Murray's character), and the other one soon became a smoker for her, just as he saved Latin classes (which, by the way, he got cancelled) and tried to build her an aquarium.This movie was a surprise.  I'm not at all shocked that so many people have expressed their dislike for it, as you can feel nearly everything the characters are going through, and many people just aren't ready for that kind of realism.  It's not a comedy (although there are some moments that made me laugh out loud), it's not a drama, it's not anything, other than maybe a character study, and an explanation of how one young man learns to cope with everything.If you can handle it, this is a fantastic movie.",Rushmore

Its not just the perfect directorial technique or the once in a career script writers life script that does it. So many people on here have put the film down in so many different ways and of course thats fine. What these people have to ask is what did they expect from this film? Its everything anyone who wanted to be entertained/inspired could ask for. The intelligent yet charmingly vulnerable Max, the seemingly stone cold Mr blume who turns out to be completely the opposite, its perfect. I cant say anything else that will make you want to watch this but i can say this, once in a while films come along that are truly original, these films live in the memory for a long time and question the ideology of..life, its true and i might sound strange for saying it but those of you reading this and have seen the film and either enjoyed it/hated it might want to ask yourselves this question...what is the secret?Who knows?",Rushmore

That is the case in this film. He operates at a level far beyond his years, no wonder he desires an older woman and is close friends with a late 40-ish millionaire.I really liked this film on so many levels :Bill Murray's deadpan looksthe soundtrack... so appropriate during certain scenesthe whole supporting cast (especially Max's sidekick Kirk)scene sequencingthe character's attireOverall, a good quality film by Wes Anderson.",Rushmore

The script was hilarious, the characters were unique, the score was infectious and the direction was sparkling youthful ingenuity.I love this movie so much because it has to be the only movie (or one of the rare,rare movies) that made me feel this great after I saw it.  It is the ultimate feel-good movie because it has ZERO amount of cheese and just the right dollop of..umm ""feel-goodness"" for lack of a better term.Max Fischer is the best character I've seen on screen.  What fascinates me about him is that technically he is so unreal--I don't know anyone and I can't imagine anyone being close to a Max Fischer--and yet in the movie he is made real, he is made incarnate as a believable human being--one with passions, faults, quirks, mannerisms, etc.In my opinion the movie was really about the maturing of Max Fischer. Max Fischer was a guy boy could--and did--do anything. From his enrollment in Rushmore at age seven he was an overachieving freak, an oversuccessful success story.  And in that sense, he was spoiled. Then he falls in love with Miss Cross and for the first time ever he has a goal he cannot achieve. By the end of the movie he has grown up because he lets this goal go; this shows in the resolution between him and Cross and Herman (Murray).There were so many beautiful parts in this movie: Max's speech in his new public school (he was a fish out of water, it was hilarious); the part when Max introduces Herman to his dad, a barber and *not* a brain surgeon; Max's first meeting with Miss Cross.. Every scene in this movie is perfect; the fact that the movie doesn't drag is a major plus.All in all, I loved this movie.

For those who don't think it's funny, well, they really don't get it. It's not Adam Sandler, nor is it American Pie.  The humour relies on quirkiness, irony, and just the plain bizarre.  None of it is over the top, and that's why it's so great.  The fact that the humour isn't blatent yet still incredibly funny makes a great comedy.  Bill Murray is incredibly funny, doing the same shtick he does in The Man Who Knew Too Little (a pretty good film) and Charlie's Angels (God Awful crap).  Olivia Williams is incredibly beautiful, and Jason Schwartzman makes the film.  He's uncanny wit and his odd looks make him perfect for the role of Max.  Besides Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (which also doesn't use the in your face bodily fluids/functions humour, yet is funny), Rushmore is my favorite movie.

The lead character, Max Fischer, is unbearably emotionally abusive and main goal throughout the movie is to escape the friend zone that his teacher, Rosemary Cross, has put him in. The female lead is degraded to a token whose only positive experiences in the movie are designed by men trying to get into her pants.

You could not turn off your brain (a prerequisite to enjoy most comedies in theaters these days) and still enjoy the film.

Plus, it has been reviewed over 500 times on this site alone.One important aspect of this film, which is overlooked in practically every online review that I've read, is Wes Anderson's nod to the world of J.D. Salinger. The parallels between Holden Caulfield and Max are numerous, and when considered in light of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (with its scenes at the museum and the b.b. gun battles), the canon of Wes Anderson is one that has been greatly colored by the imagination of J.D. Salinger. From Max's red hat to his expulsion, the film touches on many ideas from THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. Thematically, the works are quite similar and share an idiosyncratic mood.The other great influence on Wes Anderson, which is even more obvious to any student of film, is the work of Hal Ashby. In particular, the symmetry of Hal Ashby's shots in films like HAROLD AND MAUDE and BEING THERE.

There is no high principle or morals to discuss over coffee here, but rather the ingenuity of putting together eccentric characters.  I'm going to call this a feel good movie because the filmakers obviously have an optimism about being a dreamer and following the path that you make for yourself.  I laughed OK.",Rushmore
342,asimdb,The most boring movie I have ever seen.,1,8 February 1999,"This is absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen. You spend the entire first hour waiting for something to happen, and then when you realize it won't, the movie throws just barely enough interesting scenes to keep you from walking out.It's billed as a comedy, but the entire movie has just one funny scene, and that's the one they showed in the preview. (Guy in O.R. scrubs, main character says Oh aRe you?)The acting is good and the characters look good, but the script is missing. Quite simply nothing much happens. The main character does things for no particular reason, i.e. things don't occur in any particular sequence, nor does one action seem to lead to another. And the movie never bothers to explain why he does the stuff that he does do, it seems totally random.The ""romance"" or even the plays the main character put on are never fleshed out. There are numerous random scenes that have nothing to do with what came before or after, they could have been cut out and no one would have noticed - in fact 80% of the story could have been cut out without anyone noticing. You could have also taken the film, cut it into scenes and put it back together in a random order and no one would notice.In other words there is no story, only a collection of (well acted) scenes. If you like that sort of stuff go see this, but if you want an actual story I can't think of a movie with less of one.I can't even begin to describe how boring this show is, the only thing in it that doesn't suck is the pretty girl, and cute kids.",Rushmore
343,wicket-3,one of the most under-rated movies......,10,20 April 2000,"In viewing ""Rushmore"" for a second time, I picked up a lot of the little things in the movie that make it so great.  The pool scene with the Bill Murray character is one of the best directed scenes in the movie. You can feel his depression.  But the movie is so much more.  Listen to the way the characters talk to each other, react to each other, listen to each other. Its the way real people act, and unfortunately it happens all too little in movies. Also note the last scene (the dance) and how the director (Anderson)has assembled every supporting character there.  It truly is a smart film.",Rushmore

This movie does not cater to the half-minded, myopic film goer-s who just wanna sit and eat popcorn.  This movie must be thought about. Every little comment adds character and reality to the script, and Wes doesn't feel like he should have to show you when to laugh, those who pay attention and focus will fall in love with this movie.  Those who wait for scenes of bodyparts in zippers and waterboys tackling school teachers will be disappointed; i counted only one slapstick joke in the entire movie.  For those who judge it based on the color of trees during different seasons, be sure to note that the entire movie was shot in houston, and i only noticed one shot with any kind of temperate plant life, so Wes completely blew me away with his sets--i know, i'm trying to make tropical central florida look like connecticut--Jason S. is completely comfortable as a character, among acting virtuosos Bill M. and Olivia W.  It was also great to see some of the people from Bottle Rocket, who were just as good in this movie--Kumar is the best!!!--The thing that makes this movie so great is that the writers, Wes A. and Owen W. didnt seem to change their character and style to create this movie, and the entire film gives the air of ""i don't care if no one likes this, this is the way we do movies""   Almost as if it was accepting the fact that some would love it, and others would hate it, unlike other films today [cough 8mm cough] and don't even tell me this thing didn't have style...anyone would be hard pressed to match this style, visually or technically.

Bill Murray is his best as the disappointed paramour who's life, despite great financial riches, is bitter and empty.  Jason Swartzman played the role of Max Fisher perfectly, capturing both the adolescent love and Holden Caulfied-like angst of his character.This film should be in everyone's collection and certainly on the Top 250 list.",Rushmore

I have seen this movie twice and loved it. I have been a fan of their work since the now classic BOTTLEROCKET. Their teaming with Bill Murray, the king of comedy, is a pure stroke of genius. The writing is excellent, camera work fresh, and the performances by Jason Schwartzman, Murray, and Olivia Williams are superb. The script was probably my favorite aspect of the film, utilizing lines from other films, old racial slurs rarely heard today, and never has the phrase 'hand-job' been so funny. Watch closely for surprise appearances by BOTTLEROCKET alum's Luke Wilson(Owen's brother), Kumar as Mr. Little Jeans, and Futureman(also a Wilson brother) as the baseball coach. Also, Max's final play, a sendup of APOCALYPSE NOW, is hilarious. 10 out of 10.",Rushmore
351,Hamson,A brilliant film worth another look...,10,6 June 1999,"I just saw Rushmore, and all I can say is ""WOW!"" I'm not a Gen-Xer, yuppie, or a teenager, so the negative reviews that cite this film as comprehensible only to these groups are invalid for me. This was an odd, unique little film whose comedy comes from characterization, not one-liners or vulgarity (I'm no snob, though; I LOVED Kingpins). This film walked the razor's edge between quirkiness for its own sake and true insight into the human soul and, in my opinion, succeeded. Interestingly, the trailers for this film turned me off; it just looked like another teen comedy; a bit different, perhaps, than the current vogue of films using TV icons who have the vapid look of JC Penney catalog models, but looking a little too self-consciously hip and arty nevertheless. How wrong I was! I suggest that anyone who disliked this film but finds it crossing their mind from time to time should watch it again. You might change your opinion.",Rushmore
352,Perini,As unique a film as America has ever produced.,10,4 July 1999,"Wes Anderson is not a simple person, yet he directs films about simple people whose quirky personalities create somewhat complicated stories. Sort of...Well as you can tell, describing a Wes Anderson picture is a perplexing task.Rushmore is a story about a 15 year old scatter-brained jack-of-all-trades named Max (played by newcomer Jason Schwartzman).  Max is given scholarship to a prestigious prep school following the success of a stageplay he writes while in the 2nd grade.  Life thereafter is not easy for Max for his IQ is not quite average, yet he dreams big.  One day Max befriends a wealthy booster named Herman.  Bill Murray's portrayal of this character was Oscar-worthy.  He wishes he had a son like Max and makes his malcontent with his own children obvious throughout the picture.  Ultimately, Max and Herman fall in love with one of Max's teachers, Mrs. Cross, and what ensues is one of the most charming and unique love triangles ever filmed.With Rushmore, subtlety is everywhere: cinematography, scene composition, dialogue, and of course acting.  What makes this film so wonderful is the manner in which the audience can find faults with all the characters yet they're so richly developed that you still embrace them.  There is no over-the-top conflict between characters in Rushmore.  In one pivotal scene Max and Mrs. Cross exchange sentiments that they've never met a person quite like the other.  I've never quite seen a film like Rushmore.If there is one minor critique of Rushmore, it would be that Anderson seems to be intentionally unconventional with scene transition, which was more annoying than artistic.All considered, I still consider this gem a splendid 10/10.*psssst* Make sure you see ""Bottle Rocket"" too!",Rushmore
353,Chroneos,"A wonderful movie the second, third, fourth and fifth time around.",10,25 December 2001,"When I first saw this movie, I didn't really have any good or bad thoughts of it, I had expected the humor to be the style of many Bill Murray movies I had seen.  It wasn't until I had watched it one day on TV, knowing what to expect, that I really enjoyed the movie.  If you saw it once and didn't like it, see it again, if you saw it once and liked it, see it again anyway, repeat viewings of this movie make it better, but for those who haven't yet seen it, don't expect too much obvious humor, a lot is implied, and done very well, at that.Overall, I give Rushmore a 9.6 out of 10.Side note: the only movie I have given 10 out of 10 to is ""Dr. Strangelove  or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"".",Rushmore
354,skyao,one of my very favorites,10,18 July 1999,"Rushmore is one of my very favorite movies of all time.  I think it deserves an oscar nomination for Schwartzman and Murray, plus best picture for the upcoming academy awards.  Alas, it will never win because its too smart and too complicated for the old fogies in the voting circle.It is a great movie with black humor, romance, and redemption.  Although its a little sappy, Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson should get more recognition for this work but won't because this movie grossed less than $20M.  Also, buy the soundtrack, even if you didn't like the movie.",Rushmore

I hate that there is a thousand word limit on these things, because I could talk about this one all day.  Never before have I seen a film that so perfectly melted the humor of a situation with the pain and awkwardness that ultimately result in each scene.  It is truly fascinating to see how these characters react to each situation presented. Sometimes we got humor, other times we got these incredibly complex and painful situations.  What makes things interesting is that we never knew what was going to come about, and that was the true test for Wes Anderson here.  It is a daunting task for a director to try and evoke so much humor, pain, sorrow, and ultimate redemption in one film, just ask Robert Altman, and Anderson does it masterfully here.  It is nice to see Anderson growing up and coming in to his own as a director. I enjoyed his previous Bottle Rocket, a very interesting film, but found it a little boring in stretches. With Rushmore, Anderson has created a masterpiece of a film that is an instant American classic.  Bravo!",Rushmore

His enjoyment of life comes from putting on plays and participating in other extra-curricular activities. No doubt, he presents himself as an intelligent person, but his grades are lacking. What do grades measure anyway. He has determination and heart. His pursuits in the game of love show his awkwardness and inexperience. He competes with millionaire Herman Blume for the affections of a 1st grade teacher. This is a great film about the two constants, the unobtainable and the one right in front of your nose. Bill Murray gives a performance similar to Groundhog Day, but much more subtle. Jason Schwartzman amazing as Max Fischer. And Olivia Williams makes a very convincing object of affection. Much better than her role in the Postman",Rushmore

Did Robin Williams's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" leave you rolling in the floor with laughter?Sure, Max is a jerk through much of the film, but he progressively matures from his experiences.  It's called character development.Yes, it is slow.  Thank God!  We can immerse ourselves, notice all the minute pleasures that make up every scene, the little nuances of pacing, scenery, and behavior - The split-second, uneasy expression that Miss Rosemary gives Max after she shakes his hand - Murray carelessly tossing golfballs into the pool  Ever noticed how the sky overhead matches the mood of the central character in the shot (sunny or gray)?  oh, I can go on and on. Really, it does merit several viewings.It's interesting reading the reviews of those who liked it.  They each mention something different - a different line, scene, twist on a theme.

The gorgeous visuals set a perfect backdrop for some of the greatest movie dialogue of all time.  Between the amazingly witty comments made by both Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) and Herman Blume (Bill Murray, in a truly Oscar worthy performance, he was unjustly robbed of a nomination), the producers implement some great, offbeat music that fits perfectly into the film.  This music accurately projects what Max is feeling, and it progresses as he does throughout the film, as we see just how far a young man will go in the name of love.",Rushmore

This character could have so easily been unlikable that it's almost with disbelief that I found myself sympathizing with him as his life began to tumble out of control. Bill Murray is perfect as Max's friend and father of two of his classmates. He is completely restrained and proves that he can act without having to play the fool. This film is funny because of the sharp observations it makes, if you want your comedy laugh out loud ridiculous then try something else. The music is great, fitting the mood perfectly and the plot moves along at a quick enough pace to keep you completely absorbed until the end. Superb, 9/10.",Rushmore

The movie is incredibly charming and funny. The nonchalant, odd humor is very entertaining and kept me laughing off my seat. Bill Murray is great and Jason Schwartzman also does a good job. The plot had some minor weak spots, but a very good character to it. I saw the Royal Tenebaums back in the theaters so I do not really remember it very much to compare, but I do not remember enjoying it as much as I did this.

366,AvantGardePineapple,"Directionless, but still charming.",8,15 July 2010,"The concept behind Rushmore is novel and the characters are well cast. The protagonist is a socially-awkward, lovable, pathological liar who falls in love with a private school teacher who's a bit too old for him.Rushmore is subtly hilarious. Much of the film's humor derives from Fischer's character flaws and the awkwardness of the situations in which he puts himself. Viewers accustomed to overt humor probably won't crack a smile, but more attentive viewers will crack a few good laughs.The soundtrack suits the naive nature of the protagonist and the film itself. By no means is it amazing, but it definitely works.The plot seems to meander a lot. The movie often feels more like a collection of marginally connected moments in Max Fischer's life than a coherent story.For most movies, a loose plot is a huge shortfall. But Rushmore is just too darn heartwarming and novel for this to matter much. In fact, I would argue that Rushmore actually benefits from it. Despite how the film meanders, Rushmore is still easy to follow, and the lack of direction seems to contribute to its charming naivety. I was never confused over what was happening; I was only ever puzzled as to where the film was going.Rushmore is a quirky, naive, and rather unimportant film. With this in mind, it's easy to see why people who take themselves too seriously would hate Wes Anderson's woefully neglected gem.",Rushmore

Max Fisher (Schwartzman) is a student who falls in love with Miss Rosemary Cross, a teacher at the university. This love is not only impossible because of the age difference, but also because Rosemary is widowed from her late husband of which she hasn't fully recovered from. But Max is a clever boy and tries to win her love with the help of the university's principle Herman Blume (Bill Murray). They're good friends and both have the same kind of humor. But when Herman meets Rosemary he falls in love with her too. Now the friends become rivals. This creates some very funny moments between the two of them. This movie is brilliant for it entire credits. The writing and directing is outstanding and the performances of the actors are nothing less. Schwartzman is so dedicated to his acting that you don't see him as an actor but as Max Fisher, the intelligent and devoted  student. Bill Murray again proves he's the king of comedy. His 'dry' humor, as we call it in Holland, is perfectly in line with the sarcastic humor of Schwartzman. It's the same sort of comedy as 'Wonder Boys'.

He inspires me to be a comedic director.I have to admit Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman make this movie, but it's Wes's attention to detail, his pacing and his timing that really makes this a great film.  The music, the editing and the production design are all very unique to Wes's style.I can't wait to see the next film, Life Aquatic to see how Wes does without Owen Wilson as a co-writer.

The movie is a bit surrealistic and sour but the humor is deep and when you think back about this movie you can remember lots of it's jokes like how the main character, Marx Fischer used Latin in his latest play. Bill Murray was just as great as in his other Anderson movies. If you're looking for a comedy where you laugh at every scene this is not the movie but as a surrealistic comedy the movie is great.

And this coming from someone who is adamant about not believing the hype.Rushmore is startlingly amazing, especially since the trend in recent comedies has been to appeal to an audience of 14-year-old boys by concentrating on bodily-function jokes, scantily clad, 20-year-old women, and a substantial lack of plot.  I haven't seen a movie this witty and hilariously subtle since ""Dr. Strangelove;""  the acting is terrific, the directing is impeccable, and the script trusts the intelligence of its audience; never once do you suffer through a drawn-out monologue or boring voice-over explaining what you already know to be happening.I've read comments from people who didn't ""get"" the movie, who couldn't understand what was even going on in the film.  This is a forgivable offense, because you can't really expect an audience that has been served with fast-paced, plotless action movies and brainless, puerile, obscenity-driven comedies to recognize a good story when they see one.

Rushmore is one of the best films of 1998 and is one of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the funniest. Rushmore re-teams the team who brought us the cult hit ""Bottle Rocket"" Rushmore focuses on Max Fischer, a student at the elite Rushmore private school. Max is the founder, president of literally all the after school clubs and extra curricular activites. He's president of the Backgammon club, edits the school yearbook and newspaper, and even has his own team of actors ""The Max Fischer Players"". But what this highly involved student doesn't have is good grades. He soon befriends a local millionnaire, who is played by Bill Murrary, in which he does a brilliant job portraying Mr. Blume. He deserves an Oscar nod. He also befriends and begins a crush on to the first grade teacher at Rushmore, Miss Cross. And so begins of the most funniest and entertaining movie love triangles. Rushmore is very well done, it's funny, it has a deep good script, you don't know which way it's going to turn. This is a great follow up to ""Bottle Rocket"".

The Story Centers on Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a 15 year old boarding school student who has cruised by on raw charm and the ability to 'play' on his raw talents.  His talents don't include your typical academic subjects, but rather the much more important life skills of making others believe in your ability to perform the impossible. This quickly turns to a quirky love story that pits the much older millionaire Herman Blume (Bill Murray) against Max for the affections of elementary school marm Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). It would be impossible to accurately explain all the clever twists, turns and lessons that both Max and Herman learn in their quest.  Just go see it!

Rushmore, the second film from writing team Owen Wilson and director Wes Anderson, proves that not only was the charm of Bottle Rocket not a fluke, but also that even the best can get even better. Watching Rushmore was an almost transcendent experience. This near perfect film works on every conceivable level, from the brilliant script to the incredible performances by all of the actors, all of which is directed with a flawless grace and style. Rushmore very well may be my new favorite movie. I can't wait to see what Wilson and Anderson come up with next.",Rushmore

This is what makes Rushmore wonderful. Every element of Rushmore made it a potential classic.  The wonderful directing could be seen through the many wonderful actors.  The editing was wonderful, dialogue intelligent and witty, and the cinematography turned an otherwise mundane setting and made it beautiful.  The techniques used are fresh and productive.  Anderson is a breath of fresh air to modern cinematic direction.  All intellectually redeeming characteristics aside, this movie was hilarious.  It is wonderful story that is expressed beautifully on film and I highly recommend it.",Rushmore

Bill Murray, does he have any funny lines through the entire movie? His character is one of the least developed, and unfunny roles in the film. His role could have been done by anybody. The title character, Max Fletcher, steals the show with his popular nerdiness.  It reminded me of the John Hughes films of the '80's...it was only missing Lea Thompson.

Bill Murray plays an unbelievably pathetic tutor to the even less believable pupil, Max Fliescher.  The roles somehow reverse, but that process is as ridiculous as the meaningless plays the Tom Cruise look-a-like, but wanna be Woody Allen creates.  The loud painful laughs that come from this story is due to the absurdity of the situations.  Would a steel tycoon sacrifice $8 million to build a love note to a less than compelling love interest?  What attraction was there in a widowed kindergarten teacher who showed so much disinterest? Only blind men would think there was any possibility of romance.",Rushmore
389,Sponger,Fun and Original,9,25 February 2000,"If you are looking for a unique, offbeat film with solid performances, wacky humor and random stuff thrown in just for kicks, then you have come to the right place.  Rushmore has a fun energy, which keeps things interesting, and enough off-the-wall scenes to make you marvel at the pure genius and creativity of it.  Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of Max is perfect as the likeable underachieving kid with extracurriculars coming out of his ears, and a desire to impress a kindergarden teacher by building her an aquarium that she doesn't want.  Bill Murray's acting is subtle which caught me by surprise, as I was expecting his usual flamboyance. He certainly delivers a solid performance here, but perhaps not as good as all the critical acclaim and hype would suggest.  The movie does appear quite disjointed at times (but this is probably the whole point) and it certainly loses some of it's comedic steam toward the end.  All in all, if you can handle the random, quirky humor, and appreciate the subtlety, you just may end up loving this highly original film.",Rushmore

Unfortunately, all this does not a good film make.  It's neither funny nor gripping.  Yeah, I smirked a couple of times, but it thought it was a lot funnier than it actually was and this irritated me.  Bill Murray looked like he didn't know what he was doing in the movie at all, and you didn't really care about any of the characters.  The main character was a dork without a cause and the teacher was a sweet English girl also without a cause.  I was disappointed.",Rushmore

The second half of the movie fell flat after a meandering, meaningless middle that had me checking how much time was left. For a 90-minute movie to drag on into what seemed like 3 hours is not a good sign, and Rushmore ranks as one of the bigger disappointments of the year.",Rushmore

Olivia Williams, let's hope more good movies come your way (does ""The Postman"" ring a bell for being bad?)  Try your pick at indies.  As for Bill Murray, bravo!  I loved it!

So anyway, I recommend RUSHMORE because there are a few interesting characters who do some interesting things. (And to boot, there's the beautiful, if not otherwise interesting, Olivia W..) Yes, Jason S. and Bill M. do good work and their parts are well written. Seemingly forgotten, however, is Seymour Cassel, who plays Max's father: ""Mr. Fischer was my father's name, call me Bert."" Though his is not a plot-pivotal role, the guy's a standout as the laid-back, ""hands-off"" neurosurgeon/barber. I like his style, interesting.

Director Wes Anderson inculcates this rich film with incredible depth, complicated relationships, and well-acted drama to complement its great comedic overtones. Jason Schwartzman is very good as Max, making him flawed but at the same time adorable, scandelous while seeming innocent. Herman Bloom must have been created for Bill Murray, because he plays him with incredible ability and understanding of the man's unique perspective.

The fact that you liked it so much that you'll probably see it again and again...etc, This certainly isnt one of those Bill Murray flicks such as GroundHog Day, that you would want to enjoy over again. No redeeming charactors...though not in and of itself a flaw; but c'mon, a late 40's man in a relationship with a 15 year old student...both competing for a teacher?

The only scene in the whole movie that made me even think of laughing was when Bill Murray tripped over a fence.  The rest of this horrible bomb made me more bored than Alec Baldwin at the Jerry Louis Marathon.  Rushmore is not funny, nor is it clever, entertaining? Please!  This film has made me question the brain capacity of the actor Bill Murray.  This film left a permanent stain on my brain, which I can't stop associating with him.

I like how it shows a bit of the classic wes anderson style without going overboard in my opinion it's the perfect balance. Jason Swartzman was really good as max fischer he bodied him perfectly. It's very impressive too because prior to rushmore he had no acting experience. I love the theme and the little things that kept coming up like with the curtains and how it kind of symbolized a new beginning or the end of something.

405,kristin_nfgrxb,Overall Excellency,10,27 December 2001,"Rushmore definitely goes onto my list of top movies.  It is truly a movie that the everyday person can relate to.  The plot itself isn't too outstanding, but you can see why it is such a brilliant film once you see it.The written aspect of ""Rushmore"" is so well done that it's impossible to watch it and think that what's going on in the film could never really happen in daily life.  This also brings attention to the character portrayals.  Everyone in the film does an excellent job with the mixture of comedy and drama seen throughout the film.Wes Anderson is, in my opinion, a really great director.  He doesn't make films that are mainstream and will be old and forgotten about years from now.  They may be little known films, but for those that have seen a film directed by Anderson, including ""Rushmore"", will not soon forget it.",Rushmore
406,Octoberan,Wes Anderson's prep school epic,10,29 January 2003,"Caution: There are some very, very minor SPOILERS, though I think anyone who has seen the trailer wouldn't be surprised.The beauty of Rushmore is how everything comes full-circle. However zany the schemes and witty the one-liners, Rushmore stands out in my mind (and as one of my favorite movies) with its true-to-life qualities concerning love and friendship. Over the course of the film, private school sophomore Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) and steel-baron millionaire Herman Bloom (Bill Murray) become friends, then enemies, then friends again, however uncertain their futures are, and the same for Max and his relationship with grade-school teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) and his chapel partner Dirk.
That is little to say about director Wes Anderson's now-trademark scripts (co-written with Owen Wilson) and style. Rushmore was one of the best, most original films of 1998, and prepared the public for his equally-excellent The Royal Tenenbaums. Over the course of his small filmography (also including 1996's Bottle Rocket), he has set the standard for his unparalleled mastery of the montage, most notably used in Rushmore to transition between the months of Max's sophomore year.As for the idea that Max Fisher is one of the most unlikeable characters ever conceived, I must note that I was fifteen when I first saw Rushmore, and I was reminded of myself in Max - sans the whole self-destruction and teacher-loving. So perhaps I can't understand the argument.I will openly admit that I didn't immediately praise Rushmore after my first viewing, and I urge nay-sayers to give it a second try. It is easily one of the finer American films made in the last five years, and it at least deserves some credit for its originality - something Hollywood always seems to be lacking.My score: Five stars - One of the very few five-star ratings I have given out.",Rushmore

The short story you heard it from the others, who didn't see this movie, must do! Because of the minimum of 10 lines, i shall tell you that you are about to see a clever boy that lives his true normality through the official life of an adolescent who has to live the school life, which is of course too formal, and his brilliant way of doing anything that is interesting will make a lot of troubles, and nevertheless being in love which will help him become what he needs to be in his life.

408,km1501,simply great,10,26 February 2002,"Max Fisher loves Rushmore. It is his life. He spends 99% of his time starting up clubs and putting on plays. He doesnt, however, spend enough time on his school work. He meets Herman Blume after attending a speech Blume gives at Rushmore. Blume is immediately taken by Max's ambition and the two become friends.Shortly after, Max falls in love with a teacher at Rushmore, Ms Cross. He gets kicked out of Rushmore because of his bad grades and subsequently turns his attention to her. She becomes his Rushmore. Unfortunately, Blume falls in love with her too.This movie is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece. Everything about the movie, from the acting, to the writing, to the direction are fantastic. Wes Anderson is a direction genius. His movies are very original, and still have a wide appeal. Anderson co-wrote this picture with Owen Wilson. The two also teamed up for Andersons' Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, in which Wilson co-starred.Jason Schwartzman, in his first role, is endearing as Max Fisher, an overachieving underachiever. Bill Murray takes a chance with Herman Bloom, a type of character he is not accustom to. Personally, I think he should have at least been awarded an Oscar nomination for this role, but the Academy turned a blind eye, much like they did with Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums. In any case, it may be the best role of his career. Rounding out the excellent cast are Olivia Williams(Ms. Cross) and Seymour Cassel(Max's dad, Bert).",Rushmore

I will not state this quote but once one has seen the movie they will understand the simple premise of such a remarkable screenplay.

This movies combines clever comedy with a beatiful love story with A GREAT story. Jason Schwartzman, who amazingly introduced his acting career in this movie, was phenomonal. He was smart, funny, and, at sometimes, loving. Bill Murray, who was nominated for many awards for his performance, just makes the screen light up when he is on it. Olivia Williams plays her charcter brilliantly, making the audience fall in love her, along with the characters. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson write a superb screenplay for this different, great, smart story. I forgot to mention the great sountrack, which happens to make mos of the movie.

All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. 'We like the same things - soup, snow peas, talking - and not talking.' I thought to myself 'what is this - some kind of weird porn movie?' And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.I looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it: Bill Murray and company and the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.I made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie: the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture, and not surprisingly either it's garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one, but it's pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters.

Although you could say this movie has a happy ending, if you have a smile at the end of the film, you're missing something.The characters are all disturbed on some level; Max, although giving the appearance of a mature young boy, really knows very little about life. Herman has the money and the house - but his kids are brats and his life is going nowhere. Rosemary is in love with the perfect man... but he is dead. Yes, this movie is funny, but I mean it when I say throughout the film I was on the verge of either bursting into laughter or tears.The movie is funny because it's true. The movie is sad because it's true. What you expect to happen and what you hope happen never really happen, because really this movie is about life. If you're the type of person who can see the humor and sadness in everyday life, you'll love this movie. It may not be uplifting, but it is reassuring. These characters - with what little they have - learn to be happier people. They learn to move on.Wes Anderson made a story that can encompass all these emotions in a relatively simply plot. Don't be fooled; a lot is going on here. Issues of love, social class, morality, and convention are all brought up.

Only its funny when it happens to Max Fischer, a pompous arrogant flunky attending a Prep School (Rushmore). Max then makes friends with Herman Blume, an entrepreneur who is going through his mid-life crisis and is miserable with his family. You watch how Max deals with expulsion from Rushmore and the ""betrayel"" from Blume.

Max Ficsher always tries to behave and talk like an adult. On the other hand, Herman who is actually experiencing the mid-life crisis sometimes behaves like a teenager. The fascinating aspect of Wes Anderson film is that you cannot find absolute definition for characters. His characters are of great complexity, and are perfect examples of the 'anti-gravity' parts of the human nature. And because of this, his behaviour, although seems absurd, but also shows his positive side: a young man trying to find acceptance and win respect, in spite of failing to get good grades. The definition of success is challenged by him.
Dramatic plots, polemic-style lines and the sad, embarrassing moments of the characters together compose this comedy-drama. When watching it, there are many hilarious moments, but a deeper sense of the frustrating obstacles also responds the viewers as we all experienced those emotional fluctuations. The embarrassing emotions and thoughts as a teenager are not a dreadful thing to avoid, but the treasure of the complex human nature.",Rushmore
423,Bones-5,"I GOT My Money Back, Pity I Couldn't Get The Time",1,21 July 1999,"This is the most awful movie I have ever had the misfortune to see.  It is also one of the few movies I have ever walked out on and asked for a refund. I actually left a group of friends sitting in the theater because I couldn't stand any more of the antics of Max Fischer and crew.  The theater didn't ask any questions, and returned my money promptly.  I hope never to have to endure another such movie in my lifetime.",Rushmore

They complement each other well. Boy, I am glad I am done with high school.  Maybe I'll start a backgammon club, though.",Rushmore
425,derek-19,"A rare, wholly original masterpiece",10,21 January 1999,"Rarely do we see such a brave and honest effort as Rushmore. Although the trailers and commercials are touting this film as a zany, off beat comedy, it is immensely more. What Wes Anderson has created is a film, that is true and from the heart.  What Anderson gives us in Rushmore is not only Bill Murray's finest performance, which he will boldly admit to, but a film that in 20 years will be looked back upon as a crisp coming of age story that is on the top a wicked comedy and at times a very somber look at growth.  Sure adolescence has been done before but not with such a gifted filmmaker at the helm. So on the day that Rushmore comes to your town do yourself an enormous favor and watch it, with ease.  Let this marvelous creation take you over like many have done.  You won't regret it.",Rushmore
426,GWHuntin,An Absolute Classic,10,7 August 1999,"Rushmore is probably the most unique film I've ever seen. It has a pace that's highly uncommon for a comedy, it's leisurely but never quick. Rushmore has deep, pensive moments, and it also has sequences that are downright giddy in their pleasant demeanors. A character like Herman Blume (Bill Murray), probably in his late 40's, speaks with the same amount of respect to our protagonist Max's young chapel partner Dirk, a boy no older than twelve. And with all of the respect that each of the characters has for the others, you'd hardly expect that Max would be such a hard boy to like. He's selfish, cunning, and occasionally downright mean. But what keeps us from hating Max is that all of his actions are driven by love. Love for his school and love for Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a first grade teacher at Rushmore Academy. As Max's relationships with both Miss Cross and Mr. Blume evolve, those two eventually fall for each other, sending Max into a kind of downward spiral that tests his lust for life and all of his friendships. Few dramas (let alone comedies) have the depth and power that every scene in Rushmore seems to give off like a scent.",Rushmore

It started out with plot potential, but the editing was horrible to the point of distraction.  I guess you could call it ""Something About Ferris""--but that wouldn't do justice to either of those wonderful films this movie copies from.  I gave it a ""4"" because there were some clever moments, albeit too few and far between.",Rushmore
431,Jim-241,Great second showing,8,4 February 1999,"Let me begin by saying that Bottle Rocket is one of my favorite films ever. And in Rushmore, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have again managed to create some of the best and most intriguing characters found onscreen today.  Their affection for a heightened sense of the bizarre serves as terrific gryst for the comedic mill and carries audiences through some of the slower parts of the film.  Bill Murray's hilarious yet subtle performance is truly deserving of all the praise it's received, making him a likely contender come Oscar time.  Despite the fact that it is a Disney film, Rushmore's dark, quirky sense of humor and unorthodox storyline give it a feel true to Anderson's indie roots.  I only hope that these filmmakers can keep their vision and creative integrity in tact despite all the attention being lavished on them because we need more movies like this.",Rushmore
432,Gorelust,Absolutely pathetic.,2,13 February 1999,"How is it this movie went directly to theatre and not to home video? While the humor had its upbringing moments, the overall plot and moral of the story was beyond me. Absolutely no climax or any trace of a story could be found in this film. People who got a kick out of movies like ""Angus"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" will probably like this. Also, another unfortunate element to add is the horrific display of acting by Bill Murray. This has to be his most atrocious film out of his brilliant career and hopefully he will not continue in this path.",Rushmore
433,Damewood,I wet myself,10,6 February 1999,This was the best movie I have seen in years.  Funny and insightful with a great performance by Bill Murray.  I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater for a long time.,Rushmore
434,Lyn-7,Talk about over-hyped!,1,21 July 1999,"I rented this film with high hopes.  As a teacher of film, I am constantly looking for new material to show my students.  This flick will NOT be one of them.  Although the actors put forth a fine effort (Bill Murray especially) they didn't have a script meaty enough to support their talent.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  The loose plot line and dweeby dialog (let me tell you no real high school student talks like that) made me wish for interactive video so that I could yell at these people to get a life. Frankly, I've see better student films (and these are HIGH SCHOOL student films).  I have found that the best movies have a clear goal, good writing, strong performances, and a director that knows what he/she is doing.  Since RUSHMORE has only one of these criteria, it's a wonder that it got made at all.",Rushmore
435,amol-2,John Hughes Redux Smash,10,13 February 1999,"A very brilliant movie and stunningly fresh. I could say dozens of things to praise it, but will mention only this: the strength of the script and execution. This film is perfectly conceived and engineered in such exceptional detail that almost every moment in film history is parodied in its epic breadth. Max Fischer inverts the conventional heroic form, a la John Cusack's role in Better Off Dead, to comic delirium. It's a coming-of-age story, but also a grand romance and hysterical caricature of standard film trope--the action movie, the love triangle, the 90210 story, the Horation Alger poor kid makes good, the bizarre genius finally recognized. The kid, a beaten up genius to have survived so long, is a hero you sympathize with for his weaknesses and by whom you are mesmerized in his moments of wild invention. All around him, including the exceptional Bill Murray, the film is jewelled with a rich array of eccentric, peculiar and delightful characters. The story isn't supposed to be believable; it's not a silly tear-jerking trash novel. It's a comic fantasy pushed into modern cinema's forms.",Rushmore
436,d-no,Please... make it stop...,1,26 January 1999,"I have to agree with anonymous of LA ... this is nothing more than an exercise in self-love gone from script to celluloid by writer/director Wes Anderson. Some quotes that should have gone into the promo's for this ... punishment: ""It started nowhere & went nowhere."" ""It provides a reason for advocating sensory deprivation."" ""I wanted to sever my optic nerve."" ""You'll wish the CIA had a machine that could alter memory so you could forget this experience.""",Rushmore
437,Raanve,One of my favorite films - ever,10,26 February 1999,"Having seen RUSHMORE 3 times now, I'm a little hurt and surprised that so many people seem to have disliked it. But I think what it's boiling down to is this: if you find sarcasm, deadpan, and subdued humor funny, then you'll laugh at RUSHMORE.  If you don't, you'll be bored. If you relate with Max's predicaments - feeling alienated from your peers, associating better with adults - and if you see some part of yourself at 15 in Max, you'll find him sympathetic, charming, and even lovable despite his flaws [which all good characters have].I, personally, have never walked out of a movie. (For starters, that's an expensive practice.) The worst I've done is turn off a film (NATURAL BORN KILLERS) which I had begun watching on cable because I was bored and I loathed it. While I was engaged with RUSHMORE... laughing, almost crying, glowing with wonder at the way this film is made, I know that there are people who didn't feel the same way. I think this film plays to a specialized audience, but even so, there are far worse films out there right now, with worse moral & ethical problems than cigarettes, and with a good deal less production value and care put into their making.Go see it if you think you'll like it. If you seem to identify with the people here who didn't, maybe you'd better save you $8 -- but anything can surprise you. Wes Anderson surprised me: long live RUSHMORE.",Rushmore
438,Matsfan,A truly original and entertaining movie.,10,7 February 1999,Rushmore is truly one of the most original and funny movies I have seen in a long time.  Max Fischer is the greatest high school character to come along since Ferris Bueller.  Jason Scwartzman and Bill Murray were outstanding in the leads.  I also credit Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson for creating a movie and characters that will live with me for a very long time.  I urge everyone I know to see this movie.,Rushmore
439,warhul,Wes Anderson & co. craft another winner,10,6 February 1999,"I find it interesting that opinions about Rushmore (and Bottle Rocket) are so polarized.  I'm beginning to think that I benefit greatly from being a cultural and temporal peer of Wes Anderson (and the Wilson Bros. et al) inasmuch as I ""get"" their characters and films on a level that ""outsiders"" can't hope to achieve.In other words, you had to ""be there"", or perhaps just be close enough in time and possibly geography, to appreciate the genius behind the creation of a Dignan or Max.It's tempting to think that Wes should try to appeal to more than offbeat American youth, but I sincerely hope not.If Wes keeps creating every few years, I'll go to the movies every few years.  Fantastic job on Rushmore!  While I enjoyed Bill Murray's role, give the Oscar to the kid.",Rushmore

Schwartzman and Murray are...WOW !  Any would-be actors should check out Murray's understated turn as Herman Blume (I knew with the first shot of the Blume family portrait that I was in for something great), a droll foil to Schwartzman's hyper, whacked-out Max Fischer.  I'm looking forward to his next work and as for Murray, this is the jump-start he badly needed; let's hope for more quality stuff from him. In short:  see ""Rushmore.""",Rushmore

443,Baden,A Major Disappointment,1,19 February 1999,"I anxiously awaited the release of this film as soon as the commercials hit tv. I hoped that finally Bill Murray had found another decent movie to star in, having already suffered the embarrassment of ""Larger Than Life"", the ridiculous elephant movie.   How wrong I was.  Where were the laughs?  How could something with such potential be so horrifically unfunny.  Bill Murray would be likable if he played a serial murderer who preyed on children, so I can't blame him - but somewhere along the way somebody forgot to put more than 5 minutes worth of humor in this overlong, horrendously unfunny dud. The characters were great, the premise lent itself to loads of humor, but still it comes up way short of comedy.  Almost a week later I still feel ripped-off and let down.",Rushmore

447,Dina dV-2,You've Gotta Have Heart,9,27 March 1999,"I haven't seen ""Bottle Rocket"" so my opinion of Wes Anderson as a filmmaker is solely based on ""Rushmore"" and what a wonderful film it is.Had it just been a cynical view of the ultimate outsider and his triumphs, it still would have been funny, but not nearly as resonant.  Max isn't an outsider because he wants to be, he just can't help himself.  He's a boy with too much potential, but without the resources to realize it. Initially, he plows through life saying and doing things without concern to those around him that he proclaims to care about.  He's heartless and cruel. It's only through losing all that he holds dear (Rushmore Academy and Ms. Cross) that he begins to evaluate himself.  He doesn't have any major epiphanies, or life-altering experiences, he just ""grows up"".It's in the third act that you realize how thoughtful Anderson is.  I won't give it away, but the final scenes are both unexpected, and the perfect ending to a story that doesn't just reward the outsider, but shows how, when given a chance, he can enrich both his own life and those around him.",Rushmore

The saving grace of this movie was Max's plays.  Bill Murray does a great job with his character.

I don't mind that to much, but the two main male characters who were attracted to this person were non-smokers.  The movie was not billed as being the type to have a smoking type of main character.

But seeing Rushmore on cable again made me do it.Rushmore is one of the most wonderful movies ever made.  It's a light movie. ""Light"" as in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" (the book, of course, not the movie).   Creating a light movie like this, to me, is the supreme form of the moviemaking art.The characters are wonderful, the direction is great, humor subtle and top-notch.  Still, not everybody will like this movie.  Some people just don't get it, or plain hate the main character, Max.  If you turn out to be such a person, you can always hit ""Stop"" on your VCR.  But who knows, this may well become one of your most favorite movies of all times.",Rushmore

457,bourgon,A drama and comedy on multiple levels,10,23 February 2000,"I had first seen this film with a friend at his house. We had rented it mainly because of Bill Murray's presence on the box. We were totally unprepared for what the movie had to offer us - at the end, my friend and I both looked at each other in a confused sort of stupor, scratched our heads, and shut the VCR off.After viewing this movie countless more times at home. After about the second episode, I realised that there was something far deeper, far more intricate to this story than the base plot. I was drawn in, perhaps hypnotised by the incredibly awesome soundtrack, and that served to stay my attention long enough so I could pick up some of the more subtle points.I had vouched to the said friend that I would not stop watching the movie until I 'Got It'. It was perhaps a month later before I could say I truly did. Imagine the writer piecing together bits and fragments of any number of surreal dreams he had, tied together with some obfuscated theme. Some of the events in the film - Bill Murray running like a madman from the playground after handing Miss Cross a note? - can only be explained as a result of this deduction. And I must say, it was a very good job.I can't say how many times I've been walking to or from class, and imagined myself as Max Fischer, cigarette in mouth, donning a bright green suit, with an air about him (myself) as would be that of a specter, or apparition. Who can tell what Max was thinking in his transitionary period? Vague and distant eyes looked out with disdain upon all they saw.This movie, without a doubt, changed my life. Kudos to the cast for a brilliant job on something they themselves may not have realized was going on; many more kudos to the writer. This is not a story about two men in love with the same woman. It is something far more.",Rushmore

The two central characters are acted superbly, Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic warts and all performance as Max and makes him truly likeable as a result, Bill Murray is just plain God. Add in a brilliant 60's Britpop soundtrack, superb character parts (Dirk, the Blume twins, Bert Fischer, the weird kid who's in every scene but never mentioned, etc) and truly original direction and screenplay and you have one of the best films ever made. People who don't 'get it' should be banned from cinema's.",Rushmore

Bill Murrey was once again his sure self and played the role with a great deal of black humor.,Rushmore
460,muujer,Filmmaking as it should be,10,4 June 2000,"Wes Anderson has created a masterpiece.  His writing and direction are nothing short of genius.  From his Holden Caulfield-esque Max Fisher to the frequently seen but never mentioned little boy, Anderson has created wonderful characters.  The unconventional script and brilliant performances have given movie lovers a rare treat.  Mark Mothersbaugh deserves credit too.  I had never heard a soundtrack that so perfectly matched a film.

Also, it is co-written by one of the funniest newcomers to the movie seen, Owen Wilson (who played in such movies as Shanghai Noon, The Cable Guy, and Bottle Rocket, which he also helped to write).

This is my advice to you, watch it over and over again, attention to the small details around the scenes, the furniture, the clothes, the children. I don't need to talk about all the great roles, the amazing soundtrack and the care of Wes Anderson to make everything seem to be so beautiful, funny, touching and perfect. This peace of art became easily my favorite movie. Thanks, Mr. Anderson.",Rushmore
465,nukem614,carpe dium (or however you spell it),10,14 May 2001,"I think that this movie is great because it addresses the old Latin phrase: Carpe Dium (or however you spell it). For those of you who don't speak Latin, this is what it means: Seize the day.  And that's what Rushmore's about.  It may be about rich snobs who will only settle for what they want, but in the end, it's about seizing the day.  Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) plays a kid who has a true passion: writing plays.  He may right plays that have certain elements that might not be appropriate for school (a bag of cocaine in Serpico) or things that might be nearly impossible to attempt (the gunfire and explosions in his Vietnam play) but he doesn't settle for ""It can't be done,"" he goes out there and does it.  Even if it means buying dynamite himself, he goes out there and does it.His seize the day attitude carries over into his love life also.  He falls in love with a teacher, and even though it's against school policy, and probably all moral values, he pursues her, just for the chance that she might say ""I love you"" back to him.  He convinces Bill Murray (who did a brilliant job in this film), who also loves her, to spend millions of dollars on something that might make her love either one of them.  It's a huge gamble, but Max's ""Won't Give Up"" attitude and charisma help him get whatever he wants.In the end, Rushmore is a definite rental, and probably a definite purchase (unless you really really hate it).  I can't wait to see what else Wes Anderson has up his sleeve.",Rushmore
466,battletard,So boring and bad,1,24 August 2006,"If you like plot, characters that make any sense at all and humor, this movie is not for you. The humor is not funny. The characters are boring (case in point: Bill Murray. Bill Murray doesn't act. He just looks frumpy and recites lines), or they are confusing: What's up with the protagonist? Is he a nerd? A social butterfly? A sociopath? A brat? I can't figure it out, and I don't care to, because my interest is not being maintained. Everything about this movie sucks. The plot is non-existent. It just goes from one damn thing to another. The only thing consistent about the movie is the feeling of confusing turmoil that wells up inside of you, and the question ""when is this crappy plot going to start?""",Rushmore
467,drparker-74525,Still perhaps Anderson's best,10,23 August 2020,"Though Wes Anderson has gone on to greater technical achievements in subsequent films, this remains something of a personal favorite of many, perhaps because it feels the most human of his stories. This role was pivotal in Bill Murray's reassessment as a great performer, the film gave us Jason Schwarzman, and Seymour Cassel turns in an endearing performance, as well.",Rushmore
468,blauvelt,"A Sweet, Provocative, Comic Parable of Life and Love",9,28 June 2001,"Rushmore is not easily categorized. To call it a romantic comedy, which, superficially, it is, would be misleading. Rushmore is a parable about trying to find one's place in life. Max Fischer is convinced that Rushmore (the school) is his place in life, and he devotes his entire being into embodying and personifying the spirit of Rushmore through extracurricular activities. However, his devotion causes him to entirely ignore his academic responsibilities, placing his very existence teetering at the precipice of expulsion. Somehow, he manages to maintain a sort of unstable equilibrium, until he is struck by unrequited love for a young, beautiful, widowed, new teacher. Rushmore is the metaphor for a nirvana-on-earth sort of self-actualization. For Max, his Rushmore is no longer the school, but this new teacher, from whom his infatuations are not returned.The story is beautiful and each character is, at once, sweet, tragic, and heroic. Rushmore examines love, friendship, rivalry, jealousy, rejection, reconciliation, and forgiveness.Some have criticized Rushmore for its unrealistic story and characters. True, it is by no means a mainstream Hollywood movie, and the story occurs in a world which is just a few degrees outside of our spatial-temporal dimension. Nevertheless, the characters, in their hopes and faults and emotions, are more real than you'll find in almost any typical tinsel-town production.",Rushmore
469,VladdyTrout,Genius,10,10 January 2010,"Rushmore is the best movie of that long ago decade known as the 1990s. I love the overall style of this movie, a style that has since become the standard for Wes Anderson movies.The visual style is brilliant: deliberate tracking shots, centered wide angle shots. The musical style: classic pop/rock music from the 1960s and 1970s. The acting style: quirky and understated.I have watched Rushmore many times and am never bored. Rushmore is like its main characters, Max Fisher and Herman Blume, in that it is equal parts genius, melancholy, lonely, and, ultimately, sweet.Rushmore is highly recommended.",Rushmore
470,JMan409,A priceless noir treasure...,10,10 September 2001,"Wes Anderson's underrated cult classic is a film that holds its ground after repeated viewings. Instead of one growing tired of Max's antics and a brilliant British Invasion soundtrack, one learns to appreciate these often subtle beauties of a often misunderstood film.  The characters are well written, the chemistry is real, and the irony is wonderful.  Everyone  can in some way relate to Max, whether it be through betrayal, over-achievement, or a broken heart, there is something for everyone.  And the soundtrack, one of the greatest from a 90's film.",Rushmore

With a deft mixture of reality and surrealism, Anderson and Wilson present a funny, sad, and deeply poignant film about growing up and being human.

But Jason Schwartzman captivates the audience by his tasteful performance, really making the film.

The characters are entertaining and complex. Each personality in the story has a mosaic of eccentric traits.

480,ahx_kubrick_52,A Beautiful Film.,10,28 June 2002,"I find Rushmore to be one of the greatest films ever made, and by far my favorite work of art by the genius Wes Anderson. What makes him a genius? When he's writing and directing, nothing holds him back. Every little detail that comes to mind, you better believe its going into the film. What I like most about his movies though, especially Rushmore, is the replay value, the ability to watch it again and get the same level of entertainment out of it. What's so neat about Rushmore is his little random scenes that may not have alot to do with the story, but help build character and such. One example is where Mr. Blume is drunk and walks up and does a cannonball off the diving board in his budweiser trunks. The way that the scenes jump on and off topic in the movie is just great. It's so fun to watch. The story that Anderson and Wilson created is probably one of my favorites. I don't know whether to call it a intelligent, witty, deep comedy or simply a coming of age story. I guess it's both. Regardless, if you haven't seen this movie, you're seriously missing out if you have yet to see it. Wes Anderson even puts the exactly right camera angles on people's faces during dialogue to get the best idea of the character. All the characters in his movies come so alive it's scary. Bill Murray shows his ability to play a somewhat dramatic role and still carry the witty humor to the screen which he is so highly regarded for. I can't find a single flaw in this movie. If you rent or buy the DVD, get the Criterion edition.If you only do one more thing for the rest of your life, see Rushmore. It's an entertaining, heartwarming, funny, mood-rising film about relationship.10/10.",Rushmore
481,orozcofranz,Holy Crap !!!,10,4 April 2008,"When Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson put their heads together, do not expect plain old brainstorming. Expect a hurricane of theatrical proportions that drops an ocean of legendary imagery. In its aftermath you can find the pieces to a great monumental movie that only its creators could assemble so perfectly. And Anderson takes charge indeed in this modestly underrated tour deforce. Full of wit, hilarious lines, chemistry, sincerity, subliminal messages, betrayal, vengeance, and kite flying, Rushmore seems to have it all. It stands as their second prodigy-child, a brilliant masterpiece that paves the way for The Royal Tenenbaums.Rushmore is the story of Max Fischer, a nerdy, yet courageous, fifteen-year-old genius with unstoppable determination. Unfortunately his overachievement leads to an overload of extracurricular activities and bad grades that will threaten his greatest passion, attending Rushmore. With impeccable handwriting that matches his hairdo and exemplifies his demeanor, young Max is driven by a rush of testosterone to conquer a beauty twice his age, Ms. Cross. Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, a steel tycoon that finds inspiration in Max and soon enough, falls for Ms. Cross. Consequently, the story takes a dive into an unwieldy love triangle that turns into a superfluous war and ironically ends with a play of the Vietnam War.Max's greatest virtuosity is staging elaborate high school plays which add another dimension to the film as they are presented to the viewer randomly. They intriguingly echo the movie's itinerary as much as the soundtrack does. Never has a movie's score been so exquisitely choreographed. It almost feels like a musical without the excessive corniness. Together, it all meshes perfectly to glorify the tenacity and leadership required to create something as grand as a play or a movie. That's why Rushmore could very likely be a self-portrait of its own creators. Either way, Anderson provides us with a poetic look at achievement, glory, and the power of theater.The directing and the writing seem to go hand in hand; this seems logical since Anderson does both. But there is an impervious intention to make them cohesive, like written poetry complementing the grace of a painting. His shots are composed elegantly, balanced, and sometimes symmetrical. Panoramic fisheyes introduce a setting and strong close-ups emphasize moments of beauty or climatic emotion; i.e., when Bill Murray's character falls in love with Max's girl. Another camera trick is used to emphasize Max's immaturity. The already small actor, Jason Schwartzman, is cropped in such a way that he looks tiny. Anderson makes his intentions clear when Max is conversing with Ms. Cross about their age difference making it impossible to have a relationship; this is also one of the wittiest scenes in the whole movie.Anderson's opus could not be what it is without the amazing cast. The three strung-out characters are played so vividly and with a rawness that contrasts heavily with the inflated acting of Max's plays. However, the director's eloquence pulls through and seems to illuminate every bit of the film. Every line just seems perfect. The solid acting allows the characters to permeate the audience while giving performances that stay with you for days. There are a few moments of stark deliberation to leave the audience modestly uncomfortable and a bit provoked, every cinematographer's dream, right? Being familiar with Anderson's technique does make for the dry humor and awkwardness to be a lot more digestible. But even the newbies will find the overflow of references to handjobs by the second half of the movie to be surprisingly comfortable.Again, the performances make Rushmore unforgettable. Bill Murray liked the script so much that he almost did it for free. An actor of this caliber did so much with so little playing a man of few words, relying more on gestures and a powerfully austere presence. Always drunk or smoking and very depressed, Murray adds to the character with improvisations throughout the film. Following the same natural technique is Jason Schwartzman, making it hard to believe that is not himself on the screen. The kid is only seventeen and plays his first movie with such confidence and authenticity that even at times outshines a veteran like Murray. Attention is paid to the smallest nuances: the scratching of the nose when a good repartee is required. Finally, Olivia Williams plays the love interest that keeps her cool through most of the film. She sure is a catch, excessively honest, lovable, and a bit naive. The rest of the cast is also quirky and perfect.The ending is powerful; almost tear jerking, as the curtains drop and the perfect song with the perfect lyrics seals the deal. You can but stare at the credits as a feeling of nostalgia rushes through, leaving behind a cocktail of emotions certainly worth the taste.",Rushmore
482,philippe-ajoux,Glorious,10,18 December 2008,"This is an amazing film. I originally watched this several years back. I was quite a bit younger then but still appreciated the film. However, I just re-watched this movie and felt compelled to say how simply amazing it was. I don't know how to describe it, but I just related to this movie so well. It's just like the great novels you read in high school. You hate them and find them pointless (In my case) at the time. But, fast-forward 4-5 years and suddenly it all makes sense. I still don't like Tenanbums as much, but perhaps that just because of bad experiences. I will have to give it a re-watch too. This review doesn't really do the movie justice, nor does it really explain anything at all. In fact, all I wanted to say was that I liked this movie.

483,rushmore0,This movie is completely brilliant,10,9 October 2003,Wes Anderson's Rushmore is the closest thing to a perfect film that I have ever seen.  Few films create such a powerful response as this.  Rushmore's unique story and quirky humor make it truly one of a kind.  It's so beautiful and sad and wonderful and happy.,Rushmore
484,StevenRaia95,Repeated Viewings of Rushmore Made High School a Little Easier to Tolerate,10,8 January 2012,"After my first viewing of Rushmore, I was a little puzzled as to why I enjoyed it so much. I was wonder struck by the whimsical direction by Wes Anderson, the genuine and heartfelt performances by Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams, and the bizarre yet warm screenplay written by Wes and his college companion, Owen Wilson. However, after the credits rolled and ""Ooh La La"" by the Faces (the soundtrack also won me over) slowly faded out, my perception of why the film was so emotionally compelling was unclear.I watched Rushmore for the first time during the summer between my freshman and sophomore year. It was ideal timing, as the film opens with the protagonist, Max Fischer, entering his sophomore year at the esteemed Rushmore Academy. Max is a precocious, clever, somewhat of a wunderkind fifteen year old. However, as you find out in the opening of the film after his fantasy of ""solving the hardest geometry equation in the world,"" we learn that the Rushmore Yankee isn't the brightest student at the academy. In fact, the only reason he is able to keep attending Rushmore with his failing grades is because he joins almost every club Rushmore has to offer -- and in most cases, is the president, captain, or leader of a majority of those extracurricular activities.After analyzing Max, I began to recognize why ""Rushmore"" was so effective for me, to the point that I established it as my all time favorite movie. Max is the most identifiable character in any film that I have ever encountered in any of the films I have ever seen (even though I'm young, I've seen a lot of them). Max is an outcast, a social reject. He does poorly in math, has the gusto to write, produce and direct school plays (""I WROTE A HIT PLAY!!!""), and is, in some measure, a compulsive liar. He is a lot like me. This has become more true as I grow older and am placed into harder math classes. He dresses unlike his classmates (sporting a blazer with a Rushmore emblem, the only one in the crowd to don one), and talks with a pompous, almost pontifical vocabulary. One of his attributes that I most related with is his apprehension about the future. I have never identified better with a film character before I witnessed the fanciful world of Max Fischer.I know this review is more of an analysis of the main character, but I would only feel guilty to give more of the plot away of this terrific gem. I think even as I grow older, even older than Max himself, I will still look up to his high self esteem and exuberance to take on the impossible. In high school, it is easy to be without these characteristics. But only after repeated viewings of Rushmore, and learning lessons from my favorite movie character of all time, Max Fischer, I feel more and more as if I am watching a film that was written about me. I secure great comfort in knowing that, in the end, I will triumph just like Max.Rating: 10/10.",Rushmore
485,hookecho21,A classic film,10,27 May 2003,"An absolutely brilliant film with a most wonderful final scene. This film possesses intelligent humor, dynamic characters, and clever dialogue. A touching film on many different levels. Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums have brought a fresh face to American movies.",Rushmore
486,tgfilm,Sincerity Counts,9,28 December 2011,"I wasn't planning on this. I liked Bottle Rocket plenty, but was aware that Wes Anderson was a divisive director and that Rushmore would represent a very possible peak for his style. I was also aware that if I liked this movie, or, gasp, loved it, I would never escape the cloud of hipster-ism that would surely pop out of nowhere and provide woeful narration for the duration of my life. And yet... I loved it. Yup, I'm pretty sure that I loved Rushmore.Now, I'm pretty sure I didn't like Max Fischer much at all. I mean, he's a little endearing, but also remarkably sinister, and oddly dark for a comedy. But then, Rushmore isn't like most comedies. I've been working on a rather far-fetched theory that the most enduring comedies all stem from an inner darkness, or depression (see Louie, Burn After Reading, etc.), and Rushmore certainly works that angle. Although Max and Herman's antics create a lot of comedy, they're rooted in an obsession (or is it devotion?) for love--Rosemary. She calls them children, I'll call them innocent--Herman obviously identifies with Max for his idealism and his spark, his imagination and his wit, and above all he identifies with Max's courage. Herman's cannonball is laugh-inducing, but also some form of suicide, some form of drowning. He's feeling a little lonely, and he wants to escape. Max's attempts to impress Rosemary are less depressed, but they reveal a manic and willful distortion of expectations and human interaction--he's a deeply disturbed little person, redeemed by a wild imagination and a frightening ability to love. Think of his obsessions before Rosemary: Rushmore, and his plays. And think of his explanation for going to Rushmore: ""my mother saw my play and thought I should go to Rushmore."" That must be grief, right? Max's infatuation with Rosemary is a deeply uncomfortable plot device for a movie like this to carry on with, but it works because it all contributes to catharsis. Like the part in the play where the train zooms by, many significant moments in the movie are drenched in sound and represent a release--Anderson loves his songs, but they're also background noise to disguise the intensity of the movie, rather than to simply amplify it. Max's love of Rosemary also sets into motion him finally getting over his mother's death, and accepting his father's identity--Rosemary is similarly afflicted with a devotion to a dead person. And when Max identifies ""a dead fingernail"", he's come to terms with something inside him as well. One of my favorite interactions in the movie is when Margaret Yang interrupts him, and she reveals that she fudged her experiment results: ""It didn't work. I thought it would, but it didn't, so I faked the results."" Or something of that nature. In the end, Rushmore is about fakery, and about spectacle, and about how real life doesn't operate that way. But it's also about embracing that honesty (even in fakery) and allowing it to guide a person to maturity and acceptance. For a movie often derided as all style, Rushmore carries so much substance it kinda hurts.",Rushmore

Jason Schwartzman does a magnificent job in his first feature film. Although it's 2015, this movie is never old. It's one of those flicks that really connect with anyone viewing. Bill Murray brings a stunning witty character on this film. Let's talk about the soundtrack. My favorite part in this picture is the scene where Max drops out of the public school he's forced into and I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones plays over the montage.

Rushmore is quirky beyond most and its story is told with such an eye to detail that every viewing allows us a new experience. I saw this in the theater and laughed very hard. Later i purchased the VHS and watched it by myself. I cried all the way through hoping to meet people in real life like Max Fisher and Mr. Blume if only to show them this movie and to tell them to keep following their quirky dreams. I understand that I'm rambling so I'll get to the point. This movie is a multi-layered dark comedy that inspires. The characters are incredible and the visual style of Wes Anderson teamed up with the comedic writing of Owen Wilson has produced one of the best films of all time. Many years from now this movie will start popping up on all sorts of best of lists (already Martin Scorsese has named Wes Anderson as the next Martin Scorsese). It is my all time favorite movie so give it a look.,Rushmore

Bill Murray is such an anemic schlub that it's difficult to believe he could win the heart of any woman regardless of how many millions he throws their way. Yuch Yuch Blech. Olivia is attractive, but not enough to sit through two hours of this unrealistic, annoying film. The ""O. R. you"" line is classic, but it's really the only good line in the film, and everyone already saw it in the previews.

Democrat or Republican. Cats or Dogs. Fifteen years later, Rushmore still holds up (and, has the power to define who we are). Yea, it's that deep. OK, not really.

491,Ilovepandas,One of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing!,10,14 November 2005,"When I first saw this film almost a year ago I was amazed. I was immediately entranced with the main character, Max Fischer, and the movie itself but I just couldn't tell exactly why. I watched it several more times that week and was able to place it. Max speaks like an adult with a teenager's sensibility and judgment. He is completely endearing and wonderful as a character. I'm convinced that no one could have played him better than Jason Schwartzman does.This is not to say that he is the only character that stands out. He is just the one that does so the most. Bill Murray as Mr. Herman Blume is absolutely hysterical. He just plays the part so well, making you believe a man of his age could be friends with a boy of Max's age. Olivia Williams as Ms. Cross adds a certain sensibility and kindness to the role at the beginning but is able to be as harsh as she needs to be later on. I could talk about all of the actors and what wonderful jobs they did but let's just say they all did great and move on (excluding the twins who played Ronnie and Donnie, they acted poorly, but it worked for their characters).The next thing you have to take into account for this movie is the soundtrack. It is absolutely astounding. It captures every moment in the movie perfectly. The songs licensed for the movie were obviously chosen carefully. The score that was recorded for the movie is phenomenal. It's quirky and different and fits the mood like a glove.The last thing I want to talk about is Wes Anderson. Here he proves himself as an excellent filmmaker. This screenplay he produced, with the help of Owen Wilson, is excellent. This movie is infinitely quotable. Not to mention his work as a director. This movie is superb on every level. I guess the only thing left to talk about is the cinematography. It's nothing new or inventive but there are no useless, ugly, or misplaced shots. Some of the shots are quite nice actually.With it's clever wit, loads of heart, and comedic timing this movie is immediately endearing. However, I have found that for some it takes repeat viewings to understand the glory of this film. So if you didn't like it the first time, please I implore you, try it again. One last note, anyone who only cares for normal Hollywood big-budget fodder need not apply. This is more of a thinking man's movie. 10 out of 10.",Rushmore

Boy, was I wrong about that!Summary: I'm sad because I will never get back these 93 minutes of my life.

If someone asks me what was that movie about, I don't know what to tell them. The pace of the story was too slow for me which I think goes back to the fact that there was really nothing to the story to be narrated. I like the feeling and the vibe of Wes Anderson's movies in general and I don't mind them not having a strict and tight plot that follow a typical storyline arch including beginning, middle, and an end, as long as there's a underlying theme that help the viewers connect the dots. Unfortunately, Rushmore lacked that. I should probably say that I am a big Wes Anderson fan and after seeing some of his more recent films, I decided to go back and watch all his movies in the order they were made to study his evolution as a director. I probably I had very high expectations.",Rushmore

The cast is perfect and I can just make 1000 compliments to Bill Murray; well he is really a good actor, really convincing and extremely funny.The story is very emotional but in some way exaggerated too but I think ""exageration"" is typical by Wes Anderson especially the way he develops characters, their decisions and reactions. Max Fisher is ""exagerated"" in everything he does, in good and bad things too. He is maybe a loser (just like the former genius-kids in The Tennenbaums) but he still has the chance to become someone.

I LOVED Bill Murray in this movie. You actually FELT the mans pain. An unfulfilling marriage, sons that failed to meet any equitable standards. Who comes to be befriended by Max Fischer.

I feel as though Rushmore is cinematic excellence, Max Fischer is the perfectly flawed yet absolutely brilliant character who tries to find his place in the world, whether it's by engrossing himself in extracurricular activities or pretending he's the son of a neurosurgeon. All of the characters are finely tuned, Herman Blume is a successful man who feels worthless, Miss Cross is a brilliant woman who feels only sorrow because of the loss of her husband. But it is their flaws that make them so wonderful, they aren't boxed into labeled packages, they are raw and real human beings who are just trying to survive. This movie is about, as Max says, finding out what you love and doing it for the rest of your life. The camera angles in this film are interesting, connecting you to the environment and the characters. Wes Anderson picks the perfect music for each scene, especially for the heartbreaking scene at the end when Miss Cross and Max are dancing to the Faces ""Ooh la la."" But, what's most brilliant about Rushmore is how it makes you feel; pessimistic yet hopeful, sad yet joyful, confused yet clear-minded. A good movie makes you think but a great movie changes your perspective on the world and this is what Anderson has done. To quote Cousteau, as Miss Cross did in the Diving for Sunken Treasure book, ""When one man, for whatever reason, has the opportunity to lead an extraordinary life he has no right to keep it to himself,"" and I'm glad that Wes Anderson created such an extraordinary movie and shared it with us all.",Rushmore
498,callabofly,The paths of glory lead but to the grave.,10,27 October 2005,"There is a dark, sad and subtle indifference to reality in the last three great Wes Anderson movies, ""Life Aquatic"", ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""Rushmore"". Each take a depressing, yet excitingly hilarious, look at near-impossible real-life situations with an onslaught of genius characters and stunning visuals.Consider Rushmore a painkiller -- that overdoses the viewer with so much of life's pain that it begins, and eventually does, feel great. You almost feel bad about watching it. It makes too much sense, it appears too clear, and it reminds you too much of yourself.Max is clever and sad. Blume, clever and sad. Cross, clever and sad. This repetition of raw human traits makes the humor and beauty found in ""Rushmore"" that much more irresistible and sustaining. ""Rushmore"" represents a movie with a 'real' reality in its underpinnings.And as for the humor, you must be acceptant of it subtleties. A word, a look, a motion. Anything within this movie's frames can be viewed as hilarious. Any and everything. No joke. It seems the only reason negative feedback from this movie is brought about is that the viewer can not exactly figure out what they ABSOLUTELY LOVE about this film, so they revert to criticism.This movie is fantastic. It is sad. It is deeply depressing. It is hilarious.It is beautiful....and don't get me started on the supporting cast...they are ferociously amazing.",Rushmore
