0,TheLittleSongbird,Canine and Japanese love letter,9,25 April 2018,"Love animation and a lot of the cast (some of them Wes Anderson regulars). Really appreciate dogs and Japanese culture. There are examples of great films that mix comedy, drama and allegory. The concept really intrigued me. And Wes Anderson has an unmistakable, unique and very interesting style that appeals to me.'Isle of Dogs' looked incredible from how it was advertised and it is generally one of the best received films of the year, one of the highest rated on here as well. So along with the things mentioned in the above paragraph, it quickly became one of my most anticipated films to watch and high up on my need to watch list. Watching it, 'Isle of Dogs' became high up in my favourites of the year so far and towards the top as far as Anderson's work goes.Perhaps 'Isle of Dogs' is a little too exposition heavy (mostly very interesting but sometimes a little rambling) at times, with it not getting going straight away. Also found some of the female characters underused and not explored enough. A primary example being Nutmeg.However the animation is truly splendid, full of rich detail in the backgrounds and little things, quirky and nuanced character design and vibrant colours. The music score is beautiful, energetic and whimsical, while the direction is full of Anderson's creative, distinctive and unique trademarks. Writing is full of dry wit and has emotion and charm, probing thought too. The story is unconventional but always involving, with its fair share of entertaining moments, poignant drama (the emotional core of the story is truly touching and with a lot of charm), its affectionate and tender portrayal of dogs and intriguing political elements without it being preachy. The Japanese elements are charmingly and creatively handled, not in a biased way. Even with the quirks, there's also a maturity to how everything is done and told. Characters are cute and offbeat while all of the voice acting is spot from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum and Frances McDormand.Overall, great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Isle of Dogs
1,SnoopyStyle,unique vision,7,7 July 2018,"In the city of Megasaki, Japan, Mayor Kobayashi has banished all dogs to Trash Island fearing an outbreak of dog flu. Scientist Watanabe insists that he will soon have a cure but he is ignored. Atari Kobayashi flies to the island to search for his dog Spots. The boy is an orphan and is a ward of distant uncle Mayor Kobayashi. He is assisted by 5 dogs who voted to help him find Spots. Tough street dog Chief refuses to have a master and is the only to vote no. They go on a journey while the cat loving mayor is planning a final solution.Director Wes Anderson returns to stop-motion animation after Fantastic Mr Fox. While I've loved his movies, his stop-motion stuff is problematic personally. His deadpan structured filming style leaves me feeling tired from repetition. In live action, I can get involved with the actors but I'm less connected with these artificial figures. I did laugh several times for the first half but like before, the style does wear down on me slightly. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable and darn it, I laughed. It's fun while it lasts.",Isle of Dogs
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Close to masterpiece, shines more and more the longer it runs",8,26 May 2018,"""Isle of Dogs"" is a new American animated movie and the most recent work by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Wes Anderson. He is the sole director of these 100 minutes and for the script he collaborated with his regulars Coppola, Schwartzman and Nomura. A bit unusual for me to see Schwartzman credited here for once, but not voicing any of the characters. Anyway, to let you know what direction this review is heading, let me say that I felt this is by now among the very best films of 2018, animated or non-animated. Not sure it can make a big impact during awards season though, not just because of the release, but also because the animation and style and story could be something the Oscars will perhaps not warm up to. Nonetheless, it can be an underdog (no pun intended!) for a nomination in Best Animated Feature, but for the win, sadly I think it just won't happen and this film is not mainstream enough I am afraid, not that mainstream is bad by definition though There's many excellent mainstream animated films out there, also in recent years, like Frozen as the prime example. But back to IoD now. There is an incredible amount of depth and attention to detail in here. Early on, I was not entirely convinced, but the longer it went, the more I enjoyed the watch and appreciated the occasional strike of Anderson's genius. If you have seen some other works by him, you will be able to easily identify his approach, most of all of course his unique mix of set decoration and camera angles from way above, that is really visible all the time and he transitioned successfully from live action to animation and I have no doubts that his way back to live action will be a huge success too. But also the characters and their mannerisms and the way they act feel very Anderson constantly. Of course, one look at the cast list is enough to know that something really special is about to happen here too, perhaps the best cast of 2018 and I will not mention all the names now, you can see them yourselves, but of course the likes of Yoko One show how prestigious this project is like several others. It's a film about dogs. Yes and no. Dogs are at the center of the story here, but it could have been cats too with some alterations to the script of course. The dogs are really humanized on many occasions, to the extent that when they get little dog snacks or fetch sticks, they are back to their essence and these make a comedic impact already. But it's never about dogs entirely, more all about everything that surrounds them. Another thing I found interesting was the way the cats were depicted here: They are admired, but they are not loved or treated in a caring way, which would feel far more precious to them than spectacular statues or symbols on necklaces. There is no affection for cats, they are just symbols for power, nothing like the affection the little Japanese boy shows for the dogs in his life.Another scene I'd like to mention is the young American girl when we hear her talk about the boy's endeavor and how she starts speaking like an adult, but eventually returns back to children's speech. That is also from the trailer and just one of many moments that add an incredible amount of charm. Anderson is an outstanding writer and it constantly shows. This is especially impressive as this is a film about different cultures and how he catches the essence there in terms of how he elaborates on Japanese traditions, culture and lifestyle in general is nothing short of impressive. And one very specific example of good writing is that they may have included a plot twist that the dog at the center could actually be the one the boy is looking for, but this would have happened in a weaker movie, maybe a Disney movie, but instead they took the path of a very credible brother story. As for the last 40 minutes of the film perhaps, when the adventure reaches its peak, it is where the film is definitely at its best. Every scene is a winner basically and I could write a whole book about these. But I'll leave them to you instead and avoid any summaries and interpretations. Let me say that it's just incredibly smart and there's no way you are not gonna find anything new during a rewatch. I am pretty certain I will watch the film again at some point in the not so distant future, maybe with somebody who has a special fascination for that cultural context who is about to mean a lot to me. Completely aside from that, it is a film that is far more suitable for grown-ups than for young kids, a prime example of how this applies to animation on many occasions too, for example the Wasabi murder scene that has Anderson pull through with the drama, but also the scenes in which he is about to kill off all the other stray dogs, apart from the one in the center and how he gets them back in a manner that is as hilarious as realistic. Realism is one of the film's strongest components too I would say, a great success there given the subject of talking dogs and how far it is set in the future. Quite a challenge and Anderson once again delivers masterfully. The stop motion style is also executed close to perfection, it all fits so well together. And finally, the comedy is also a huge success with some brief but charming references like the girl interpreting near the end what she wants the boy to say and how he looks at her. Probably the cutest moment of the entire thing. And the best is really how the film manages to make an emotional impact without trying (hard) to do so at all. Yes there's pups, but that's not what it is about. So unless you really despise (stop motion) animation, go watch this film. It oozes creativity and wit and it's probably my favorite Wes Anderson film at this point from what I have seen. Competent execution in every area really, I applaud everybody who worked on it and thanks for bringing us theatrical experiences like this one here. Highly, highly recommended.",Isle of Dogs
3,Prismark10,More than just a shaggy dog tale,8,8 February 2019,"I have become quiet a fan of Wes Anderson. He makes beguiling, interesting films with a blend of comedy and quirkiness. At least his films do not emerge from a sausage dog factory.Even his deadpan stop-motion animation has a charm a world away from Disney.Set in Megasaki, Japan, a dystopian society in the future. There has been an outbreak of dog flu. The corrupt dog hating Mayor Kobayashi has banished all dogs to to toxic garbage filled Trash Island, beginning with his household dog.All this despite scientist Watanabe insisting that a cure is imminent. He is a lone dissenting voice in the wildernessThe household dogs in Thrash Island are living a miserable life. They are sick, starving, unwashed and unloved.Little Atari Kobayashi is a 12 year old boy who was taken in as a ward by his distant relative, Mayor Kobayashi. Spots was his guard dog but he was more like his pet. He has flown in to Thrash Island looking for Spots.He finds a ragtag bunch of five dogs who tend to beat off other dogs for food. Four of them like to gossip and vote on important matters. They are just house pets now doing their best in these hard times. They are helped greatly by stray street dog Chief. The best fighter in the pack and who refuses to obey any master.The four dogs vote to help Atari in his quest, Chief is outvoted as always. While they search for Spots, the Mayor is planning to exterminate all the dogs in the island.There is a lot of dry wit in this film as well as a few sweet songs. It is whimsical and dark. If you replace the dogs with humans you can sense Anderson is making a point about how western societies are viewing refugees and immigrants these days.",Isle of Dogs
4,kosmasp,"Funny and light, still a bit dark",8,5 July 2018,"There are hints of darker and I guess you could say more disturbing things in this (I mean if you put animals/people in one place with no way to escape, a survival fight is inevitable and the movie acknowledges that). But you have to look for those things. Still I wanted to point that out, just in case some may have thought this is just fun and games.But I do think, this is also what makes this great. It may seem like it is aimed at the little ones, but it has more than enough fodder for the big ones. And it is really funny too. If you are an animal lover (dog person), you won't need any convincing anyway. The title alone speaks for you ... it's a nice wordplay and it's a nice movie too",Isle of Dogs
5,lee_eisenberg,Canine you dig it?,7,16 December 2018,"I've liked every one of Wes Anderson's movies so far, and he's turned out another interesting one with ""Isle of Dogs"". The movie has drawn controversy for its depiction of the Japanese and embrace of the white savior trope (as the foreign exchange student calls on the townspeople to stand up to their crooked leaders), but it functions as an allegory for demonization of minorities, as the mayor vilifies the canine population to hide his corruption.The movie follows Anderson's modus operandi by centering the action and creating quirky characters. Along with Anderson regulars Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Jeff Goldblum (and occasional cast members F. Murray Abraham, Bob Balaban, Harvey Keitel, Frances McDormand and Frank Wood), we also have the voices of Bryan Cranston, Greta Gerwig, Scarlett Johansson, Yoko Ono, Liev Schreiber, Fisher Stevens, Courtney B. Vance and Ken Watanabe. It's not Anderson's best movie, but I still recommend it.",Isle of Dogs
6,jboothmillard,Isle of Dogs,8,7 April 2018,"I knew I was going to love this movie as soon as I saw the trailer, not just because I love movies featuring stop-motion, e.g. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Chicken Run, but also I am a fan of director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Grand Budapest Hotel), and he did such a good job with his previous animation movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox, so I couldn't wait. Basically in a dystopian near-future Japan, a dog flu virus, known as ""snout fever"", has spread throughout the canine population. In Megasaki City, authoritarian and dictatorial Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) signs a decree, banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite scientist Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito) insisting he is close to finding a cure. The first dog to be transported to Trash Island is Spots (Liev Schreiber), who belonged to Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin), the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, hundreds of dogs are now living on Trash Island, going through the different stages of the virus symptoms, including deterioration, starvation, insomnia, tiredness, rage and much. Among the many dogs on the island, there is a pack of five dogs - Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray), and their leader, Chief (Bryan Cranston). They are surprised by the crash-landing of a plane, it is Atari, who has run away from home, landing on Trash Island to find Spots, they decide to help Atari in his search, although former stray Chief is reluctant to fraternize with humans. Initially Atari and the dogs believe Spots is dead, seeing his cage lock failed to open upon arrival, in fact there was a mix-up, and Spots may be alive elsewhere on the island. After an altercation with a rescue team sent by Kobayashi to retrieve Atari, after meeting a female purebreed named Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), Chief has a change of heart and decides to accompany Atari and company on their search. They seek advice from sage dogs Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Oracle (Tilda Swinton), who claim to see visions, in fact they get their information from television, the two dogs inform the group there is a rumour of a tribe of cannibalistic dogs on an isolated part of the island. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe has found the cure to the virus and all its main ailments, but he is poisoned by Mayor Kobayashi, so the dogs will remain on the island. Foreign exchange student Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate, confronting assistant scientist and Watanable's former cohort Yoko Ono (Yoko Ono), who confirms Tracy's suspicions and gives her the last remaining dose of the cure. During the journey, Atari and Chief are separated from the others, Atari washes Chief, turning from dirty black to his original white-coloured fur, he is the same breed as Spots, implying they may be brothers. Chief reveals he was once a house pet, forced out of his home after regretfully attacking his master out of fear, they reunite with the group and locate the isolated tribe, who are not actually cannibals, and they are ambushed by Kobayashi's men again. Spots arrives with a small army of dogs, they help them fend off the assailants, it is revealed in flashbacks that Spots was rescued on arrival by the tribe, and became their leader, Spots also confirms that he and Chief are brothers, and asks to transfer his protection duties for Atari to him. An owl arrives, revealing that Kobayashi plans to exterminate all dogs on Trash Island when he is imminently re-elected, Atari and the dog tribe decide to return to Megasaki City to attempt to prevent this. At Kobayashi's election ceremony, he prepares to give the order for the extermination, but Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption and the existence of the cure, Atari and the dogs arrive and confirm the cure works. Kobayashi has a change of heart, but his right-hand man Major Domo (Akira Takayama) insists the extermination should be seen through, a fight breaks out, during which the button is pressed, but the poison backfires on the captors instead, Tracy's friend helped. During the fight, Atari and Spots are gravely injured, Atari's only remaining kidney fails, but Kobayashi admits to his mistakes, he donates his own to save the boy's life. By election law, mayoral control of the city passes to Atari, he decrees that dogs be allowed to reintegrate into society, Tracy and Atari become a couple, and Chief reunites with Nutmeg and takes up the role of bodyguard for Atari. Spots is presumed dead, in fact he recovered from his injuries, and is secretly raising a family under the Kobayashi Manor. Also starring Frances McDormand as Interpreter Nelson, Harvey Keitel as Gondo, Ken Watanabe as Head Surgeon, Short Circuit's Fisher Stevens as Scrap, Anjelica Huston as Mute Poodle and Courtney B. Vance as The Narrator. The all-star voices are all chosen well for the malnourished mutts living on the rubbish-tip island, it is a very interesting story, filled with poignancy, there are some good laughs along the way, the style of the movie pays homage to dystopian vision like Akira, it serves as a celebration of Japanese culture, and has a great score by Alexandre Desplat. There are some surprisingly adult moments, including filleting a salmon for preparation of sushi, and a bloody operation, it may be slightly dark and disturbing for younger viewers, and there are snobby people that criticize the Western interpretation of Eastern civilisation, but it is a fantastically quirky and inventive animated comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Featured Film, and Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and Best Original Score. Very good!",Isle of Dogs
7,Quinoa1984,Every Wes Anderson dog has his day,10,29 March 2018,"The difference between the absolutely amazing and incredible Wes Anderson movies and the merely good ones is this: does it have heart? This has a heart that explodes into a giant white cloud of chaotic animation. It's also the most MOST of his films: most wonderous and frame-for-frame spectacilar animation, most enjoyable characters, most talented and going-above-and-beyond what's asked of voice actors (especially Cranston, as it's his film really at hear, plus Schreiber and Gerwig - even Yolo Ono works well in a small dose), most exquisite and poetic and both dark and light, sweet and ugly, highly comedic in dialog and physical work and tragic as Miyazaki could get, and also both varied colors, and most moving music. It's the dog with the mostest. It's a film where Wes Anderson dares to have imagery that isn't all nice and tidy and precise (though of course the shots all are - animation is the filmmaking sweet spot for a director who's dreams are likely storyboarded to a tee) - as the Trash Island is one of those immense locations that has varied designs as it's so large, but it shows the director, in a small way, challenging himself: can garbage and waste and filth be interesting? Hell yes it can, and the dogs fit in to it as these outcasts who are naturally... Dogs. And yet this is the kind of work that one viewing cant suffice - you can't take in everything on one fell swoop. Just one moment where the dogs are having a discussion about what to do next (pre one of their ""we're all the leader!"" votes) has thr backdrop of thousands of empty bottles. Look at that shot! Just LOOK at that shot! This movie is filled with a lot of that, but it doesn't repeat itself (or at least any more than it has to). Everything is of its piece, and while I'm not sure I can find it 100% *perfect* - the end kind of lacked some of the characters who were prominent earlier on, and this is after the action - but im sure after I see this another 3, 4, 10 times, more of the themes and little dogs will come more to light. isle of Dogs is the kind of film where you have the cutest little puppies in one scene and holocaust death camp imagery in another... And it isnt jarring in the slightest. Wow. I want to play the video game version of the bit where the dogs go into the death machine (not a spoiler dont get nervous). Count this as going to likely be HIGH on my top 10 at years end.(PS: I had a major geeking out when I recognized the guitar music from Kurosawa's Drunken Angel - that's my film hipster coming through)",Isle of Dogs
8,grantss,"Another sweet, quirky, charming and original creation by Wes Anderson",8,10 February 2019,"Dog flu has broken out among the canine population of the Japanese city of Megasaki. The ruling, cat-loving, Kobayashi clan has a several-centuries long enmity with dogs. Mayor Kobayashi orders all dogs moved to the city's waste dumping ground, Trash Island, henceforth known as the Isle of Dogs.Written and directed by Wes Anderson who brought us such gems as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr Fox and Moonrise Kingdom, Isle of Dogs has many of his trademarks. Highly original plot, from the word go, I was immediately drawn in by how different and clever it was. There's also a wonderful sweetness, innocence and charm about the movie, making it suitable for all ages. Add in the subtle, often tongue-in-cheek, quirky humour and you can clearly see his hand in this movie.Interesting animation. Not your perfect cartoon style, but a rougher sort of animation. Can be a bit jarring at times but it suits the story and Anderson's style of storytelling.Voice casting is spot-on and features a Hollywood who's-who of names. Most interesting casting: Yoko Ono as herself...sort of.Not perfect, however. The plot gets a bit loose and hard to follow in the second half. The first half was perfect - engaging, tight, interesting - but the second half gets a bit random at times and feels more like a conventional adventure story.Overall, great: wonderfully funny, interesting and entertaining.",Isle of Dogs

10,neil-476,"Ugly animated ""comedy"" with no laughs - typical Wes Anderson",5,1 May 2018,"Japanese big business has outlawed all dogs to an island made up of dumped junk. Young Atari travels there in pursuit of his missing dog Spots, in which he is assisted by a group of the dogs who live there.You can often break a movie down into the story, and how it is executed on screen. I try to imagine how the story here would have been dealt with by someone rather more conventional than Wes Anderson, and I can see it being a straightforward dog-centric narrative if undertaken by Disney, Pixar, Ghibli, Sony Animation etc.So the Wes Anderson factor - and the execution is pure Wes Anderson - is what marks this out as unique. Which doesn't necessarily mean good, although this film does seem to have found a moderate amount of public goodwill. Just not from me.I love animation, but Anderson has adopted a similar style to what he did with Fantastic Mr Fox, which looks ugly. I didn't find this a film which I enjoyed looking it.The quirky humour was, to me, just quirky. Anderson, too often, seems to be having his own private jokes, not unlike the Coen brothers.
I loved the star-studded and wildly eclectic voice cast, but I often didn't like how they were directed - there was far too much deadpanning.For me, this film was made by Wes Anderson for an audience consisting of Wes Anderson.",Isle of Dogs
11,evanston_dad,Outgrowing Wes Anderson,6,7 November 2018,"I think I might be outgrowing Wes Anderson.How is it that this movie touches on themes of fear mongering, media manipulation, treatment of immigrants, and environmental crisis and yet still seems completely disconnected from anything actually happening in the real world? It's like Anderson makes movies for the sole purpose of existing inside his own head. And I'm tiring of his stylistic quirks -- the toneless line deliveries, the dead pan mugging directly at the camera, the awkward pauses as if the characters in the film are waiting for a laugh track that the audience watching the movie can't hear.The animation in ""Isle of Dogs"" is breathtaking, but I couldn't get into it at all.Grade: B-",Isle of Dogs
12,ferguson-6,say it quickly,7,30 March 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's referred to (sometimes affectionately, sometimes not) as Wes World. Many directors have their own style, though few are as immediately recognizable as a film by Wes Anderson. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, MOONRISE KINGDOM, FANTASTIC MR FOX, THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS, and RUSHMORE all share a tone and style ... a cinematic personality, if you will, that places them squarely in Wes World. Beyond the similarities, there is also a level of innovation and creativity in each of his projects. He consistently delivers a ""Wow"" factor, or in the case of his latest, a ""bow-wow"" factor (my one and only pun, I promise).Expanding on the stop-action animation he used in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, director Anderson also plays homage to Japanese filmmaking - especially the animation of Hayao Miyazaki and the cinematic legend Akira Kurosawa. The film's prologue, ""The Boy Samurai"" is a Japanese fable and sets the stage for a futuristic Japan where the Mayor of Megasaki, Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), has decreed that all dogs should be banned from society due to dog flu, snout fever and canine saturation. Kobayashi (an embittered politician who looks eerily similar to Japanese acting legend Toshiro Mifune) even ships off his nephew's beloved Spots (Liev Schreiber) to Trash Island. In Part 1 ""The Little Pilot"", that nephew, Atari (Koyu Rankin) crash lands his plane on Trash Island while attempting to rescue Spots. Part 2 (""The Search for Spots""), Part 3 (""The Rendez-Vous""), and Part 4 (""Atari's Lantern"") break the story into segments, but the real fun here is in the visual effects and the banter amongst the dogs. The five main dogs we follow are Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). Chief is a stray dog who is the group skeptic and doesn't hesitate in greeting most anyone with ""I bite"". We know this because director Anderson explains ""Barks are rendered in English"". While assisting Atari with his search, the five dogs alternate between gossiping and decision-making by committee ... spouting one-liners that are consistently funny and incisive. Anderson co-wrote the script with Roman Coppola and his frequent collaborator Jason Schwartzman. Kunichi Nomura provided expertise to ensure the Japanese segments were accurately portrayed. The usual Wes-style droll humor is evident throughout, though viewers must make sure their hearing is fined tuned to catch some of the wise-cracks that almost seem like background noise at times. In addition to the humor, political corruption and conspiracies are at the core of what could be described as an animated rescue adventure comedy. Narrator Courtney B Vance ensures we are following along with the story, although the artistic beauty of Trash Island - a garbage strewn wasteland - is enough to hold our interest. Keeping track of the homages is challenging enough, but we also get Haikus, Puppy Snaps, and Yoko Ono as a scientist. Greta Gerwig voices Tracy, an idealistic Foreign Exchange student who recognizes a corrupt politician when she sees one, and there are a couple of brilliant noirish scenes between Chief and Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson). A recurring visual of dogfights in a cloud of dust harken back to the days of classic cartoons and the unbridled violence that we've always found so comical in animation.It's a dystopian tale ... well it is if you happen to be a dog. Cat lovers probably view this as paradise. An all-star cast of voice actors keeps us interested even when the story bogs down at times, although the look of the film always seems to be priority one. It's such an easy movie to respect, however, one that's a bit more difficult to speak passionately about. This review doesn't address the ever-present complaints from those looking to create a race or nationality based scandal. To me, the film is creative and appears to be against unkindness and discrimination and corruption. Perhaps that message overrides some easily ruffled feathers.",Isle of Dogs

Funny, Gutsy & Metaphorical, this canine comedy has teeth & soul.'Isle of Dogs' follows a young boy who goes in search of his dog after the whole species is banished to an island due to an illness outbreak.'Isle of Dogs' is about political greed, love, loyalty & immigration. Come to think of it, Wes delivers a film, with dogs as its pivotal characters, to deliver a story about members of our society who go into banishment. Does this story ring a bell to you given the current talk in America by its most powerful man? It sure does. But, Wes being Wes delivers a darkly comedic, metaphorically poetic film, that uses current circumstances (most of them, condemnable) to great impact. I found myself laughing here many times, but at times, I knew it wasn't really a joke to laugh on. Wes is in top-form, as a Writer & Director, both, and gives us a nearly unforgettable film. The stop-motion animation is top-notch & each character, be it the dogs or the humans, appear detailed & emotive.Oscar-Winner Alexandre Desplat's Score is another ACE of 'Isle of Dogs'. The musical genius delivers moody & soulful tunes, that match up-to Wes's wildly innovative imagination to mesmerizing effect. The voice cast that includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Courtney B.

14,Hellmant,"Being a vegan, I hope this message will translate to how we treat other animals as well.",8,6 April 2018,"'ISLE OF DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new stop-motion animated comedy from writer/director Wes Anderson (Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Kunichi Nomura also co-wrote the story). This is Anderson's second stop-motion animated film, following 2009's 'FATNASTIC MR. FOX'. The movie tells the story of a dystopian future Japan, where all dogs have been quarantined to a remote island, due to an extreme canine flu outbreak. A boy travels to the island to find his dog, and he gets help form a team of dogs there. The film stars the voice talents of Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Kunichi Nomura, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Fisher Stevens, Tilda Swinton Harvey Keitel, Ken Watanabe and many others. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like nearly all of Anderson's movies), and it's playing in select cities now (like Portland). I enjoyed it, like I do all of Anderson's films. All of the dogs in Japan have become infected with a severe canine flu, and the human population fears they'll catch it from them. So against dog lovers' (and animal activists') wishes, the canines are all quarantined to a remote island full of garbage. A group of rebel activists want to change this decision, and a young male activist, named Atari (Rankin), travels to the island to find his beloved dog there. A team of tough canines decides to help him.The film is witty, funny and quirky (just like all of Anderson's movies). It's also got a great message about respecting dogs, and not taking them for granted. Being a vegan, I hope this message will translate to how we treat other animals as well (which is far worse), but I doubt it will. As a whole the movie is funny, and also bizarrely interesting (which is the same as all of Anderson's movies). I do like 'FANTASTIC MR. FOX' a little better though.",Isle of Dogs

16,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Visually interesting but ultimately more style over substance.,6,1 April 2018,"As is almost par for the course with Wes Anderson, at least nowadays, 'Isle Of Dogs (2018)' is far more style over substance, presenting its fairly simple story straightforwardly and with plenty of on-the-nose exposition. Thankfully, the visuals we get are splendid, aside from the annoying and too frequently used 'to-camera' framing that sees characters mug for the fame for no reason other than a repetitive and only occasionally satisfying composition. The amazing stop-motion animation and a general aesthetic balances a real tangibility with a slight absurdist cartoon feel to wonderful effect, though. The way it looks, and moves, is unique and definitely its strong point. The film, much like 'Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)', isn't really aimed at kids. I think most of the allegory and dry wit would go over their heads, and that's not even considering the non-conventional storytelling and slightly 'edgy' elements. But it didn't ever claim to be directed at them and nor should it have, though it does beg the question as to why the narrative seems so diluted and bizarrely expositional (as I've mentioned) - and no it isn't just Anderson's 'style', which can't be an excuse for lazy storytelling - if it didn't have to aim for the youngest of its possible audience. It's the fact that the experience is a passive one, no matter how well crafted or 'quirky', that isn't particularly funny or engaging, that stops it from being any better than it ultimately is. 6/10",Isle of Dogs
17,dromasca,can dogs disappoint?,6,15 September 2018,"I had all the good reasons to have great expectations from 'Isle of Dogs'. First, it's a movie about dogs. Second, its animation and the trailer looked great (including the dogs). Third, it's set in Japan, a country I love for its culture, including the passion for film, animation and manga. Fourth it's a movie by Wes Anderson and I liked his previous work. And yet, I was quite disappointed. 'Isle of Dogs' was much less than what I had expected.It's a film by Wes Anderson and it comprises many of the qualities that you can expect from the stylish director. It is amazing in it's visual part which combines a dystopic image of the close visuals of Japan with animation descending from the Japanese manga style and from the Disney dog lovers division. It gathers in the distribution a unique collection of stars which borrow their voices to the animated characters. It lacks however one important component - a compelling and original story. All the talent invested in the movie seems wasted in an exuberant aesthetic show supporting a rather childish and expected story about a teens and children helping good dogs in their fight against bad men. Too simple, too linear.Dogs seldom fail us in real life. This is one exception. Luckily, it happens on screen.",Isle of Dogs
18,ThomasDrufke,Heartwarming and Gorgeous,8,17 April 2018,"As a relatively new owner of a Canine, I'm still unbelievably attached to my dog. And so any movie that comes along, stop motion/animated or not, I will be one of the first to the theater. Fortunately, Isle of Dogs finally got a wider release this week and I was able to go see it. Funny, heartwarming, and visually spectacular, Isle of Dogs is a darling of an animated film. Of course, the voice talent is top notch and particularly effective, but the real heart and sincerity comes from Wes Anderson's direction and sharp script. It doesn't commit to an overly complex story nor one that is a dumb nonsensical animated flick, like a certain animated studio tends to put out (Illumination). But what Isle of Dogs does do is present the unbreakable bond that an owner and his or her dog has with each other. I would live on Trash Island if I had to go find my dog and for that alone, Isle of Dogs won my heart over by well-representing that relationship.8.3/10",Isle of Dogs
19,gbill-74877,"Beautiful, with a great message",9,20 October 2019,"When those who whip the populace up into fear and hatred have a greater voice than those who use reason and science, man will do unspeakable, heartless things. What could be worse than turning on his most faithful, innocent friend, the dog? Of course, the film actually has as little to do with dogs as the original Godzilla had to do with monsters. With fantastic artistry, light touches of humor, and an homage to Japanese culture, Wes Anderson delivers a message film that is every bit as beautiful as it is touching.While the film has the worldwide rise of populism clearly in its sites, my favorite moment was when the troubled stray Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston) talks about a mistake he made after being adopted:""Anyway, one morning a week later, the youngest boy, his name was Toshiro, woke me up at 6:15, bright-eyed, wide-awake, and he tried to pet me. He didn't mean anything by it. He was just being friendly. Apparently, I bit him so hard, I nearly chewed his hand off. Blood all over the kitchen floor. They rushed him to the emergency room and I got padlocked out in the tool shed with the lights out. It gave me some time to think. What happened? Why did I do that? To this day, I have no idea. I guess he scared me. I bite.""It's a painful, soul-searching moment, and those who have damaged in some way in their lives will identify. He doesn't know why he bites, but we do. He's never been shown any kindness. It's a parable in empathy and understanding that really resonated with me.It was also telling that the hope in the film is with youth, and with the appealing to the hearts of the people. In another brilliant moment, the boy says:""I have spent much of my time in recent weeks traveling in the company of the very kind of animals our mayor refers to as ""bad-dogs."" They are the finest living beings I have ever come to know in all my dozen years on this earth. To your readers, the good people of Megasaki, I say: the cycle of life always hangs in a delicate balance. Who are we, and who do we want to be?""Who are we, indeed. What the world needs now, Anderson is telling us, is love and understanding. Simply fantastic.",Isle of Dogs

The American cast includes Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Yoko Ono, Tilda Swinton, Ken Watanabe, Liev Schreiber, and Anjelica Huston. What really makes this movie stand out is its strikingly animated visual look as powerful as Coraline (2009), WALL*E (2008), Spirited Away (2001), and La planète sauvage (1973). The story and its message has emotive resonance found in The Incredibles (2004) and Inside Out (2015) and has a special poignancy as the singular focus is the connection between a boy and his dog. Isle of Dogs is a captivating cinematic experience and an innovative, refreshing approach to storyteller. One of the writers, Roman Coppola, the son of Frances Ford Coppola and brother of Sophia Coppola also is credited with and startling creative Moonrise Kingdom (2012). This movie has the same theatrical impact as the imaginative design of Dogville (2004), Being John Malkovich (2000), and Bunraku (2010). Additional with the paranoid conspiracy theme incorporated in Aeon Flux (2005), The Giver (2014), The Host (2013) offers the audience a more adult flavored animation movie.

26,tomgillespie2002,I fail to see how anyone could not be utterly enchanted by Isle of Dogs,9,18 July 2018,"Fans of American writer and director Wes Anderson are in for a treat with his latest picture. Returning to stop-motion animation for the first time since 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox, Isle of Dogs is the auteur's most Wes Anderson-y film to date. Set in Japan 20 years into the future, it tells the story of a pack of dogs left to fend for themselves on 'Trash Island', an expansive dumping ground that looks like the type of place WALL-E would feel right at home in. You don't have to be a fan of canines or Japanese culture to enjoy this tale, although it may help. Anderson peppers the film with his trademark deadpan, straight-to-camera sense of humour, and frames every shot with even more attention to detail than his 2014 masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel. Children may be put off by the film's idiosyncratic approach, but Anderson followers will indeed be appeased and then some.The planet is under threat from dog flu and snout fever, both timely reminders of the recent swine flu 'epidemic' and the dangers of fake news. The mayor of Megasaki City (voiced by co-writer Kunichi Nomura), who is part of a dynasty of long-time cat lovers, puts forward a decree to banish all dogs from the mainland and transport them to Trash Island, despite claims of a breakthrough to cure the animals' illness. His ward, a young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin), is having none of his caregiver's authoritarian attitudes, and travels to the human-less island in order to find his beloved dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), the very first mutt to be dismissed. Atari steals a plane and crashes it into the wasteland, and comes across a pack of mostly former domesticated canines led by the incredibly democratic Rex (Edward Norton). The rest of the gang consists of Boss (Bill Murray), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), and the only stray in the group, Chief (Bryan Cranston).Chief is the beating heart of the film, and the character through which Anderson explores most of the film's themes. The black, scruffy dog is proud to be from the streets, and is quick to admit that he's a biter. He's the only one to refuse to sit for Atari, but nevertheless agrees to go with the majority vote and assist Atari in helping his track down his lost friend. From here on in, it's very much an A-to-B adventure, but Anderson and his co-writers (Nomura, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman) ensure that the journey is anything but formulaic. Along the way, we meet the likes of Oracle (Tilda Swinton), Nutmeg (Scarlett Johnansson), Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Gondo (Harvey Keitel), with even Yoko Ono thrown into the mix. Things aren't made easy by the fact that the Japanese actors speak in their native tongue without the assistance of subtitles (although Frances McDormand occasionally pops up as an enthusiastic translator), but this highlights the communication barrier between owner and pet, as well as falling in line with the film's themes of migration and social integration.Anderson packs in more shots than is usually expected from animation, particularly in the painfully slow process of stop-motion. Rather than accepting this as a limitation, he uses animation as a tool to bring his vision vividly to life with more freedom allowed by live action. The visuals are even more luscious that in Grand Budapest, with the animation retaining a rustic, old-fashioned quality that makes it feel as if you could reach out and actually touch the dog's hairs as they ripple in the wind. As soon as the Taiko drums start to thud on the film's glorious soundtrack, Anderson's love of Japanese cinema can be sensed immediately. The influence of Akira Kurosawa can be felt throughout (a status of Toshiro Mifune appears at one point), but the precision of the framing is pure Ozu, and Tristan Oliver's cinematography relishes exploring what was perhaps Japan's greatest period for cinema. The mediocrity of 2004's The Life Aquatic must have been a wake-up for the filmmaker, urging him away from his comfort zone and towards more unexplored territory. Anderson continues to amaze, amuse and baffle, and has emerged as one of the most important, original voices in American cinema. I fail to see how anyone could not be utterly enchanted by Isle of Dogs.",Isle of Dogs
27,eddie_baggins,Lesser Anderson but still a visual treat,6,7 August 2018,"By this stage in his career, 22 years on from his debut film Bottle Rocket and follow-up break out hit Rushmore in 1998, you know what's in store when you sign up to watch a Wes Anderson film; oddball humour, arthouse tendencies and Bill Murray and for any acolytes of the esteemed indie filmmakers previous works, Isle of Dogs will be one of the years easiest to digest cinematic treats.Showing us all he was a deft hand with animation with 2009's memorable and very good Fantastic Mr. Fox, Anderson returns to stop-motion animation with his whimsical and fantastical Japanese set tale, that sees man's best friend banished to a trash island, living a life of scraps and canine disease, whilst felines are allowed a life of luxury in the imaginary Megasaki City.It's a unique and colourful tale filled with eye-capturing scenery and one that fits Anderson's sensibilities and imagination like a glove, yet while so much of Isle of Dogs is wondrous and engaging, there's a sense that the core tale of Anderson's fable isn't one of the filmmaker's finest moments, as we are thrown into a simplistic yarn about young pilot Atari trying to reunite with his old 4-legged friend Scraps after he was sent to Trash Island 6 months previously.Joining forces with a rag-tag collection of mutts led by Bryan Cranston's Chief and Edward Norton's Rex, Atari's journey starts off promisingly enough but unusually for an Anderson film, Isle of Dogs narrative begins to peter out as the runtime wears on and interest levels wane and despite the fine attempts of its voice cast and the beautifully constructed animation, Isle of Dogs is neither funny enough or thrilling enough to be considered up their Anderson's most assured works such as Fantastic Mr. Fox or more adult oriented dramas such as The Royal Tenenbaums.While its disappointing Isle of Dogs didn't connect more emotionally or nail its comedic oddball tone to a higher degree, there's no denying Anderson and his team's commitment to their hard to master animation technique is a genuinely remarkable achievement and filled with Anderson's creativity behind the camera, Isle of Dogs is abundant with visual wonder and acts as a colourful and memorable Japanese themed treat that is great for the eyes and senses, just not so much the heart or funnybone.Final Say - Some will be utterly charmed and dazzled by all elements of Anderson's newest creative offering, while others will find this appealing work slightly disappointing on a higher level. Hard to dislike but arguably harder to love than the best of Anderson's offerings, Isle of Dogs ends up being further proof that Anderson is a unique and unpredictable talent, to be forever copied, but hardly ever bested based purely on imaginary outputs.3 black owls out of 5",Isle of Dogs
28,leonblackwood,Amusing in parts but not the best from Wes Anderson! 6/10,6,20 August 2018,"Review:
I'm usually a big fan of Wes Anderson movies but I really struggled with this one. The cast was amazing but the storyline was overcomplicated when it didn't have to be. He obviously didn't make this animated film about talking dogs, for a young market because I really can't see the political element being entertaining for kids. I did enjoy the emotional content, between the dog and the child, and the animation, which is the same as the Fantastic Mr. Fox, was unique but I did get a bit bored of the plot after a while. Anyway, the movie is set in the near future in Japan, were a canine flu virus spreads across the population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dogs. The first to be exiled is Spots, who belonged to Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari flies to trash island to try and find spots but his plane crashes, and a pack of dogs, led by Chief, rush to his rescue. When Atari tells the dogs about Spots, they agree to help him on his mission but Chief, a former stray, is reluctant to help humans. Chief decides to follow them on there journey and to seek advice from Jupiter and the Oracle. Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe finds a cure for the dog-flu but Kobayashi refuses to lift the dog ban. After criticizing Kobayashi's decision, Watanabe is put on house arrest and is killed by poisoned wasabi in sushi. A radical American exchange student, Tracy Walker, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. Kobayashi claims that Atari was kidnapped by the dogs and vows to kill them as punishment. During there journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others, and they bond close together after Atari gives him a bath. When they finally rejoin the rest of the group, they come across a cannibal tribe of dogs but are ambushed by Kobayashi's men. Spot arrives with an army of dogs, and they fend off the assailants together. Spot reveals that he was rescued by the tribe, and he has become their leader. He has also mated with a female, who is pregnant, so he doesn't want to leave with Atari, even though he has risked his life to rescue him. He then reveals that Chief is his brother, so he transfers his protection duties for Atari, to Chief, even though Spot still loves Atari. The people of Megasaki believe that Atari is dead, and Kobayashi plans to exterminate all of the dogs in Trash Island, so when the dogs find out what is happening from a mysterious owl, they decide to make there way back to Megasaki. Meanwhile, Tracy is given the cure from Watanabe's ex-assistant, Yoko Ono, who confirms that her suspicions are correct about the corruption in office. When Tracy confronts Kobayashi with the evidence, he dismisses all of her information, and he orders her expulsion from Japan, back to the United States. When the dogs finally arrive at Megasaki, they prove that the cure works, which puts Kobayashi to shame in front of all of his supporters. He then revokes his decree but his right-hand man, Major Domo, insists on triggering the extermination. A fight then breaks out between Kobayashi and Domo in which the execute button is pressed but the poison backfires on the captors, thanks to some help from a hacker friend of Tracy's. Now you see what I mean about the movie being over complicated! With this amount of A Class actors, it didn't really smash the box office, and with the amount of hard work that goes into this type of animation, the movie should have been much better. The critics have given it high praise, and I personally haven't heard a bad word about it but it still wasn't my cup of tea. Dog lovers will be able to relate to the film in many ways, especially the relationship between Akira and Spot but I haven't got, or ever had a dog, which explains why I didn't get it. On the plus side, I did find some of the scenes funny, especially the smoked out fight scenes and some of the narrating but I expected more from this, somewhat warped minded director, who usually produces great work. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Wes Anderson, who also brought you Bottle Rocket in 1996, Rushmore, the great Royal Tenebaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the enjoyable Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom and the brilliant Grand Budapest Hotel. He's not one to release movies often, so when he's working on a project, he really does give it his all. He has directed some of my favourite movies, which is why I was really looking forward to this film but it let me down, just like the Fantastic Mr. Fox did. Although his films don't smash the box office, he has the ability to get some of the best actors in the world, due to his unique and fun style, which will stand the test of time. Budget: N/A

29,howard.schumann,"Full of Anderson's offbeat, captivating energy",9,2 April 2018,"Performed at the Swan Theatre in July 1597, ""The Isle of Dogs,"" a satirical play (now lost) written by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson was labeled ""seditious, slanderous, and lewd"" by the government and led to the arrest of the actors (including Jonson) and the closing of all London theaters for months. The nature of the satire is unknown but comparing court figures to mangy curs is not far from the realm of possibility. No such drastic punishment awaits Wes Anderson's (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") modern day Isle of Dogs, however, though there are some who would be inclined to banish it to movie purgatory for its many Japanese cultural references that tread a thin line between homage and appropriation.If sumo wrestlers, haiku poetry, Kabuki theater, sushi, taiko drums (courtesy of composer Alexandre Desplat (""The Shape of Water), cherry blossoms, and symbolic mushroom clouds are your thing, however, you have come to the right place. Written by Anderson from a story by Roman Coppola (""Moonrise Kingdom""), Jason Schwartzman (""The Darjeeling Limited"") and Kunichi Nomura, Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated adventure about a boy and his faithful pet out to prevent the genocide of the dog population of Megasaki City in Japan. Thanks to the superb work of cinematographer Tristan Oliver (""Loving Vincent""), it is beautiful to look at and is filled with the kind of offbeat, captivating energy of which Anderson is a master. Oh, yes, the Japanese voices are untranslated to add more authenticity or confusion as the case may be. Set in the fictional city of Megasaki twenty years in the future, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Nomura), a villainous Toshiro Mifune look-alike, has used the fear of possible contamination of humans by ""Dog Flu"" and ""Snout Fever"" to exile the city's canine population to a forbidding place called ""Trash Island,"" a disposal site filled with neatly compacted piles of garbage and inundated with rats. Ignoring the fact that political rival Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito, ""Birdman"") is working on a Dog Flu vaccine that will prevent the spread of the disease, Kobayashi first sends the household guard dog Spots (voiced by Liev Schrieber, ""Spotlight"") to the island, breaking the heart of Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), his 12-year-old nephew and ward, an orphan whose parents were killed in an accident. One is tempted to ask, along with Megasaki's news translator (voiced by Frances McDormand, ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri""), ""Whatever happened to man's best friend?"" As the exiled dogs scrounge for food on the island, one pack forms a bond. These previously household pets include Rex (voiced by Edward Norton, ""Collateral Beauty""), King (voiced by Bob Balaban, ""Wormwood,"" TV documentary), Boss (voiced by Bill Murray, ""Ghostbusters""), and Duke (voiced by Jeff Goldblum, ""Thor: Rangarok""). There is an additional dog in the group, however, an undomesticated stray named Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston, ""Last Flag Flying""). Chief is an outspoken black dog who decides that he is the leader of the pack even though decisions have been made democratically. Chief is not too fond of humans and, in a moment of introspection, tells his friends that he bites even though he claims that he is not a violent dog. These gossipy dogs are all believable characters who long for the comfort of their former life. Rex recalls huddling with his master by the fireside, Boss remembers being a mascot for a sports team, and King reminds everyone that he was once a commercial star who promoted Doggy Chop pet food. Even Scarlett Johansson (""The Jungle Book"") shows up, voicing Nutmeg, a show dog who falls for Chief's gentle overtures, as well as Tilda Swinton (""Okja"") as Oracle, a dog with the powers of precognition. Of course, these Japanese dogs all bark in English and do not understand one word of Japanese, even though they were raised in Japan. Meanwhile, Atari, who along with Spots, wears an earpiece that serves as a tracking device, crash lands his plane on Trash Island in an attempt to find his beloved pet. As Atari lands, he is greeted by our five enterprising dogs who do not know whether to eat him or comfort him. Eventually, they endearingly name him ""The Little Pilot"" and help him crisscross the island to find Spots. The search unleashes a twisty adventure that is so full of Andersonian moments of high strangeness that you may feel as if you've just entered a parallel universe. It is all great fun, however, even though there is one unnecessary subplot about an American exchange student Tracy Walker, (voiced by Greta Gerwig, ""20th Century Women"") who alerts the sleepy Megasakians about a conspiracy involving the corrupt Mayor. White savior, anyone? Wes Anderson's ninth feature and his second using stop-motion animation has a universal appeal, though it may be a little daunting for children untrained in the nuances of quirk. For those tuned into his style, however, it is Anderson at his subversive best. While some may read into it political implications about corrupt leaders using their skewed version of truth to achieve a dubious end, basically it is just a sweet children's adventure story about a little boy and his lost dog. It is - isn't it?",Isle of Dogs
30,TheMovieDiorama,"Isle of Dogs made me realise ""I Love Dogs"".",8,5 April 2018,"Firstly, those accusing this film of racial appropriation and marginalisation, stop. It is abundantly clear that Anderson was inspired by the Land of the Rising Sun as he creates a futuristic reimagining of Japan whilst retaining their traditional culture. It's not racist in the slightest. The mayor of Megasaki signs an executive decree to banish all dogs to Trash Island due to viral outbreak. His young nephew flees home in an attempt to find his guard dog Spots on the quarantined island. Japanese, stop motion, ensemble voice cast, canines...safe to say I adored this animated adventure. Anderson's quirky utilisation of symmetry, character centralisation and swift camera panning makes for a deliberately odd style that is incredibly easy to succumb to. A darkly mature story that involves political agendas, propaganda, totalitarianism, obedience and death is surprisingly intertwined with an intelligently written script that is sure to have you laughing on several occasions. This is also a result from the outstanding voice ensemble consisting of Cranston, Norton, Murray, Johansson and more as they inject life into their puppet canines. The smart use of language and lack of subtitles ensures that linguistic authenticity flows throughout its runtime. The attentive detail put into each character (both physically and literary) makes for several heartwarming moments as you quickly become emotionally attached to these adorable dogs. The stop motion animation was gorgeous, just like 'Fantastic Mr Fox', with excellent use of fluffy wool to depict clouds and industrious rust to illustrate the abandonment of the environment. It's not just aesthetic appeal, it's world building. Desplat's musical score of booming taiko drums and other traditional instruments allows the Japanese culture to invade all of your senses, slowly entrancing you. I did find that the narrative segmentation and constant flashbacks made for a disjointed plot. Small gripe aside, it's very rare that we are presented with such originality, creativity and humanity in an animation. Stunning.",Isle of Dogs
31,matthewssilverhammer,Another Anderson Animated Success,7,20 April 2018,"Hyper-stylized auteur Wes Anderson is back in animation for the first time since Fantastic Mr. Fox with Isle of Dogs. This sci-fi-comedy-adventure touches on topics like political corruption, media, oppression, and even the Holocaust. However, the Mad-Gab-esque title (""I Love Dogs"") really lets you know what the film's aims are. A visually captivating and heartfelt stop-motion film, it's main goal and success is as an unabashed rub-on-the-belly for man's best friend. 
Set 20 years in the future, a young boy is goes searching for his beloved pet after all of Japan's dogs have been exiled to a garbage-dump-island. Full of deadpan humor and detailed history, the world-building is fantastic. As with many of Anderson's films, it's filled with small touches (hilarious haikus, surprisingly complex dog characters) that envelope an audience despite the intentional stiffness in the delivery. And of course, there's his signature visual style. Here we're given a technical adeptness in the animation styles that makes this even more aesthetically stunning than normal, along with the extreme symmetry and dry emotions.
For me, Anderson's style has always been one that I could never quite embrace the way others do. Where many see it as distinct and engaging, I often find it makes his films colder and more distant than they might otherwise feel. Those feelings still popped up here for me, an undeniable sense of cloying cuteness and self-parody. However, with Isle of Dogs those negatives only serve to highlight how great the visual achievements, subtle laughs and story constructs are here. Artfully attentive and original, this may not convert audiences either for or against Anderson, but it's still a cute entry into his unmistakable repertoire.",Isle of Dogs
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Classic Anderson filmmaking and storytelling in its most creative packaging yet,8,20 April 2018,"The union of Wes Anderson and stop-motion animation continues to be an ideal match. In 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Anderson showed what he could create using a medium that gives its author total control over every detail and every tiny movement; it amplified his comedy and creativity. This proves true once more in ""Isle of Dogs,"" a completely original concept and story.The film takes place in a fictional Japanese Dystopia in which a canine disease has swept over the city of Megasaki, leading the mayor to order the banishing of all dogs to Trash Island. Flash forward a little to the mayor's nephew, Atari (Koyu Rankin), crash-landing a plane on the island and encountering a pack of Trash Island dogs led by Chief (Bryan Cranston). The pack discerns that Atari is looking for his dog and bodyguard Spots (Liev Schreiber), the first dog ever shipped off to the island. Despite Chief's reluctance to help a human, he is overruled by Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and Boss (Bill Murray).Their adventure becomes this fresh and interesting way of exploring the relationship between man and dog, embodied in the initially tenuous dynamic between Atari, an orphan in search of his best friend, and Chief, who has found new purpose on Trash Island because he doesn't have to be obedient.That story could've been told any number of ways, so in a sense the Japanese cultural aesthetic could be deemed arbitrary, yet it really adds a distinctive flavor. Various Kabuki/Noh theatre influences blend with Anderson's usual visual stylization and storytelling rhythm, and Alexandre Desplat gets a fresh musical palette to work with for his excellent score. It's clear that Anderson was destined to do something in a traditional Japanese style and it was probably easiest to do in a completely fictional adventure story.All this to say, ""Isle of Dogs"" is rife with Anderson trademarks that will undoubtedly satiate his most devoted fans. He only gets points for dressing up some of his most prolific themes -a protagonist with dead parents, estranged relationships and a meticulous plan gone wrong - in his most unique and creative way to date. The world-building he does in this film is unlike anything he's done before, from the visuals of a Dystopic Japan to telling a story in which only the animals speak English and there are no inorganic subtitles.The tender relationship moments that usually accompany his films also take a slightly different shape in man and his pet. Even though the plot is larger than life, it always boils down to that moment of emotional vulnerability that always helps catapult his films from good to great. ""Isle of Dogs"" is no exception, and there's plenty to marvel at too.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Isle of Dogs
33,southdavid,Atoll Protected.,7,28 January 2019,"Isle Of DogsWes Anderson returns to the stop motion animation style that served him well in ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" adaptation for ""Isle Of Dogs"".In future Japan, dogs are outlawed and sent to live on a nearby trash Island by order of Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura). Months later, with dogs established on the island, fighting for whatever scraps they can, a plane piloted by the Mayor's ward Atari (Koyu Rankin) crashes on the island. Atari is looking for his former security dog Spots (Liev Schreiber) and with the help of Chief (Bryan Cranston) and his team of alpha dogs, sets on a quest to find him.It's impossible not to appreciate the amount of talented people's work that has gone into creating ""Isle Of Dogs"". It's a beautiful and detailed piece of work, with everything down to eyes glassing over recreated using puppet and stop motion techniques. I can imagine some people being turned off by the way the vocal performances link to the characters, as with ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" they are low key realistic line deliveries, rather than typical voice over work. Personally, I love it, particularly when it's a distinctive voice like Jeff Goldblum or Harvey Keitel.The film, however, isn't perfect. The story could do with a few more beats to make it slightly more compelling. It would also benefit from being slightly more conventionally funny, as opposed to just offbeat funny. Don't get me wrong, I laughed a few times whilst watching it - it's just an area that I felt it could do more. I do think that ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" was slightly better in both those regards. I also didn't feel much of a connection to the human characters in the story.Visually arresting if a little narratively underwhelming, I look forward to the next time Anderson turns his mind to animation.",Isle of Dogs
34,paul-allaer,Wes Anderson's 2nd motion-stop animated film is a WINNER all the way,9,2 April 2018,"""Isle of Dogs"" (2018 release; 101 min.) brings the story of the canine population in Megasaki City. Japan. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""20 years into the future"", and a dog virus is sweeping the city. Mayor Kobayashi signs a dog ban, and Spots is the first dog deported to Trash Island. We then go to ""6 months later"", and Atari Kobayashi, the Mayor's nephew, sneaks onto Trash Island, determined to find his beloved Spots. Atari befriends a pack of dogs led by Chief. Will they find Spots? Will the dog virus be treated? At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-producer-director Wed Anderson, and his second stop-motion animated film, following the equally excellent ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (2009). The big difference is that ""Isle of Dogs"" is set in Japan, and features Japanese dialogue and communications (all translated by either a translator or a device called ""Simul-Translate""). The movie plays out in 4 parts, and I have to say that my favorite is Part II ""The Search for Spots"" (get it?). Anderson devotes careful attention to even the smallest details, and I'm sure that I missed quite q view in my first viewing of the film. The movie features an all-star voice cast, truly too many to name them all, but let me just point out Liev Schreiber as Spots, Greta Gerwig as foreign exchange student Tracy Walker (who later is revealed to hail from... ""Cincinnati, Ohio"", much to the delight--hooting an hollering--from the theater crowd where I saw this at), and Bryan Cranston as Chief. The animation itself is done exquisitely, truly a eye-candy from start to finish. The movie's dialogue brims with vigor and comedy (although I was surprised by the use of the term ""final and permanent solution"" when the Mayor contemplates killing all dogs). Last, but certainly not least, Anderson's house composer Alexandre Desplat returns once again (on the heels of his second Oscar win--his first Oscar was of course for Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel). Desplat brings a dazzling score, mixing Japanese elements with more traditional (Western) music. Can't wait to check out the movie's soundtrack.""Isle of Dogs"" premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February to immediate critical acclaim. It opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend (on not one, not two but THREE screens, something I have never seen before), and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and it was clear the crowd was loving it. ""Isle of Dogs"" is a funny and engaging movie, not the kind where you are rolling on the floor laughing hysterically but instead you have that certain smile on your face, chucking on and off, while taking in as much of the movie's details as you possibly can. If you enjoyed ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", I readily suggest you check out ""Isle of Dogs"", be it at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Isle of Dogs"" is a WINNER all the way.",Isle of Dogs
35,billcr12,Dogs Rule,7,2 August 2018,"Isle of Dogs is an animated film with dogs as the stars. The human characters are secondary. Visually it is as good as it gets and the story is good enough to keep the audience watching. A mean mayor in Japan has banned all canines to an island due to a doggy flu. The cure is hidden from the public and a 12 year-old boy must come to the rescue of his pet and the rest of the dogs. A few Japanese language moments had no subtitles and I don't know if this was a mistake. Otherwise, Isle of Dogs provides some much needed distraction from the current news cycle.",Isle of Dogs
36,jamesrupert2014,Great dead-pan animated adventure,9,11 August 2019,"All the dogs in Megasaki are deported to Trash Island for ultimate disposal unless one boy and his friends can save them. The film has the typical Wes Anderson aesthetic: unrelenting symmetry, wide shots with tiny elements of movement, and an almost surreal dead-pan hyper-earnestness. The script and story are interesting and engaging, the kinetic stop-motion animation outstanding and the character design and voice talent is universally excellent. Like many recent animated feature, there are endless jokes in the background, so pay attention or watch multiple times.",Isle of Dogs
37,dfranzen70,Have you heard the rumor? This is a great movie.,9,15 November 2019,"Very enjoyable movie - downright hilarious, and it's good for kids, too. Seems that in Megasaki City, Japan, the dogs have come down with a bad case of the flu and have been forcibly evacuated to the appropriately named Trash Island, which housed factories, trash facilities, and so on. The first dog sent over to the island belongs to the young ward and nephew of the city's mayor; years later, the boy hijacks a small plane and heads to the island to find his pal. Aided by five other dogs, he must deal with the machinations of his distant uncle, robot dogs, the dog flu, and other obstacles in order to find Spots the dog. Wes Anderson's imaginative, beautiful movie employs stop-action animation with excellent detail to wonderful effect. I mean, you can see the individual fur strands move. The life of an untethered dog is exquisitely expressed, and as usual Anderson employs fine actors to provide the dogs' voices, such as Bill Murray, Liev Schrieber, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, and Bryan Cranston. As an added bonus, the entire movie is presented as a Japanese film that's been, shall we say, modified for an American audience. When the mayor gives one of his many speeches, for example, a translator sits off in the wings, speaking his words in English. A note tells us that the dogs' barks have been automatically translated to English, too. But lest you think this is a culture appropriation issue, the original Japanese written language is employed throughout. In short, great entertainment no matter who you are.",Isle of Dogs
38,stevendbeard,Quirky,7,13 April 2018,"I saw ""Isle of Dogs"", starring the voices of Bryan Cranston-Power Rangers_2017, Godzilla_2014; Edward Norton-Collateral Beauty, Moonrise Kingdom; Bill Murray-Rock the Kasbah, Dumb and Dumber to and Scarlett Johansson-Ghost in the Shell, Home Alone 3.
I guess it depends on your fondness for Wes Anderson movies on whether you enjoy this movie or not-I do like them and I did enjoy this one. The Houston born Wes Anderson is the director and some of his other gems include The Grand Budapest Hotel, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Darjeeling Limited. This is his second stop motion animated movie-Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first-and it is set in Japan, about 20 years into the future. The mayor of Japan has banned all dogs to an island where they dump their trash-In fact, it is called Trash Island. It seems there is a canine disease-not affecting the cats-that has people worried. The mayor's nephew just happens to have a dog-the mayor is a cat lover-and is one of the first dogs sent to the island. The 12 year old nephew goes to the island, in search of his beloved pet and that's when he meets Edward, Bill, Scarlett and Bryan, all abandoned dogs that agree to help him find his pet. All the people in the movie-with a couple of exceptions-speak Japanese and all the dogs speak English. There are lots of other voices you might recognize-I checked the credits on some that I wasn't sure of-including Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Yoko Ono. If you read the end credits like I do, there is one cast member that says, Anjelica Huston as Mute Poodle. It is a quirky movie, but if you like quirky.... I must mention, I don't think it would be quite suitable for smaller children. There is a pack of dogs that are known as cannibals because when they were starving, they decided to dine on a fellow dog. There are also dogs that have been experimented on and they are shown in different degrees of, well, experimentation-missing limbs, eyes, etc.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violent images and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.
I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Isle of Dogs
39,drqshadow-reviews,"Anderson's Dog-Venture is Creatively Adept, But Also Slow and Wearying",5,20 September 2018,"Wes Anderson goes back to stop-motion puppets, using the same team he last employed in The Fantastic Mr. Fox. As with any Anderson film, it's meticulously composed and ornately decorative, peppered with spots of dry humor and awkward bits of stumbling dialog. It treasures the in-between moments and personal spoils, often at the expense of greater rewards.It's sufficiently quirky and offbeat, but I had trouble getting emotionally attached, which is odd as that's usually one of the director's greatest strengths. Everyone's just so damned somber and drawn all the time. Understandable, given they've been exiled to a landfill island and slated for extinction, but still. Give us a little flavor when you're fighting robot canines or riding a suspended mine car through a raging inferno. A fun concept and another visual showpiece for the highlight reel, but in the end it's rather dull and monotonous.",Isle of Dogs
40,CubsandCulture,Focus on minutia robs film of stronger impact,7,13 December 2018,"Anderson's existentially delightful film is at once a wonderful world of twee detail and charming whimsy and a story that gives more humanity to dogs than the nonwhite characters whose culture Anderson was inspired by. It takes a lot of Gaul or myopic fixation for an American to make a film about how the Japanese are rounding up the unfairly maligned minority. It is the same sort of blindness that allows a literal whitewashing of a character to be played off as a throw away gag. This sort of missing the forest from the tree ends up robbing Dogs of much emotional impact. With its White Savoir the film is close to obscene.Nonetheless, the film;s overall constructed feel is at once hysterically surreal and helps hides the narrative warts. The narrative goes places you wished it wouldn't go but boy does it go there in style. The animation is simply absorbing and deeply impressive to look at. Everything is has that just-so perfection that is Anderson's trademark.I am not really sure why the film was set Japan, apart from Anderson's various homages. There use of English for the dogs is rather off putting when you think about various implications of the narrative. But this film is very enjoyable to watch and it is quite funny.If only Anderson saw the big picture isn't just the tiny details being right.",Isle of Dogs
41,iquine,Talking Dogs With Depth,9,21 November 2018,"(Flash Review)Wes Anderson has created another Wes Anderson-styled film. Another animated one similar to Fantastic Mr. Fox. This story is about a cat loving politician who orders all dogs removed from the city and transported to Trash Island due to a rapidly spreading canine flu. A humane secondary plan of finding a cure is stamped down. Saddened by the separation from his pet, a boy pilot crash lands on the island looking for his dog. While he and a group of discarded dogs search for his pet they begin to learn about themselves during the expedition. As expected, this is full of clever and sharp dialog with an abundance of dry wit humor. This is a nice tale with well-developed characters so you begin to actually care what happens to them.

Though the conclusion of this animated feature suggests that the latter veins of vile virtually-useless venal villains are best scavenged for their body parts, one wonders if this actually would be a viable option in Real Life. Would it make any sense to slap a misused kidney or liver from a current geriatric Cabinet Secretary into the mostly pristine mortal coil of a 12-year-old? I think not. Be that as it may, ISLE OF DOGS offers we beleaguered patriots of Today the hope that the present Bloated Billionaires Administration under which we presently suffer will soon collapse from the weight of its own multitudinous lies, prevarications, and falsehoods. ""Mayor Kobayashi"" of ISLE OF DOGS' ""Megacity"" spends the first 99% of this film fighting science, disseminating false ""facts,"" and thwarting Progress.

45,kluseba,The greatest animation movie in a decade,8,25 July 2018,"Usually, I'm not a big fan of animation movies but Isle of Dogs certainly deserves the praise it gets. I would even consider it the best animation movie since the brilliant Wall-E ten years ago. I predict this movie is going to win at least one Academy Award next year.There are several elements that make this film stand out. First of all, the stop-motion animation manages both to honor influential animated films and series of the sixties and seventies and to develop some stylish retro-chic that makes the movie look fresh. The numerous references to Japanese culture in form of clothes and settings, drinks and foods as well as spoken and written language are quite charming. The story is interesting enough as well and follows a group of dogs who help the orphaned nephew of a tyrannic mayor who wants to exterminate dogs find his vanished guard dog. The film teaches values such as courage, democracy, freedom, friendship and resilience. Its messages are important for children but also apply for adults. Despite its intelligent plot and intriguing intentions, Isle of Dogs is a movie that remains entertaining and easy to digest. The dog characters complement one another in a humorous way and especially Chief is quite sympathetic as tough dog with a soft core. The human characters aren't as detailed but also rather charming, especially the resilient Atari and the courageous Tracy. The fates of dogs and humans will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.There isn't much to criticize about this beautiful movie. The plot could have been a little bit more creative and surprising. The movie might moralize a little bit too much here and there. There are a few too many flashbacks that break the movie's flow. It's debatable whether choosing an American exchange student as one of the protagonists in a story taking place exclusively in Japan was truly necessary. However, all those things are only minor details that won't take away from your enjoyment of this superb flick.If there is a movie for the whole family to watch this year, it has to be the beautiful yet profound Isle of Dogs. Wes Anderson's latest project is emotional, entertaining and intelligent and should please the brains and hearts of old and young cinephiles alike. If even someone who usually doesn't appreciate animation movies a lot like me likes this film quite a lot, I guess it must be something truly memorable.",Isle of Dogs

A boy Samurai appears and beheads the Baron and dogs are domesticated rather than destroyed.Forward to 2038, the malevolent Mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi signs a decree deporting dogs to Trash Island due to an outbreak of Dog Flu which results in Snout Fever. Professor Watanabe show's he is close to a cure for this virus but is ignored. The Mayor's 12 year old nephew Atari flies to the island in search of his beloved guard dog spots. He joins up with a pack of smart dogs who join him in his quest.Back in Megasaki City pupils involved in a school magazine investigate the whole affair including an ace hacker and a foreign exchange student from the US suspect a conspiracy is afoot regarding the whole affair. THis belief is strengthened when the Mayor claims his nephew has been kidnapped by the dogs.Good fun even if the school students get a bit too cutesie at times. The dogs are well imagined, most with back stories. Trash Island has been devastated by earthquakes, tsunami, volcanic explosions and power plant failures. It has deserted fun parks, factories, waste disposal plants and a dog experimental laboratory.It is rumoured that cannibalistic aboriginal dogs roam part of the island. This is the devastated landscape which Atari must traverse with his canine companions.An all star cast provides the voices for the dogs and humans.

Animation work is quite innovative, with mixed techniques but prevailing stop motion. Great actors dub the characters and the idea of humans speaking Japanese with almost no subtitles, whereas dogs speak English, was very smart. The distopian story is very nice and works very well as a fable for fake-news authoritarian governments, and neonazi and neofascist aimed rule (problems the world, including my Brazil, is seeing increasingly).

49,jadepietro,Puppy Love,9,11 April 2018,"GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An inventive animated film with much wit and a pedigree of mischief too.JIM'S REVIEW: I am enamored by animated films. As a child, I was amazed that a series of drawings was able to ""move"" and created an emotional story of worth. Back then, (we're talking the 50's / 60's), the animated full-length feature was a rarity with the Disney Studio being the primary source of that genre of entertainment. Nowadays, with computer generated and stop motion movies being more common, and many studios venturing into state-of-the-art animation techniques like the reliable Pixar Studio and Aardman Animations, among other lesser sources, the allure may have faded somewhat and the results from the many prolific studios vary in quality, if not quantity. It seems that either the visuals overtake the narrative or vise-versa. It is so rare that both meld successfully into the final product. Wes Anderson's quirky and clever animated feature, Isle of Dogs, almost makes that leap of story and visual balance. It has scenes of total brilliance and political satire done with imagination and flair, even if the story ultimately wears thin and settles for a contrived ending to please the masses.The simple tale relates the story of a boy searching for his lost canine friend. Set in the distant future in Japan, dogs have been banned and shipped to a trash heap island due to a contiguous outbreak presumedly caused by dogs. One of the first to be banished is Spots, owned by an orphan called Atari. This boy is determined to get his pet back and goes off to rescue him. He lands on Trash Island and is befriended by a quintet of raggedy mutts, namely, Rex, King, Duke, Boss, and Chief. All journey together to find Spots and uncover more than they bargained for.Written by Roman Coppola, Jason Swartzman, Kunichi Nomura, and the director, the film takes its storytelling quite seriously depicting a ""love cats, hate dogs"" polarized society, an Orwellian world that is controlled by a fascist dictator. The dogs are literally the underdogs representing the oppressed class. All of this dramatic structure is heavy-handed and in need of a few re-writes to clarify characters and the events that transpire. Still, the stop motion animation is most skillfully rendered, especially in its superb details of discarded refuse and hand drawn backgrounds. There is much to admire from its color palette, stylish compositions, and imaginative littered landscapes.Mr. Anderson's vision focuses on this dystopian place using aerial views, shadows, and lighting to maximum effect. He injects this adult-oriented film with subtle touches of unexpected wit and droll humor (ticks scurrying in the dog's fur to show the squalor, a boy's bloody face with a impaled metal rod becoming an annoying yet forgotten appendage, shadows of figures quickly traveling against mounds of detailed garbage, a dead fish head still moving on a nearby plate as lunch is being prepared, etc.) These slightly macabre moments give the film an indelible sense of glee and mischief and show off this off-kilter universe. Another clever conceit is that the human words, mostly spoken in Japanese, is explained through translation while the dog's ""barks"" are the main English dialog. Whimsy is Mr. Anderson's forte and his penchant for good spirited fun.The voiceover work is uniformly strong. Koyu Rankin voices Atari and Liev Schreiber is his friend, Spots. Vocal support comes from Bryan Cranston (displaying a wonderful tone of ongoing despair) Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Murray as the Canine Five. Other star-studded friends of the director add their talents in minor roles: Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, Greta Gerwig, F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Courtney B. Vance, and Yoko Ono.Isle of Dog is a masterful ménage of lovely animation and unique storytelling that make this movie going experiences a howling success.

Director:
 Wes AndersonWriters:
 Wes Anderson (story by), Roman Coppola (story byStars:
 Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton 
LIKES: Animation: With computer graphics dominating the field, it's nice to see a deviation from the traditional Disney and DreamWorks presentation. Isle of Dogs unique design is the most recognizable component of the film, a well-crafted blend of various Japanese art styles cooked and mixed into a cuisine of delightful fun. All the characters have a variety of qualities and traits to their models, many standing out in some concept that defines the very character you get hooked on. The stop motion like quality adds charisma and comedy to the mix, giving the movie a nice originality. Yes, it is not the smoothest animation to come out of the woodwork, but all the personality behind it makes up for it. The Voice Acting: With the cavalcade of stars taking up ranks in the voice acting department, Isle of Dogs is well equipped for voicing their characters. Each star or starlet brings some component to the movie, be it comedic, blunt presentation, mysterious allure, or a heartfelt emotional speech to inspire and move. The writing set these unique cast members up for some hilarious bickering/bashing one another, developing a relationship that at times feels like a dysfunctional family of Full House and other times like Lord of The Flies. Certainly, this voice work deserves some award recognition, but enjoy everything it has to bring. The Comedy: My friend and I could not stop laughing at all the comedic relief packed into this movie. As mention previously, the voice acting has a lot to do with bringing the full comedic punch of the writing, with Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, and Bryan Cranston being my particular favorites. Past the writing, the movie's pokes at a lot of cultural stigmatisms, references, and stretches of the imagination that many animate features take. And even the sheer ridiculousness of the movie is fun to laugh out, classy jabs that work well and fit into the story. The Story/Culture: Isle of Dogs is certainly the odd story to say the least, the tale really has a lot of gusto behind it. Its presentation is certainly clever, feeling much like a TV soap opera with a little anime and political thriller all rolled into one. These genres may not seem like they would mix well, but Anderson and company have managed to tie these components together in an entertaining manner. As the Japanese culture of modern and ancient Japan clash, the various principles and ethic codes come to a full boil as Atari's Odyssey adventure progresses across the wasteland that is trash island. The emotional fire, the tension of friendship, and even the corruption that lies beneath it all, were all well-balanced to the point of keeping things engaging and entertaining. 
DISLIKES: (More like limitations)More Time with Other Characters: We got a decent balance of characters with this cast, but I would have liked more time with some of the other dogs. Chief and Spots have a majority of the screen time, and while the other dogs got their moments to shine, I wanted more of their involvement in the story. The ending in particular could have used their individual skills to get to the end game. The Pace: The movie has a little inconsistency in regards to how it moves when presenting the story. Some parts move excessively quick, while others are a little drawn out and oversaturated with their odd eccentricities and banter. Eventually the pace smooths out, but the movie took a little while find it's rhythm and get to the ideal mix of all the story qualities. The Limited Audience: This movie's uniqueness is not going to be for everyone and that limitation is going to be difficult to overcome. The Movie is not going to be for everyone, and if you aren't ready for odd criteria, specific cultural references, and drier senses of humor. So therefore, this movie is not going to expand to a lot of people and be lost to other, more widespread audience members. The VERDICT: Isle of Dogs is certainly one of the more unique movies to hit the silver screen, trading traditional presentation for an angle that most don't play. It's got culture, story, fantastic design, and voice acting that really pops, locks, and in many cases rocks. However, the movie is not going to be for everyone, as the odd style, dryer comedy, and cultural references may not be appreciated by many. For those liking this unique style though, this is the movie for you and certainly one of Anderson's better films to hit the screen. So definitely check this out in theaters while you can and enjoy getting creeped out by the penetrating gaze of most of the cast. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",Isle of Dogs
52,invisibleunicornninja,This movie is fantastic.,9,16 April 2018,"This movie may not be aimed towards younger kids, but there was some kid sitting behind me in the theater who looked to be around 5-6. He was engaged enough to make comments throughout it where he complimented the animation and was nervous about the characters when they were in peril. I can see how a lot of younger kids would be bored by this movie though. Plot - In different hands, this movie could've been a dumb, goofy comedy, but the final result here is a very serious movie. It is extremely entertaining, but don't expect to be laughing too much. Most of the only jokes are in the trailer. The seriousness isn't a bad thing, just something to think about before you watch it. Animation - The animation is absolutely fantastic. Of the whole movie, there is only a single shot where the animation looks a bit dumb. Other then that, the whole movie looks awesome. Characters - Most of the characters aren't developed a lot, but its still entertaining. Voice Acting - Some people may find the flat line delivery boring, but I think it fits the tone of the movie and I enjoyed it.Everything about this move is extremely well done and I'd highly recommend it.",Isle of Dogs
53,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Isle of Dogs,7,11 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs (my latest review) is the best form of animation. Stop-motion animation that is. As a film about a young boy searching for his dog (via an island where illness outbreak pups are banished to), ""Isle"" is a technical triumph. It has director Wes Anderson using his required trademarks to make eye-popping grandeur a complete understatement. This is Anderson's ode to fictional Japan, his form of made-up dystopia that he was born to put out. In Isle of Dogs, Wes gives us a rinse, repeat cycle of wide-angle clips, close-ups, various title cards, random flashbacks, and whip pans. Sure his narrative is a little choppy, his storytelling way overzealous, and his plot points too aplenty for a flick rounding out to 101 minutes. Still, ""Isle"" is a midnight stoner's dream, a feast of lushly framed scenes so detailed and itemized that you can't help but demand a second viewing. For instance, check out a sequence where an animated chef is making sushi with a poisonous wasabi. Also, check out a depiction of a garbage bag filled with dumpster diving food. Finally, look for a sequence where a doctor persona is performing a blow-by-blow kidney transplant. Anderson is wise here to give us his signature camera shots from up above. It wouldn't work any other way. All in all, the characters in Isle of Dogs are voiced by the likes of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, and Liev Schreiber. Schreiber and Cranston handle the majority of the dialogue while everyone else sort of fades in and out. In truth, my favorite Wes Anderson film of all time has always been Rushmore. ""Isle"", with its beautified dirtiness, its form of deafening taiko drumming, its tongue-in-cheek squeak, and its V for Vendetta banality, comes in at a close second. Rating: 3 stars.",Isle of Dogs
54,rannynm,A movie to be reckoned with - incredible animation from Wes Anderson,10,12 April 2018,"Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is a movie to be reckoned with. This incredibly unique piece of stop motion animation is totally different from the norm of today's films. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, it stars the voices of Bryan Cranston as Chief, Edward Norton as Rex, Bill Murray as Boss, Liev Schreiber as Spots, Bob Balaban as King, Scarlett Johansson as Nutmeg and Jeff Goldblum as Duke. It also stars Koyu Rankin as the young boy, Atari. It is the second animated film from Wes Anderson, after the wonderful Fantastic Mr. Fox.In future Japan, where dogs are viewed as savage and disease ridden creatures, a young boy, Atari, searches for his dog, Spots. This dystopian world, created by his guardian, Mayor Kobayashi, disparages dogs but worships cats. Atari defies his guardian and along the way befriends some loyal, passionate pooches who help him on his fateful journey of finding his lost dog. One thing I particularly adore about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is his irreverent humour and creativity. It's almost as if Anderson has a patent on an new genre of filmmaking, that's entirely his own. During the making of this film, Anderson was influenced by his love for Japanese cinema and two of the most monumental Japanese directors - Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki. In an interview about his many influences for the film, he states ""with Miyazaki you get nature and you get moments of peace, a kind of rhythm that is not in the American animation tradition..."". Later on, Anderson explains that during the scoring of the film he and his composer, Alexandre Desplat, had to rethink their approach to the soundtrack because the movie longed to be quiet. He later specifies that this aspect of the film also comes from Miyazaki. The stop motion animation style pairs perfectly with the pure grittiness of its creativity. In most animated films you don't hear the roughness or coarseness of the actors' voices, but in Anderson's film you do and it is the most lifelike. Also, despite the humor, Anderson doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the story. His films are always truthful and cut to the heart of the matter. I recommend Isle of Dogs for ages 12 to 18, due to its violence and sophisticated humour. Younger kids might not understand the ironic tone. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for bringing an incredibly unique vision to the mostly mundane animation of today. Reviewed by Clayton P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

55,Rob_Taylor,"Dull, overlong and superficial",5,24 June 2018,"It's not hard, after watching Isle of Dogs, to imagine the moment when Wes Anderson decided to set this movie in his imaginary Japan. You can see him nodding excitedly (if he ever gets excited) and then... googling ""Japanese tropes"".Isle of Dogs (IoD) is a rather cringe-inducing look at a Westerner's idea of what Japan is all about. Haiku's, Samurai, Cherry Blossoms... you name it. If you've ever associated something with Japan, Wes Anderson has put it in this film.Now, I'm not one to get offended on behalf of others, but when every on-screen explosion is a tiny mushroom cloud, you have to ask yourself what the hell is going on? Not that IoD is offensive, but it does make you cringe. A lot.Outside of the Japanese depiction, is the film any good?Well, it is...serviceable, at best. What lets it down are the trademarks of Anderson's movies... dull dialogue delivery, pointless dialogue, and a focus on things other than the story itself.Worse still was the usual poor marketing of the movie. In this case, I get the reason for the deception foisted off in its trailers. How else are you going to get people to go watch a 100 minute movie where the most excitement you will have will be going to the bathroom. So they painted it as a fun adventure, perhaps even suitable for kids. Suffice to say, if you bring any small children to this film you will have issues. This is a movie not designed for kids. Not unless they are heavily sedated, at any rate.Then there is the music. Whilst it definitely evokes a Japanese theme throughout, it is at first dull, then later on annoying and intrusive. At no pint, however, does it really add anything to the movie. It is just... there.The combination of all these things leads to a movie that is as dull and lifeless as the stop-motion figures themselves. There are many good tellers of animated stories... Anderson is not one of them. A triumph of visual style over substance that will leave you wanting... to check your watch every few minutes to see how much longer it has left..SUMMARY: Usual Anderson tropes. Flat delivery. Pointless dialogue. Annoying music. Tiresomely trite Japanese portrayal. Story that is dull and unengaging. Avoid unless you are a fan of Anderson's work.",Isle of Dogs

57,mhorg2018,A GREAT Movie.,10,13 April 2018,"Let me be honest, first, I don't care for Wes Anderson movies. I didn't care for The Fantastic Mr. Fox. But I do love Stop Motion animation, and have since I was a little kid. O'Brien, Harryhausen, Tippett. All are gods to me. Isle of Dogs is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Simply brilliant and enthralling. Not a dull moment in the movie and it at parts, hysterically funny, full of pathos, and enjoyable. One can't take their eyes off the screen. A wonderful, fun, must be seen movie. Fox Spotlight should be promoting the hell out of this movie. If this doesn't unseat Disney/Pixar for best animated movie this year, then the Oscars are a joke! This is #1 on my must buy Blu Ray list. Thank you Wes, from Dog lovers everywhere.",Isle of Dogs
58,nancyldraper,Much better than I expected,7,11 February 2019,"It's amazing what an Oscar nomination will yield in convincing one to watch a movie that I never had any intention of seeing (the trailers for this movie were most uninspiring - filthy dogs on a trash island - ugh!). My first response 1) this isn't as bad as I feared, then 2) this is an all-star voice cast, and then 3) this is a decidedly quirky story. The strangeness of this screenplay may be what earned it its nomination. The stop-animation is flawless. Performances are layed back and chill well befitting the style of writing we expect of Wes Anderson.

59,krocheav,Isle of Dogs - Leads You On A Curious Journey,9,5 February 2019,"Anyone who likes a different kind of storytelling should find something to appreciate in this offbeat, but winning movie. Regardless of being a stop motion 'fairytale' (?) there's enough gritty realism and unexpected themes explored to make this quite compelling indeed! Others, I feel have looked too deeply into the political and racial aspects of the, at times, rather emotional situations covered by writer/director Wes Anderson (even though there are certainly many astute observations to be considered). Alexandre Desplat's excellent and highly inventive music score adds much mood and movement to overall proceedings. While I expect, ""Isle of ""Dogs"" won't be everyone's choice of entertainment it will please and intrigue more than it may alienate.I had not read anything about this movie before watching and was convinced it was a Japanese production - only to be surprised at the finish to find it was mostly American. Highly recommended for a somewhat sardonic, dark and insightful journey into imagination and would expect it should garnish some attention at this year's Global Awards. The visuals by British cinematographer Tristan Oliver are standout.While not many may remember a British animated film by Richard Williams from '58 titled: ""The Little Island"" much of the humorous visual style of ""Dogs"" bears a resemblance, and makes this rare featurette worth seeking out - simultaneously very funny and serious.",Isle of Dogs
60,areatw,A typically bizarre Wes Anderson movie,8,22 July 2018,"Although I was never much of a fan of Wes Anderson's previous hit films, a short 30 second trailer clip of 'Isle of Dogs' was enough to convince me that I had to see it. In typical Wes Anderson fashion, this film is barking mad (pardon the pun) - a weird and truly unique film that will leave you scratching your head wondering how, and why, somebody would come up with such an obscure idea for a movie.'Isle of Dogs' is, if my memory serves me right, the fourth Wes Anderson movie I've seen, but the first that I can truly say I really enjoyed. The others, while I appreciated them for what they were, just weren't my cup of tea. I loved everything about 'Isle of Dogs' though, from the silly storyline to the hilarious characters and stunningly crafted visuals and animation. This is a movie well worth watching, even for those who aren't much of a fan of Anderson's previous films like myself.",Isle of Dogs

62,proud_luddite,Rather good,7,11 July 2018,"In the fictional Megasaki City in Japan, all dogs have been exiled to Trash Island due to reports of a canine flu virus. A young boy travels to the island to try to find his pet dog. In the meantime, various conflicts and alliances occur on both the city and the island. ""Isle of Dogs"" is a stop-motion animated film and is mostly in the English language with some Japanese. It is a U.S./German co-production.Like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", director Wes Anderson has led a creative team (including an all-star cast) that is accompanied by very clever and enjoyable animation. The story is also well structured with interesting twists and surprises even though the eventual climax - and its build-up - seem to lack clarity and excitement at times.But it stands out mainly due to its characters especially the dog Chief, voiced by Bryan Cranston. As the occasionally self-appointed leader of a gang of five male dogs, Chief stands out as he is a stray dog compared to his peers whose previous life circumstances were relatively privileged. His outsider perspective and attitude provide many of the movie's greatest insights.",Isle of Dogs
63,aciessi,"Sit, Stay, Enjoy.",10,2 April 2018,"Whether he knows it or not, Wes Anderson is an animator trapped in a filmmaker's body. Like Tim Burton, he's a visionary director with a peculiar, oddball style of telling stories. But when he gets into the realm of stop-motion animation, there is no limit to where his imagination takes him. Isle of Dogs is one of the most spectacularly beautiful pieces of animation in a very long time. As to where this falls in Anderson's filmography, I'd put it near the top and quite a few spots above The Grand Budapest Hotel, a film that's perceived to be his masterpiece. It wasn't, but this one just might be it.From the opening shot, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. I let go of every perceivable reservation and let Anderson's entire universe overtake me. What a universe it is.Somewhere in the not so distant future, a Japanese city called Megasaki is run by cynophobic, cat supremacist, fascist, Mayor Kobayashi. He institutes extreme measures of quarantine and expulsion of dogs from his city after a curious case of dog flu threatens his citizens. The dogs, now stranded on Trash Island, forage and try to stay alive yet seem to communicate like self-aware entities in an old Woody Allen comedy. The five dogs we meet are voiced by Anderson favorites (Norton, Murray, Goldblum, Balaban) with the exception of Bryan Cranston, who plays the feral stray dog leader, Chief. The designs of these dogs all have something to gaze in wonder at. For example Boss (Murray) has dark button eyes and wears an adorable sweater as the former mascot of a local junior baseball team. Another dog we see later in the film named Jupiter, played by F. Murray Abraham, sports a canteen of ""turpentine brandy"" around his neck. All are furry and all are downright cuddly. Torpedoing from Megasaki is a stowaway child pilot named Atari Kobayashi, on a mission to rescue his beloved dog Spots (Liev Schrieber) from Trash Island. Meanwhile, an underground resistance of the Mayor and his iron fisted rule is growing in Megasaki. Leading it is an American foreign exchange student, Tracy, played by Greta Gerwig. I could only describe her as a cross between Norma Rae and Little Orphan Annie. She uncovers a conspiracy which proves indefinitely that the epidemic of dog flu was invented by the government in order to eradicate Dogs as a species, Nazi style.With an engaging plot like that and such richly constructed environments and characters such as these, nearly everything should go right and it does. It's 100 minutes of bliss. It never deviates from Wes Anderson's signature narrative style which at times has proven to be grating in live-acting. But in the world of stop-motion animation, it's enchanting and it fits him like a glove. I found myself to be the only person laughing out-loud in the theater, not because the movie is deliberately trying to make me laugh, but out of sheer joy at the amount of fun Anderson had in making this. But we had to wait 10 years to see him dare to venture into this world again. Here is a word of advice. Wes, animation is your greatest strength. Keep doing it.",Isle of Dogs
64,rockman182,Isle of Dogs (2018),7,31 March 2018,"There was a time where I disliked Wes Anderson films. Then I saw The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited and then turned the corner. I was a fan of his previous stop motion animated effort, The Fantastic Mr. Fox. So as soon as I heard about The Isle of Dogs I was excited to see it. I'm not sure if its better than Fantastic Mr. Fox or ranks among Anderson's best but Isle of Dogs is smart, funny, and quirky. That's what we've come to expect from Wes Anderson.The backdrop for the film is a dystopian Japan, where a dog flu virus has spread throughout dogs. The mayor has decided that the best course of action is to send all dogs to Trash Island. Meanwhile, a cure for dog flu is being tested and the nephew of the mayor travels to Trash Island to find his recently banished dog, Spots. The film has a bevy of voice actors, a few of who have previously worked with Wes Anderson.I'm not going to comment on the ""cultural appropriation"" that has taken wind recently. You be the judge on that and form your own opinion. The film's animation is great as expected. That was the strongest part of Fantastic Mr. Fox. The stop motion is beautiful as expected. The film keeps that general Wes Anderson charm and has that slight humor that is a staple in this type of work. The film has very memorable sequences and a tightly constructed story that is told creatively.Its hard not to love these dogs in the film. Its a good fun time, which is what was needed. I respect Wes Anderson for adopting a certain style of film and exploring different avenues of technique in film to explore his talent. While, I don't think Isle of Dogs is among his very best, it'll charm many people and delivers the goods as it should. I love dogs!7.5/10",Isle of Dogs
65,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Full of Wes Anderson's charming cinematography but not too much else.,7,8 March 2019,"A few years ago, I got on a Wes Anderson kick. I practically watched his entire filmography to that point in one long binge-worthy day. After catching up, I felt I truly appreciated his quirky, orthogonal cinematography and deeply complex characters. I've essentially been a fan of his since Moonrise Kingdom (2012), so I was looking forward to his latest work, Isle of Dogs(2018). After all, he had proven his skill at stop-motion animation with The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and had received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) since then.Unfortunately, while Isle of Dogs carries Anderson's distinct style and charm, it felt a little watered down. Sure, the shots were full of their beauty and symmetry, and the story had its cute moments, but it mostly felt like he was on autopilot. Maybe the PG-13 rating was holding him back? I don't know. In most fiction, there is a suspension of disbelief, but setting this film 20 years in the future while still holding to the aesthetic of the antique (I doubt there will be nearly that many reel-to-reels in the future) seemed to backfire a little.I'll give Wes Anderson some credit, though: he did try something new by including the ""language barrier"" and adopting the Japanese style as much as he could. It also seems that stop-motion techniques have improved significantly since The Fantastic Mr. Fox, likely due to many of the same 3-D printing technologies used for Kubo and the Two Strings (2016). The mixture of 3-D stop-motion and 2-D animation in Isle of Dogs should also be commended. In the end, I think my main qualm with this film was that it was a smidge too predictable. Perhaps this was due to the standard McGuffin of the boy trying to be reunited with his dog.Full of Wes Anderson's charming cinematography but not too much else, I give Isle of Dogs 3.5 stars out of 5.",Isle of Dogs
66,RforFilm,Isle of Dogs is basically what would happen if Wes Anderson made a Studio Ghibli film. It's amazing,10,3 April 2018,"Wes Anderson has one of the most unique styles of modern cinema. His combination of specific color patterns, off kilter soundtracks, comedy, consistent still camera angles, and occasional reoccurring actors like Bill Murray and Edward Norton gives him the rare distinction of having movies that really don't resemble someone else's. I think that a lot of it comes from how even with a large cast, his movies manage to feel like small, unimportant independent movies...even though their still filled with passion. Wes Anderson has shown that he's not afraid to try out other genres ; his most prominent example being that of Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009. Fantastic Mr. Fox was his chance to not only do something more family friendly, but was his first (and as of 2018, his only) adaptation of another story. But unlike other animation styles of Disney and DreamWorks, Fantastic Mr. Fox embraced it's identity by combining stop motion that looked intentionally unclean, but still kept a lot of the typical Wes Anderson traits. The movie came out great and I'd had always wanted him to do another animated movie. Not only is Isle of Dogs another stop motion story, but one that's also original. Set in the near future in Megasaki City, Japan, an outbreak of dog flu is spreading amongst the canine population. Mayor Kobayashi decrees that all dogs are to be quarantined to a nearby trash island until a cure is found. Six months later, the dogs have formed a variety of tribes and packs, with the only goal of surviving. In one group, we have the leader Chief (played by Brian Cranston), Rex (played by Edward Norton), King (played by Bob Balban), Duke (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Boss (played by Bill Murray). All except for Chief had lives of families, celebrity, and comfort. Chief was merely a stray that became leader. About six months after the decree, a boy Atari Kobayashi crash lands his plane on the island, looking for his bodyguard dog Spots (played by Live Schreiber). Though the dogs can't understand his Japanese, they understand what he's looking for and agree to try and find him. Meanwhile, back on land, there is a conspiracy that the mayor doesn't want a cure found and would rather exterminate the dogs. Transfer student Tracy Walker (played by Greta Gerwig) tries to get some answers for her school newspaper. I'm happy to say that not only is Isle of Dogs a great movie, but it's an improvement on Fantastic Mr. Fox. Even though I like that movie as well, the latter film suffers from a story that seems to be focused on trying to be a crowd pleaser. Isle of Dogs doesn't talk down to people. In fact, I'd say the movie is a combination Japanese samurai, political thriller, and a little bit of a Woody Allen comedy. And yet it all still feels like it fits into Wes Anderson's style. The animation, which is clearly representing something like Raken-Bass, keeps a lot of the roughness featured in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Though you can tell that some things were touched up by computers, this is an example of good C.G.I, when it's merely used to remove strings. It's never overpowering and it maintains the ""unclean"" look that's still intentional. Each of the dogs look different and make it easy to tell who is who. There are even similar breeds that stand out thanks to the voice acting.Let's talk about the voice-overs. Wes Anderson is an actors director, who knows how to take advantage of each persons skills. He gets a quality mix of Brian Cranston's eccentrics and stern demeanor. This develops into a character that's troubled, but someone who could still be redeemed. Though we certainly get plenty of time with the other animals, Brian Cranston's character gets the most focus and rightfully so. What about the humans? Wes Anderson made the interesting decision to keep the majority of human cast speaking Japanese. A lot of it isn't even translated and were simply supposed to figure out what their feeling or tying to get across. This will definitely stress some audience people that want something more straightforward, though this creates more of a visual experience. I'd compare Isle of Dogs a lot like a silent movie with dialogue. I'll give this ten robot dogs out of ten. Isle of Dogs is more proof on why Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors. He's an artist whose not afraid to keep evolving his work to create something that's all his own. It's hard to imagine Disney or even Pixar making a story like this. It's heart felled, funny, interesting, and impressive. Go see this and then give our dog a hug.",Isle of Dogs

68,dave-mcclain,cute and clever but inconsequential,2,4 April 2018,"""Isle of Dogs"" (PG-13, 1:41) is a stop-motion animated adventure comedy directed and written by multiple Oscar-nominated auteur Wes Anderson and realized in his distinctive quirky style and with his usual stable of all-star talent. Anderson is best known for films like ""Rushmore"" (1998), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012) and his Best Picture Oscar-nominated ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014), but this isn't Anderson's first animated project. 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (also a stop-motion animated comedy) received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Typically unusual and eclectic, Anderson has said that ""Isle of Dogs"" is inspired both by the 1960s and 70s holiday specials produced by Rankin/Bass - and the films of legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.In the near future, Japan's people are concerned about an overabundance of stray dogs - and the possibility of a rampant canine flu affecting humans. The leader of Megasaki City, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), who comes from a long line of cat lovers, signs an order banishing all dogs to Trash Island, starting with Spots (Liev Schreiber), the pet and guardian of the Mayor's orphaned nephew and ward, 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin). Atari then steals an airplane and crash lands (with only minor injuries) on Trash Island when he is discovered and helped by a self-proclaimed ""pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs"", led by the human-averse Chief (Bryan Cranston) and including the more timid Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Boss (Bill Murray) and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). As those five dogs fight off other dogs for territory - and some humans sent to retrieve Atari - and then lead him on a dangerous and uncertain cross-island odyssey trying to find Spots (if he's even still alive), there's a lot happening back in Megasaki City. A scientist called Professor Watanabe (Arika Ito), who has an assistant named Yoko Ono (voiced by Yoko Ono), claims that he's perfecting a cure for the dog flu, but the powers-that-be aren't interested (to say the least). Meanwhile, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig), who stands with the city's dog lovers, develops a fascination with Atari's story (as reported on the news) - and an obsession with uncovering what's really going on.""Isle of Dogs"" is creative and attractive, but not very enjoyable. It has Anderson's trademark adorable quirkiness, but the plot is so far-fetched (no pun intended) and irrelevant to anything going on in the world that the whole thing feels like a pretty pointless exercise. Limited cuteness - and quirkiness just for quirkiness' sake - is of limited entertainment value. ""C-""",Isle of Dogs

There's a scene on the eponymous Isle of Dogs where the main characters stumble upon the canine skeleton of a beloved household pet who starved to death in a locked cage. I love dogs and just the thought of that scene should reduce me to tears. I felt nothing, and that was my reaction to the entire movie. I didn't laugh or cry. I just didn't care. Cute dog puppets? Check. Anything else? Not much. I did love the taiko drum soundtrack, and hope to buy it. But taiko drumming has nothing to do with dogs. I also really liked the voice talent, including Bryan Cranston, who is just terrific and memorable as the voice of a tough stray dog, Jeff Goldblum, F. Murray Abraham, and Edward Norton. The plot is unnecessarily convoluted and violent, and told rather than shown. There is endless voiceover narration. ""And then this happened and then this happened and then this happened.""

Hands down. Wes Anderson works his magic and showcases his skill at set-building in every single scene. The choice of stop-motion allows Anderson an insane amount of detail. From individual hairs to random fleas that scurry, no piece of detail gets left out. Each scene is beautiful and stands out on their own. Colors and visuals and media styles mix and blend together to create a beautiful film. The animation is nothing less than captivating.But the film is more than a delight to the eyes, it's a delight to the ears as well. The music and sounds were perfect. Loved the music throughout. The voice cast was well selected. It's fun guessing which person is playing which character.The plot was unique and heartwarming. Who can't like a story about a boy and his dog? There are some suspenseful moments, it's a feel-good movie throughout.I enjoyed the nod to Japanese culture and Anderson's choice of not having subtitles. Though confusing at first, it increases the level of immersion. Double points for accurate Japanese. That's one area most American filmmakers neglect.I don't think any animated 2018 film could have topped this.5/5. I loved it. Sorry, cat-lovers.",Isle of Dogs
73,AhmedSpielberg99,"I love dogs, and I love Wes Anderson too!",8,21 June 2018,"There is no need to say that this movie is visually stunning, beautifully stop-motion animated, or that it has imaginative, creative, and above all that a heart-warming story, nor it's necessary to praise it for its witty visual humor using the setting, the symmetric cinematography, etc. Simply, because it's a Wes Anderson movie!What should be mentioned are the pros of this very movie. And, of course, Isle of Dogs, as any Wes Anderson movie, has what distinguishes it from any other Wes Anderson movie. In fact, there are three new pluses here. First, and foremost, the visually storytelling. Yes, I know it's not a new thing to say about a Wes Anderson movie, but there is no Wes Anderson movie, nor any stop-motion animated movie that has used its visuals to tell its story in this way. Specially, when you know that this movie has many scenes where there is no dialogue in English, just in Japanese, or where there are just Japanese subtitles!The second great thing about Isle of Dogs is the voice cast. Sorry Fantastic Mr. Fox, I love you even more, but here the cast really adds up to the movie. The cast isn't star-studded just because it's a Wes Anderson movie, but every single actor, or actress, really made every character feels distinctive. Bryan Cranston, who voices Chief, is easily the best. His vocal performance here is undeniably one of the best in any animated movie from the last, say, five years. But really all the cast shines in this movie. Edward Norton is my second favorite.At last but not least, comes the music score from the Oscar winner, Alexandre Desplat. It has some Western touch in it, along with a traditional Japanese music. What a wonderful soundtrack! It really sticks in my mind long after watching the movie!.As I mentioned above, I prefer Fantastic Mr. Fox to Isle of Dogs. That's because Isle of Dogs, unlike any other Wes Anderson movie, is convoluted for its own good. That didn't hurt the movie as whole, except at the third act, which is quite rushed and messy. Also, I wanted the character of Atari to feel more life-like person. Because I felt he was overshadowed by the dogs. Nevertheless, Atari is a well-developed character.Isle of Dogs may didn't live up to my expectations, but still it is my favorite animated movie of 2018 so far!(8/10)",Isle of Dogs

The movie features an ensemble cast portraying humans and dogs. The movie follows a boy named Atari as he aims to find his bodyguard dog that has been exiled to trash island following an epidemic. On the island, the boy finds a group of dogs that help him locate his lost dog.Isle of Dogs is a gorgeous movie to look at. Although the animation may be basic, the movie does a good job with the visuals. Every dog, smoke, human, and background look distinct. The voice acting is also impressive with the ensemble cast chiming in and delivering lines with emotion. This mix of clean and distinct auditory and visual experiences makes the movie engrossing to follow.The story is incredibly basic. From the beginning of the movie, the story is already told and it plays out mostly in the same way. The movie contains too many characters that distracts from its main story. One of these is the foreign exchange student, Tracy. I enjoyed her character but much of her story took time away from Atari and the dogs on trash island. The movie uses a lot of flashbacks and side stories. All of this is fine to anyone who enjoys Wes Anderson but to anyone viewing his movies for the first time, they may be taken off guard.Overall, Isle of Dogs is a recommended movie. It features many common styles from Wes Anderson and is one of his more approachable movies.Grade: B",Isle of Dogs

77,MrDHWong,Yet another quirky look into the mindset of Wes Anderson and further proves his versatility as a filmmaker,8,12 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated film co-written and directed by Wes Anderson (Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel). Featuring the voices of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, and Bill Murray, it is yet another quirky look into the mindset of the acclaimed director and further proves his versatility as a filmmaker.In a futuristic Japan, a serious virus spreads throughout its dog population and as a result, all dogs are banished to an isolated place called ""Trash Island"". One day, a young boy named Atari sets off to Trash Island to search for his dog Spots, who was the first dog to be sent there during the banishment.Despite its cute presentation, Isle of Dogs is not a kid's film. Some of its dark themes and plot elements would likely be too complex and intense for most children under the age of ten, but anyone older should find plenty to enjoy. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Bryan Cranston as the stray dog Chief, who is responsible for a great deal of the film's dry humour. At times, however, the pacing feels off due to some strangely inserted flashback scenes. In addition to this, the lack of subtitles during some Japanese dialogue can be frustrating to anyone who doesn't understand the language, as an interpreter's translation becomes quite distracting when trying to understand the story. Director Wes Anderson's trademarks are once again on full display; his use of symmetrical framing, his unique use of colour, his interesting oddball characters, truly one of the most artistic filmmakers right now. One can only hope he continues making stop-motion animation films like this and Fantastic Mr. Fox.I rate it 8/10",Isle of Dogs
78,Alexander_Blanchett,"A true gem! Best Wes Anderson since ""The Royal Tenenbaums""",9,18 February 2018,"Another highlight in Wes Anderson's filmography. And honestly his best film since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". A wonderful and inspired animation comedy that lives from the typical Wes Anderson wit. The stop motion was perfect and it was created with many beautiful details. The voice performances were pitch perfect and the right actors were chosen. Bryan Cranston was terrific and so was Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Greta Gerwig, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton (tho her character deserved way more screen time. 
The soundtrack was fantastic, especially the score was perfectly created. The screenplay is among Wes Anderson's best work to date. I loved the editing and general look of it. There are nice and funny twists throughout the whole film. And in the end it has an important message to tell. Its a winner film and I am sure it will make its mark at the box office, with the critics and also at next years Oscars (especially in the best animation feature category). I already loved ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" but with ""Isles of Dogs"" Anderson was able to top it. Highly recommended.",Isle of Dogs
79,cliftonofun,Not Anderson's best...but that is a high bar,7,4 April 2018,"If you are a junkie for the Wes Anderson aesthetic (I am), this movie is well worth your time. From the large cast of quirky characters to the understated emotion/ comedy to the constant attention to detail, it checks every single box. It is beautiful and charming and whimsical. Is it actually entertaining? Well, that's a trickier question. Aesthetic alone isn't really enough, after all. You should have some genuine tension or suspense or concern for the characters. I never quite got there. As a result, this was not my favorite Anderson joint. Then again, that's a high bar, and I got my fix.",Isle of Dogs
80,elicopperman,I Love Dogs Too (Get It?),9,7 April 2018,"Wes Anderson is quite the unique filmmaker who is well known for his distinct visual and narrative style, as well as his offbeat sense of humor. When he entered in the realm of animation, he delivered his lovable sensibilities and tropes into a stop-motion film adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. So when it was announced that he was making another stop-motion animated feature, and his own original creation at that, it was a guarantee that Isle of Dogs would be a unique take on the talking dog movie, complete with huge admiration for the animal. Right off the bat, the animation is truly astounding from start to finish. Every frame has at least some attention to detail, complete with the fur moving as the characters move, water coming from the eyes, background sets and lights, aircraft, Japanese cultural architecture and art, and so much more. The designs of the characters look relatively simplistic but still look aggressive, rough and full of life, and their movements are well defined and energized, even when they're static. The way the animators were able to make the dogs talk is admirable enough, but the way they move as well is quite accurate given the limitations of real life dog movements. I'd say the opening does a great job bringing the audience into the experience, with Anderson's trademark framing establishing a great contrast between the fully lit Megasaki City and the heinous trash ridden island for dogs, and kudos to the small bits of hand-drawn animation done when the televisions are on.The general story itself centers around a young boy named Atari Kobayashi who goes in search of his dog Spots after all of the dogs in Japan are banished to an island from an illness outbreak. Along with a group of dogs who will do anything to not only help him but to also get off the island, the boy sets off on his quest to find his dog while the flu dilemma tries to be solved. If the visuals make one's eyes gouge, then the unpredictable outcomes of the story suck one in, as it's hard to figure out what will happen next, complete with flashbacks that unleash numerous upon numerous of layers nobody will see coming. There are several subplots that run afloat, such as a pro-dog activist group led by the stern foreign exchange student Tracy Walker, yet none feel out of place and are genuinely well woven together. In fact, when stakes and bloodshed do arise between the humans and dogs, one might reimagine the dark talking animal pictures Watership Down and The Plague Dogs, complete with the rough atmosphere and affection towards the animals themselves. From the heart, Isle of Dogs is truthfully about the bond between people and man's best friend, and when the dogs do interact with the good hearted people, it's hard not to just want to adopt a dog of your own those moments are so heartwarming.In addition, the humor is the usual deadpan dialogue common in Anderson's films, which help fit the cast. With a mix of Anderson's usual actors such as Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Scarlett Johansson and more for the dogs, and a Japanese cast for most of the humans, they all bring their own distinctive voices for the characters they play without overpowering them. While the dogs are humorous enough, the one dog given the most development in the film is Chief, as his relation with Atari helps bring the raw emotions and heart the film displays in its love for dogs. On another added note, considering that most of the humans are Japanese, Anderson cleverly chooses not to use subtitles when they speak. You know you're fantastic at storytelling when even those who don't speak the Japanese language will still understand what is going on, treating the viewers with respect and sincerity.Over the years, we've seen live-action filmmakers experiment with the art of animation, and Isle of Dogs definitely stands as one of the best examples of succeeding in such a task. With a suspenseful and captivating story, phenomenally crafted animation, a great cast of characters worth rooting for and genuine love and respect for Japanese culture, Wes Anderson has showcased his love for the unlimited possibilities that the medium of animation can accomplish through visual storytelling. Using stop-motion requires the upmost patience and attention to perfect, making the final product all the more admirable. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, animation, or dogs in general, seek this one out and give it your full love and attention, like any dog. Here's to more great animated features Wes Anderson hopefully makes in the future, and to more great animated films yet to come this year.",Isle of Dogs
81,ronakkotian,A feast for the eyes,8,4 July 2021,"Wes Anderson is a filmmaker that I truly love. His imagination and style amazes me like no other filmmaker has and Isle of Dogs is another beautifully crafted film by him.Isle of Dogs takes place in the city of Megasaki where an outbreak of dog flu leads to Mayor Kobayashi demanding every dog to be sent to Trash Island. On the island, a group of five dogs try to help a young boy named Atari find his lost dog, Spots.I have a real special place for stop motion animation. It's an art style that requires so much time and effort but if done right, the result can be dazzling. This is the second stop motion film Wes Anderson has made with the first being Fantastic Mr. Fox. I don't think this film is as good as Fantastic Mr. Fox but the one thing I believes it improves on is the animation. This is some of the best stop motion I've ever seen and I truly cannot imagine how much time went into creating the world of Megasaki. Anderson does such an incredible job building this world for us through the variety of set locations, rich colours and camera techniques. I loved the varying design of every dog we see in the film. They all look so different and are unique in their own right. Wes Anderson and the entire team of animators deserve a lot of praise for the amount of effort they put into creating this world as Isle of Dogs is a feast for the eyes.What also added to the worldbuilding was the treatment of Japanese culture. Anderson goes all out in the representation of the culture to make the world feel as authentic as possible to the audience. All the Japanese characters speak Japanese and the sets are very reminiscent of Japan. There is also a fantastic sushi making sequence where the animation is not only perfect but also adds to the immersion into this fictional world. The script is also delightful with many funny lines and whimsical moments whilst maintaining a level of seriousness. Despite being an animation, Isle of Dogs isn't strictly a kids movie. It deals with mature themes and involves politics into its story quite a bit but there are still parts of it that I can see kids enjoying. The voice acting by the ensemble is also fantastic. Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Frances McDormand, Greta Gerwig, Bob Balaban, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and the Japanese cast all do a terrific job with their roles. My favourite performance has to be the one given by Bryan Cranston as Chief.The only thing that bothered me was the lack of translation for the Japanese dialogue. Some of them are done either by subtitles or a translator in the film but a lot of them don't get a translation which does create a barrier between the audience and the Japanese characters especially the young boy Atari, whom we're supposed to care about.In spite of this, Isle of Dogs is an absolute joy to watch. I feel Wes Anderson has perfected his skill in stop motion animation here and has managed to create yet another imaginative and unique film.",Isle of Dogs
82,AvionPrince16,A brilliant movie in animation and colors,8,18 August 2021,"Isle of Dogs have a brilliant animation style, it let us discover the japan and we can appreciate all the effort of Wes Anderson who was inspired by miyazaki and other great japanese director. The movie was one of his kind and very enjoyable. I recommend it.",Isle of Dogs
83,garethcrook,I should be predisposed to love this.,7,9 July 2018,"The ever quirky and inventive Wes Anderson directing an animation, what's not to fall madly in love with. Yes it's got more stars in the voiceover cast than a whole summers worth of blockbusters. Yes it's effortlessly beautiful, gorgeous, exceptionally so. Yes it's brimming with dark humour, but most importantly it knows how to have fun. The dialogue though. Fast, witty, sharp, one line rolling over another with breakneck dexterity. The story is simple, delightful even. Boy seeks lost dog, on an island of dogs, that talk, live amongst garbage and oh some robodogs, from the municipal task force on the mainland that's looking for the boy, as are the slightly militant activists, that support the K9 uprising, see, simple! It's very entertaining and well worth a watch, however it's not quite Anderson at his very best.",Isle of Dogs
84,Azanspy,"60% funny, 40% disturbing.",7,9 September 2018,I liked Isle of Dogs. But I didn't like it as much as I liked other Wes Anderson movies. His director trademark is there but sometimes we feel it's too much.,Isle of Dogs
85,statuskuo,Trump Era Criticism Wrapped In Hope and Joy,10,24 March 2018,"This is a thinly veiled attack on Trump's position of eradicating the illegal immigrant debate. The solution they believe the Right want is to deport them to an island where you can rally society to murder them off later.
My response ""coooool"" do that. But to head-in-the-clouds artist such as Wes Anderson, the solution is peace and love. A great message yet...a child's view of the world. 
Though absolutely adorable and fun, my political stance has nothing to do with the fact that Anderson has made an innovative, nearly flawless movie that doesn't overcooked the term ""visionary."" It is EXACTLY that. An incredible blend of craft and storytelling which I've been starved for.
This is, in fact, a child's perspective of politics when adult thinking is magnified. Who we see are embodied in ""domesticated"" canines (cough...immigrants...cough) who have been displaced due to no fault of their own. Society has decided to back the cuter more accessible cat society, and therefore, dogs are deemed pests. They are deported (yes, I'm using that word) to an island that might as well be a leper colony. A young boy runs away to the island to search for the dog who offered comfort after an unfortunate event.
Friendship, kindness and empathy. A lot we can use today on both sides of your political leanings. I'm not suggesting you take away the same message. You can still enjoy as a simple diorama storytelling Anderson is known for.
You can't deny the artistry. Political discord or not.",Isle of Dogs
86,rubenm,"An outburst of wild, untamed creativity.",8,15 April 2018,"An outburst of wild, untamed creativity. That's the best way to describe 'Isle of Dogs'. You would almost think that director Wes Anderson's imagination is spinning out of control, judging from the number of ideas, storylines, gimmicks and visual treats in the film. Let's face it: at first sight the story sounds like something crazy. It is set in a Japanese city where the mayor decides to evacuate all dogs to a garbage island. His twelve year old nephew decides to rescue his favourite pet from the island, and hijacks a sputtering jet fighter. This leads to a series of wild adventures and weird developments. In a way it is indeed completely crazy - but just leave it to Anderson to make it work. In 'The Fantastic Mr Fox' Anderson showed how he could use stop motion animation to create animals who talked and acted like humans. In 'Ilse of Dogs' he brings this process to perfection. Helped by a top cast providing the voices, the dogs are great characters. Their personalities are much more developed than the humans in the story. This is accentuated by the Japanese dialogue of the humans, which is largely left untranslated. This puts the viewer in the position of the dogs, who can't understand humans either. Visually, 'Isle of Dogs' is wonderful. It's full of nice aesthetics, original viewpoints, and funny running gags. An example is the way Anderson shows the many dog fights: a large cloud of dust, with the fighting dogs largely invisible, apart from some body parts sticking out of the cloud.Sometimes there is almost too much going on at the same time. I had trouble paying attention to all the little visual details, while at the same time concentrating on the story (with some flashbacks adding complexity) and trying to recognize the voices of Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson (hers was easy). So if you go and see the movie, be warned: you can't lean back and relax, you have to stay alert at all times!",Isle of Dogs
87,andrewroy-04316,"Beautiful animation leads another feel-good, simple Wes Anderson movie",6,9 July 2018,"Just like Fantastic Mr. Fox, Isle of Dogs is a pleasant, easy to watch movie with an unremarkable plot. The premise was an interesting one, and the characters were original and fun. The excellent stop- motion animation was the best thing about the movie. The plot was a little thin, and several leaps (the sudden, easy political downfall of Kobayashi and the effect a couple kids had on the process, especially the hacker, seemed unrealistic), but I think with movies like this, you can't get bogged down in that and have to just appreciate the positive, fun movie presented. Like my previous Wes Anderson movies, I think of them as easy, happy, but not especially deep or thought provoking films.",Isle of Dogs
88,mjsreg,Awful hyped trash,4,20 August 2018,"I see the Anderson contingent will vote top marks for anything he produces regardless of merit This film has no merit. It is merely a very bad copy of many copies of Japanese animations that were trendy in the 70s. It is certainly nothing new.The story isn't written very well, although it had potential.

91,sweidman-28016,Wes Anderson is Great Again,8,28 October 2018,"Isle of Dogs review:Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's latest film. In Japan, there is an abundance of dogs and they're all getting sick with various diseases. Their solution to the problem is to send all dogs to Trash Island where they can scavenge for themselves. A little boy from Japan named Atari, the mayor's son, flies over to the island to look for his dog, Spots, and a group of dogs journey in help to find him. So this movie had a limited release I think about a month ago. It was given a lot of praise and buzz so last week there was a little bit of a wider release. This week it finally got a wide release. This movie was great! Unique and original. All of the voice actor were amazing. It's almost like the characters they had were a reflection of themselves. The stand out for me were Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, and finally Koyu Rankin as Atari. I like Wes Anderson's idea for stop motion. This is his second stop motion movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox being his first. Alexandre Desplat creates a great score, like he always does. The only flaws I had were that there was a side plot with one character that wasn't necessary, but I still liked it. Some scenes dragged on just a little too. Other than that I thought Isle of Dogs was a great movie and people should go see it, as our theatre only sold 5 tickets altogether last night.
My Grade: A-",Isle of Dogs
92,Offworld_Colony,Undeniably creative and fun. More eccentric but more streamlined than Fantastic Mr. Fox;,8,17 February 2020,"The sort of plot from the getgo that you know will be a wild ride in which the themes and points will emerge. Cleverly and respectfully appropriating Japanese cinema and art makes for a uniquely beautiful film and one that renders the audience in the same camp as the dogs: unable to understand everything except for tone and a few choice words.
There's something special about hearing these legendary voices behind these hand animated creatures, and Wes Anderson has, in the dogs, created a sort of very refreshingly sweet, honest pack of fun characters for this adventure that intentionally don't fit the stereotypes you would associate with Alphas.
There's very little not to like about this movie except for the fact that it's very much of little consequence. But I can imagine rewatching this movie many times, sometimes for the visuals and sometimes for the pitch perfect acting/dialogue/animation.",Isle of Dogs

94,TheDonaldofDoom,A grey yet colourful romp,8,26 January 2019,"It's hard to think how a film could be more ""Wes Anderson"" than Isle of Dogs, a uniquely animated film set in a stereotypical fictional Japan. The story at its heart is simple, but it is told with Anderon's signature style turning it into an unforgettable romp.It's the animation style that really draws you into this. It's not to everyone's taste, and that's understandable. It's more grey than Anderson's normal work (unsurprising for a film set on a trash island) but Anderson is able to find colour in all that bleakness. The characters, mostly dogs, are charismatic and full of life. The environments are depicted in such a unique way that makes them feel colourful despite their greyness. Landscapes are brought to life in delightful 2D, Anderson playing with space in his eccentric way. And of course, there's symmetry, everywhere.There's been a lot of controversy about the depiction of Japan but the intention here is to use the setting to give the film a unique feeling, which it definitely does. Sure, the plot could work in any other country but Wes Anderson chose to set it in Japan and there's nothing wrong with playing on it in an animation clearly not set in the real world. All in all, the depiction of Japanese culture is respectful. One interesting quirk is that the Japanese isn't subtitled, yet it's always so easy to understand the dynamic of a scene. Then there's the way rooms and stickers are labelled in English in a way that really obviously tells you about their function. That would be totally out of place in any kind of film other than this, but here it successfully communicates things to the viewer while generating a few laughs along the way.The characters all have interesting personalities, exaggerated by the goofy animation. Chief, a former stray voiced by Bryan Cranston, goes through the most interesting change throughout the film and many other dogs have interesting personalities too, although the other four of Chief's pack seem to be pretty interchangeable. Human characters are depicted well, the main one being a 12-year-old boy who is a bit cold on the outside but has a good heart. Meanwhile the villains are depicted with hilarious exaggeration, with delightfully insane faces when carrying out their evil plans.The main plot isn't that deep. It could be read as political commentary, but whether it is or isn't, it isn't particularly deep. It's best when simply admired for its eccentricity. Dogs being deported to an island! A flu invented specifically to make people hate dogs more! A dog genocide plan! It's crazy in a self-aware way. In the end though, it isn't the plot that makes Isle of Dogs so entertaining, but the way it's told.",Isle of Dogs

 As a movie lover all my life Ive seen every amazing move I can lay my hands on. But art Is In the eye of the beholder, each and every one have different tastes. I can appriciate the work behind Isle Of dogs. But that's where It stops.
The movie Itself Is a slog to sit through, I lost interest several times, I didn't find It funny, gripping, or any emotions whatsoever throughout.
It plays on the now very familiar Wes tropes. dogs walk to the left, dogs walk to the right. panorama from air etc. says something boring and that walks some more. I Just find the storytelling very uncompelling. It's just a mishmash that plays out as slapstick. dogs fighting robot dogs, boy got another metalpiece in brain.. wow, It's like how people love to praise Tarantino.. Also a director that makes the same boring movies over and over with only top grade actors. And.. you see why the movies then become a kind of what you expect, fanservice.
It plays out in whatever fashion It wants. We all know even from the first minute the dogs are gonna make It. So the tention Is gone, Then again.. It's a movie about dogs.. 
There's countless of stopmotion, puppetry, claymation and anime movies that really pull on the heartstrings or make you care for the characters displayed onscreen, or even make you cry, or being astounded with how beautifully crafted they are.. But Isle of dogs did nothing for me even If I love the japanese food culture and their customs.. It just doesnt work here.

97,markgorman,More Wes Anderson greatness in his homage to Japan.,8,5 April 2018,"Is it an ode to Millwall? Is it a statement of undying adoration for our four legged friends? Is it a literal description of his movie which features an archipelago where Japanese canine's are despatched offshore?Whatever it is Wes Anderson's latest minutiae-packed art form is a thing that inspires awe.You simply have to ADMIRE Wes Anderson's work because no-one (not even Guillermo Del Toro) approaches his craft with such precision, such forensic detail and because this latest epic is created in stop frame animation he has the opportunity to go microscopic; boy does he take it.I've never seen a stop frame animation so beautifully lit. Nick Park is no slouch but he prefers grand gestures, huge laughs and bold statement. Nothing like this detail. This art.That all makes it sound sterile, fussy perhaps, but it's not. Under the art lies a beating heart of humour and passion for our fine four legged friends that no-one else could get even CLOSE to emulating.It's a bit too long, I'll grant you that. And some think its Japanese-ist (I don't buy that). It's not a pastiche of Japan, as some say, it's an homage.The thrilling 'Taiko' drumming that sets the wheels in motion relentlessly underscores a movie that takes Japaneseness to thrilling heights of respect, with some humour of course - it's Wes.The, rather slight, story, is about a vile Japanese city-dictator, and cat-lover, banishing all of Megasaki's scabrous dogs to a toxic island of waste. Thereafter it follows the quest of a young boy trying to rescue his pet, Spots, from this hideous prison.The voices are great, but best by a mile is Bryan Cranston's as the lead stray, Chief.You can read the detail elsewhere.

98,gavinp9,"OK, but missing Anderson's typical whimsy",6,14 April 2018,"'Isle of Dogs' is another animated/puppet Wes Anderson film, a la 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' and his 9th film overall. Needless to say, it's quirky and offbeat. The plot is quite simple: Megasaki in Japan is divided into dog-haters and dog-lovers, and the mayor exiles all dogs to an island/dump across the bay. Atari (Rankin), a 12-year-old boy, then sets off to rescue his dog, Spots (Schreiber). The main characters are a pack of talking dogs - Chief (Cranston), Rex (Norton), Boss (Murray), Duke (Goldblum) and King (Balaban).Even though it's stop-motion animation/puppetry, it's not really a kids film. It must have just scraped a PG instead of an M. There's certainly some rather grim moments and gallows humour. It takes a while to build momentum and fully immerse you in the story - the final third is much better than the rest of the film. There's probably too much drumming in the score - it becomes distracting, as does the lack of subtitles for the bits spoken in Japanese. It's certainly not a bad film, but nowhere near as fun as 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' or 'Moonrise Kingdom'. The puppetry is pretty amazing, even though they sometimes look like action figures in close up, but the animation and some of the landscape shots are expertly done. There's a million cuts, as is Anderson's style, and too many characters, so no one gets a true chance to shire.",Isle of Dogs
99,MogwaiMovieReviews,The Anderson Touch,7,12 April 2018,"While watching Isle Of Dogs this afternoon I found myself trying to put my finger on whatever it was that made Wes Anderson's films so distinctive, even when - as with this one - there are not even any actors or real-life scenery on the screen.Wes Anderson films, like Woody Allen's and Charlie Chaplin's before him, tend to be thought of as comedies but have a much greater strain of sadness, realism and melancholy woven into them than most people remember afterwards. And this one is no different, to the point that I started to feel just a little concerned there were so many children in the cinema I saw it in, given that animal cruelty, sickness, genocide and death were so often the subjects at hand.Then there's the colours - the gorgeous yellows and reds and pinks and whatever else: sugary treats for the eye second to none.So that's two, but the greatest one is probably just endless attention to detail, always going the extra mile into the precise vision of composition he has. Watching this there are so many tiny, tiny details that anyone else would have left out or cheated on somehow. But everything here had to be first drawn up and then made by hand, and the time and love put into it is in the end what makes it so special.Where does it belong in the pantheon? I think I would place it over Fantastic Mr Fox, and maybe Bottle Rocket.

A boy travels there to rescue his pet, and teams up with pack of misfit canines to help expose a larger conspiracy.It's a stop-motion-animated film told from animals' perspective, from writer/director Wes Anderson, who already tried this kind of thing successfully in 2009, with well-received ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"".The voice cast includes Koyu Rankin as the dog lover boy, and a colorful variety of cool actors including Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Liev Schreiber, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, Greta Gerwig, and Yoko Ono.This is how far I can go with objective overview, because ""Isle of Dogs"" is made by Wes Anderson, and this artistic soul produces everything but easily describable kind of work.I will switch to ""open letter mode"", because this seems way more appropriate approach for writing about American cinema's King of Quirky.Oh, Wes... what can I tell about your work that has not been told already, and by writers much more able than yours truly? How can I describe how weird but wonderful you are, so even those who have never seen your stuff would know what you are about?The best I can describe the feeling of watching your movie - any one of them - is to compare it to accidentally wandering into warm and fuzzy fantasy land.Details are always more important than actual events - how you show something, how you frame things. It's always fun to witness how exactly you have chosen to put together a scene.Like haikus in ""Isle of Dogs"", it's all about the mood. At the best of times, I'd like to shake my head in puzzlement and laugh at the same time.The animals in your animated movie feel way more unique and alive than in ""real"" movies. You have an amazingly sharp sense for depicting the essential ""dogness"" in dog's behavior, and you are able to mix it effectively with human attributes for added comedy.Having said that, as ""Isle of Dogs"" progresses, it starts to get... boring. It should be shorter - who cares about the human characters, anyway? - and the running jokes repeat too much and the story wears thin fast.All in all, ""Isle of Dog"" doesn't feel as potent as your works of previous decade. I've not actually truly admired any of your movie from 2010's.I still love your style... but maybe little less than before. It's just that the newer stories are not that striking and memorable. And the style and the main cast is the same as always.Many will love ""Isle of Dogs"". I mostly loved watching the dogs, not the whole movie.I will close with a little haiku:""Isle of Dogs"" is fun
but also more of the same

The stop motion animation, the incredible voice actors, the great use of sound, and a wonderful musical score.Unfortunately, the movie tells its very thin story at a snail's pace and then has to introduce an American teenager- an exchange student from Ohio- to set the naïve people of Japan on the right path. Maybe this is supposed to remind us of the Japanese horror movies of the 1960's where a desperate American actor like Nick Adams or Robert Horton could make a fast paycheck.ISLE OF DOGS' greatest accomplishment is that Bill Murray no longer needs to be ashamed of GARFIELD as his worst work. He, and the other actors, certainly deserve better.",Isle of Dogs
103,politic1983,Needs more bite,6,25 April 2018,"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" didn't feature one shot of the Hungarian capital, so it was much to my further annoyance at the director's geographical ignorance that his latest animated feature, ""Isle of Dogs"", didn't go anywhere near E14. In fact, it's set in a fictional city of the other side of the planet!Resulting from an age-old family feud, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by co-writer Kunichi Nomura) of Megasaki, a cat-lover, paints dogs out to be a diseased species and banishes them all to Trash Island; an island as its name suggests. The Mayor's nephew Atari, a dog-lover, seeks his pet dog and bodyguard Spots and flies to Trash Island. The islands new natives do not trust humans and their English is incompatible with Atari's Japanese. The Mayor angered, he sends in the troops to bring Atari back. Though with a band of newly found ""man's best friend"" voiced by a list of star names, Atari flees and locates Spots, but finds he has started a new life on the island as its mythical leader. Back in Megasaki, Kobayashi seeks to destroy evidence of dog serums created by dedicated scientists to bring all canines back; to much protest from a group of student activists. Returning, Atari delivers a rousing speech to shame his uncle, releasing the serum and reviving the dormant dog-lover in the citizens of Megasaki. The end. One word to describe ""Isle of Dogs"" is ""nice."" The animation is well-executed, though you don't feel it anything too innovative; it looks very nice, but is far from delivering anything too dramatic; a nicely put together, extensive ensemble cast creates a lot of draws, though the delivery at times can be a little flat, perhaps due to actors taking on voice acting roles. The film is not greater than the sum of its parts, with the aesthetics giving a feel of style over substance, with no real depth when you wash away the level of trash. In an interview at Berlinale, the writing team suggested that a dog trash island was the starting point for the film; the Japanese setting coming later. The decision to set the film in Japan seems aesthetic as much as anything. References to the films of Akira Kurosawa are made throughout and acknowledged by Anderson. But it could easily have been set in France.""Isle of Dogs"", therefore, would appear a more Tarantino-style homage piece than cultural appropriation that has caused debate. The incorporation of a Japanese to the writing team gives some additional authenticity in cultural reference points, as well as a Japanese cast delivering Nihon-go, giving a Japanese audience a little something extra. However, much like last year's ""Ghost in the Shell"", the intended target audience means that American voices still dominate. The student protest is driven by foreign exchange student Tracy (Greta Gerwig); and while a stylistic choice, simultaneous translators talk over much of the Japanese dialogue. The inconsistency of the direct translation of text versus none for dialogue could perhaps irk some viewers also. Though, in general, the film feels good-natured and too light-hearted to intentionally create the controversial debate which arose - though this is perhaps an unconscious given in Hollywood in this day and age. In fact, that is perhaps where the film falls short: Perhaps aimed at a younger audience, the storyline is a little too light and breezes through with ease and little in the way of real bite.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk",Isle of Dogs
104,austin0731,True Wes Anderson cinema,8,8 June 2019,"In true Wes Anderson fashion we are treated to another feel good and whimsical tale of a boy and his best friend. The voice acting and animation for this movie was great, very fluid motions and fitting voice acting. Isle of Dogs was designed to be pleasing and to invoke a warm smile in its audiences. But at the same time delivering its message of companionship, the relationship and bond between man and man's best friend.I can't help but be reminded of the not so successful Alpha that executes this theme rather poorly. While that movie chooses to focus on the grand scopes and large wild plains and tell this lengthy story, Isle of Dogs takes a completely different approach. It focuses solely on a brief relationship between Chief and Atari, making it a lot more relatable and thus a much more accepted message.This was a movie that felt fun and exciting when dealing with serious issues, a trademark of Wes Anderson's cinema at this point. A wonderful movie that delivers a message for both children and adult audiences.",Isle of Dogs
105,FelipeCarrillo,This canine-themed stop-motion beast wags its tail because of Anderson's filmmaking loftiness,9,14 June 2018,"Wes Anderson is not a cult artist, he's a prolific maestro. His films always enjoy an added cachet that positions them far above many only-entertainment flicks, and his latest classical animated jewel meets perfectly what one would expect from an indie author who has erected his sublime filmography frame by frame. It's neither a blatant cultural appropriation of East Asian culture nor a scurrilous Japanese stereotyped assortment drawn by an injurious foreigner, it's a beautifully hand-made and delicate love story, a widely different, a fertile pic in visible and veiled exclamations on freedom, press, politics, principles, fear, transformation, friendship and human and dog's life which feeds off from a top-of-the-range vocal cast and a visual and technical section as eccentric and neat as every of the narrative ambitions of a filmmaker who not only sets up a baroque addition to his exquisite filmography and artistic growth but imbues this high-concept film, with some complacency, of a razor-sharp, sophisticated allegory that is clearly geared to the grown-up minds, those who resist to consider art as a channel of trivial thoughts, not as a mechanism of inescapable contact and advancement. There's no doubt that for Anderson's style newcomers the first thing they will highlight is tangibility of the pictures. Getting into the multiplex with a pre-established idea about how ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" director works is not helpful to prepare the senses, because it'd be minimizing part of their huge effort, every drop of beauty emerging from the screen is commendable, it's pure marvel. When the screening was over, the up-front reference that arose in my mind was the most recent piece of art of Laika Entertainment, ""Kubo and the Two Strings,"" not precisely by the concordance with the cultural basis or some moral similarities, but by the beautifully crafted creations, by being an invaluable gift for cinema, by the unspeakable visual prowess that hundreds of artists have built for us. The symmetrical compositions of the ever-perfectionist director who refuses to subdue his works under the phenomena of the digital age are straightforwardly glittering; a sharper aim to circumvent known superficialities and immerse it into the complicated, visually speaking, Japanese pulp places this film on a higher level in artistic terms, even unfolding the majority of the action on an adjacent island. Detail transmutes into obsession with the slightest manifestation of sumptuousness; the naturalness in its moves dazzles our perceptions which try to stumble upon a broken sequence, a malicious desire that, obviously, never will come true with Anderson at the helm. There are few human beings walking through the story because the canine leads are the ones who get most of the attention of the art departments; the dog's actions and activities enhance the progress of the plot thanks to the veracity of their behaviors, the domesticated animal par excellence is really here beyond the nearly human behavior given to them. More broadly, what decorates with personality the feast of strangely gorgeous frames is incredible and awardable cinematographer Tristan Oliver, rich in nuances and recesses endowing the pictures with irrepressible force which grows uncontrollably as the film runs, every frame is an authentic, finely crafted and shaped sculpture passing through the hands of hundreds of exquisite animators who with their talent, literally and figuratively, capture the obsessions of an animation maestro; a spellbinding experience. It's worth highlighting the majestic score by the most recent Oscar winner for Best Original Score Alexandre Desplat, who again is running for a golden nomination in the awards. Like Ludwig Göransson for Marvel Studios' ""Black Panther,"" he's a composer who knows how to channel well traditional drum sounds and Oriental instruments in which the feature film develops, he mixes them with his own ideas, creating a portentous whole, here, musical accompaniment is vital for the sensory process in the cinematic experience; his score is volatile, energetic and powerful, but at the same time fine, sensitive and adequate, candid and completely exciting. 
Anderson isn't only known for his peculiar and unpractical but extremely gratifying filming method, the textual motives that mobilize such handmade constructions intervene in the success of the narrations. The script is written undeniable by the American director because the characteristics of a concise writer arise, sensitive in a given moment, but coolly manipulative when the film itself requires it. With regard to the dicey, well-intentioned plot, it's conceived by eight hands with own name and recognition: Kunichi Nomura, in his first work as a writer; Jason Schwartzman, in his third experience as a film screenwriter; Roman Coppola, in one of the greatest successes of his career; and Wes Anderson, a man who doesn't need a description, just run and get covered with his artistic visions. The perspective he gives the story is simply unique, social and pleasantly revitalizing not only due to the fussy field of animation but the drama genre lines it uses with an unusual confidence in levels of conviction and coherence with respect to a plot that doesn't set in an explicitly human context, in the strictest sense of the word. The spark of the script gives brilliance to the plot needs and intransigent twists, besides, comedy is handled surgically in the narrative, becoming it a crucial point on the mere fact that the gradual and unexpected humor threads compose and speed up the pace of a non-commercial film, one that does have to defend against other mega-budget opponents. The most unfocused and less determined who attend the multiplex will delight with the elements manufacturing a beautiful surface, however, the most observant and connoisseurs of the filmmaker's style will get out of the theater with a radically different perception, a sharper, more complicated and risky one that touched on polarizing and delicate current problems concerning the whole world. In addition to its frank animalistic message, the script keeps going its critical purpose in every approach it proposes, criticisms that never boss around the characters to get their tasks, but rather they boss around every spectator's intellect to try to play with what it considers to be right and wrong, ironically, expressed through a canine tale. 
Generally speaking, Anderson delivers an editing style I have never seen before, telling his story in two languages (English and Japanese) and opposing completely to dubbing, he warns with complacency, after the unforgettable opening credits, the way how he will approach the narrative, presenting the rules of the universe he created and you have to accept to get lost in, whether you want or not. The film always gets a way to literally translate most of the foreign dialogue, however, it's here where his filmmaking method comes into play to underline that the most important characters are the animals, the Americanized canines, who capture all their attention and effort. It's also widely appreciated the work done by the incorrigible voices of post-modern American and European acting patrons and matrons- it's not really difficult to hide the disparity between men and women again. - Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson or important Oriental exponents such as Yoko Ono, Kunichi Nomura or young player Koyu Rankin perform a dubbing work motivated by dedication, enthusiasm and, of course, the pride of joinig forces with one of the most old-school and perfectionist directors currently working. The excellent vocal cast is undoubtedly one of the strengths and main thrusters for the organic, charismatic and dynamic functioning of the ambitious idea.
""Isle of Dogs"" by Wes Anderson mesmerizes from beginning to end, partly by its mania of playing with the high expectations always put on a director's job. Accessible and sophisticated, strategic and human, hilarious and dramatic, strangely beautiful and directed; this animated film is an undeniable love letter from the filmmaker to Oriental culture, canines and, beyond doubt, the recesses and perversities of the feelings, actions and inspirations of humankind; A feature film that produce juicy critical, controversial commentaries through generally opposed elements that are quickly woven on a story led by any manifestation of love, prioritizing narrative, technical and artistic fields with the proportionality only a maestro could handle. If you want to enjoy a good movie you will have many more options to choose from, but if you demand a top-notch film you will be welcome to watch as a stop-motion animation monster puts an actor, screenwriter, producer and director- uninterested in making movies for an Oscar - on the front page, a place he has never gotten out from.",Isle of Dogs
106,bastos,Very original as always.,8,17 October 2021,"Wes Anderson movies are a miracle to me. His shot composition is so different and original that I don't know how it can even work in a coherent movie. And what's fascinating to me is that the longer he does it the better and more refined he gets, never compromising to anyone or anything, always staying true to his vision. This movie is a marvel to look at. Everything is so meticulously well constructed, every shot so detailed that the only bad thing I can say is that sometimes I longed for a pause button so that I could appreciate all the details he put into all the shots. But it's not only at a cinematography level that his movies work, I would argue that he excels at every aspect of filmmaking, like the use of music and editing to further enhance his vision. But all of this would be for nothing if the movie didn't work on a story level, and here is where some of his movies sometimes fail, but that is not the case here, as I found everything almost perfect with this near future tale of a boy trying to set things right in a world that wants to get rid of dogs.

109,harrylosborne,A Stop-motion spectacle both in art and storytelling,8,10 August 2019,"In a similar vein to his work on the brilliant Fantastic Mr Fox (2009), Wes Anderson has delved back into the painstaking art of stop-motion film, and with great success. Isle of Dogs is an artistic vision that requires a very particular talent to construct, using Anderson's mastery of colour palettes to recreate a gritty, unclean world that still holds its charm. The story follows a group of banished canines helping a boy find his own dog, all whilst trying to avoid the extermination of their species. Set in a modern-day Japan (and on an island made exclusively of rubbish), stop-motion gives the film more refinement than you would be able to generate via GCI, enhancing the personal feel of the spectacle.It feels as if Anderson has pored over every frame, secreting hidden details to give the more attentive viewer a rewarding experience. Further to this, the use of authentic Japanese text and speech means the departure from the location isn't too extreme for a largely foreign viewership. Anderson's casts are always exemplary: Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson all lend their voices to various characters, each adding individual quirks to their respective roles. Their animations are all so clean and precise, highlighting the true quality of the animation team.Isle of Dogs caters for virtually any audience, containing elements to entertain adults and younger generations alike. The journey around this fabricate world is a story in itself, making Isle of Dogs a rare example of a film that creates a truly immersive environment, as well as delivering with a quality story.",Isle of Dogs
110,peeedeee-94281,Isle of Stereotypes,1,23 March 2018,"I have to go against all of the voices who are praising this film. I found the film relied way too much on stereotypical jokes. It wasn't at all respectful to the Japanese and it definitely wasn't an homage to anything related to that culture. Haiku jokes, samurai references everywhere, people dressing and acting like they're from WW2 imperial Japan, sumo wrestlers, the list goes on. When someone speaks Japanese, because they're using yelling talk without any subtitles, and that's supposed to be 'funny'.
Most of the jokes in the movie would not work if it was set in, say, the US. 
And if this backward looking Japanese city set in the future was so Japanese centric (no english signs anywhere), why are their dogs named 'Spots', 'Chief', 'King'?!
Some earlier reviews have complained that the movie was 'whitewashing', by placing the english-speaking actors names at the top, and the japanese at the bottom. I don't find that offensive, since it is a hollywood movie, and the voices are of well-known hollywood actors. It doesn't make sense to put a lesser known actor at the top, regardless of their ethnic background.
It's just a shame that culturally-specific jokes are still acceptable today. Come on, Hollywood, I thought you were supposed to be progressive, and all this metoo stuff. I'm just thankful they didn't have a godzilla or a scene of harakiri in the movie.
Unfortunately, I can't really comment much on the story itself. Was it interesting? Not really. Were the characters enjoyable? They were okay. But overall, the stereotypes depicting the Japanese culture and people ruined the enjoyment of the film.",Isle of Dogs
111,peeedeee-94281,Disappointing,1,24 March 2018,"I was curious to see this movie based on all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately this movie fails to live up to the hype. The main issue with this movie is the setting, and the mocking of the culture as the basis for the humor. There are so many instances in this film where the jokes are only about making light of a certain aspect of the culture, like having sumo wrestler bodyguards; using haikus as a common form of speech; having the mayor sport a gangster tattoo; and every scene is depicted as though it was set in the 1950s Japan, even though it was set in the future. The visuals were obviously designed by someone who's only access to Japanese culture was through watching old Japanese films. And what is really bad is that Wes Anderson chooses not to subtitle any of the Japanese spoken, further making the Japanese people less 'like us'. And of course all the heroes in the movie (with the exception of the boy) are voiced in English or represent western culture. 
Wes Anderson has stated that this movie could have been set anywhere, and yet how would half of the jokes in the film work if it wasn't set in Japan? I think if this movie had featured live actors, the uproar would have been greater. 
And when you strip away all of the cultural jokes, you really don't have much to work with. The story is pretty average, and the ending predictable.",Isle of Dogs

113,sirwillisiv,Expertly-crafted...,10,19 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's second stop-motion animated film after 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox. Set in Japan in the near future, Mayor Kobayashi has banished all dogs to a polluted island after a virus spreads throughout the canine population. Atari Kobayashi, the mayor's distant nephew and ward, arrives at the island alone to search for his dog named Spots. He enlists the help of a dog pack consisted of Chief, Rex, King, Boss and Duke who escort Atari across the island to find Spots. Meanwhile, a headstrong foreign exchange student from the United States who supports Atari's cause attempts to expose the Mayor corruption and cure the sick dogs. The film stars an ensemble voice cast including Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Bob Balaban, Kunichi Nomura, Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel, Liev Schreiber, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and F. Murray Abraham. Many of these cast members are frequent collaborators of Wes Anderson.Being a fan of Fantastic Mr. Fox and Anderson's work overall, I was beyond thrilled for Isle of Dogs and it exceeded my expectations. Something I really appreciate about Isle of Dogs is that it takes more risks than Fantastic Mr. Fox, which was essentially aimed at a family demographic. Isle of Dogs leans more toward teens and adults with its edgy content. Characters endure pain, bloodshed, and even talk about some rather disturbing imagery, but Anderson's dry wit is was ultimately keeps the tone lighthearted. Rest easy, it's not over-the-top like The Plague Dogs, for instance. In that film, a dog is purposely drowned for scientific experimentation and a man's face is blown off by a shotgun. That film sticks to a consistently upsetting, nightmarish tone. In Isle of Dogs, a character could succumb to poison and a dog could have its ear torn off by another, yet there's still a punchline involved that ultimately makes those occurrences funny. It's a bizarrely unique comedic style that only Anderson can seem to pull off smoothly, and this film is chockfull of great, memorable moments like that.The story is refreshingly original and is supported strongly by an endearing band of characters with distinct looks, personalities and backstories that gradually reveal some intriguing and emotionally gripping twists and character chemistries, namely the relationship between Chief, a human-hating stray, and Atari, a boy who seeks companionship. Their bond is the film's emotional, thought-provoking highlight. The set design is especially gorgeous, which is an odd word to describe landfills and factories, but I'm a sucker for dystopian/industrial set design and I thought the dreary landscapes breathed a rather mysterious and venturesome atmosphere. In contrast, the scenes taking place in the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki are absolutely brimming with neon colors and lively culture. Overall, there's balance present. After looking at garbage dumps for 20 minutes, you'll of course want to cleanse your eye's pallet with something dazzling, am I right? Lastly in terms of visuals, I personally loved the film's on-and-off touch toward traditional 2D drawings and animation, mainly when characters are viewed through video feeds or newsprint. It really adds a charming stylistic essence. Speaking of culture, I should address the great dane in the room, that is the absurdly overblown controversy surrounding this film. Many critics and film goers believe Isle of Dogs is a disrespectful interpretation of Japanese people, excessively stereotyping their looks and behavior. People, this isn't a World War II propaganda cartoon. You're not watching Popeye's You're a Sap, Mr. Jap. They look like Japanese people, they talk like Japanese people, they prepare food like Japanese people...shall I go on? Anderson didn't portray the Japanese insensitively, he portrayed them ACCURATELY...and frankly, they aren't the focus of the film. THE DOGS ARE. I wholeheartedly believe that these racial accusations were formed because people were watching this film with a political mindset at work rather than an artistic one. It's just a STORY...BY A FILMMAKER...TRYING TO BE CREATIVE AND CAPTIVATING...AND GUESS WHAT, HE SUCCEEDS.Anywho, with that rant aside, is there anything negative to say about Isle of Dogs? Not necessarily. It has a first-rate story, lovable characters, rich visuals, quality stop-motion animation, a deft balance of humor and drama and edgy scenes of action and peril. I think it's a clean slate, yet I do have one minor comment that's mostly scraping the bottom of the barrel: I wish Scarlett Johansson's character Nutmeg was featured more prominently in the story. Nutmeg is a clean-cut, beautiful show dog who serves as Chief's love interest, however they only share two scenes together. I think Chief's group could've benefitted from a female presence. Yet, the story works brilliantly otherwise thanks to Chief and Atari's chemistry. I loved Isle of Dogs, every minute of it. It's a bold and stylish animated adventure. If you aren't an avid art house viewer, Isle of Dogs is the perfect gateway film. A true breath of fresh air narratively and visually, one of Wes Anderson's finest, expertly-crafted work.",Isle of Dogs

I particularly enjoyed the music which really fit well with the flow of the film.The story was original and kept me entertained the entire time.

Each character had a distinct voice and personality. The back-and-forth character interactions were probably the best part of the movie.Overall I really enjoyed it, but you have to be a Wes Anderson fan.

116,js-66130,FETCHING,8,18 April 2018,"Must be hell working for Wes Anderson, the obsessive, compulsive movie maker who carefully sculpts each and every frame, and meticulously fills it with excruciating detail. Thankfully most of us are in the audience instead, which means a totally opposite, enjoyable experience.As with all past efforts, ""Isle of Dogs"" is a staggering visual feast, and because this is animation (a stop motion, retro futuristic, Japanese one), it is chock full of exquisite canvasses, complex graphics, and stunning originality. It's easy to get caught up in the eye candy, but what is truly revelatory here is the stunning audio that envelops the theatre. Remember all that fuss about surround sound? Well, we finally have proper use, and with several instances - a fabulous drumming sequence, and a haunting dog howling - it is glorious.Oh there's a story as well, which is the usual, meandering vehicle that strings together all the fun bits, and is perhaps the most traditional of Anderson's jaggedy plot lines.

There he meets a pack of mongrel dogs who decide to help him in his search. That is where the joy ride begins. The ending has a heartwarming twist that touches on what many humans believe.

It's no surprise artist continue to collaborate with him on projects. It reminded me off how dogs often times display more humanity than we do.

Jeff Goldblum's Duke is hilarious and Bryan Cranston's voice acting is perfect.The pacing is great and the film flows smoothly. The runtime is a little overlong.This film is not a masterpiece, but I do believe it deserves a good score because it is so beautiful to look and an because of originality.Pros: Great, whimsical, and funny story, great characters, amazing voice acting, Jeff Goldblum and Bryan Cranston's performance, good pacing, and a lot of good humorCons: The runtime is a bit overlongOverall Rating: 8.7",Isle of Dogs

121,lucasnochez,Film Review: Isle of Dogs/www.nightfilmreviews.com,10,5 April 2018,"Audiences around the world go to see a Wes Anderson film for many reasons; imagination, creativity, wonder and most of all, amazement. A man who has crafted and added to, not only a branch of the film industry within the independent market, but an individual who arguable has his own genre of film, proves with his latest that you are able to make an independent success, commercial darling and fading animation style feature film revolutionary. After eight feature films which enrich the medium as a whole, Wes Anderson delved, for a second time, into the stop-motion foray with his ninth future film, and quite possibly his best yet with Isle of Dogs. You heard the rumours right? About Isle of Dogs? Sure, there are a ton of rumours, controversy and discussions about the auteur director's latest film, both positive and negative (which we will discuss further into this review) including some fun facts that if you say the film's title fast, it's actually the equivalent of saying ""I Love Dogs"", as well as arguments about cultural appropriation, hmmm.The fact of the matter is, first and foremost, Isle of Dogs is a film that pays tribute and homage to so many of the things that Anderson loves and hold very dear to his heart. From his love to canines, to his homages to legendary filmmakers and vanguards Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa, to his love of stop-motion animation; Anderson's second venture into stop-motion animation is a film anchored by his passions, as well as a TRUE film for dog-lovers everywhere. DISCLAIMER: NO ACTUAL dogs were harmed during the making of this film-fact!Nevertheless, don't let the animation fool you, Anderson's Dogs is as convoluted a story and themed complexly as any other of his films.A true underdog story, the film follows a young Japanese boy Atari (Koyu Rankin) and his odyssey to save his beloved guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber), a short-haired Oceanic speckle eared sport hound, who so happened to be the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, a fictional land outside of Japan's fictional Megasaki City twenty years in the future, although the story seems more relevant now than it may in twenty years. Trash Island was sanctioned by Atari's mayoral uncle, Mayor Kobayashi voiced by Anderson collaborator, who also served as one of the screenwriters, Kunichi Nomura. Kobayashi, following an age old dynasty that transgresses from his farthest ancestors, with strong pro-feline beliefs, sets course to sanction a law to deport all dogs to Trash Island, blaming ""snout-fever"" and ""dog-flu"" as an incurable disease for its people, despite two scientists (Ken Wantanabe and Yoko Ono) on the verge of a medical breakthrough with the cure.""What ever happened to man's best friend?"" indeed becomes one of the driving forces of the film. While Atari steals one of his uncle's jets, the mayor himself Kobayashi, who serves as the boy's ward following his parents tragic death years before, become family members and foes overnight. Questions arise as to why Atari on a quest to save Spots and deliberately chooses to throw his comfortable life away, despite Spots being one-helluva cute dog? It hurriedly becomes apparent that not only was Spots Atari's loyal companion, but the pup also served as Atari's loyal and trusted doggie-gaurd, despite Atari's hesitations at first. Fast forward some time and Atari's crash landing onto Trash Island, a desolate, ugly, grungy and garbage-filled wasteland inhabited only by dogs, populated with the brittle bones of animal carcasses, leftover waste, as well as spoiled and half-eaten food of Japan's Megasaki, the journey becomes a young man's ode to self-discovery and his ultimate moral fibre. Anderson, who so wonderfully, brings to life fantastical worlds in true Wes Anderson-esque fashion, seemingly chooses this story to showcase a very different side of his of his visual, truly allowing garbage, trash and waste to serve as a beautiful and poetic backdrop to his newest canon of films. Adding signatures such as Anderson's symmetrical filming style, the use of pans and deep zooms, and Trash Island as well as the overly-populated Megasaki City fit right in with the rest of Anderson's highly staged universe's. It also becomes quite easy to see that Anderson is also pioneering himself into cinematic prestige; using Isle of Dogs as his Avatar, progressing and improving stop-motion, maturing the visuals of the medium as well as mastering the ways of its presentation, especially comparing it side-by-side to his first venture with the form in The Fantastic Mr.Fox.Once on Trash Island, Atari comes into contact with five courageous dogs who unflinchingly help the young boy; the koy and spoiled celebrity dog King (Bob Balaban), the bumbling team mascot Boss (Bill Murray), the dextrous gossiper Duke (Jeff Goldblum), the rationale Rex (Edward Norton), and of course, the leader of the pact and mangy stray Chief (Bryan Cranston). Together, the six travel to the depths and deep dark corners of Trash Island to find Spots. But like any other ferociously Wes Anderson film, on their way, they encounter a plethora of obstacles, including; a crew of cannibal dogs, some violent, Kobayashi made robotic replacement dogs and other outcasts sentenced to the depths of an unlawful prison. All of these challenges between Atari and his rag-tag bunch of scoundrels push the limits of what they all thought they were capable of, paying special attention to the relationship between Chief and Atari in compassionate fashion.There are many beauties that encapsulates a Wes Anderson film, especially with each and every new entry to add to his exquisite filmography. The director/writer extraordinaire is truly evolving in his craft, experimenting with style, tone, narrative and themes like he has never done before in his earlier work. Sure, it can be argued that Anderson has difficulty with female protagonists and female characters in general, but luckily enough, he never tries to mask this; his confidence with unfolding strong male characters suffering with strong familial mis-steps never miss a beat.Anderson also has this sensible touch to integrate real-world current issues into his films, without ever really spending too much time analyzing or harping extensively on these issues. With the quarantine that all the dogs must face upon being banished to Trash Island, it becomes clear that Anderson's allegory of real life politics, not just American, but worldwide, is being painted on, reflecting the state of these lovable human companions, to the current problems of immigration. Anderson's subtle yet explicit subject matter in Isle of Dogs advances towards his cinematic style, sheding a light and 'throwing-a-bone' to a light-hearted yet extremely relevant subconscious audience that is never ever really acquitted of, but coerced towards enjoying a highly stylized and whimsical feature film experience with real-world issues surfaced.Visually, there is no exception to a Wes Anderson film. Never opting out or showing his films in 3D to gain extra profit, Isle of Dogs is a 2D feature film with NO two-dimensional characters; whether they have a tail or not. While the film itself is an ode to dog-lovers everywhere, its also a human narrative about the perseverance and endurance of the spirit of goodness and selfishness and the labours of love. As Rex points out in the film, Atari is the first human to come to Trash Island to find his dog, hence why the raggedy group of dog misfits agree to help the young boy find Spots, including Chief, even though he has never been with a family or owner long enough to know what love is. As Chief proclaims, ""I am not a violent dog, I don't know why I bite"", it becomes clear that Chief's void for love for humans doesn't stem from hatred, but rather from a lack of affection. Once Chief and Atari begin their journey together and share progressive moments with each other, the narrative truly showcases the wonders of companionship that make all other dog-films seem cliche by comparison.Isle of Dogs is one of the first neat perfect films of 2018, undoubtedly. Right there beside Black Panther, the film is a true testament to the goodness of excelling cultural awareness and showcasing diversity.Yet, the day before the limited release date of the film, beloved and respected film critic Justin Chang wrote a review on Isle of Dogs speaking about the insensitivites of cultural appropriation in the film. While I am in no position to talk about the beauties of the Japanese culture since my ancestry doesn't steam from any parts of Japanese, nor have I ever been to Japan, I can offer my opinions based on the simple fact that I am also a film critic, dog lover, cultural enthusiast and human being. In Chang's review, he speaks about Anderson's 'highly selective, idiosyncratic rendering' of East Asia, as well as a failure of sensitivity. Furthermore, Chang goes on to discuss Anderson's 'weakness for racial stereotyping', deeming Anderson's take of the Japanese culture hurtful and somewhat violating. Other critics, upon Chang's review, have questioned as to why Anderson set the film and Japan, and why certain characters speak Japanese with no subtitles, while the dogs ONLY speak English if they are in fact suppose to be from Japan, and why there is an American translator (Frances McDormand) only for the political segments of Isle of Dogs. Is this all too convenient and superlative to Anderson's story being told?Firstly, it is in my sincerest opinion that, Anderson, who wrote the script of Isle of Dogs, with Japanese actor/writer Kunichi Nomura, as well as Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, had no intention of the film being cultural insensitive or offensive. Nomura, who is of Japanese decent, had an integral part of the script's fruition, as well as providing the voice of a major character in the film.",Isle of Dogs
122,PotassiumMan,"Colorful, slightly annoying but endearing Wes Anderson fable",7,9 April 2018,"Wes Anderson's homage to Japanese film animation certainly has its good points. It's visually elaborate and depicted in alternatingly desolate and pristine landscapes in fictitious places in Japan. The incredible thing about Anderson's work is that even a story about dogs being quarantined on a toxic waste island can seem momentous and even highbrow with his upright, stubbornly eccentric style of filmmaking.Initially, this wasn't quite my speed. I found the film's beginning a bit lacking in its emotional pull even with a fairly thorough backstory about the five dogs who become the pack at the center of the story and a boy who flies to the island where the dogs have been isolated. Fortunately, the film becomes considerably more compelling once it becomes clear what the boy's purpose is and how much he is up against. The plot aspect involving a corrupt, tyrannical mayor of a large fictitious Japanese city is one of the more enjoyable parts of the storyline.I was ultimately able to digest this film because I settled into it and just decided to run with its mad adventure and its dogged (no pun intended) fight against political corruption and anti-democratic practices. The political aspect of the story made this film more fascinating and worthwhile. Having said that, a couple of the human supporting characters are so cardboard and disposable that it might make the viewer regard Trash Island as more a refuge than a prison.My friend who saw this with me described the film as ""too precious"" to connect with (a common criticism that Anderson films sometimes run into) and concluded that it was ultimately ""superficial"" after a promising start. If you're not a Wes Anderson devotee, you might conclude that this film either squanders or redeems itself. In the end, I found it adequate enough to recommend.",Isle of Dogs
123,gcsman,"""Pull yourself together and act like a scientist!""",7,22 April 2018,"... That's my favorite line in the movie and it doesn't even come from one of the dogs in the cast. Actually, it took me quite a while to get into this movie, maybe half an hour before the setup exposition was over, the plot started really rolling, and I finally got embedded in the goings-on. I'm a Wes Anderson fan -- Moonrise Kingdom is one of the finest things ever put on film, and Grand Budapest Hotel is a close second although it's SO stylish that it kind of collapses of its own lighter-than-air weight (if that makes any sense) -- and I did eventually like Isle of Dogs too but just not as much. The plot, such as it is, is remarkably intricate for the 1:41 run time, but once again for Wes Anderson, it's style that is the main attraction.The dogs are certainly the stars (voiced by an all-star cast, every one of whom is spot-on) and it's one of several subversively charming elements of the plot that the humans are relegated to the background even though on the surface, they should be the principals. They're endlessly charming, and daffy charm is Anderson's trademark. Rex, King, Boss, and Duke make an amiable quartet of mutts who decide to help 12-year-old Atari find his lost pet Spots. They're so good-natured and helpful that they have to vote on everything. The real (dog} center of the narrative, however, is Chief and his journey of discovery as he goes along for the ride. The villain Kobayashi, the dastardly Mayor of Megasaki, is I think supposed to be either Putinesque or Trumpian and I'm not sure which.So much of the action involves rides -- rusty tram cars, rickety airplanes, and amateurishly built boats -- so enjoy the ride. But after you've seen this, go back and watch Moonrise Kingdom again.",Isle of Dogs
124,iantrader,A watchable mix of Japanese cartoon and doggy plot!,5,23 July 2018,"So... We Anderson. You may love or hate it because of him , but that's not the way to look at it. Is it a good movie? Yeah, it's ok, it's a 5. The higher scores tend to come from Anderson fan boys/girls but you make up your own mind.It's a really odd mix of Japanese animation about dogs but it's not anime. The dogs are 'nice' but not cute. Mot of the dialogue is in English but there are moments of Japanese which are not translated. Slightly irritating but no big deal as you can still follow the plot.Speaking of plot - it works fairly well, and is better for being in a cartoon. It probably wouldn't work as a live movie. It's engaging and there are a couple of characters you can empathise with.And it has a host of stars doing the voices - I won't list them all, check the list.It's rated a PG but I'd definitely not want younger children watching it so check it out before showing it to younger viewers.",Isle of Dogs
125,justinwfirestone,"A plain story, great animation",7,25 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs, or maybe more obviously Wes Anderson meant ""I Love Dogs,"" is a vapid story, oddly enough written by four people. One would think a story so plain would need but one writer, yet we have four, which might explain why the movie is little more than a beautiful animation.No offense, Mr. Anderson, but Roald Dahl wrote better stories, and you're beginning to perfect stop-motion animation, with particular excellence for sushi, explosions, dog fights, and kidney surgeries. What's a bit strange is the relatively small number of types of dogs represented on Trash Island, nearly all of them male dogs, nearly all of them looking something like a terrier.There must be some sort of morality play going on with the legend of cats versus dogs, a beheading, and a link between ecology and disease. Or maybe it's something more current, some message about exiling unwanted animals akin to keeping refugees or immigrants at bay, away from us, hidden from view so we no longer have to deal with them, because they were never human in the first place.The voice acting is as good as you would expect, even with the clever casting of Yoko Ono as Assistant Scientist Yoko Ono, and even better use of F. Murray Abraham and Harvey Keitel. Although I love dogs, Isle of Dogs is not really about dogs at all, is it?",Isle of Dogs

127,joshbarton15,a.k.a. I LOVE DOGS,10,28 March 2018,"If you've ever watched a Wes Anderson film before, you'll sort of know what to expect with each new film he delivers; a quirky story, a bunch of oddball characters, an impressively talented ensemble cast and an immaculately shot feature presentation. Isle of Dogs is his latest offering and it sees the director return to the world of stop-motion animation.When a dog flu virus spreads through the canine population of Megasaki City in Japan, the mayor signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island. When 12 year old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin) crash-lands on the island searching for his dog Spots (Live Schreiber), the first dog to be sent to Trash Island, he comes across a band of dogs; Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray) and Chief (Bryan Cranston), and they set about a journey to find the boy's dog.Isle of Dogs is one hell of a breathtaking film to watch, with the fine detail in the stop-motion animation and the meticulous framing of every single shot making it feel as if you're staring at a piece of fine art hanging on the wall rather than a film. When a film like this comes along, you can't help but sit back and just admire it.The story is such a heartwarming one, Atari's determination and loyalty towards finding Spots together with the story behind Chief's coldness towards humans making for a film very hard not to take a liking to, the richness to both the narrative and characters will make you just fall in love with some of the dogs on show. The film is topped off with some of Anderson's signature dry humour that had the audience in raptures at times.Coming to the performances, Isle of Dogs features a fountain of talent lending their voices to proceedings. Vocal performances can often be forgotten in the midst of all of the year's performances however, some of the work here deserves to be remembered for a long, long time. Bryan Cranston's work on the voice of Chief is so spot on that he'll be close to bringing the audience to tears and Edward Norton is wonderfully funny as Rex, the dog in the group questioning Chief's leadership. Isle of Dogs shows a case of not being able to teach an old dog new tricks for Wes Anderson however, when he can repeat those tricks as well as he does, it becomes a film that entirely deserves all the praise it gets for being such a sheer bundle of joy to behold.",Isle of Dogs
128,krbodkin,Best Wes movie so far,6,8 July 2018,"But considering I've found all his other work to be pretentious snorefests, that's not saying much. This had just enough adventure, cynical humor and quirky animation to keep its head above water.",Isle of Dogs
129,anthonyf94,Kurosawaian dog movie,8,29 September 2019,"In Japan, all dogs are moved on an island because of a terrible disease that attacked them. With a plot that mixes dog movie in American style (relation with human), but avoiding all stereotypes about friendship, political and social questions about diversity and fight against parties, and identity theme, the movie tells about the research of a lost dog and the recognizing of one of the researchers as it's brothers. Beyond a complex plot, that it's at the same time made light by Anderson as he often does, what's very fascinating is the typical Anderson geometric setting of shots (with also games with split screens and field corrections) unified with a kurosawaian reminiscence that gives to the movie an epic tone, also due to a powerful rhythmic soundtrack, immediately diminished by ironic situations. Considering also the maniacal stop motion result, this is a little masterpiece.",Isle of Dogs
130,datautisticgamer-74853,Why Wes Anderson would benefit from more animated films,8,28 April 2018,"I had the opportunity to see this movie when my father provided a request. In some light rain, we trekked to an ICON location to view this movie. My father had already informed me of the favorable reviews of this movie, but I would like to set those aside entirely. Instead, since that is the point of my review, I will be presenting my personal thoughts on this movie. Now to not dawdle...The premise behind the story was already a curious one to craft a film from, and the presentation of it didn't disappoint. We have the tale of dogs shunned by future Japan and exiled to a figurative Hell, the dystopian society of Megasaki led by one who wants to decimate the dog population, and that man's adopted son who journeys to the island to find his long lost guide and friend. Despite having enough material for 3 film plots, Anderson blended them together so intricately that one may just forget, in all the thrills and laughs, how complex the story becomes. Being my first Wes Anderson movie, I can't say much about his style of humor except that for this film, it works. For the characters, I did end up getting confused in Part 4 when it comes to the feud between Kobayashi and Domo, since we didn't get much development of the latter's character enough to understand his view on the dog epidemic. For the rest of the characters, I can say that they fit their purposes in the plot excellently, be they the main characters or the kind who are just slightly more useful than comic reliefs. The blend of stop motion and traditional animation is rather strange, especially when the traditional animation isn't in a more anime style like I would expect for a Japanese setting. That's not to say the animation is disappointing, especially when it pulls off nice effects with stop motion that I would actually compare to Kubo and the Two Strings. The character designs and animation do offer in creativity and do complement the setting well. This is a movie that I am sure most older families would enjoy. If children are able to get past the offensive and violent language, they could take something away from this as well. People who like dogs or futuristic settings would be the most likely to enjoy this movie, but for a general audience, I would overall find this a safe bet for pleasing. A bit confusing, but in a way that puts us in thought. After all, one aspect that makes many animated films great is that they get us to ponder their messages, especially more contemporary ones. For this, there isn't much of a deviance from that, so see it and be prepared to encounter (the good kind of) complexities.",Isle of Dogs
131,elmoslively,Unique to say the least.,8,23 December 2018,"Wes Anderson does it again! Terrific exploration of adult style animation, in that it's very sophisticated without being overly sentimental. It has a great voice cast and tells a fascinating story of dystopian proportions. Although it's not violent and has very little use of coarse language, I wouldn't say it's family friendly in that it deals with some fairly deep views of human existence. Overall I found it very satisfying, as I do most Anderson films.",Isle of Dogs
132,Endless_01,Wes Anderson's unique style doing an excellent job as always.,8,15 June 2019,"I was hoping to get the quality that Anderson usually works with, I ended up getting that and more. A film unique in its style, using two quite fascinating methods to observe and enjoy in a film: The stop-motion and the direction of Wes Anderson. This combined with an excellent voice work by luxury actors results in a fascinating work full of hilarious moments and memorable scenes under the same fascinating label that characterizes both the work of this particular and very original director.Totally enjoyable from beginning to end, with a unique idea based on the beauty and loyalty of the dogs and developed through a fascinating and fun adventure, next to the incredible work of Anderson direction plus the high quality stop-motion that we are given, this ends up being a film of high quality deserving of much applause.",Isle of Dogs
133,cappiethadog,Imagine,10,20 January 2019,"The Japanese had company. Hayao Miyazaki was not the only iconoclast of cel. Martin Rosen, a relatively unsung British filmmaker, just like the Ghibli founder, rehabilitated the perception of animated films as being solely a child's preoccupation, following up ""Watership Down"", adapted from the Richard Adams young adult novel with ""The Plague Dogs"", whose lab animal storyline provided Wes Anderson with a template for ""Isle of Dogs"". Actually, Anderson utilizes both films: From ""Watership Down"", the one about rabbits, he replicates its storytelling device, the prologue, in which a narrator tells the story of The Great Frith, a JC figure who is at the center of the hare's religion. El-ahrirah is Adam. It's their creation myth. The animation style(best described as moving children book illustrations) differs from the impressionistic watercolor look that follows. The rabbit creation myth gives the burrowing mammals an interior life. In ""Isle of Dogs"", the prologue is named as such, titled ""The Boy and the Headless Ancestor"", it recounts a history of cats and dogs, a history that has more in common with folklore than scripture, told through Japanese woodblock paintings. The ancient art form, indigenous to Japan, gives way to stop motion animation, indigenous to 19th century America. Although there is no transfigured creation myth in ""Isle of Dogs"", the filmmaker reinvents the human form of the carpenter into a warrior who challenged the hegemony that cats held over dogs by slaying Mayor Kenji's forefather, founder of the cat worship-based religion. The renegade Kobayashi defector was immortalized as The Boy Samurai of Legend. Cats and dogs don't need to look toward the stars. They have masters. It's people who need a higher love. And in this alternate universe, instead of a text, a consecrated book that connects mankind to the spiritual world, the dog is the text, or cat, depending on what the pet advocate believes. Such are the properties of the canonical in this domesticated animal-centric world that Anderson lays out. Petting a dog brings you closer to God. Petting a cat brings you closer to God, too.The lay of the land, home of the brave, Anderson replicates then displaces, our current political climate, moving the partisan fighting to an island nation. Two factions exists, pro-dog and anti-dog, and both sides, not just the latter, take on the personification of a social activist group, more so than a religion. The two sides, brainwashed by state propaganda, don't seem to understand that their mutual enemy is Mayor Kenji, the current dictator of the cat-loving Kobayashi dynasty. Before the wood blocks, there is a diorama, and the objects within this diorama convey more than a passing resemblance to eastern faith. The formally dressed man, a high priest of sorts, moves ritual-like precision inside the tableau adorned with cats; he hits a gong, lights candles, bows, and claps his hands together twice in reverence of the sacred feline. The cat worship is government-sanctioned, the dominant religion whose leaders of an apocryphal Japan devised a campaign against dogs by expropriating the chemical industry to cleanse the country of man's best friend. At a town hall meeting, Professor Watanabe, the Science Party candidate, introduces a cure in the works for snout fever, a dog serum that would stave off the planned deportation of dogs from Megasaki City to an adjunct island. But the people reject science; the people turn into an angry mob; the anti-dog demonstrators, once former dog lovers are now cat lovers, a conversion to the fictionalized native eastern religion propagated by propaganda. They throw things at Watanabe, setting his female assistant into action. Yoko Ono stares down the anti-Science crowd as she moves the professor away from the lectern. Yes, that Yoko Ono.In his lifetime, John Lennon wanted Ono to get credit for co-writing ""Imagine"", a song that takes gentle aim at belief systems as the intervening hitch whenever peace talks are attempted and inevitably fail. In 2017, Lennon, posthumously, finally got his wish when the National Music Publishers Association(NMPA) added Ono's name alongside her late husband as the co-author of ""Imagine"". The temptation is there to posit Watanabe as a stand-in for Lennon, since in ""God"", a track off the ex-Beatles first solo album ""John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band"", he renounces his past association with the Maharishi. The professor dies, but there is ambiguity in the cause of his death. Under house arrest, Watanabe eats a boxed lunch comprised of sushi, then stops to inspect the final piece, suspecting poison. He tastes the laced wasabi, but the filmmaker cuts away before we learn if that tentative lick was enough to kill him. Did the professor ingest the whole of the wasabi? Does he want his assistant to get full credit for the dog serum? The cure for snout fever is finished after his passing. At the sake bar, Tracy Walker, a student activist, confronts Ono about the dog serum. The bartender slides down a bottle of blue liquid. Look at how close Ono moves her face up to the glass. Like in real life, she remained silent about the truth.It's hers.",Isle of Dogs

It's heartwarming, it's funny, perfectly entertaining. There's wonderful character development for both the humans and the dogs. I love how the film is bilingual.

137,brianjohnson-20043,Didn't work. Pick a genre for your narrative.,4,17 April 2018,"OVERALL: I feel like this film suffered by trying to be too many things. I'm no cook, but I know that a cook can't just take a bunch of random ingredients they like, throw them together, and expect a good result. Isle of Dog is this type of mashup. For the Record, I'm capable of liking dogs, liking a post dystopia type environment, liking a heartwarming narratives about kids and their friendships with pets. I often like irreverent comedies. I like narratives that highlight political corruption when done well. This film tried to be all these things plus celebrate Japanese culture. No 100 minute film can very well pull off so many conflicting things. I think many people want to like this film because they like and care about all or many of these things. And people can relate to the passion of the filmmaking of Wes Anderson. And they like his individualism. But that doesn't make the substance of a movie good. It just gives one reason to want it to be good. I'm not a troll, but I expect down the line this film will lose a star or two, because at some point people will realize that this film doesn't effectively tell a good story. The Good: The film does have some great animation and great voice acting. The timing, the cuts, and quirkiness are likable. Many of the jokes are entertaining. There is a joy and passion in this film. It's trying to be unlike any other movie. And it succeeds in this regard. And I really do respect that. THE BAD: I don't know the genre of this movie, or could say in 20 words what this movie is about. I don't know a successful movie that can't describe itself by such basic parameters. If there's too much, one can't delve into some issues or some characters. And then, what is the audience left to care about? In 2 or so hours, you can only do so much. The two strongest descriptions for Isle of Dogs were that it was a quirky irreverent dystopic comedy, and it was a heart-warming drama about the love between people and their pets and their fight to reunite. Both are great. But if a film tries to go all-out in celebrating both, in this case, one doesn't compliment the other but instead contradicts and cripples the other. These styles are at odds with each other no matter how much an individual may like both. And such contradictions make it difficult to be invested in the story. I'm not saying that there can be no comedy in a drama or vice versa, but they need to feel like they exist within the overall comedic or dramatic foundation for the story which is being told. Dr. Strangelove makes a lot of dramatic political points. But it's clearly within it's comedic environment. Casablanca has some great humorous exchanges, but it never gives one the impression that there aren't still huge dramatic stakes. Isle of Dogs never establishes an environment that has some rules or consequences or meaning because it's always switching between two conflicting styles. This makes the film seem long especially the last 30 minutes or so. I was wondering when it would end. The interest in masterful visual and auditory aesthetics can only last so long. Eventually, I think about the substance. And this substance is always being rewritten, which makes it hard to feel much is at stake and worth caring about. CONCLUSION: Style alone can't save this film, or I'd argue, any feature length film. I'd say Wes Anderson would be better off minimizing his ambitions for a future feature project so he can effectively give attention to a few things he really cares about, instead of undermining himself. Or he could just make a short quirky art film which highlights the joy of film-making and what can be done with art. He clearly has a talent for executing a vision, and has a unique spirt which should be appreciated. He just needs to be sure that his narrative vision is consistent, so it can be understood and fully appreciated from a story-telling perspective.",Isle of Dogs
138,ccamp89,"Impeccably crafted, whimsical, and substantive",9,3 May 2018,"An absolutely wonderful and imaginative film from Wes Anderson that oozes creativity from every frame. From a sheer craft perspective, this is some truly fabulous work. The visual presentation is consistently stunning with Anderson's trademark symmetrical compositions and storybook aesthetic. The propulsive, percussive score that clearly homages classic Japanese cinema (which the film is very much drawing from creatively overall) also really brings out Anderson's strong sense of rhythm. Everything from the editing to the beats of dialogue carries a sharp sense of timing that helps the film flow and infuses a playfulness that contrasts its decidedly dark themes. Political corruption, conspiracy, racism, and even genocide are among the many ideas floating around the film, and I felt it was able to strike a nice balance between the weight of these issues and Anderson's typical whimsy. Though I hate to fault the film given the incredible degree of artfulness and passion that clearly went into creating it, I do feel that perhaps the characters could've been a bit more fleshed-out. It's a very plot-driven film which is not necessarily a criticism in of itself, but the depth of the characters seems to have suffered a bit as a result. I also felt that it falls a little short of the cathartic conclusion it's striving for, though things do wrap up in a satisfying way befitting of its storybook quality. These amount to minor quibbles, as Isle of Dogs convincingly shines as a highly entertaining and visually spectacular film that is artful, witty, and ambitious.Light 4.5/5",Isle of Dogs

Seriously, this movie is beautiful! The movement is so smooth and it's so detailed! It's a feast for the eyes! Now, the movie is a little slow in a few places, but I still think this is a great film overall. Just don't show it to your kids, it isn't a kids movie. Just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids. It isn't even that inappropriate, I just don't think kids would be very interested in what's going on.

141,Animated_Antic,A very charming and brilliant film.,10,17 April 2018,"If there is a director who knows how to make a great animated movie, it's Wes Anderson. Although he perviously made only one animated movie almost ten years ago which was ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", I remember it being so funny, clever and very well animated that I wanted to see more from him. Now we have another one called ""Isle of Dogs"" and I'll just get this out of the way right now. This is a great movie. Every thing that was so great about ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" has been stepped up big time in this movie with a very clever and charming story, brilliant and flowing stop motion animation and characters that are made memorable due to their brilliant voice over work from a wide cast of Oscar nominated actors. Before we get into why you should go out of your way in see this movie, here's my brief plot synopsis.In the country of Japan not to far in the future, a dog flu has begun to spread throughout the community. Wanting to protect the citizens of Megasaki City, the corrupt Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) issues an order to banish all canines onto a trash island away from the country with the first dog to be banished being his nephew's guard dog Spots (Liev Schreiber). In a matter of six months, the young nephew named Atari (Koyu Rankin) decides to rescue his dog by stealing an airplane and crashes on the island. There he meets five dogs, four of whom use to belong to masters and one a stray. While the four named Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and King (Bob Balaban) are willing to help, the stray named Chief (Bryan Cranston) is initially reluctant due to his prejudice against humans. The six then set off on a journey to find the lost dog traveling through many abandoned areas along the way. Back on the main land, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) has begun to suspect that a conspiracy is ongoing a proceeds to investigate while coming across details involving a group of scientists (Kunichi Nomura and Yoko Ono). I could list more details like say what other fantastic actors are in this movie, but I dare not spoil anything.Throughout my viewing of the movie, I was marveled by the immersive work that Anderson and his team put in this film. The story created by him, Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura was very original and clever. Similar to ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", the screenplay written by Anderson was top notch quality with the dialogue being very smart and clever. Though unlike the former, this film doesn't hold back on the cussing as the characters actually fully on say the words without having it being replaced with the word ""cuss"". As for the animation, it's also fantastic. The movement of the characters as well as the human designs have really been improved from ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and I really have got to appreciate the style that Anderson puts into the visuals. He claims to have been inspired by the work of Akira Kurosawa and the holiday Rankin-Bass specials (both of which were made in Japan) for this film and it clearly shows though it isn't without his typical trademarks like his symmetry framing and quirky dialogue. As for the characters, I really liked how captivating they are. You can tell that the actors in this film were allowed to be themselves and were able to put what makes them charming in real life into their performances. Bryan Cranston in particular was a highlight. He was able to sell the character of Chief starting off as very unlikeable and then develop into a likable character by the end of movie which is something that I love seeing movies do. Even the score by recent Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat was once again fantastic and helped impact the story like great scores do. I don't think I have any complaints for this movie. It's that good.If you love movies, go support ""Isle of Dogs"". This is something that people who love movies should see with it's intruding story, beautiful animation and captivating characters. This is a film that was well worth the wait. I'm glad I saw it, and I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it in the near future.P.S. Also, I really got to thank a few of my friends for convincing their manager at the movie theater they showed the film in for screening it there. Had they not, I would have been forced to see it an hour away from where I live.",Isle of Dogs
142,thisseatofmars,"""A tedium of whimsy."" Animation alone isn't enough to save a movie.",4,24 December 2018,"Wes Anderson's best work seems behind him. I loved The Royal Tenenbaums and Fantastic Mr. Fox, an animated movie very similar in style to Isle of Dogs. Anderson's films however have taken a downturn, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, which was disappointing farce. ""Dogs"" is no less disappointing.I think the problem Anderson's last few movies have is that the plot is too thin for the run time. ""Hotel"" was 100 minutes but felt like it should have been 80. Isle of Dogs is 97 minutes, but it takes a long, long, long time for it to get going. Wes Anderson sacrifices ""artsy shots"" and style for storytelling; that is, plot and pacing. The numerous pull away and flat establishing shots drag the movie down so much watching ""Dogs"" is a chore. ""Dogs"" also features a tedious amount of people speaking, at length, in Japanese, and then having a character translate it for us. Is it meant to be a joke? It's quirky, sure, but isn't it also, I don't know... tedious? Since when is quirkiness a joke? Since when is listening to people speaking Japanese a joke?The whimsical ""quirk factor"" of this movie is compounded by how the (English speaking) characters all talk; as if they're all trying to do a Jeff Goldblum impression (which is funny as he is also in this movie). But people don't talk like this, not unless it's late at night and you have to talk to your spouse about something bothering you but you don't want to wake the kids.I can't shoot the movie down completely, however: this style of animation is charming and filled with character, but it's not enough to save the movie. Fantastic Mr. Fox had the same kind of animation but ""Fox"" also had stronger storytelling, acting, and humour. Animation alone isn't enough to save a movie.",Isle of Dogs
143,amarshoaib,Typical,8,12 August 2020,It's a spectacular piece of stop motion animation with a quirky tale about loyalty and friendship filled with remarkable character dialogue. Wes Anderson delivers again a symmetrical stop-motion-animated work of art.,Isle of Dogs
144,chiaragiacobelli,Well done and uncommon,7,31 January 2019,"This is a funny movie with a deeper meaning, not boring and really uncommon, different from all the other ""cartoons"" or graphic novels I have ever seen.
The entire movie is a metaphor of the human behaviour and the society, in which power and ignorance make people stupid and violent. But there is always a hope for humanity...",Isle of Dogs
145,WooderIce64,Solid Wes Anderson,8,8 October 2018,"Wes Anderson has made quite a name for himself with his unique style of filmmaking, which has been brought to animation once with Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009. Set in a future Japan, Anderson returns to the world of stop motion with Isle of Dogs. Stop motion animation isn't seen very often in movies anymore, so it's always a treat when it does. The animation is one of the movie's strong suits, with the amount of detail put into the dogs, the backgrounds, and the character animation. Of course, Anderson's famously quirky style is seen here. The animation helps some of these effects, like how some scenes appear to happen on a 2D plane. The distinct Wes Anderson style is also seen in the English dialogue (more on that later), with many jokes and humorous lines delivered in monotonous, deadpan voices. The film is set in Japan in the late 2030s, where dogs have been deported to Trash Island in the fear of spreading disease, and a young boy named Atari seeks to rescue his dog from the island.The movie has a whole host of characters. The main character is Chief, one of the dogs who used to be a stray before being deported to Trash Island. He works alongside several other dogs to help 12-year old Atari find his missing dog. The rest of the dogs, King, Rex, Boss, and Duke, are really more comic reliefs that anything else. On the mainland, there are really too many characters to count. Mayor Koboyashi is the film's main villain, and the uncle of Atari. There's Tracy, an American exchange student who knows something is up with Koboyashi, the scientist, who works on curing the disease that's been infecting the dogs, Nutmeg, a dog who values the relationship between humans and dogs, and many, many more. There are enough characters to the point where it becomes a problem with the movie. The hacker was a Deus ex Machina. What's interesting about this movie is that the human characters speak entirely in Japanese, with no subtitles included. Some of the more vital scenes have an English speaking translator talk, like for a news report. It works, though. Having much of the dialogue in Japanese adds a sense of authenticity to it, given that that's how those characters would really speak.By the way, am I the only one who doesn't find the dogs creepy at all? Everyone online seems to think so.",Isle of Dogs
146,eparazak,"This movie will make you say ""I love dogs""!",9,12 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's latest directed film as well as his second stop-motion animated feature. It's slowly being released to theaters nationwide and I finally got to see it alongside some friends of mine. It's about a boy named Atari Kobayashi who hijacks a plane and heads to Trash Island, which now acts as an island that is inhabited by the exiled dogs of Japan. While there, he encounters a pack of dogs lead by a stray and journeys with them to find his dog Spots.One of Isle of Dogs' biggest strengths for me is that the movie works off the generic ""adventure to find something"" movie. There are so many movies with this premise, and Isle of Dogs works off of it by exploring the lore and the world as it goes on. It explains the dog epidemic, what's being done about it and the perspectives of both the opposers and supporters of Mayor Kobayashi's decision of exiling the dogs.Speaking of which, this movie does have a lot of political commentary surrounding it. I don't wanna get into spoilers, but all I can say is that it tackles topics like censorship, political opposition and exilation. For the most part, they're done very well.The Japanese people in here all speak their native language, and they don't use subtitles to translate the dialogue. Instead, they use Interpreter Nelson voiced by Frances McDormand as the translator...some of the time. It uses her to translate Mayor Kobayashi's dialogue but virtually nobody else's. Elsewhere, we don't have any idea what they say. While most people may have a problem with it, I found this an interesting choice since it relies on show, don't tell if you're not a Japanese speaker.The visuals are obviously gorgeous, not to mention painstakingly handmade. From the faces, to the fur on the dogs and even the backgrounds, the team behind the animation process made sure to put in every little detail into the animation. The voice acting was also perfect; I couldn't think of any bad performance in here. Finally, the musical score really helped deliver the tone and tension of the story, and what's interesting is that they mostly consist of drums.If I could point to an aspect of the film that could've been better, it would have to be the pacing. To me, the movie movies too fast at times, and it gives less time for plot development and for us, the viewers to sink in the moment. I feel like if the time had been dragged on for a few more minutes, then that would solve that issue.Isle of Dogs is another fantastic Wes Anderson movie that brings out great storytelling, thought-provoking political commentary and gorgeous animation. I suggest giving this a watch if you're a fan of Anderson's work, a fan of stop-motion or a fan of movies in general.9/10P.S. Try saying Isle of Dogs fast, it sounds like you're saying I love dogs. Clever Anderson, clever!",Isle of Dogs
147,seige-hound,A Beautiful and Compelling Film,10,22 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs, from its first frame, oozes style. The amount of craft shown in this film is incredible, but even then, they still manage to tell an emotionally involved story.The film is set in Japan, but not in the real sense. 20 years into a dystopian future of a strange mix of different states of culture and technology. This strange and wonderful setting elevates the film in ways that weren't even necessary. You could have essentially told the same story set in the United States, or anywhere else for that matter, but instead they decided to put it in Japan, which gave them a tremendous amount of creative freedom to tell a story that is entirely unique in presentation.Some critics have complained about cultural appropriation, asking whether or not the representation of Japan in this film is fair or sensitive. I'm not Japanese, so I cannot answer for them, but I would hope these people would ask the number of Japanese people who worked on this film, from story to acting, and I'm sure they would have perfectly valid answers for the creative decisions made. This version of 'Japan' isn't meant to be real, it's meant to be a fantasy world inspired by Japan, a world where such a ridiculous story could occur. We don't hear people complaining about cultural appropriation and sensitivity in regards to Avatar: The Last Airbender, so they shouldn't be here.Now a decent criticism you could levy at this film is the severe lack of well developed female characters. There are five female characters with speaking roles. One is an interpreter, one is Yoko Ono, and the other three serve as romantic partners for the three major characters (Chief, Spots and Atari), and not very well developed ones at that. I'm not going to dock a star for this because I rate movies based on how much I enjoyed the experience, not based on any nitpicks or technical issues, but as a person who does care about positive and progressive representation of women and minorities, it is disappointing that the only real inclusion of female characters in this film were to fill in shallow, one dimensional romances in a story that didn't need them.That shouldn't affect your ability to come into this film and enjoy it though. This is an incredible film with a lot of value. The art design, direction and story are strong, funny and at times dark. This is an incredibly unique film that deserves all the money it can get.",Isle of Dogs
148,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Substantive style over Substance,6,30 March 2018,"Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's love letter to Dogs and Japan, her aesthetic, her archetypes, and her culture. And it's in those respects where the movie flourishes, as Anderson lovingly and meticulously breathes life into his imagined Nippon of the future. If you love Wes Anderson and Dogs, you'll probably dig this movie. Furthermore, if you have an appreciation of Japan and its culture you might like it too...just don't expect anything more than a superficial treatment and you won't be disappointed. I would also add that this superficiality, the elevation of style over substance, is what keeps this from being a great film, as the human characters were all flat. They were one-dimensional archetypes, and the lead, a boy named Atari felt more like a conglomeration of archetypes and quirks than anything else.
Anderson didn't let me spend enough time with them, and Anderson didn't spend enough time developing them, for those characters and storylines to come together in a satisfying way.Now the story involving the dogs was quite enjoyable, and had a pleasant enough conclusion, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the un-engaging humans we had to follow for much of the screen-time. They weighed the picture down, and it dragged...specifically the second act (a guy in my showing fell asleep about forty five minute in, and I must admit that my eye lids got heavy too).Basically with Isle of Dogs, what you see is what you get. If you dig Wes Anderson, and his muses, you'll probably like this movie. It's a lovely looking movie with real moments of visual and atmospheric inspiration. Just keep your expectations low and don't expect any real depth.",Isle of Dogs
149,AlbertCinefilu,"Oh man, I've missed Wes Anderson's movies so much!",9,29 January 2021,"It's only been 2 years since I watched a movie by Wes Anderson, namely ''Fantastic Mr. Fox'', but now I feel like it's been an eternity. Even if it's not easy to describe the atmosphere of his movies, believe me, there is only one like him. He's a true film auteur and an artist, not just a director.If you want to have a clue about his film-making style (but nothing more, since you have to watch his movies to feel it) here are some of his trademarks: a unique colorful scheme that is really bright and uplifting but finds itself in opposition to the mental state of the characters (this creates a comedic effect for me); a certain kind of nostalgia, a childlike feeling floating through the air; a witty, ingenious sense of humor for both older children and adults; children or animals that present a more mature behavior than grown-ups and many other aspects that I'll let you discover.Coming back to ''Isle of Dogs'', his latest future and second animation, I can confirm it has everything listed above and something more. It has several bits of high-quality, fable-like parody of human behavior and character. It's not that he lacks that in his overall work, it's just that here the information and the humor is slightly easier to assimilate and this without ever feeling like lazy-writing (there are a couple clichés here and there, but they are handled in a way that doesn't make them seem typical).Another thing that I think he gets right (and even if just partially right) is the cultural element. I don't recall him trying to include another culture in his movies and as a fan I have to say this only added to the bizarreness and exotic character of the movie. There was a sushi scene where I was laughing out loud with my father at the ''sick'' humor of seeing some aquatic beings being chopped while still living (it's not what it seems from my description, just watch it).In the end, I'm awaiting to see Wes Anderson's next feature film, ''The French Dispatch'' and hope I'll be pleasantly surprised once again.A 9,5 out of 10 from me.",Isle of Dogs

I saw this at a midnight showing and I can tell you, everyone walking out of the theater was raving and talking about how great it was, And it was, such a charming a cute adventure of a story that was a total surprise, in the sense of a surprise to see Anderson making an animated film. I was so exited for the film and it really was in no way a disappointment, I thoroughly enjoyed his latest work, in fact, I might go see it twice, which is rare for me. In the second paragraph I will discuss a little more about what exactly I liked about it, but in general this was a damn good film that demands a viewing.Wes Anderson's style is so honed in this film despite it being animated. The use of colors and symmetry are still plainly obvious, the color and design of things very consistent giving a believable world for the film to be set in. Each one of the characters was deeply developed and fascinating while also working off many of the other characters. The writing is sharp, intelligent, and very well written in the style of many of the other Anderson classics.

151,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Isle of Dogs,9,6 April 2019,"I think that it is fair to say that Wes Anderson definitely has a particular style. Isle of Dogs fits perfectly into his filmography as a charming story of friendship and trust that just so happens to also be about dogs. The animation is truly amazing and I am blow away by how well Anderson can block and stage scenes in the stop motion style. This film looks beautiful start to finish and is a treat to watch for that. The voice cast is also pretty interesting as it made up mostly of well known actors with recognisable voices playing to their public image. Every word said be Goldblum or Murray especially feels exactly like what you would expect real word Goldblum and Murray to say. My only real criticism is that despite being really charming, this movie does not make a lick of sense and fails to build a solid word with it's own internal logic for this story. I found myself often taken out of the film when something would happen that just didn't add up, I guess with this being more of a family film it doesn't matter too much and there is enough to enjoy without thinking too hard about the plot. It's not Anderson's best work but it will most certainly satisfy his fans.",Isle of Dogs
152,Jack_C_,Another Wes Anderson Classic,9,26 March 2018,"We absolutely loved Isle of Dogs. All of your classic Wes Anderson tropes of lingering still shots, zany dialogue, and an outlandish take on underdogs (pun intended) rebelling against the system are present. The Japanese themes were artistically delivered as well as one could expect, and felt respectful to the culture. The quality is as good as Fantastic Mr Fox, though the heavy use of untranslated Japanese leaves the viewer somewhat emotionally estranged from human characters.Setting is modern Japan, where a dog flu epidemic has turned a city against its furry friends. The evil dog hating mayor has rounded up all dogs and exiled them to trash island, where they live in filth and suffering. Atari, the adopted son of the Mayor, flies a plane onto the island to rescue his dog. Hilarity and poignant moments ensue.Don't miss this one if you are a Wes Anderson fan, or simply want a great comedy. Certain scenes may bother kids below the age of 5. The subtle allegory on an evil leader stirring the pot against the most helpless in our society is timely and well wrought. There is a legitimate criticism on the ""white savior"" plot device that plagues nearly all Western movies based in Asia, and I hope future directors take heed.",Isle of Dogs
153,Clank_Zoka,Wes Anderson You Done It again,10,27 March 2018,"I knew I would be in a for a treat (no pun intended) when Wes Anderson would make another Stop-Motion animated film the first being Fantastic Mr. Fox which I really liked and is one of my favourite Stop-Motion films of all time, that's the only film I have seen from him but now I should more of his films since Fantastic Mr Fox really impressed me.I was really pumped for this movie since it's by Wes Anderson, it has a huge cast and it's about Japan and Samauri Dogs fighting, now that sounds amazing, I hope Wes knows what he is doing with this and thanks to my local cinema getting a early screening on Sunday the 25th, I was delighted to see film early before coming out on the 30th, so I did see it and......... I LOVED IT!, this is even better then Fantastic Mr. Fox, this could arguably be one of the best films of this year, so what's it about?.In the city of Megasaki, Mayor Kobayashi banishes all flu infected dogs to a island called ""Trash Island"" where all dogs live in a grey, unpleasant, rotten and dangerous island where junk food is thrown away and other props that have now turn into junk, however a 12-Year-Old boy named Atari Kobayashi travels to the island to look for his loyal bodyguard dog named Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber) with the help of five other dogs, Chief (Bryon Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray), Duke (Jeff Goldblum) and King (Bob Balaban).So from what I just said, you'll know what will happen, in just the most basic way possible and it will be just as generic as any other animated film, but not this one, Wes Anderson put in so much elements in to one and for some strange reason it.... actually works, comedy, drama, suspense, adventure, fantasy and sci-if, all of these elements in this movie work off each other with every unique turn, it all stays on point with It elements and doesn't feel out of place, it creates atmosphere and different moods, the film also have genuine emotion that anyone who has dogs can relate to and can pull off really funny moments at the same time can be quite mature, the film also have moments that I didn't see coming and quite graphic and a bit sweary for a PG which shows Wes is taking risks, seeing the film as more of a adult film then a harmless family movie, I never thought I would say this but this is not only a original idea with it's fantastic direction, writing and a powerful moral about Dogs should be treated equally and old things shouldn't be replaced with new things to change the future, in all honesty this much effort feels so.... groundbreaking.The animation is fantastic, I know it's expected for a stop-motion film like this but you can't help but be impressed by it, comparing it to Fantastic Mr. Fox, this animation has ideas, for example the different styles used when a character is seen on CCTV cameras or when characters are seen in a far distance is used in different art styles and it works unbelievably well, the characters have a down to earth and real look to it, the dogs are all each identified by their types, you can tell who's who from Chief to Nutmeg to Jupiter, their fur moves normally like wind is blowing through it, which is such a unique small detail that is just creates realism and believability, the humans look fantastic, looking almost realistic with very expressive faces, they all have a unique look that stands out as well, the backgrounds are so well-crafted like the city is a place full of colour and makes you feel welcomed while Trash Island has a grey, dirty, nasty, unpleasant and sad look to it that again creates a mood of misery and fear, the animation truly knows how to make stop-motion animation look impressive, extraordinary and beautiful fall at the same time.The characters are all unforgettable and so likeable that people will have at least one favourite, They all play a part in the plot that gets it going and they all have a moment to shine to show who they are and what their goals are, my favourite characters are Chief, Spots, Atari, Rex, Tracy, Nutmeg and Jupiter, they all have personality and some memorable about them, same with the villains, they create fear and conflict with our heroes and they can be quite intimidating, the voice acting is top-notch, with big names like Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Scarlet Johansson, Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum and the rest of cast as well, everyone put in great voice performances, Bryan Cranston, Scarlet Johansson, Liev Schreiber and Greta Gerwig all stand out for me and just put so much emotion and effort into their performances, I'm happy that the major character have development and all the rest have a purpose with wonderful voice acting.And on a side note, the score by Alexandre Desplat is one of the best movie scores I have ever heard, seriously, check it out, it's so fascinating, but after the movie of course.So yeah as you can tell I love this movie so much, need I say more?, an originally plot, groundbreaking and brilliant animation, characters that have development while others all have screen time with a moment to shine with wonderful voice-acting and an amazing score, people if you love Fantastic Mr. Fox and/or Wes Anderson, you'll love this, take the kids to see this one if they can handle blood and swears, it's a mature and adult film that everyone must watch, please see it while it's still in cinemas because we need more stop-motion films to prove that they can still make money and bring us something timeless, but Wes Anderson, you did me proud, cannot wait to see the next stop-motion you make next.I'm at delighted to give Isle of Dogs a solid 10/10.",Isle of Dogs

It's incredible stop motion, with an unparalleled attention to details.

It seems a shame to give an actor like Jeff Goldblum only 4 or 5 lines, especially considering he has perfected the deadpan humor this movie is going for.
Furthermore, the movie is a bit emotionally lacking, as it rushes along so fast that you don't really connect to the characters, so I can see ""style over substance"" being the biggest criticism.Although the plot is admittedly loose and iften nonsensical, the script is great and the overall story entertaining enough to forgive the rest, and the movie sure doesn't have a dull moment.",Isle of Dogs

And if you are a fan of his work, it's enough to say that he is the director and scriptwriter of the cartoon ""Island of Dogs"".First of all, the visual component of the cartoon, unusually distinguished against the background of frankly children's Pixar and Disney, attracts attention.This puppet cartoon event takes place 20 years later in the Japanese city of Megasaki, where, as a result of the epidemic of canine influenza, the ruling kitten party led by the mayor Kobayashi moved all the dogs to a garbage island, condemning them to death from disease and hunger. However, one 12-year-old boy decides to save his dog and goes in search of him.The cartoon is wonderful, touching, funny and sad at the same time. This kind of anti-utopia, which shows the impartial nature of people. Some plot scenes are very similar to the modern reality and are perceived as a political satire. The highlight of the cartoon is that conversations of people are not translated, except for the necessary cases and the audience hears the Japanese speech, while the language of the dogs is translated into Russian.The dogs are the main characters of this story, in the original they are voiced by movie stars: Cranston, Norton, Murray, Goldblum, McDormand, Johanson, Swinton, Yoko Ono and many others. Unfortunately in dubbing we do not hear their voices and maybe because of this the dogs came out not so individual, stand out and bright.Despite this, the cartoon is extremely positive emotions, there is something to mourn and laugh about, what to think about. The cartoon raises issues of ecology, political structure, rights and freedoms of people and animals, so do not take this picture as entertainment for children, there are enough tough and unpleasant scenes.Occurring on the screen is accompanied by colorful music with pronounced Asian notes, complementing the picture with a certain emotional color.A wonderful cartoon and I hope that against the background of the ""Avengers"" he will not get lost and find his audience.",Isle of Dogs

161,rustonreviews,"A scrappy, meticulously crafted animation from Anderson.",7,13 April 2018,"Stop motion animation is a painstakingly long process. In Laika's fourth feature, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), a 16-foot skeleton was constructed over a 6 month period and took an entire year to film its sequence, resulting in 49.2 seconds worth of footage in the completed film. With facts like these, it's evident that stop motion films are true labours of love, involving countless animators to bring these visions to life. Wes Anderson's second foray into stop motion cinema (his first being 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox) is Isle of Dogs, set in Japan and boasting a large, impressive cast list. With fears of an outbreak of snout fever becoming overwhelming throughout Japan, Kobayashi, the Mayor of Megasaki City, banishes all dogs to an island of trash, ensuring the citizens that a cure is impossible. First on the list is Spots (Liev Schieber) the beloved dog of Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin), ward of Mayor Kobayashi. Several months pass, and Atari flies out to trash island in search of Spots, and is immediately joined on his quest by a ragtag group of dogs, including Rex (Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Murray), and Chief (Cranston). One of the most notable things about Isle of Dogs is the characteristics and expressions of the dogs. There is so much emotion and detail in their eyes, and the animation perfectly captures their mannerisms and provides the audience with a selection of lovable characters to spend time with on an island towering with garbage. Scrappy and rough, yet strangely beautiful, the films aesthetic is a certainly unique one. Anderson splits the film into two storylines that ultimately unite towards the end. The first features Atari and the dogs travelling across the island in search of Spots, and the second centring on Tracey Walker (Lady Birds writer/director Greta Gerwig) investigating a conspiracy surrounding Major Kobayashi. Whilst this secondary plot doesn't quite measure up to the strengths of Atari's quest, it still works and results in a satisfying conclusion to both arcs. One of the sweetest aspects of the film is the bond between Atari and stray dog Chief, who makes it clear on several occasions after Atari's unexpected arrival that he does not bow to any master, yet over the course of the film gradually eases up and becomes a loyal aid to his quest. A quirky, sweet tale of the bond between a boy and his dog, Anderson's second stop motion film is an enjoyable animated adventure that finds beauty in the unlikeliest of places.",Isle of Dogs

164,Metaflix,Wes Anderson succeeds in giving his second stop motion film greater depth and sophistication,7,5 April 2018,"'Isle of Dogs' is going to most readily be compared to 2009's 'Fantastic Mr. Fox', Wes Anderson's first stop motion picture, and given that the former is Anderson's second time trying his hand at stop motion, one would expect both the technical and artistic aspects of the film to be of greater sophistication. Simply put, Anderson succeeds on both fronts.Setting the film abroad in Japan poses numerous language and translation issues that have to be addressed throughout the film, and Anderson nimbly uses it to his advantage. Furthermore, each of the dogs is given a meaningful amount of depth and characterization. That being said, there were a handful of times I felt my attention drifting throughout the movie, and I found myself less emotionally invested in the plight of the characters as the film went on. In the end, Anderson has brought to us another prototypical Wes Anderson film, a unique combination of his particular form and function that we've come to know and enjoy, so while I certainly recommend seeing the film, I think it would really take being a dog lover to really love this movie.",Isle of Dogs
165,willeasyer,This movie is spectacular. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen!,9,24 June 2018,"I guess that Wes Anderson is incapable of making a bad movie. As simple and childish this movie might seem to you, it's everything but that. It's like a modern age animal farm a poignant epopé about freedom, propaganda, and tyranny against democracy. One of the many things that attracted me about this movie is how alive and human this puppets and dogs are especially the dogs, they feel alive and they're very attachable, moving and funny (the way they vote to decide at any situation is very charming and clever) and I guess it's done on purpose to make you wonder how no one except atari noticed that and set them as the representatives of democracy aka freedom from the beginning. I must also praise the voice acting Ed Norton, Brian Cranston and Bill Murray can deliver a heavily charged humorous and touching performances only relying on their voices, I was mesmerized. The other thing that impressed me with this movie is how beautiful and original this world and story are with this fictional Japan stuck between the future and the past plus the manner Wes managed to convey a complex and thorny message through a funny, simple and gratifying story is border genius. Add to it his iconic romantic touch and directing that make the best out of this epic. I promise you won't be able to lift your eyes for a second, it's by far one of the best movies of the year.",Isle of Dogs
166,mauriciofernandogerhardt,The plot is the same as the isle: a trash heap with cuddliness on top.,1,27 June 2018,"First of all, I must admit I thought this movie was boringly slow paced (as most of Wes Anderson's movies), so I didn't pay attention to all the details in the movie, so there might be some stuff wrong with my review, but since I didn't see other people exposing the plot as well as could be done, I felt obligated to do so.
Cat lover and dog hater mayor makes gets a pharmaceutical company to create a dog disease (this is only exposed much later in the movie).
Even though there's a scientist politician who tells people that they can create a cure for the dogs, the Mayor gets people to hate dogs and makes a law that bans them to an island that serves as a trash dump.
A rich boy had a loyal bionic super intelligent bodyguard dog (btw all the dogs in this movie have human level or higher intelligence), and he goes to the island to save his dog.
His dog was dead, but he had brothers. The boy fights against Mayor agents and robot dogs who want to get rid of (kill) the boy, and keep the dogs in the isle.
In the continent (outside the island), the scientist politician finds the cure for the dog disease and gets killed for it by the Mayor's group.
Also, the Mayor tells the world that the rich boy has died.
An exchange student from the U.S.A. has a hunch that this banning of dogs is because of a conspiracy done by the mayor, and he leads a group of japanese kids to help him. And after finding out that the politician/ scientist was killed he goes to another of the Mayor's speeches and exposes him.
When the Mayor is telling that the exchange boy has lied, and is going to get deported, the rich boy who made a raft and got a lot of the dogs to the continent appears and helps expose the villany of the Mayor, by proving that the rich boy is alive and that the cure works on dogs.
At that point the Mayor decides to expose himself as honorless, and turns good, and tries to stop another of his evil minions from pressing a button that will exterminate dogs on the island.
The evil minion presses anyway, but instead of that killing the dogs, it kills the evil minions.
Then dogs join human society again.
There are so many plot holes in this story, deus ex machina moments, terrible personality developments, as well as bad analogies to actual events that you can clearly see that they thought of the esthetics first, and the content later to fill in gaps.",Isle of Dogs

This is Wes Anderson at his finest particularly as realized through the film's animation. Not enough can be said with just how gorgeous and wonderful the film looks, I especially admired the blend of the hand drawn with the stop motion. The film itself is part just classical talking animals learning to love again picture, which wholly enjoyable particularly in how enjoyable the world it creates among the dogs.The other half is semi-Kurosawa, but I'd argue far more Masaki Kobayashi with the lone ""samurai"" taking on the strictures of his society through his own individualism and rebellion. It's masterfully crafted work that deserves to be mentioned along side ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" by Anderson. This is the best animated achievement of 2019",Isle of Dogs
172,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A Wes Anderson-ish underdog tale,8,24 March 2018,"If you are expecting symmetrical compositions, deadpan humor and the occasional sudden bursts of uncomfortable violence with some emotion throw in then you know you have stepped into a Wes Anderson film. And that's what Isle of Dogs but a lot more political and serious then you might expect.Isle of Dogs is set in an alternate future Japan where Mayor Kobayashi uses fear and paranoia to manipulate the people of Megasaki City to banish his family's ancient mortal enemy: dogs. With the dog population carrying a contagious flu, Kobayashi tricks the citizens into believing Trash Island (literally an island made of trash) is the only place the infected canines can be quarantined. But through the actions of his distant adopted nephew Atari to rescue his bodyguard dog Spots, he gains the aid from a pack of Alpha dogs Rex, Boss, Duke, King and reluctantly the stray Chief.At first it may seem like it's a boy and his dog storyline but Anderson goes deeper then that. It is truly about the stray Chief finding his place in a xenophobic world. Because of his status as a wild stray, Chief isn't trustful of human society and sees the civilized democratic voting method by the other Alpha pack members as being more problematic then progressive. Chief's hatred for civilized politics becomes justified when we see how the people of Megasaki's decision-making process is very much influenced by the latest rumour and propaganda to portray the dogs as the threat to society. Its there that Anderson's political points become very clear that reflect on what is going within the political system today.
By making most of the Japanese characters speak in their natural language while dogs are translated into English, it creates a language barrier that shows Atari as an outsider. This displays the divide that has been made between dog and mankind. But when Atari's noble actions speak louder then his own words, his kindness and sympathy changes Chief's view and he finds a greater purpose in life beyond just trying to survive. There it becomes more of a classic tale of a group of underdogs (no pun intended) fighting against people in power.Where Isle of Dogs really succeeds beyond its politics is its world-building. Anderson creates so much history around Trash Island. His attention to detail makes each layer and cube of garbage feels so real and tactile. As the characters travel across the island, more is revealed of its tragic history to reflect on the dog population's own blight. Megasaki City is a bright shinning utopia that is in political disarray that has divided the people between the corrupted Kobayashi clan and the dog-supporting protesters.Where Isle of Dogs I think does struggle with is that the Japanese characters outside Atari don't get as much characterizations and are more painted as broad archetypes. And since Anderson does not use that much subtitles for the Japanese dialogue, it can feel a bit disconnecting since I only speak English. It feels even more awkward the character that gets the most depth in Megasaki is the white American English-speaking foreign-exchange student Tracy Walker.Not sure if it's a negative but Anderson, with lack of subtly and maybe its intentional, makes cats or at least cat people as the obvious villains. The fact that every evil member of the Kobayashi family has a devlish-looking cat as a pet to the mayor himself revealing to have a huge back tattoo of cats, it could shrugged the cat people community the wrong way.While it does not top his previous film Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs is more spectacular, smarter and richer in detail then Wes Anderson's previous stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's a movie that I think adults will take more in then kids because of the heavy subject matter and dark themes.",Isle of Dogs

In Isle of Dogs he delivers signature moves that make his work so good - compelling story, carefully detailed and visually entertaining planimetric shots, deadpan humor... but... the depiction of Japanese culture made me uncomfortable.

174,paulmcuomo,"An unconventional children's film, but it's Wes Anderson so what did you expect?",8,15 April 2018,"Wes Anderson is probably, along with Spike Jonze, one of those directors that has such an extreme style that you know that when they have a new movie out you have no idea what it'll be like - just that you'll want to see it and you'll almost certainly like it.I really enjoyed The Fantastic Mr Fox and The Grand Budapest Hotel, and so for this I was interested for an angular, interesting take on the idea of the children's film. The dog angle also played a big part of my anticipation in the film, as I have had 4 dogs in the course of my life, and view them as my best friends in a way.The big thing about this film, much like other Anderson films is that there is no shying away from the fact that the animals in this film do suffer some harm. Bizarrely enough, despite there being instances in the film relating to suicide, cannibalism, starvation and - in a way - genocide relating to the dogs, the kids in my audience had zero issue with it. It was a ""think of the children"" moment that the children didn't care about, because within the context of the story, it functions perfectly for the narrative.Speaking of narrative, this film has a deeply tangent storyline, in which we follow the dogs on the Isle, specifically Rex, Chief and Spots, voiced respectively by Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston and Live Schieber. Then there's the attempts by Atari, voiced by Japanese actor Koyu Rankin, to rescue Spots and fly a prop plane to the Isle to do so, and also the similar endeavours of American exchange student Tracey, voiced by Greta Gerwig. The film is also told in an untraditional 5 act structure, which frequent flashbacks, stories retold from an altered perspective, and everything to make this an unconventional movie. The voice acting is a standout of the movie, with those names I've mentioned being real standouts, in particular Cranston, who does well with his tough guy stray persona that evolves into a softer, more caring character throughout, and Norton who delivers a side to acting we haven't seen before: delivering heavy, expositional, big dialogue in a rapid fire humorous fashion. Also shoutout to a small part voiced by Scarlett Johannson as a love interest for Chief, who provides a soothing quality akin to her voice role in Spike Jonze's film Her.The film's mystery and thriller elements are accessible to both older and younger audiences, and do make this, along with Kubo and The Two Strings, a film that would both test and extend the tastes of younger audiences. It certainly does merge into an element to the film I want to talk about with regard to how it is portrayed - the portrayal of the Japanese culture, and the ""white saviour"" character of Tracey. First and foremost, something cool about this film is that whenever there is a dialogue not in English, it isn't subtitled - really, only the credits have both the English and Japanese equivalents - and this is acknowledged: ""Man, I wish someone spoke his language"", among other things are said, and a healthy amount of visual storytelling is used. Secondly, the idea that Tracey is a white saviour is fairly misplaced, as whilst she does uncover a deeper mystery run by the Kobayashi government (itself, a callback to the Japanese coffee cup brand, and the alias used by Keyzer Soze's lawyer in The Usual Suspects, great touch) her findings are largely ineffective until Atari (another piece of Asian business and culture used sweetly and amusingly) gets involved. In fact, her involvement is entirely triggered by Atari's engaging in his quest.What we're viewing here is tantamount to healthy cultural, and bi-cultural conversation. It's not offensive, nor inoffensive, it's an integral part of a film I very highly rate and recommend. Oh, one last thing - Isle of Dogs, if said quickly, sounds very similar to ""I Love Dogs"". Again, really nice detail.",Isle of Dogs

Which leads to this statement, if you like Wes Anderson you like the film, but if you don't, then you won't like the film. It's just that simple. I find myself on the line for his films. I want to dive in and soak it up, but at the same time, it is so different and irregular that it sets and uneasy feeling in me. 
But outside of the directing, the movie was a success. The characters were on point, and he was able to convey so much detail and plot, with mostly physical queues and not words. The main characters were appealing and the bad characters were sinister. Also being a dog lover, this movie was right up my ally.

It has a quality and creativity like no other of its type particularily because of the excellent animation it has, and the fact that it was filmed I think like 5 seconds per week makes it even more impressive.And the style of Wes Anderson is intact. Along with the script, the film portraits a scenario that, altough tragic and unfair for dogs and their lovers, it is full of heart and highly humorous situations in a way that only he can make. The strong soundtrack by the great Alexandre Desplat perfectly fits with what we are watching.The voice cast was great too. My personal favourites were Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson and Edward Norton, but I think that everyone in the cast did a really good job. But of course, he who knows some of the work of Wes Anderson also knows that the cast of most of his movies is composed only by great actors.Overall, this is a great movie that probably is not for everyone, but if you're into realistic animated films that show you the world as it is, or as it will be, then enough said, this movie is for you. I think it completely deserves the Oscar for best animated feature next year. Parents, if you are thinking about taking your kids to watch this movie, please have in mind that this is a PG-13 rated movie that isn't really intended for children as there's a complex, dark and sometimes scary tone in it.Thanks for reading!",Isle of Dogs

The stop-motion animation is a sight for sore eyes, especially with all the flashy computer-generated animation out there, Sometimes less is more. Each frame, Each scene while stunning is soothing at the same time, which is the trademark of the director.
It is one of those rare movies where the technical craft is on par with the emotional craft. While it has great direction, cinematography, music, voice acting (Perfect casting), The story is what struck a deep chord with me.
Dogs love their humans unconditionally and it is great to see a story which shows this love and has a human protagonist who reciprocates that love and does everything he can to get his best friend back. Atari Kobayashi talks less but his actions speak volumes, As a protagonist, he is a breath of fresh air. The dogs Rex, Duke, King, Boss and Chief are hilarious (Throughout the movie, I kept wondering just how does Duke know everything?? I am really glad they answered that question, lol).
The movie has a lot of themes such as propaganda, conspiracy, animal-cruelty and unjustified hatred but at its heart is the bond between a dog and it's human. I recommend this movie to any dog lover out there. It will make you appreciate your dog and dogs in general, a bit more.

182,neobateman,For all dog lovers.,8,5 May 2018,"Wes Anderson is a filmmaker that is very divisive. Some of his films are brilliantly written and have such a unique style that further analysis of his films are inevitable. This goes in particular for his recent film before Isle of Dogs, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Isle of Dogs is another stop motion animated film in the same vein as Fantastic Mr Fox. However the animation of Isle of Dogs makes Fantastic Mr Fox look like a mockbuster. In a futuristic Japanese city called Megasaki, dogs have been abandoned to a nearby island because of the viruses they carry that may perhaps infect humans. When one day a little boy named Atari lands on the island, he and a pack of dogs supposedly ran by Chief (Bryan Cranston) set out to find Atari's best friend Spots (Liev Schreiber). The film boasts an incredible ensemble cast, like many of Wes Anderson's films. The pack of dogs are voiced by the talented Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum. The rest of the cast also includes the talents of Greta Gerwig, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Yoko Ono, Tilda Swinton and Ken Watanabe. All these actors do fantastic jobs in adding character to each of their animated counterparts. Voice acting is a tough job because the actor has to add emotion using only his or her voice. Luckily everyone exceeds in this brilliantly, especially Bryan Cranston. He adds a grumpy personality that gives him a lot of authority, he stood out very well among all the other incredibly talented actors. Like most other Wes Anderson projects this film is hard to get into, the audience must be ready to watch a film like this. This goes especially for this, families might walk into this film expecting a nice family film, I will warn them right away, this is not a kids film. Children can certainly watch it (its rated PG), there is nothing overly gory, sexual or offensive about it. However most of the human characters speak Japanese (as the film is set there). There are no subtitles provided, either the dialogue is translated by someone or the importance of the scene is portrayed through visual storytelling. This certainly won't be too difficult to adults, however I can see kids struggling with that. There are also some very great parallels to totalitarian government and to things such as the holocaust. There is some definite deeper meaning to this film. The animation is as I mentioned before, spectacular. This is some of the best I have ever seen. The stop motion adds so much detail that it is honestly seamless, it adds a specific style, however never is there a scene where I went, that looks animated. Of course this being a Wes Anderson film, there will also be some criticism. I will also add that one particular character voiced by Gerwig felt slightly off, she didn't add much to the overall story and slowed the interesting aspects down. Overall there is not much to complain about for me. My most important recommendation is that you need to know what kind of a film this is. You need to be in the mood for this picture and not expect a harmless family adventure. However I can assure you at the end, if you love dogs, you wanna simply go home and cuddle it for hours.",Isle of Dogs

I t stars Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Koyu Rankin (Juken) and Edward Norton (American History X).This films direction and writing is incredible as always. Wes Anderson in my opinion is one of the best directors working today. But the animation steals the show, It is stunning to look at, every frame could by a painting that I would haply buy. The voice cast is brilliant but the stand outs are defiantly Cranston and the narrator Courtney B. Vance (The Hunt for Red October) who delivered his lines with elegance. Finally, I loved the score by Alexandre Desplat (The King's Speech), but most importantly I loved the way Anderson and Desplat incorporated the music from one of my favorite films Seven Samurai (1954).In my opinion Isle of dogs is one of, if not the best films of the year.10/10",Isle of Dogs

So many character actors have joined this project - there're still people passionate about motion pictures!(^_^) Although the movie atmosphere was mostly goofy-comical and sarcastic, its crew showed their respect to the Japanese culture with meticulous stop-motion production design (landscape, stage play, historical paintings / scrolls depicted in the movie). This film may not recoup its production cost, so this level of dedication (I've visited most prefectures in Japan except the north) was a real treat to Japanese culture and animation fans.The group dynamics among the main dog characters who have been abandoned on the island were both hilarious and poignant satires about social inequality, isolation, public paranoia, scientific ethics, corruption, and urban pollution. This fairy tale Invites us, the audience, to take in the fun and the serious side of life, with a human-canine paw touch.",Isle of Dogs

190,SharkByteAudioProductions,The most charming film of 2018 - Isle of Dogs is a masteclass in animation and film making,10,11 December 2019,"I believe Isle of Dogs was somewhat overlooked - it's initial aesthetic may appear somewhat off putting for an animated movie, especially if you intend it for children but it's fantastic. I've never watched a Wes Anderson movie but the premise alone of this movie was intriguing enough.Firstly, as a Western produced film - I believe it's very respectful and faithful to Japanese culture and film making - majority of the human characters talk in their native language and this is something overlooked when setting a film in Japan. The score feels dynamic, traditional and exciting - really adding to the emotions and pacing of the film.The story presented here is fantastic - simple enough for children to understand on a surface level but deep enough for adults, especially with the politics involved. It's emotional, relatable and lots of fun, even with its dark humour outlook of dispair and desperation.The attention to detail in this movie is astonishing - every shot is composed with purpose, every model is unique and the fluidity of scenes join together with a brisk pace that ties everything together nicely! The film changes animation style consistently in such a manner that it adds another layer to the film making.The voice acting was completely nailed by every actor/actress and it really added to the charm of the movie.Even as a certified Cat Daddy, I personally loved this movie, give it a watch.",Isle of Dogs
191,sonicheze8,Not the strongest Wes Anderson film,7,24 March 2019,"I adore Wes Anderson, he is an auteur with a distinguished idiosyncratic style. He's known for quirky films that display his brazen originality. Isle of dogs. his newest film, is undoubtedly an entertaining film, it's stop motion style is welcomed after a long drought since Kubo. The landscape is vivid and surreal. Dialogue snappy and stylish like all his other films.But watching the film, I couldn't help perceive a detachment between me and the film. That could entirely be me, but I felt that the characters weren't convincing enough. Most of them were one-dimensional, to serve the plot or to provide a quick remark there and now. Moreover, there are many characters and some of them do not even complete their arcs and even discarded in the end without resolution. This might be a byproduct of the ambition of the film to capture an adventure film with various plotlines, yet Wes Anderson had shown he could do it before. While the film is in no measure terrible, it had been caught in a more mainstream narrative of saving the day. One we have seen multiple times before.If this is your first Wes Anderson film I suggest you watch the Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel as I believe those are better substitutes.",Isle of Dogs
192,GoldenBlunderbuss,A heartwarming tale (tail?) but the cutesy Anderson style can't do much with trash,7,1 August 2018,"A 12-year-old Japanese boy, with the assistance of a small group from the local canine population, journeys across a barren landscape in search of his beloved dog, Spots.A helpful opening title card explains that the Japanese characters in Isle of Dogs speak Japanese (mostly) untranslated, while the dogs' barks have been generously translated into English. The film keeps its promise - the only time a Japanese character's dialogue is spoken in English is when they're on TV with a translator - which means that some parts go over our heads as they do the dogs' (since an Alsatian can't understand Japanese either), but never enough that the audience is alienated or lose track of what's going on. Sadly, there's little to the story - travel here, get some advice, travel there - but the way the script reveals the pasts of the dogs, the 'little pilot' named Atari and the island means there's always something going on to keep your attention, although people who don't like slower films will be fighting off their heavy eyelids (at 102 minutes, this is the second longest stop-motion film ever made).The animation, as you would expect from Wes Anderson, is charming and endearing to the eye much like his last venture into Ray Harryhausen's domain, Fantastic Mr. Fox. However this isn't an especially pretty film; the harsh landscape of an island made almost exclusively from refuse isn't one that lends kindly to Anderson's trademark cutesy style and perfectly centred simplistic shots, though he certainly tries. Instead the charm comes from the doubtless talents of the animators in giving the dogs individual and collective personalities, while the cast of voice actors aids their efforts.The biggest disappointment (not that there are any others worth mentioning) is that the ending is one of those that just happens because 'reasons'; it washes over you and the entire status quo is flipped on its head without being entirely sure why. Isle of Dogs leaves you with lasting messages of the dangers of misinformation, the perils of unflinching obedience to authority, and that man's best friends are bloody awesome - after all, the title itself when spoken makes the person admit their love of dogs!Best Quote: (in Bill Murray's voice) ""I was the lead mascot for an undefeated high school baseball team. I lost all my spirit ... I'm depressing.""",Isle of Dogs
193,littlemankazoo,How could you NOT love it?,8,28 March 2018,"In my experience, Wes Anderson films have always made great date films.Not even joking. My first proper movie date was with my girlfriend was when we saw The Grand Budapest Hotel. We instantly fell in love with it, and it's a night I still remember fondly for the experience we had in a theater that consisted mainly of us and one other couple. It was simply magical.And that, perhaps, is what makes me love Wes Anderson's work so much; it's simply movie magic. The man can take any setup he pleases and turn it into a whimsical, silly, but somehow all the same ""Important"" piece of film that holds its own weight. In short, Wes Anderson has made himself an icon when it comes to the quirky and whimsy in film. His films are a warm blanket that I love to wrap myself in.In 'Isle of Dogs', the immediate strengths of Wes Anderson are apparent: the worlds he builds. The world of Megasaki and Trash Island are all realized in vivid detail, complete with a massive array of characters on both human and animal ends that one can recall and adore. Rather than the recent disappointment of 'Black Panther', where characterization took a backseat, this film OOZES character and a rich world you can feel. You can show me images of characters from this film and from their appearance ALONE I can tell you a story about them and what I enjoyed about them. The colorful and vast array of characters is something I think I loved most about this film, and still sticks with me even as I write this review.What else has to be admired regarding this film is its respectful and quite incredible treatment of Japanese culture and art. Right from the get-go, Anderson makes it apparent he WANTS the culture to envelope us. All Japanese characters speak Japanese. Only 1-2 humans speak English. The dogs only speak ""English"" for the benefit of our understanding of their dialogue. Megasaki LOOKS like Japan. Japanese text is constantly displayed and is translated in subtitles for only our benefit. There is clear respect paid to the culture Wes wishes to show us, and for having that courage to not simplify it out of sheer convenience, I admire his work here.Additionally, the homages to Japanese cinema, specifically Kurosawa, were welcome beyond all belief in this film. This film is hardly a zany and swift-moving animated film that one sees in this day and age. Heck, it is not even in the same league of movement and speed as Fantastic Mr. Fox was. Rather, this is a film that runs on its own pace, derived from Japanese cinema, and finds its footing in that delivery. It is a crisp, complete-feeling film that FEELS like a 2-hour film, but in the end, it barely coasts over 100 minute total...but it feels absolutely perfect in the time we are given in this rich world. In fact, by the time the film ended, I wanted MORE of the world I had seen.The animation, as if you are even remotely surprised, is GORGEOUS. Every frame, and I mean EVERY FRAME, is just magnificent to look at. Where Fantastic Mr. Fox had the warm cinematography on its side, Isle of Dogs sports a bleaker texture, though it manages to create its own charm that way. You feel the characters' emotions through their well-animated faces, you can see every hair on the dogs' bodies move, you feel every movement of this film and adore it for how charming and Wes Anderson-y it is. Thankfully, the only thing you can NOT feel is the scent of Trash Island...The only thing that has bugged me since seeing this film, however, is how little time the film has to really have FUN. The film is surprisingly played straight in most regards when it comes to conflict, and its tone is whimsy in some regards, but the laughs are surprisingly not as common as you would suspect them to be in a Wes Anderson product. This is not a case of a cultural barrier, but perhaps simply that the story Anderson chose to tell was far more important than including all the laughs he could. The tone of this film is ""different"" than most of his films, which is perhaps a good thing. It works for the film...but for most, I imagine ""different Wes Anderson"" won't click with everyone.The lack of too much ""fun"" is noticeable, however, in that we do not see too much of the silly side of this world Wes Anderson has built. We get occasional glimpses and gags that are classic Anderson and certainly hit, but by the end, it is a surprisingly serious tone the film chooses to maintain in its climax. Again, this WORKS, but I wonder how much more I would have loved the film if it were as child-like and fun as Fantastic Mr. Fox or Grand Budapest Hotel tended to be.The sometimes-noticeable lack of ""fun"", however, does not detract entirely from the enjoyment of the film itself. It is just as quirky and out-there in the best ways possible as any other Wes Anderson film, and thanks to that, the film simply beams with charm. Whether it be its animation style, Anderson's unique direction, or the fantastically unique score by Alexandre Desplate, this film sticks-out as any good Wes Anderson film should.That said, the strongest thing (Aside from the animation) about this film is its subtle message it attempts to strike. This film is one about companionship and love, which is a feeling that often goes hand-in-paw with the subject of dogs and pets. If you have ever been a dog owner, this film WILL strike a chord with you, as it has some very important things to say about our relationship with them that I think often goes understated.Dogs are a connection. Dogs are a beacon of loyalty and family. ""Dogs"" don't need to be dogs. Dogs are man's best friend.How could you not love dogs?How could you not love a Wes Anderson film ABOUT dogs?",Isle of Dogs

Notably, some objected to the pseudo-Japanese setting, but Isle of Dogs is set in Japan the same way The Mikado is: not for realism but as a distant place sufficiently removed from the present world to make the satire a bit safer.The stop-action animation is impressive and engaging. The plot isn't much; it's there to frame the satire, which is rather heavier than W S Gilbert's. The list of famous voices may seem a bit much, but on occasion there's a real shock in hearing a familiar voice with a different face. The soundtrack is often inventive and dramatic -- and with more African-sounding material than in Black Panther. Won't go on my favorites list, but it was fun.",Isle of Dogs

200,criti-cally,"This movie is a treat for the eyes, the heart and the soul {criti-cally reviews}",10,1 April 2019,"My ExpectationI had seen Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums and then his stop motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox, and I wan already into the movie watching the trailer. My hopes were really high considering it stared Bryan Cranston and Scarlett Johansson too, and was set in Japan (my top place to visit). So I had pretty much good expectations which were fulfilled from the movie. I wish I had seen it on a big screen though, instead of the flight.My ReviewFirst of all, the visual component of the movie is something especially new and crafted. One can find the typical Wes-Anderson style of stop motion animation and color effects, but the overall rough look of the characters with vivid colors lends it a completely different air compared to a Disney movie.Another notable thing about the movie is its background score. The score with colorful music and pronounced Asian tones and Japanese drums beating lends the movie a magical touch. The visual accompanied with the music makes the movie in itself something to watch and remember. Its an experience.Coming to the story, it's a new story and not easily predictable. The story has its ups and downs, and at a few places does get a little annoyingly slow, but overall the tone visual and music help carry it through those low moments. However the story is presented in a very smooth, fresh and unique way which never let there be a dull moment in the movie.Another great feature is that the Japanese dialogues are all in Japanese and haven't been translated. Only the important dialogues are either said in English or have subtitles. The dogs speak amongst each other in Russian but their dialogues are shown in English just for our benefit. So this uniqueness of retaining the language make it a more unique and absorbing experience.That said, the strongest thing (Aside from the animation) about this film is its subtle message it attempts to strike. This film is one about companionship and love, which is a feeling that often goes hand-in-paw with the subject of dogs and pets. If you have ever been a dog owner, this film WILL strike a chord with you, as it has some very important things to say about our relationship with them that I think often goes understated.Dogs are a connection.

201,odaleg,Because dogs are the best,8,10 May 2018,"Wes Anderson gives us a creative comedy, directed by charismatic characters with a political and satirical background.
The basis of the film is the animation, the artistic direction and especially the sound that is Is in charge of the Oscar-winning Desplat.
The narration of the film is perfectly taken, the important moments stand out, especially the flashbacks. The structure of the story helps to communicate as quickly as possible, this helps you to return to the extravagant characters and landscapes. 
The story, beyond being ridiculous and dissociating from reality is used to attract the viewer to it. After a certain moment you accept the strange rhythm and the accelerated editing style that the film has.
Once you accept it, the film takes you to an audiovisual experience so hypnotic that you do not want it to end. The negative note is the lack of originality that makes us think of something like ""this already seen"".

207,Danielpotato,A great animation does not make a great movie.,1,27 April 2018,"Let me make one thing clear, at the beginning of the film is narrated a Japanese legend about a samurai who has helped a bunch of dogs in the past. Yes the hero of this story is not the little Atari Kobayashi, but the white American student with Afro hair, named Tracy Walker. Of course you could not make a movie with American money, without appearing certain mannerisms or mechanisms. The dumbest minds will say that it is to lure people to the box office, but why the Japanese people, who are hustling in the history of this movie are idiots who can not communicate without screaming, and schizophrenics that can not socialize with other individuals from other countries. The clearest example is when Tracy Walker tries to ""pull"" a information from a japanese scientist over a sore to heal dogs. Seriously, Hollywood, why the filmmakers do not try to first change their mentality, before writing these scripts for these films.Yes, this movie has the same stereotype ideas about Japanese people that Hollywood thinks that is true, but I doubt many Hollywood guys had left their jobs or homes to live in Japan, and they would see a totally different life and people.Not to mention that the story of the film is totally chiché and predictable, despite the excellent animation (stop animation animated movie) out of ordinary. But good animation is not enough to save a movie. A good script, story and characters are the main reason, because when the animation effect passed away (the Wow reaction of the audience), it is the story that stays in the memory.The Wow effect on the audience due to the excellent animation only lasts the first 10 minutes of the movie, after this the audience becomes more interested about the story and characters rather the beautiful animation.

The work that went behind the stop-motion is admirable and quite finely detailed too but when it comes to draw the emotions out from the screen, it isn't utterly adequate. The writing is strong, witty and fast paced (especially in its first act) which should have come off in its favor, but due to multiple characters and their sub-plots that it has to cover in such short runtime (around 100 minutes), there is very little space for the audience to breathe in. Wes Anderson's world is definitely different than its usual features and the irony in here is that, ""this"" is a simpler and asymmetrical one . A decent job on giving the voice by the star cast to these eerie characters and so was the choice on casting them. Isle Of Dogs is an intriguing feature to encounter where the execution is genuinely effective and lures you in within few minutes making the audience work for it and sweeps away its runtime like a charm but the only thing that itches you throughout the course is the writing which unfortunately isn't as convoluted as the makers think.",Isle of Dogs

212,aileencorcoran,This movie is a very good boy.,10,28 May 2018,"Stop motion animation is a technique that is not only alive and kicking, but provides many acclaimed features. Despite being seen by many as archaic, the winsome charms of studios such as Aardman and Laika have not only kept the medium alive, but also continue to push past adversity to deliver a unique and enchanting experience. Wes Anderson added to the roster of stop motion films with his Oscar nominated ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" in 2009. It came out in the first of what would be two years of amazing animated features, and lost its nominations to Pixar's first Best Picture nominee, ""Up."" While most critics looked favourably on ""Fox,"" what with it gaining a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, it flopped at the box office, earning a measly $46.5M on a budget of $40M. That, and despite its praise, ""Fox"" fell into a more cult classic pile of animated films, like most of its stop motion comrades, and indie films such as ""The Secret of Kells,"" which was released the same year. I, for one, was one of the few that preferred Anderson's take on Roald Dahl's book more than ""Up"" (which I love, but not nearly as much). Even though it strayed from the source material, it still kept with the quirky storytelling and wistful nature of the book, and was funny, relatable and gorgeously animated. Needless to say, when Anderson announced that he was working on another animated film, about my favourite animal, I was excited. 
""Isle of Dogs"" may not be as colourful as ""Fox,"" but it's still jovial despite its sombre story and messages. It takes place in the distant future, in Megasaki City, Uni Prefecture in Japan. The corrupt Mayor Kobyashi has all the city's dogs exiled to Trash Island due to outbreaks of Snout Fever and Dog Flu, which has started to spread to humans. The first dog to be sent away is Spots, the body-guard dog of Mayor Kobayashi's distant nephew and ward, Atari. Six months later, Atari flies a dinky little plane to Trash Island, where he enlists the help of a group of former pets, and one stray, to help him find his best friend.
I loved this movie. I loved the characters, the animation and the overall look and feel of the film. I like the way the story was told. It isn't perfect, but I had a huge smile on my face at the climax, and I didn't want the film to end. There's something inherently special about this film. There is so much passion and effort put into every minute detail, that too many may go unnoticed. When Jeff Goldblum makes his characteristic ""uh"" (""uh, you heard the rumour, right; about her and Felix?""), they took the time to animate the very thing that the actor is known for. The sneezes are composed of cotton wool and sugar. Each bit of hair (Alpaca, by the way) was attached to the puppets one by one. The fur moves so realistically that it's both mesmerizing and disconcerting in the most glorious way possible. Each shot, each movement, each camera angle ads so much verve and pop to what is basically a film set in a dump. The anatomy of the dogs, the way they move, is spot on (there is only one scene that made me go ""uhm?"" but it was an aerial shot of Chief running, and one or two little quirks only ads to a film that breathes individuality). This film is gorgeous. I'm partial to the stop motion films where you can be both immersed in the world, and sense the work the very touch of human hands helped create. 
The story, at a glance, is rather predictable. However, much like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Coco"" the filmmakers manage to elevate the story so that the familiar story beats feel energized and new. While it is an A to Z search party plot, the film sports an interesting commentary on the corruption of society by higher power, the fear of the Other and the use of innocence to slap authority in the face. Some people will see this as a nod to immigration, others to snobbish politicians, and some will see it as a fun romp with five dogs and a boy. Fun, you say? The plot sounds grim; it's about dogs fighting to stay alive. It is grim, and harkens back to a similar film from 1982, ""The Plague Dogs."" In Rosen's animated feature, based on Richard Adams' book, two dogs must fend for themselves after escaping a vivisection lab, while avoiding capture from authorities who think they have the plague. The difference here is that the equally fantastic 80s film holds little humour, save from the Geordie fox. Anderson's film is peppered with tongue in cheek dialogue (""I'm fetching it because I feel sorry for you,"" ""I wish somebody spoke his language""), an ironic sense of cheerfulness and, of course, dog jokes (""you son of a bitch!"") From the dogs talking about their favourite food, to Oracle thinking she's psychic (""she just understands television""), to the dark humour, there's so much joy and verve in what can be considered so bleak. This is a film where the characters talk about suicidal ideation, where one pro dog person is murdered, and where many dogs cry salty tears over missing their owners, or having to eat their friends, and yet it feels so jovial and bright. This is all thanks to the witty dialogue and fantastic acting. The film knows it's serious, but can have fun with itself. It's refreshing, and breathtakingly authentic.
Some have taken issue with the Japanese elements of the feature, such as the use of mushroom clouds, wasabi as a weapon and implementing Haiku as a narrative device. While I can see how this will bother some people, as a random European person who just wanted to see a good film, I wasn't bothered by the nudges towards Japanese culture. In fact, it felt more like a tribute to Japan than anything else. The Japanese characters speak in their native tongue, with no subtitles save for a few occasions, and are voiced by Japanese actors and actresses. One of the writers, who also voices the mayor, is Japanese. It feels more like a friendly nudge-nudge than slander, as if Anderson is toasting to an old friend. 
To touch again on the use of Japanese language, some have also criticised how it was often left untranslated (save for scenes with an interpreter), saying that it removed part of the human's character, and left them unrelatable to the audience. That and it silenced Japanese people. I fervently disagree, but I do see the point some are making. Much like YMS, I would like to experience the entirety of a film I adored, and wouldn't mind if there was an option to watch the film with the Japanese language subtitled on the Blu-Ray. However, I feel that this may remove some of the artistic value and over all vibe of the film. I liked not completely understanding the humans; the focus was on one human and a group of dogs. Said human is a twelve year old boy, and children need not speak much to be understood. Somehow, the intuitive knowledge of the dogs and the boy's understanding of them was enough for me. 
This leads unto the characters. I adored them. The dogs are all so likable and scruffy, each with their own personalities that is their own, but still infused with the actors that voiced them. Each quirk was endearing, even Duke's running gag, which I taught I'd tire from, but ended up laughing at when he did it yet another time (""uh, did you hear the rumour?"") Each dog is just lovely. Atari, the boy, is likable and tenacious. However, the main character here is Chief, the ragamuffin Tramp of the pack who has never had an owner, and fervently distrusts humans, stating that ""he bites."" From the scene where we see all the dogs sitting before Atari, but Chief lying down, we know that the two will form a bond. Predictable? Yes, but the unfolding of events and how they are handled makes the bond seem very amiable. The only issue I had in regards the characters is with Tracy and Spots. I can't go into Spots, due to spoiler reasons, but let's just say that I felt that he really was a ""son of a bitch."" Tracy just seemed gratuitous to me; it seemed as if Anderson felt the need to have a saviour, when we already had ones in Atari and the dogs. I didn't hate her character or plot line, but I did feel that if she were removed, it would make no difference. The dogs and Atari were more than enough to carry the plot forward.
Despite my minor gripes, I found ""Isle of Dogs"" to be absolutely fantastic. I said when it was over; ""I think this is one of my new favourite films."" There's an odd, quintessential charm that makes it infectiously likable. This film is a very good boy.",Isle of Dogs

Anderson fans will recognize his cinema techniques (as in ""Moonlight Serenade"").
The score is brilliant: including Japanese taiko drums throughout - hypnotic (with one exception - a bit from Prokofiev's ""Lt Kije Suite"".

215,hakrames,Wes Anderson's masterpiece,10,15 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs stars Bryan Cranston, Yoko Ono, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, and many other amazing cast members in this Japanese-English stop motion masterpiece. Following in the future where dogs are banned for having a disease and a little boy sneaks out to find his lost dog that is on Trash Island which is renamed to Isle of Dogs. Wes Anderson wrote and directed this amazing film about trust, leadership, corruptness, love, and friendship flawlessly with it's various morals and fantastically smart dialogue woven into this breathtaking film. First the stop motion in this film is some of the best stop motion I've ever seen in my life, I thought Tim Burton's stop motion effects were good but this takes the cake as the best stop motion to ever exist in a film. With it's brilliant direction as well and Anderson putting his signature spin on it his direct center focus and simplistic but super effective filming style makes the film easy to watch and easy to understand. And with the various use of english and Japanese dialogue throughout the film it makes it a load of fun to watch with McDormand and Gerwig doing the majority of narration in it. This has been some of the tightest written dialogue in a single film of animation than any other film ever. That does include Pixar and Disney sadly. The voice acting is some of the best voice acting as well. Cranston takes the stage as Chief with his harden shell over his character and his beautiful arc as well alongside with the majority of his fellow Alpha Dog group that he has formed. The Japanese voice acting as well is brilliant too and along side with beautiful animations again made me forget at a few points that I was watching a stop motion film and that I was watching a live action one. I waited a day to write this review because I wanted to think on if there are any errors in this film or any negative aspects to it and I can't think of a single thing to this masterpiece of a film.

But the story transcends into a story about mans cruelty to animals, and the journey that in the beginning was fun, turned into something dark. I wish I had known that the story was going to make that dramatic turn because I may not have taken him to see the movie as the scenes showing the dogs that had been treated badly effected him in such a way that it upset him. Yet part of me is grateful for this as the movie also shows the love and compassion that man has, and my son was able to acknowledge that in the end good overcame evil.If taking children to see this under the age of 10, I would recommend caution.The storytelling is very well done and different, most of the spoken word is in Japanese but the way the translations are done are very clever.

It comes with all the quirks and distinctive style we've come to expect from him, and it works on an amazing level. The most amazing thing about this film are the visuals. Everything is meticulously crafted and done in such a way that you can't look away from the screen. The movements of all the characters along with the settings look spectacular, and the stop-motion style animation only makes it more pleasing to watch. All the visuals cleatly had an immense amount of work poured into them, and it definitely paid off. The dialogue is just as witty and entertaining as any other Wes Anderson movie, and most of the characters are perfectly-cast. Although the story is simplisitc, it doesn't really negatively affect the movie because everything else is done in such a fantastic manner. The cinemotography is just as aesthetically pleasing as any other Wes Anderson movie, with plenty of symmetrical shots. The score by Alexandre Desplat is also incredible, as it fits the tone and feeling of the movie very well. On occasion, some Japansese characters speak Japanese without subtitles, although simply a personal preferance, that would be my only criticism of the film. Overall, this film is incredibly enjoyable and well-made, and it is a must-watch for everyone. If you love filmmaking as an artform, this is the movie for you. Go and watch it.",Isle of Dogs

There was no dumb Disney joke, they were all quite intelligent and you aren't explained everything like you're a toddler.

230,theowlofthegame,Isle of Wes,7,10 December 2018,"I saw Isle of Dogs yesterday.
I was blown away by the animation from the start, the film is stunning. Each frame is truly a masterpiece. Don't know how they pulled it off, but it is a visual feast. I would give animation 11 out of 10. Great job!Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the story. It is a pretty straight forward, at times childish, overall quirky story. I'm sure Wes Anderson fans will love it, but I wouldn't consider myself a big fan. My problem with the story is that I have troubles to believe the premise, i.c. dogs that are transported to a garbage island because some Japanese mayor doesn't like dogs. I might even use the word lame here. The story has a good pace, but not enough drama or compelling characters. I stopped the movie twice, and thought of giving up, but the quality of the animation kept me going. This is art.The music is an essential part of the movie. Rhythmical, a lot of drums and sax...

The film asked the question ""What happened to man's best friend?"" The heartfelt message rings 100% true and nothing compares to the loyalty & love that dogs give us. The stop motion animation was top notch and beautiful to watch! Excellent characters, setting, & story!! All ""cultural appropriation"" false accusations aside, all-in-all Isle of Dogs is a highly relevant/ symbolic film.

234,wakka_chakka,maybe it was just for the critics ..,5,17 May 2018,"Don't jump on me guys, hear me out please.
As a layman I think the Isle of Dogs was just another animation, to be more precise let me say this (to tell that I know) - ""stop animation"" movie .. a bit dull on that part too. Dull as in the movie, animation was good.
Even the kid on the seat next to me predicted the things with 100% accuracy right in the beginning and then he slept. I am not saying that bring me unpredictable everytime, no .. predictable is just fine but I think the movie gave us something which we have seen in one form or the other. A lot of times. With half the pace of those movies.I may not be that familiar with Wes Anderson's work and all but that doesn't stop anyone to enjoy a good movie. I think this is how we pick up things and build references. And I didn't enjoy it this time. Sorry critics.
I think the characters were flat and somehow it was more about the style of animation rather than story telling. 
And what was that all about making it a long 5 hours affair, oh wait was it just 2.5 .. he he .. time just didn't pass :D
Yet there were people who gave a standing ovation and I know they have to agree to critics and all to be in the same league .. but deep down they were sleeping like half of my theatre was ..",Isle of Dogs

You have to admit that he has some classics and has been known for killing a lot of dogs in his film - which I've always been on board with. I thought Wes was in our camp but then when I heard the title of his next film I was surprised. All of the portrayals of his cats in this film are depicted as villains and stereotypes while the dogs all have fully fledged characters. I could barely sit through this film and was between the theatre and the litterbox the whole time. Too long, boring, and offensively bad. At it's base I think that it's anti-cat and culturally insensitive.",Isle of Dogs
236,AustinSober,Best of Man's Best Friend,10,19 May 2018,"""Isle of Dogs"" provides one of the most unique animated film experiences in recent memory, combining technical awe, subtle humor, and heartstring-pulling to create an immediate classic that will likely never age.The story is set in future Japan where dogs have unfortunately come upon a disease that could threaten the human population. Seemingly to prevent this outcome, the mayor of Megasaki City bans all dogs to a trash dump island just off the coast to live out the remainder of their days. The son of the mayor takes it upon himself to go to the island to locate his lost dog (the first to be removed) and is helped by a small dog pack led by a stray street dog, who refuses to show any pity towards humans.The most notable thing right off the bat about ""Isle of Dogs"" is its excellent stop-motion animation. This is such a unique form of animation and, despite its rough qualities, it always provides a charm and basically never really ages. The visuals of ""Isle of Dog's will continue to appeal to viewers as long there is a copy of it in existence. There was a trailer before this film for Illumination's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" which featured the typical modern 3D animation complete with an alarm going off playing ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams. Gee, I wonder what's going to be dated in less than a year? With competition like that, it's easy to see why ""Isle of Dogs"" steals the show in American animation.Wes Anderson is easily one of the most unique directors out there. At first glance, all his stuff seems like a comedy, but this film is only that in a subtle manner. Jokes are blunt, dry, and fast. Honestly, there are very few ""jokes"", most are just based around the execution of the film. This is assisted by a perfect ensemble voice cast including Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Scarlett Johansson. Expect more chuckles rather than knee-slapping laughter. The film holds a great dramatic core around the concept of man's best friend. If you don't like dogs, this film may change that.The use of Japan as a location gives the film a fresh cultural look both in regards to visual and sound design. The soundtrack is one of the most memorable I have heard in some time. Take note Hollywood: the world could use more taiko drumming (On second thought, you might screw it up so don't bother). Anderson's use of symmetry is so appealing to the eyes that you question why more filmmakers don't try to imitate this particular style. You can clearly see thought and effort was put into every shot. Or rather every frame, considering this is stop motion.The only complaint I could find would that the 3rd act is arguably story-heavy or, in other words, there was a lot being dumped on the audience at once. I won't go into what happens, but the simple story of dogs helping a boy find his favorite pup does develop into something bigger. Most of this is caused by flashbacks, which the film does actually make enjoyable via stylistic choices. (The movie literally indications when it is a flashback with a text card and they tell you when it is over with the same effect). However, unlike many other films, I can forgive this little issue because the effort and overall style of the film just overshadow it.Finally, I should indicate that while this is an animated film, that doesn't mean it is for little kids. There is nothing too graphic (there is a bloody ear) or profane (B-word used hilariously) in the film, but the storytelling isn't really designed for little kids. The film is rated PG-13 after all. When I saw the film, a family containing about 6 or so little kids entered the theater and they were clearly not interested in what was going on and thus started running around all over the place making noise. The family left halfway in and I am sure they likely wasted 50 plus dollars (probably closer to $100 if they bought snacks). This is not a film to distract and/or amuse children.For those old enough to appreciate it though, you will enjoy one of the most unique films you will likely see in theaters this year. In many ways, films like this are best because they really make you think ""how did they do that""?",Isle of Dogs
237,Leray97,Typic Wes Anderson fun,7,29 June 2018,"It's pretty hard to dislike Wes Anderson's style or at least accredit him for practically branding it, especially when it's fused with a visual storytelling method such as stop motion. I don't think Anderson was breaking any boundaries with Isle of Dogs; it was somewhat safe and delivered on what many fans would expect from his style of filmmaking, which makes for a great time. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun. The snappy dialogue, humorous quips, likable characters, and visuals all help make Isle of Dogs more enjoyable with its simple premise.I had some reservations though, with all the talk about the political subtext and culture stuff. There is really nothing to gain by complaining about whitewashing in Hollywood, to reduce this film to pure whitewashing in its attempt to use the Japanese setting as an interesting backdrop would be a disservice to it in itself. I'm glad to say that I also wasn't bothered by the politics of the story. There is definitely time given to develop that aspect of the overall narrative but I never felt that showing the events outside of the trash island detracted from the central story. Although if this film turned out to be just about a boy and his dog, I probably would have liked it more.The voice cast is pretty crazy. There are a lot of big names, some recognizable from Wes Anderson's older films, but my favorite performance was Bryan Cranston's Chief. He has a raspiness and deep tone to his voice that really helps him command screen presence when he needs to. Cranston is also good at comedy; his timing and attitude at times made Chief my favorite character by the end.Isle of Dogs is not your typical Disney kids movie. I hate that I had to sit in an auditorium with some kids and their negligent parents. Wes Anderson's style is not the most mind blowing thing ever seen on the big screen but in the end it really is an art form that has touched a lot of people in a lot of ways. Consuming Isle of Dogs and all of his other recent films shouldn't revolve around just observing the pretty visuals but also how they help tell the story and define its characters.One of my favorite parts about this movie is the sushi making scene. There's something about the way the stop motion was done for that part that made it so satisfying to watch.",Isle of Dogs
238,12_Monkeys,Isle of Dogs vs Hollywood Blockbusters,10,8 May 2018,"It is no surprise that a Wes Anderson film is good anymore, because let's face it, the guy knows what he's doing.
What I loved most about ""Isle of Dogs"" though, was the script. It is far more insightful than anything that's out there right now, because of the level of CARE that Anderson puts into the story, the characters and their development, and the MESSAGE he wants his audience to take home with them.
Over the last few years there's been a lack of good writing in the movie industry (specially in Hollywood). This has not been true for TV, though. Although most serious screenwriters have moved onto television, this is not because they earn more money, or they can't get jobs in films, it is simply because TV producers are caring more about the scripts than movie studios.
Remember when the story mattered? When it wasn't about visual effects or how many screens a distributor could get for your film? Well, for a moment yesterday, ""Isle of Dogs"" transported me to that era. The era of ""Shine"" or ""Jerry Maguire""... when movies that made money at the box office actually struggled to get a lot of screens, but climbed their way to the top for one simple reason: GOOD STORYTELLING.
Nowadays, good vfx or good advertising have overcome good storytelling. Think about it. Do you really believe that ""Infinity War"" would have been more successful than, say, ""Schindler's List"" back when good storytelling was what made the difference? The more admirable production value ""Infinity War"" has is the gigantic distribution it was given. When you go to the theaters and all you can watch is the new sequel to the Avengers... you'll end up watching that because you have NO MORE CHOICES. But back then, when you actually had options, when your film was screening at the same time than ""The Fugitive"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", it was a BIG DEAL to be number one at the box office, because it meant that your film was most likely, the best film screening at the time, and not the one with more money spent in advertising and distribution. All these new ""infinite sequels"" are doing is spoiling the audience's taste and right to cinematic cultural diversity.
I'm not saying there shouldn't be any Avengers films. I'm simply saying there should always be more options for our audiences to watch, because, as you all know, once a film is cut out of the theaters, it most likely will never be screened there again. And when exhibitors permit that one film is shown in the vast majority of theaters, that means that a whole lot of good movies are going to be cut out, and people are going to lose a chance to watch them in the big screen.
Imagine if you never got a chance to watch ""Fargo"" in the movie theaters because ""Titanic"" was the only film showing. Imagine not being able to watch ""As good as it gets"" because the distributor for ""Men in Black"" kicked everything else out of the theaters. Thank God that didn't happen back then. Because they are all great films, and should be given a chance to be enjoyed by the audience. But nowadays, it seems that it's all about marketing and making money, and it is not about content anymore. It is not about the stories.
If you are a true believer in cinema, and in the power that a good film has to change, not only perspectives, but PEOPLE'S LIVES, then you should definitely watch ""Isle of Dogs."" If all you care about are sequels and visual effects, and scripts without purpose or message, then this film will probably seem boring to you, but you should give it a chance anyway, because everyone else gives a chance to the movies you like (we mostly don't have a choice anymore.)",Isle of Dogs

The dogs even have fleas moving around their body! The characters themselves consist of a ragtag pack of dogs and their leader ""Chief"" trying to get by on trash island, which is where the Japanese government dumped them due to a dog flu outbreak. The main human antagonist, Atari visits the island in search of his lost dog ""Spots"". Atari also happens to be the nephew of the current Japanese leader Megahashi, with spots being Ataris old support dog. As Atari sets off in search of his dog, his plane crash lands and is found by Chiefs pack. From thereforth, he befriends the group of dogs and they help him search for his pet. Chief is at first reluctant to help the boy due to being the only stray whom does not believe in human ownership, but the development of his and Ataris relationship is one of the most important and heartwarming moments of the story. Half of the film also focuses on mainland Japan as a group of protesters uncover a government conspiracy directly relating to dog flu, including the discovery of an antidote which has been hidden from public eye due to the leaders diastase for dogs. Overall, cannot fault this movie much and have watched it twice already. I reccomend watching it at least once over for the visuals alone. I expecially enjoy the Japanese text and dialogue as I studied the language at university.One thing I do question is why they didn't choose Japanese breeds for the dog characters, although I suppose they would be limited and some audiences would not recognise them. There are also some parts which are not translated, but I think this is more artistic choice and to express how personal some conversations between Spots and Atari are supposed to be.",Isle of Dogs

Charming and well conceived.I'm not a Wes Anderson devotee or distractor - I simply enjoy well crafted movies. This is certainly a hit for my particular biases. I would hope that humans would behave as well as these dogs.Some of the unexpected harder themes - I won't mention, might be spoilers - were unexpected, but handled very well. Handled so matter-of-factly that they added to the movie, rather than being what the movie was about.If you like to be entertained while asked to think, go see this movie.",Isle of Dogs
247,dwgmartin-33760,Wes Anderson Charming as Ever,9,27 April 2018,"Isle of Dogs: from the stylised and distinct mind of Wes Anderson comes his most pleasantly charming movie yet, in a wonderfully worked stop motion animated style. In the near future a dog flu is on the verge of the human transition so a city in Japan decree that all dogs are to be quarantined and exiled to 'Trash Island', and a small boy travels to the island to find his dog.... There's also a conspiracy theory by a cat loving government whose hatred for dogs goes back generations, oh and robot attack dogs (it's certainly a different take on the relationship between master and pet). It's obvious that Isle of Dogs is a labour of love for Anderson bringing in his enthusiasm for all things- not least dogs. His sets are of course lathered with all manner of details that's it's entirely possible to lose yourself in them for hours and you'd still miss some small details. Being set in Japan means all the human characters are speaking Japanese (without subtitles) but all the dogs speak in English. That may sound a tad confusing and distracting but it works surprisingly well for the movie, because you never really need to know what the humans are saying; all their motives and emotions is conveyed through the way the are animated. And the focus isn't so much to connection between humans and dogs, but more dogs and humans. It's works really well. Isle of Dogs is also extremely fast paced which again works in the movies favour, but it stops just enough to ponder on our characters and their emotional connection to their masters. The dog cast is also stellar, with the talents of Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Jeff Goldblum (who I hope plays a stop motion talking dog in all of his movies from now, including Jurassic World- I would pay a stupid amount to see that). Isle of Dogs is Wes Anderson's second trip into stop motion animation, a style which I do hope he continues with, as it works well within his distinctive style of offbeat humour. But for some reason I found myself admiring Isle of Dogs rather than outright loving it. And I don't know why. 
Anywoo, nonetheless I give Isle of Dogs an A-",Isle of Dogs

This film will give you a greater appreciation for man's best friend and follows the story for a young boy to find his lost dog in Japan which has banned all dogs and relegated his beloved pet to thrash Island where dogs are separated from humans and relegated to thrash.

252,yeehung5,Best Stop motion Film?,8,8 August 2018,"Amazing stop motion, amazing soundtrack and amazing storyline that depicts the Japanese culture. So many dogs but no shiba inu? Maybe some Asian should watch this film and learn to love dogs, not eat them.",Isle of Dogs
253,jamheigei,Its depth is fascinating,9,19 May 2018,"Just to get it out of the way right from the start: Of course, the visuals are stunning. Only Wes Anderson could make a stop-motion animation where the dogs' hair blows in the wind. It makes you forget about how it was made from the first minute on. Cinematography is right up there quality-wise, another Anderson-trademark. Perfectly pulled off, as always.
Now on to what really fascinated me about this movie: That it is so deeply funny and serious at the same time, and that on unfathomably many levels.
Isle of Dogs is fast, like any Anderson movie. It reminds me of slapstick, where you really have to keep up with the pace of narration in order to not miss anything. At the same time, while being so fast-paced, Anderson manages to bring so much depth to the story and characters, thus generating an unparalleled level of empathy inside the viewer. You end up leaving the theater somewhat confused. Confused about how you could care so much about a story that has been told (in part) in a seemingly unemotional way. Just scene after scene, dialogue after dialogue, immediate changes in scenery and so on; Towards the end there might be a little too much of everything, but that's critique on a very high level. 
While enjoying the depth and technical expertise put on display, you're also reminded to laugh at many points. A subtle, yet very pointed and incredibly dry humor adds another level entertainment to Isle of Dogs. The humor and occasional light-heartedness in an otherwise more seriously-themed movie finish of Wes Anderson's latest work and make it a true masterpiece that will live on for its ability to induce thought, open eyes and really just entertain all at the same time; Which is a thing I cannot point out often enough: It's such a serious movie done in such an unorthodox way. Yet, while being exquisitely unusual, not for one minute does it fail to do what every movie should do which is simply entertain an audience. It now stands alongside some of the finest works of art in filmmaking history, that is of course Anderson's very own catalogue.
I can't wait to see what he comes up with next, so far Isle of Dogs ranks #2 behind Grand Budapest Hotel as my favourite Wes Anderson flick.",Isle of Dogs

255,matigiorgi,Whatever happened to man's best friend?,9,29 February 2020,"I love dogs and I love Japanese culture... and this movie has both!The movie is a visual marvel, is a real spectacle to the eyes. The dogs are lovely, specially their eyes which are always full of emotion. A few scenes should be in a museum, as they are true pieces of art; for example the sushi cooking and the operation of Atari and the mayor Kobayashi. These scenes also represent the discipline and search of perfection in which most Japanese do every task.The story is easy to comprehend. I didn't like that the original pack of dogs (Rex, Boss, Duke, King and Chief) looses their role as the film moves forward, with the exception of Chief, but that is for Spots to shine. The character of Atari was really ambiguous, sometimes I felt that he was evil as his uncle... maybe all dogs sometimes have that fear for their masters.I personally like the representation of the Japanese culture, but I believe it was exaggerated sometimes. Also, there were too many scenes in Japanese without translation and that made the movie a bit dense.Finall, I loved the reaction of the pack of dogs to the arrival of Atari, as it represents that a dog will never betray their masters, regardless what is done to them. They loyalty is unbreakable.",Isle of Dogs
256,mohamedhazem1,...,7,30 March 2019,"What is unique about Wes Anderson is that he can fool you with his style, you would not pay much attention to the story if it is good or not because of his unusual and cheerful style (the colours, frames symmetry and how the actors perform differently in his movies).
In Isle of Dogs the using of the above mentioned elements was perfect, the animations are absolutely amazing and you can see how much talent and effort were put there, and voiceovers were top quality with that A-list cast, but the story itself is not that strong or captivating, yet you don't feel annoyed by that fact and i thought there are many other good things going on here so i can forget about that.
There were many plots but the director kept them intact and saved the audience from getting lost, but towards the end when he tried to bring them all together, it kind of got boring and too long, with the ending which was a little bit lame and predictable.
It's a fun movie to watch especially if you are into Wes Anderson world, but not the kind i would watch twice.",Isle of Dogs
257,theweffy,Another success by Wes Anderson,9,30 April 2019,"Good through and through. I have to say, I wasn't sure what to expect with this one.

Obviously the movie is quirky and silly yet serious at the same time.Lots of big names doing the voices, and everyone did a great job. I would watch again, and probably will.",Isle of Dogs
258,sassonlonner,"""I Love Dogs""",7,25 April 2018,"Wes Anderson truly is his own genre of film. If you like his genre, you end up appreciating all of his movies. Isle of Dogs fits into that category I'm referring to. If you like Wes Anderson's genre, you certainly will enjoy Isle of Dogs. For someone like myself, who never truly understood the Wes Anderson hype, it was an enjoyable movie. It's corny jokes made me laugh, and the way dogs acted like humans (but still acted like dogs) kept a grin on my face. The way I would describe how dogs acted in this film resembles how Brian from Family Guy does, doing things only humans do, but at the same time would chase a squirrel. Another technique used in the film which I was able to appreciate, was how instead of everyone speaking English the whole time, Wes Anderson chose to have the film take place in a non-English speaking country (Japan), and lack subtitles, in order for us to connect more with the dogs (who spoke English) than the humans. The only flaw this resulted in was that it prevented us from seeing much depth in the big human characters. I however do appreciate that this tactic shows us how much you can get out of a foreign language speaker just from their tone of voice.
 
 Another complaint I have is that this movie really is only for people who love dogs. I'm even hearing people calling the movie ""I Love Dogs"" (say Isle of Dogs out loud if you don't get it), which really does say something about the movie's fanbase. For one, I hate cats, and I mean ""I hate them!"" (<--Know what I'm quoting?) If the movie were Isle of Cats I would have left the theater afterwards complaining about how awful it was (I know that's kind of biased, but this movie was quite literally all about dogs, so if you dislike dogs you probably will be bored). In conclusion, if you are a Wes Anderson fan, totally see this movie, you'll eat it up (especially if you love dogs). If you don't love Wes Anderson, you definitely can enjoy it, but you won't be referring back to it in the future.",Isle of Dogs

Yes, the animation is interesting (but gets old quickly), there's some dry humor (which gets extremely dry as it wears off quickly) and there's some glorification of Japan and its culture (some interesting Japanese drums that also get old quickly). The voice acting is definetely not bad and has its moments. Other than that however, the movie drags on, the characters are flat, the storyline borders on the ridiculous and the movies' ""originality"" in dialogue manifests itself as semi-intellectual after a short time.

Not only is this story bad to begin with and fatally crippled by the excesses of style, every line is delivered in that particular customary journalistic affection this director so favors, a monotonic barrage of tautological verbiage that is perhaps conflated in his mind with cleverness, but is ultimately no more than an inadequate unjustified formalism that just turns characters into lifeless drones.

This is souly a recommendation for both stop motion fans, but for both fans of Wes Anderson and the Fantastic Mr. Fox film. I gave this Anderson Stop Motion film a 10/10 rating for being Was's 2nd greatest stop motion film ever made!",Isle of Dogs
273,archiesmith,I Love Dogs,10,13 April 2018,"Wes Anderson is no stranger to stop-motion animation, as exhibited by the marvellously exquisite 'Fantastic Mr Fox'. However, whereas that film was Anderson's first venture into animation, which can be considered experimentation in the medium, 'Isle of Dogs' is undoubtedly a perfection of the medium. This film is a living, breathing piece of art in its highest form, in its highest quality. It is obvious that every single frame has been painstakingly crafted to gorgeousness, as there is always something just as interesting happening in the background as there is in the foreground, whether it be split-screen photography, the visual translations of the Japanese dialogue, the ingenious use of hand-drawn animation for monitors and TV screens, or even the simple mannerisms of the dogs themselves which make them feel so lifelike. This creates two intrinsically unique settings; the desolate wasteland of Trash Island, and the dystopian metropolis of Megasaki City, both as enthralling to watch as each other. As per usual in an Anderson film, the main plot focuses on the developing relationship between a small group of individuals, such as father and son or concierge and lobby boy. In this case, it is the unique bond shared between a master and their dog, encompassed by Atari Kobayashi and Chief, who is given an emotive vocal performance by Bryan Cranston that perfectly contrasts with the monotone impassiveness of the rest of dogs celebrity voices. Chief's character arc from a vicious stray to a loyal loving accomplice to Atari is what forms the heartwarming, bittersweet emotional centre to the film's cold, calculative execution. Unlike an Anderson film though is the tone, as while it is unquestionably still quirky, it trades his typical whimsy for a constant sense of danger and paranoia created by the journey the dogs are on, which allows for various instances of deliciously dark deadpan humour. Thus, 'Isle of Dogs' appropriately seems like one of Anderson's darker films. There are particular issues with pacing and story structure, specifically in the first act, however, I found this to be miniscule when compared to the continuous grand sense of awe that was continuously delivered by the visual splendour on-screen. Definitely the most delightfully enjoyable experiences at the cinema this year.",Isle of Dogs

275,shetty-05258,Visually stunning,8,6 July 2018,"Isle of Dogs is yet another excellent stop motion film by visionary director Wes Anderson. All the dogs from Megasaki City have been exiled to a vast garbage dump called Trash Island and the movie follows a 12 year old boy trying to find his lost dog with the help of a pack of exiled dogs.Wes Anderson brings his distinct visual style and hilarious characters all with some amazing stop motion animation. The film balances some mature themes with rib-tickling deadpan comedy and gorgeous visuals.The films voice cast is filled with plenty of big names from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and so many more. Bryan Cranston is stunning as always as Chief and it was touching to see his relationship with Atari played by Koyu Rankin grow into one of mutual respect and camaraderie.
The film has many deeper themes like animal cruelty but the film balances these darker themes with the a light hearted tone which is something Wes Anderson has done well several times before with films like The Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox.It was a visual treat to watch this film and although the pacing slows down sometimes and I didn't love it as much as I loved Fantastic Mr. Fox it still is a wonderful film and I cannot praise the stop motion animation enough.

The claymation in this film is phenomenal, although the character designs might discomfort many younger children. The use of color gives me a post apocalyptic vibe that you really wouldn't expect in an animated film. Its rare for an original concept to have an all star cast, but this isn't a surprise since Wes Anderson usually casts A-listers like Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, Owen Wilson (who doesn't appear in the film), Bob Balaban, Tilda Swinton, and you get the point. So, the cast in this film did a pretty good job with the source material they had, and the score by Alexandre Desplat is perfect.I do have one con, and that is the unnecessary 'love interest', who is given nothing to do, and I wasn't impressed with Greta Gerwig's voice acting. I've heard she's a phenomenal director, and I hope to see Little Women sometime in the future, but her character just didn't work for me.Anyways, I did this review because I'm bored as hell and I have to keep myself isolated because you know why.

He is assisted by five Island dogs in his journey, that eventually shapes the narration of this movie.This movie is headlined by a stellar voice cast. Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Harvey Keitel and Frances McFormand to name a Few.Anderson takes a risky approach by not providing any subtitles when the characters are speaking in Japanese, but it pays off brilliantly as the themes and ideas are easily communicated to the audience, which consequently gives the movie a truly global appeal.The underlying themes of Dystopia, Authoritarianism, Tyranny, Segregation and Prejudice with a Quirky Wes Anderson Touch further establishes this as another Classic.Recommended for Lovers of Independent Animated Movies.",Isle of Dogs

294,twilightavocado,"Stunning visuals, anemic story",5,22 January 2021,"True to Wes Anderson's filmmaking, this movie is a visual feast. Shots are perfectly framed, rich with details--is that another sinister cat crest?--and take wonderful angles. For a film set in a garbage dump, this is a remarkable achievement.On the other hand, the plot is dull and predictable. The overall premise is absurd--a city ruled by a cat mafia--but the ending is clear by about 15 minutes in. For example, the 'dramatic' fight scenes to move the story along are lackluster--the film probably would have been better without these 'obligatory' action scenes. It felt cringe to cast a white girl to be a primary heroine for the Japanese people. There are some delightfully quirky moments that made me chuckle along the way, but also fewer than in some of Wes Anderson's best work.",Isle of Dogs

I was accompanied by brothers and friends some who weren't necessarily fans but ended up enjoying it a lot. One thung I liked was how the Japanese was selectively translated. Also the political and ecologicalsituations harked back to the reality of today. The dogs were heartwarming. The people were wierd. It was a quirky movie. Awesome.",Isle of Dogs
296,suenoverde,"Ugh, how do you mess up a story about dogs?",5,15 April 2018,"I adore Wes Anderson's films, yet I will admit Fantastic Mr Fox is perhaps my least favorite; something doesn't translate to animation for me. I was expecting to be transported or at least pleasantly entertained but a lot of the film irked me and thinking about it more afterward it bugged me even more. This is a beautifully animated movie and the visuals are pleasing as punch. However, the story seems to mean nothing and the characters are all flat.
 
Here are some of my random complaints:1. The concept of having one of the main characters only speak in Japanese with no translation felt distancing and we only see one short scene of him bonding with his dog he supposedly loves enough to risk everything for.2. Women are an afterthought in this movie. They exist only as a nearly silent assistant (the tragically underused Yoko Ono!), a sexualized trophy wife dog (Nutmeg played by ScarJo), a pregnant dog with no lines, an interpreter with only 1 line of her own dialogue. The only female character with any kind of agency is the white foreign exchange student who is A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH 12 YEAR OLD BOY SHE HAS NEVER MET!3. The story is pretty brutal and realist about death, suffering and euthanasia and animal experiments but it told so flatly and matter of fact that it had no impact for me. Maybe I'm thankful they don't use the music and characters to really pull at your heartstrings since for the first half of the movie I was already questioning why I wanted to sit through a movie with so many dogs being tortured. Pretty bleak stuff. 4. The dialogue and characters have the Wes Anderson autistic flat affect where everything is delivered with the least amount of emotion as possible but taken to the extreme. This made me not really care about the kids or the dog.5. Deux Ex Machina to save the day at the end. The trials and tribulations of the main characters almost had no bearing on the resolution.6. Cats are given a pretty short end of the stick here. They are somehow benignly evil and there was something interesting to be uncovered there but the film just had them as background. I thought it was trying to avoid the cat vs dog cliche...but it didn't. The evil clan are the cat people.7. The had some real potential for dramatic adventure scenes but I never felt worried about the characters despite their head injuries, broken teeth, chewed off ears, missing limbs, etc. I'm usually a sucker for animals in danger but these characters all seemed to have the same personality. 8. I love Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and almost all the rest of the cast but they weren't allowed to really show off their voice acting talents. All the voices blended into one as the dogs were so dead pan. 9. And it did feel pretty white washed to have the cast be primarily white actors with the Japanese actors being untranslated. I wonder if in Japan they will subtitle or dub the dogs.In regards to the supposed political statements the film makes, they seem weak. Now he had set this in a more realistic version of say the Dog Meat Festivals in modern day China or had this be a story more closely analogous to refugees that would have been pretty bold.I can understand people enjoying this film but for me I just didn't understand what it was trying to say and it felt gimmicky and not like a Wes Anderson film. I read somewhere he directed the film in absentia, just emailing his notes for the animators and was pretty hands off for this film (unlike his auteurism on his other films).",Isle of Dogs
297,sjgalaxy,I Hope a Oscar for the animation,8,1 July 2018,"Wes Anderson is one of the director in the industry who value style over substance. This film also a good example of that.
It's a story about humankind and their best friend that is dogs, when a unknown flu spread around the dogs, the human got scared, then they decided every dogs in japan to be exile to a deserted place, but a boy name atari does not agree to the idea of the separation so he went to search for his lost dog.
Now lets talk about the animation. it blows my mind to think about how passionate they are for this film. Every frame is filled with details. Pay attention to the every details every animation like dog's hair moving when wind blows and so many example like that.

299,ariwebbkatanos,Movie Review #4: Isle of Dogs by Wes Anderson,8,13 May 2018,"On Saturday I went to go see my first Wes Anderson film, and I really enjoyed it. Isle of Dogs is a lighthearted animated comedy film that doesn't require too much brain power and keeps you entertained the whole way through. While the comedy may have been well timed, at best it was a hit or miss. This was made up for with a great score and overall good design.The first thing I'd love to talk about is the music. This, I enjoyed most about Isle of Dogs. The Japanese-inspired score of deep drums opens and closes the film, while also complementing it throughout. It's expertly timed with both the comedy and general story of the movie so one can, at certain points, simply sit back and melt into the grove of the film.There wasn't much I didn't like about the design in Isle of Dogs, and a lot I did. My main complaint is there is an excessive use of crying in the film. While I have no problem with emotions or anything of the like being put anywhere, the animated effect they used for the tears was first fascinating but quickly irksome. Otherwise, the characters, sets and editing in the film all added up perfectly. Greta Gerwig as Tracy Walker was certainly my favorite character but all the dog characters certainly deserve great praise for their design and voice work.Thematically and comedically, the film has a mixed performance. The comedy was at times funny and at others simply fell flat. I did however appreciate the tone of the film. Never does this film ask to be taken seriously, nor does it ever ask the viewer to take its very seriously flawed logic into account. The film simply just is how it is. This, combined with a great soundtrack, good acting and set design made for great viewing. The story itself has decent themes but overall I found it to be necessarily hollow.Overall, I'd day the film is a perfect one for an easy night where you just want to sit back and enjoy. The film has depth, but to a large degree is simply consumable at a surface level. Go and check it out, 8/10.",Isle of Dogs
300,johnsmithsbasementreviews,Delightful if slightly hamfisted,9,18 August 2018,"Isle of Dogs is exactly what you would expect from Wes Anderson at this point: childhood whimsy and fun mixed with some darker themes and moments. The film is another one of his stop-motion movies, after the excellent Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009.The good news is that this film is just, if not more, visually striking. Wes' level of detail, in everything from the backgrounds the fur of the protagonists, is amazing. The dialogue, characters and story are top-noch as ever...even if they're a tad predictable by this point.The star-studded cast (including Bryan Cranston, Scarlett, Johansson, Ed Norton, Jeff Golblum, Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, etc.) does a fantastic job, as do the lesser-known actors The soundtrack is fantastic, nearly all of it consists of Taiko percussion. However, this also leads into a criticism that may be minor or major, depending on how woke you consider yourself to be.I'll get right to the point: the film is guilty of using Japanese stereotypes. Atari saves the day with the power of a haiku. Kobayashi changes his mind over the fact that ""he has no honor"". It's not exactly nuanced, nor is it justifiable. However it doesn't come across as malicious or even intentional either. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it is worth mentioning.Other than that, the only other 'real' criticism is the movie isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as Fantastic Mr. Fox. But that doesn't bother me. Besides, it's less funny because there are less jokes, not because the jokes aren't funny.On the whole, Isle of Dogs is a fantastic, if slightly insensitive, movie that anyone who loves great independent films should watch.",Isle of Dogs

304,jd-538-793868,A Family Friendly Tale of Friendship in the Style of Wes Anderson,10,20 March 2018,"A Family Friendly Tale of Friendship.For Wes Anderson's ninth film, the auteur director took what he learned while making ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and and expanded upon it to make his magnum opus. Mixing the mediums of Stop Motion, Puppetry, Miniatures, Still Image, Traditional Animation, and Tableau for this stunning homage to the Japanese 'Iki' Aesthetic. Taking place ""Twenty Years in the Future"" from whenever you're watching, in the fictional Megasaki City on the Japanese coast, ""Isle of Dogs"" on its face is the story of a boy, Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin) looking for his dog / bodyguard, Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber) after Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura), Atari's uncle and guardian, passes a law that banishes all canines to the offshore ""Trash Island"" after an epidemic of ""Snout Fever"" has infected nearly all the dogs in the city, though the Mayor may have a more nefarious plot... While not the simplistic ""Cats Evil, Dogs Good"" of some other family friendly film fare, the pooches portrayed feel betrayed by their mislead masters. After six months, Atari steals a small plane and crashes on Trash Island to seek out his four legged companion, and is recused from the wreck by our hero pack, Rex; the leader of the pack (Edward Norton), Boss; the former mascot of a Little League team (Bill Murray), King; the face of a popular dog food (Bob Balaban), Duke; a gossip (Jeff Goldblum), and Chief; a stray (Bryan Cranston). Atari and the Pack also must fight off henchmen who work for the Mayor, in their search for Spots. Meanwhile on the Mainland, we learn of the evil plot set out by the Mayor, to replace all the dogs with robots, made by his company, and he is also responsible for spreading the puppy plague, and it is up to a small group of science minded students to defend the honor of man's best friend. While there is an All Star voice cast, including Ladybird scribe and director, Greta Gerwig as American Foreign Exchange Student, Tracy Walker, and Oscar Winner, Frances McDormand as an international wire service interpreter, the rest of the cast are Japanese, speaking in Japanese with no subtitles, their characters intentions and body language are enough to convey what they are saying despite a language barrier. The only subtitles are on Japanese text, and the film cleverly states at the beginning, all Barking is translated to English, as a way to respond to cultural appropriation critiques. ""Isle of Dogs"" is not a pastiche of an American Filmmaker wanting to make a movie set in Japan with American actors. This is as close to perfect as hybrid storytelling can get. A very Japanese film, told in Wes Anderson's personal way of whimsy. The Dogs love their masters and don't understand why they've been sent here, but when a ""master"" comes to Trash Island, they do what Good Dogs do, and protect their human. The way the corruption gets handled is also very Japanese as well, it is firstly in the name of business, and what is best for their bottom dollar, and the bad guys go about their plans legally, until the legality becomes their downfall, and rather than fight and lie, the bad guys accept their fate, as they acted dishonorably. Composer, Alexandre Desplat, brought his A-Game to Isle of Dogs as much as he did for Shape of Water and Anderson's last live action feature, The Grand Budapest Hotel (both films which Desplat won Oscars for), his haunting melodies will have you whistling Atari's little 3 note ditty on your way to your car after. Cinematographer Tristan Oliver, of Wallace and Grommet pedigree and Anderson's lenser for Fantastic Mr Fox outdoes himself, with how visually interesting with every frame of Isle of Dogs, partially due to Production Designers Paul Harrod and Adam Stockhausen, who won an Oscar for Grand Budapest Hotel as well. Harrod, an expert on the Japanese Aesthetic and Stockhausen, an expert at Wes Anderson's Aesthetic flawlessly fused the two styles. 10/10",Isle of Dogs
305,bryancheong96,"A Masterful Work of Art and An Endearing Story, Presented With Some Underlying Social Commentary",8,9 April 2020,"Isle of dogs is a world-building visual masterpiece suitable for all ages, with the most painstakingly detailed characters and set designs I've ever seen in a stop motion picture. The plot of this film has a pretty large scope for a stop motion film, covering an array of characters and subplots, with lots of heart and character development naturally integrated into it. The director seems to have struck a good balance between story and art. The characterisation of the dogs fit perfectly with the actual voice actors, with some of the dialogue feeling like they were tailor-made for Jeff Goldblum's or Bill Murray's character. The musical score adds an extra layer of lightheartedness to the overall feel of an already humorous and entertaining film. However, I do believe that there are deeper underlying themes surrounding political propaganda and how they can incite xenophobic fear and hatred. Is it any coincidence that this film was in development during the rise of Trump's presidency? In any case, Isle of Dogs can be viewed multiple times for its immaculately detailed aesthetics (as it is so detailed you will never see everything upon the first viewing) or you can simply enjoy it for a heartwarming tale of the endearing relationship between a boy and his dog. Isle of Dogs gets an 8.5/10.",Isle of Dogs
306,sollygibbs,Classic Anderson flare.,7,26 April 2018,"'Isle of Dogs' is, with no surprise, directed brilliantly by Anderson, with every shot in the film feeling meticulously crafted. His attention to the characters positioning is more than prevalent here as how each interaction feels highly stylised. The visuals and stop motion animation is truly incredible here with every dog feeling rough, rugged and rich with detail, down to every strain of hair. The lush and smooth camera work is very Anderson-esque, with everything in frame and long panning shots matching the speed of the characters walking. Technically, this film couldn't be more immaculate.Voice talents across the board are great, in particular Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton and Bill Murray who are all spectacular with their voice work. Each of the character designs felt matched to their voice, almost made for the actors. The adventure with Atari and the dogs through trash island is very entertaining, and provides each dog with a distinctive personality, as well as their strong bond with Atari. The pure atmosphere of Megasaki City is wonderful and just presents a lovely aura with each of the scenes involving it, in contrast to trash island, while beautifully crafted, feels grubby and scruffy which is translated fantastically.When a character was speaking in Japanese, there was either subtitles, or Frances McDormand's character as an interpreter who would speak over what was being said into English, and usually drowning out the Japanese language entirely. This was slightly off putting, and would have been an advantage for the film if only subtitles were provided. This as well takes away from the lovely Japanese atmosphere of the film, as well as its cultural nuances. The eventual finale of the film felt a tad rushed, with little leeway given, and in hindsight being slightly forgettable. 'Isle of Dogs' is a stunning piece of stop motion animation with frenetic energy, wonderful atmosphere and delightful characters. Aside from the Japanese monologues drowned out, and the slightly rushed third act, Anderson's craft is strong with this one, as a beautiful work of animation mastery.",Isle of Dogs

'Moonrise Kingdom' a faint piece of whimsy I might score a 6, but this one evaporates after 30 minutes. I have to wonder why Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum signed on, because any meaningful dialogue disappears for them at this point.I was underwhelmed by the theatrical trailer but, thought why not when home release was made available. My original summation was proven correct in that this piece is style over substance. The plot in the latter stages becomes somewhat convoluted or perhaps I was too bored to concentrate. As other reviewers have asked 'Who is the target audience?', I am left with the same quandary - too dark for kids, too predictable and unchallenging for adults.This production appeared rushed.

316,stofsisters,What a satire!,10,7 January 2019,"Hooray for Wes Anderson, for bringing us a biting satire of America politics and its attempts to scapegoat immigrants for all our woes. Starting with the city's name, Magasaki (as in MAGA. not mega as so many reviewers have spelled it) and moving on to the mayor's propagandizing which is swallowed whole by his mass of followers, the movie skewers denigration of scientists, suppression of facts, and the readiness of a populace to follow a corrupt line of political thought.
Everyone else has already acclaimed the artwork, which is magnificent. The movie itself is immediately recognizable as Wes Anderson's work, if only from the flat tones of the actors' voices, one of his signatures. I sometimes felt as if I were in a Moonrise Kingdom set in Japan, as the camera swept across the landscape.
There is a taste of John Hoffman's Good Boy!, another dog and boy story, to Isle of Dogs. I'd recommend Good Boy! for the younger children in the family: Isle of Dogs is not a kiddie flick.

This movie has gotten some negative feedback because some people view this film as racist towards Japanese culture, but all this movie did that could be seen as racist is how it portrays the Japanese government as evil. I don't see this as racist however because They depict stereotypical Japanese culture like sumo wrestling and stuff but I didn't see that as racist as it's still just kind of a thing in their culture and it's nit racist to show it in a movie.

Isle of Dogs is witty, has a strong and coherent story line and despite being longer than most Wes Anderson films, does not lose its excellent storytelling and continuous viewer entertainment. A star-studded cast lose none of their quality performing as voice-actors, this film is simply brilliant. Without a doubt this is now one of my favourite animated features ever.

339,ilya-ratner,Kind of like Lake Wobegon: where all dogs are above average (but this movie is not),6,20 August 2018,"I am baffled, by the number of 9 and 10 star reviews this film has received. If a reviewer starts out by professing their love for Wes Anderson or dogs, their review should be tossed aside as an empty can of sardines that one might find in the trash on the Isle of Dogs. This film clearly under-performs. Its technical aspects -- the visuals, voices, all the production values -- to my untrained eye are quite good. It's quirky and original. The plot is decent, albeit that there's little tension. What dark, tense moments do exist don't last and don't grab us. In other words, it's rather superficial.There's little character development, save for one dog, where we can see some character trajectory, but, again, it fails to go deeper. That is to say, the movie plays it quite safe; it engages us enough to keep on watching, but it doesn't want to stir up anything deeper inside of us. This movie is a tad dark to be a kids' movie, yet too superficial to be a good adult film. I can see where my 12yo would enjoy it.",Isle of Dogs

There is an air of self awareness about the story that, rather than disengaging, is used to draw the viewer more into the inherently ridiculous story. There is an artistry to suspending disbelief, and this is an endlessly creative way to get the audience to do so. To make them aware they're getting conventional information or that certain things are ridiculous plot details, even tropes, and highlighting such details to actually enhance the storytelling rather than distance the viewer. After a point you accept the strange pacing and rapid editing style as part of the universe of this film, and when you do , The Isle of Dogs is an audio-visual experience so cathartic you won't want it to end.",Isle of Dogs

1. Why they put cats on the opposite as a symbol of evil? What did they do wrong?
2.So the only way of dogs getting along with human is to submit to human by doing stupid toss&fetch?
3.Although I'm not Japanese, I found the flag which looks like the Stars and Strips Flag on the boat very offensive. It reminds me of the colonial time, which hurts. I know the US is a great nation with glorious history and excellent constitutional government, but it's arrogant and disgusting to show off in this way.
4.The most serious problem is the half-baked and inconsistent script, which is too obvious to be worth discussing.",Isle of Dogs
347,tommacdonald-46377,Isle Of Imperialism by a white American man,1,16 July 2018,"The animation is not bad at all, it is the only positive point that can be found in this film. The scenario is predictable as hell and the fact that the story takes place in Japan brings nothing to the film but racist stereotypes about Japanese and Asian people in general, white saviorism (stinking of colonialism and American imperialism) and cultural appropriation, all sprinkled with a bit of sexism. The film is also outrageously speciesist while it is supposed to take the defense of dogs...
Now, here are the spoilers to illustrate what I am saying.
In this movie, Japanese culture is reduced to samurai, sumo, sushi and wasabi sauce (the poison used to murder a 'pro-dog' scientist and to exterminate dogs is the 'Wasabi Poison'...). In addition, the Japanese main characters are either completely hysterical corrupt politicians, or too stupid / soft to organize their resistance without the help of the white American student (color blind bonus: white blonde with an afro cut...). The white American woman speaks loudly for everyone to hear, while the little Japanese people are discreet and only serve as Japanese tokens (whenever there is a talk with important claims, it is she who is in the center of the image and who uses the megaphone, yes it is really painful to watch). A scene particularly representative of the racist violence of this film: the white American violently shakes a Japanese scientist, screaming at her, while she is mourning. It embodies the various racist stereotypes and domination relations that this film promotes: Americans who know what is good and take what they need by force, respectful discreet Japanese who let themselves be violated without retaliating (when we have in mind what Americans did to Japanese, it is an even more violent image...). The only important female character is the white savior and I wonder if it is not to better pass the pill of all the violence she symbolizes. The other female characters are bitches (literally, female dogs) completely useless to the scenario. In addition, Wes Anderson has chosen to make Japanese people speak Japanese without subtitling them so the only people we understand are the white American and the dogs who speak English, which makes Japanese people even more strange and incomprehensible to the audience.
In terms of speciesism, we are also served. In an imaginary Japan, Japanese people have an unexplained hatred for dogs while they love cats. The evil Japanese politician with the support of his degenerate barbarian people decides to get rid of all dogs by sending them on an island - open garbage dumpster. Then, one might think that they will question the status of human mastership and rebel. But the only character who could have led the revolt against human domination is a stray dog who will eventually become a bodyguard dog for a politician... Humans remain masters and dogs remain nice servile little doggies.

Lack of subtitles was annoying in some parts, but translations were there when necessary. When there weren't any, like with most of the government leaders dialogue, they did a good job of displaying his emotions which still got out the main points.Plot: Worked very well with the setting/art style. Pseudo antagonist redemption at the end felt rushed but was understandable. Beginning was focused on Main character with the group of five dogs. Second was focused on secondary character (Afro girl) and Atari fighting (separately) against government as well as the dog brother subplot. Ending was cute and did a good job of taking very subtle plot points and bringing them to the fore front (hacker dude from Afro girls high school for example)Characters: The kid and the Main dog had a surprisingly good chemistry that kinda came out of nowhere towards the end. The scene where they first get separated from the rest of the group is one of the best. It's the biggest character developing section and does a good job of showing why they become so close towards the end. The other dogs in the group served there purpose, but were somewhat forgettable in the third act. The Afro girl wasn't exactly necessary, but was a definite net positive on the movie.+Art Style

362,ajr93,I Love Dogs...and Japan...and Great Films,10,6 March 2018,"I had very high expectations going into Isle of Dogs, being a great admirer of Wes Anderson's work, and especially off the fumes of his previous film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and ""Wes Anderson-ey"". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a ""canine flu"" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",Isle of Dogs

Wes Anderson is probably my favourite film maker working today so when I heard he'd be returning to the screen with the stop-motion animation, Isle of Dogs, I couldn't wait to see it, even going to my first advance screening to catch it. He did not fail to disappoint.Set in a near-future Japan, due to an outbreak of dog flu and populations of dogs reaching ""epidemic proportions"", on the orders of authoritarian mayor, Kobayashi, every dog in the city Megasaki has been captured and quarantined on a nearby landfill site named 'Trash Island'. In response, Atari, a 12 year old orphan, crash-lands on the island to find his beloved dog, Spots, accompanied by a pack of grizzled canines. Like most Wes Anderson films, the plot details are not what makes the film great, more so its characters, the comedy and the world created.From his beautiful usage of Japanese ukiyo-e illustrations to the thunderous taiko drumming, Isle of Dogs is steeped deeply within Japanese culture, with most of the Japanese dialogue even left untranslated. Moreoever, Anderson takes this opportunity to pay homage to the Japanese greats of Hayao Miyazaki and Akira Kurosawa. Coupled with the meticulously crafted, symmetrical visuals of abandoned urban landscapes from sun dappled sake glasses to towering valleys of waste, these details come together to form a compelling, beautiful world for his characters to inhabit.
Voiced by a truly astonishing cast of actors and actresses from Bryan Cranston to Scarlett Johansson, Yoko Ono to Edward Norton, Greta Gerwig to Harvey Keitel and of course Bill Murray, Isle of Dogs perhaps possesses one of the greatest casts assembled. Unfortunately though, Anderson struggles to deal with such a rich and varied cast. Although the main characters of Chief (played by Bill Cranston) are dealt with well, none of the characters possess the charm of previous Wes Anderson creations such as Grand Budapest's Monsieur Gustave or Rushmore's Max Fischer. Instead what we receive are loose subplots that tarnish an otherwise great film.Despite its faults, as with every other Wes Anderson film, it is immensely funny, full of small details that you may only catch on a second or third viewing such. I've always had a soft spot for stop-motion animation and the enormous level of work that goes into it and the same goes for Isle of Dogs. The level of attention that goes into filming a bead of sweat rolling off the forehead of a drummer or a chef making sushi never fail to leave me impressed.
Although Anderson is often criticised for simply being style over substance, I never truly understood the argument for it. If you disregard the fine artifice that layers each of Wes Anderson's films (with the exception of perhaps Bottle Rocket), there lies a great deal of depth. In the case of Isle of Dogs, the kids adventure movie about dogs also explores darker themes such as The Holocaust, identity, free will and morality, but in a manner that does not take the audience as stupid.Although Isle of Dogs may not be Anderson's strongest film, it is one of his most endearing and beautiful films. Behind the stunning visuals, is a story full of heart, a story about a dog, man's best friend, and his master.8.4/10",Isle of Dogs

The story focuses on 12year old Atari who flies to Trash Island to find his bodyguard-dog, and tries to bring justice to what was once mans best friend. The positives of the movie is the the character development of the dogs throughout the story, and the background culture of the nation of Japan that influences the film.

379,christianfietz,Isle of Dogs,7,22 April 2018,"Wes Anderson proves his newly-discovered talents for blending animation and storytelling, comedy and relevance, heart and humour in his second stop-motion picture. 20 human years into the future (not certain about dog years) a breakout of dog flue in the Japanese city of Negasaki has 'forced' the government to banish all dogs to Trash Island. There, the dogs form their own savage society until Atari (Kuyo Rankin) tumbles in in search of his dog.What is perhaps most wonderful about this film is the beauty of it. Each and every dog has been given equal care and effort in creation and each look is scruffy yet loveable. The audience therefore, cannot help but fall in love with each K-9 character they meet. Hearing the words 'Trash Island' used to describe the film's setting would usually be enough to put anyone off yet Anderson surprises audiences. The trash is colour correlated and arranged in such ways that resemble the beauties of modern society and bring a strange charm to the world of the film. A cave the leading dogs have built for themselves comes to mind; the whole thing built out of empty bottles of various colours. This makes it resemble a jewel cave or something even more wonderful. Such care in setting is accommodated by a carefully chosen cast. Actors such as Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton allow themselves just enough freedom to develop individual characters. We hardly have time to get to know anyone with the speed of the film, yet the independent quirks of each dog allow just enough life and wit to be given. Most of the humour derives from rather dark jokes bordering around animal cruelty and certain injustices in Japanese culture. An example being a chef preparing sushi dinner and, in the process, carving open the head of a still-alive crab. Another being the dogs gossiping about the miserable and suicidal way that one of their comrades lost his life. These quirks seem like Anderson's way of making small statements about human's powerful ability to be cruel to creatures we deem as less powerful than ourselves. After all, what's crueller than abandoning sick puppies on a dirty and disease-ridden island? Anderson still pays tribute to the culture he toys with by presenting Kabuki dances and having his human characters speak their native tongue. Their own injustices are still there however, and its evident the thesis he attempts to present about human nature.Of-course not all the jokes are this dark. Most of the humans in the film are presented as silly using fast-paced slapstick actions. Most of this humour derives from its own unexpectedness and thus, should not be spoiled in a review. The quirks balance out the darkness in the film and ensure that the audience keeps laughing and involved in the film. All other social statements aside, this is a tale about a dog's loyalty to his master. Watching the friendships develop between the dogs and Atari demonstrates this love and ties together all other themes explored. Ultimately, leaving audiences with a sense of hope as they leave the cinema. The only downside to the film is a somewhat abrupt and unrealistic ending. The ending does tie up loose ends yet gives everything to its main characters from basically nothing. Does this contribute to any morals or themes of the film? It'll need to be up to the audience to tell. Wes Anderson is famed and glorified for his strange and unique creative style. Isle of Dogs is perhaps his strangest and yet one of his best. With humour and flair, the film speaks up for those who cannot speak for themselves and ensures laughs from audiences pro-dog and not.

392,xxLucarxx,I went for Wes Anderson and I got Wes Anderson,9,16 February 2018,"I've just seen this movie at Berlinale and it is exactly what you would expect from Wes Anderson. I wasn't sure how he would do with a non-Western setting but he managed well.He keeps his unique style and it works very well with the futuristic, but still traditional Japanese art. It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.It's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story. I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.Without spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.P.S. It's still not a children's movie, don't let the format fool you.",Isle of Dogs
393,mein-hampen,"Top visuals, poor female roles",5,23 May 2018,"I love the visuals of Wes Anderson movies. He is one of my favourite directors. The colors, the setup, the paintings, the alignments and silhouettes. Isle of dogs is no exception. But! This is a movie made by men for men. Lead and most supporting characters are male. Animals that usually have no sex are male. The owl is referred to as he, almost all the dogs have male voices. There are only three female dogs, first is the beautiful show dog, the second the motherly dog that instantly gets pregant and whos only role is to nurture, build a family and admire the male family dog, the third is the so-called oracle who only watches TV all day and stands next to the bigger, respected organising alpha male dog.Then there are three female human characters. One girl that actually says that she is in love with Atari although that contributes nothing to the story, the female scientist who can't manage her life without her male achiever colleague who commits suicide and the female translator who, well, at least works and does not talk about men and their superiority/manlihood all the time but also doesn't contribute anything to the progress of the movie other than commenting and translating to the audience.Wes Anderson knows better to write for stronger, more diverse roles. The actors/voices (Scarlett, Tolda, Greta - really?) know better to demand better female roles and dialogs. And the audience knows better not to vote 10 stars when it only has 0-star-female characters in it.",Isle of Dogs

403,cward18,Wes Anderson Delivers Once Again,7,16 April 2018,"I would not consider myself a Wes Anderson fanatic like some people would, but I certainly do enjoy his films. In an era of big budget superhero movies dominating the box office, it is refreshing to see someone with such a unique vision continuing to thrive. His latest effort, Isle of Dogs, is no exception to his commitment of great film making. Anderson's style translates extremely well to this type of story; simple yet entertaining at its core. His technical precision, comedic timing, camera movement, and quick editing elevates a timeless plot into something truly captivating. The star of the show is the quality of the animation. This is Anderson's sophomore effort into the medium (the first being 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") and he has yet again achieved something remarkable. His team's effort to make the animation look flawless absolutely translates to the screen while viewing this film. The voice acting for the most part is done well. While I take some issue with almost exclusively casting well know actors to play these characters, overall they did a good job. Bryan Cranston is the real standout here, as his gravely voice and intensity fits the character he is playing. He voices a dog named Chief and his character arc, as well as his relationship with the young protagonist, Atari, are the emotion core of the movie. Their dynamic has been seen before but is really well executed through the animation and voice performances. Despite these positives and my overall enjoyment of the movie, there are some negatives to the movie. The dialogue can very often fall into the cliche or hokey category which is not atypical for a Wes Anderson film. He writes his films purposely deadpan which is acceptable but this, however, causes some of the jokes to misfire or completely miss the mark and could be solved with a change in style. That being said, I did laugh a few times throughout the movie, with some of the visual gags being quite funny. There is a subplot involving a foreign exchange student character (played by Greta Gerwig) that I found to be distracting. Every time it cut to this character, I was just hoping it would return to the main characters as soon as possible. They are the real heart of the story. I also found some of the editing choices to be awkward, possibly relating to this being stop motion animation and hence, being more difficult to edit. It is possible, but I am by no means an expert in the field. I did overall enjoy the film despite is flaws in the writing, editing and overall simple story. The quality of the animation and the emotional core of the movie kept me engaged throughout the run time of the film and I would definitely like to see this again in theaters with some friends to gauge their reaction to the film. I would recommend the film to Wes Anderson fans, who will probably get the most enjoyment out of the film. The general audience I viewed the film with seemed to enjoy it so I would also give it a recommendation to the wider public as long as you keep an open mind to different styles of film making. Overall Rating: 7/10",Isle of Dogs
404,emcwilliams1122,"Got what I expected, Great movie, Great animation, and Dogs.",10,8 April 2018,"Drove an hour to see this one and it was worth it! A bummer it did not have a wide release all at once, but gave us a new chance to experience a different theater. The plot is good and expands a bit more throughout the story past what you know from the trailer - but not to the point of confusion or thorough thought. 
 The animation and characters and scenery were amazing. I already want to watch it again since we had to sit front row so that made it hard to take in all the detail on the big screen being so close.
 I wouldnt bother bringing any kids under 13 or so, as it deserves the PG-13 rating. Some adult talk, a few swears, some blood and depiction of injuries, ect. 
However more important, this isnt a knee-slapping comedy kids movie. It has a good pace and I was never bored, but the pace may be just a bit too slow, and comedy lacking for young kids. However, adults will appreciate this film, especially if you have a thing for stop motion. 
 If you are a feminist or critical of cultural references, maybe dont bother as this movie shows people in their ""typical"" roles and one of the main heros is an American trying to sway the masses. I hate that I have to mention any of that...just enjoy the great movie!",Isle of Dogs

407,DevinGSquire,Wes Does it again.,7,27 April 2018,"With in the first few seconds I was already haveing a good time. Wes pulls off another entertaining animation. Each character definitely has there quirks and characteristics. All of wich are enjoyable, even the side characters and villains. Every member of the cast gives a solid performance. It's well paste and structured. Doesn't Direlle off too much in to any small points or subplots no time is wasted on any others stories other then the 3 or so main characters. The core of the story is quite simple, and the situation everyone else is in is well explained. At first I was a little frustrated there wasn't subtitles for the Japanese characters, but soon realized it doesn't matter. We're only given the necessary information. Any additional information could have distracted and/or confused me. The style of animation is pleasing to the eye, with its atension to detail, for even the shortest segments. Additionally the cartoonish style on the televisions add a funny component to the whole film.Stop animation almost always gets extra points in my book. With how much more care and craft, is put in to each and every frame. You can't help but appreciate the film, even with a less then Ideal story.Everything is accompanied by a intense and compelling musical score. That really brings you in to this world.
In short it's a fun and enjoyable film with a gently delivered message that isn't shoved down your throat.Would highly recommend to animation lovers.",Isle of Dogs

410,mariasolmanuli,"If you watch this movie, you'll feel like a dog with two tails =)",9,11 September 2018,"The recent stop-motion animated film of Wes Anderson (writer and director) offers us 110 minutes of sharp wit, touching moments and an unexceptional plot that is full of heartfel and warmth. The plot centres around a pack of sick dogs that are kept in quarantine in an area called Trash Island near Japan. A boy called Atari goes to that island trying to find and resue his dog Spots and he gets help from other outcast dogs. The boy's search inspires a group of dog lovers to fight against this government's measure and this group shows that the goverment is trying to hide something. The plot is gripping and quite entertaining.
The entire cast is superb and some the recognizable voices includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, Greta Gerwig, and Yoko Ono. Apart from the plot and its fantastic cast, some highlight features of the ""The Isle of Dogs"" worth mentioning are the visual effects and the clash of cultures between the characters in the movie (Japanese vs English).
Overall, this film will have you laughing out loud and crying your eyes out at the same time. The enganging plot and effects make the movie work. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening than watching this film with yuor family or friends.",Isle of Dogs
411,johnboyauthor,Wes Anderson Continues to Impress,9,9 April 2018,"After The Grand Budapest Hotel, I thought that no film afterwards by the same director would be able to compete, but I was proved wrong when I went to see Anderson's latest movie. The animation style has certainly improved since his first stop motion feature, Fantastic Mr Fox, but Anderson's familiar and much loved directing traits remain. The cinematography is absolutely extraordinary, which is complimented by a range of quirky, funny and well developed characters- despite not being able to understand any of the Japanese characters, it is still easy to empathise and understand the motivations of these characters. The story, though not overly complex, is still intelligent and engaging.
The film may at first appear, especially from the trailers, to be a fun family jaunt in a quirky animation style, but within minutes it is established that relatively mature themes will be explored throughout, which they are, often with explicit detail. This, however, does not harm its availability to younger ages. 
I would thoroughly recommend this film to everyone and hope that none will miss this fantastic film.",Isle of Dogs
412,squashd,Only superficially creative,3,27 August 2019,"This is cool to look at. Otherwise, leave it for Wes Anderson fanboys who can see no wrong in anything he does. It's got some tedious things like all the main characters are male dogs voiced by older men. And not particularly well. And the female dog is depicted as feminine and pretty and voiced by a young, attractive woman with a ""#x22; voice. Yuck to that brand of anthropomorphism. It's the opposite of creative or cool. And a really petty criticism? The dog names are so basic and boring. This movie felt SO LONG too. I started checking the time only 35 mins in. However, the most disappointing thing is that the film seems written by people with no love or understanding of dogs. They're just annoying, unoriginal human characters that happen to be drawn as dogs. The stray dog Chief is especially tiresome, plus Bryan Cranston does not elicit any charm in the role. And the heavy-handed sociopolitical metaphors are just...sledgehammered in. It's no Animal Farm.",Isle of Dogs

This has probably become my favorite Wes Anderson film yet. But I'll need to see it a couple more times before I can make that call. The timing in this film is impeccable. The humor has a perfect balance of cute and dark humor it's a weird mix. For a stop motion film it's so meticulous and detailed it's probably the first Stop motion film i've seen where i forgot I was watching a Stop motion film.

Way too much time was spent by movie trying to explain everything to you, feeling like a boring video game dialogue.
Maybe it wouldn't be half bad, if the story was presented in less obvious way, with more mystery.

422,canonjensen,Film Lit Review (Canon Jensen),9,21 May 2018,"This film has art, entertainment, educational and literary values. Through the whole film this idea of conformism is presented through how the Japanese citizens all simply given to the mayors hate for dogs and conform. Other art values include the sound/audio techniques used in the film. Every voice and sound effect lines up perfectly with the kind of animation they used. Entertainment wise it didn't seem to be the most popular film that ever come out in theaters, but it was popular enough. Powerful scenes included whenever the Dog Chief or the main character Atari discovered something new having to do with Atari's dog and Chief's brother Spots. Those scenes seemed to add more excitement and interest in the film. A morale message that can be seen in the film is don't just conform to those in power and their ideas, think for yourself and what you believe is right. Scenes that reinforce this message are whenever Tracy Walker fights for the cause to save the dogs or stands up for what she believes is right. Internal conflict increases well in how Chief has pride in knowing that he must help Atari, but will not until a certain point. External conflict develops in the fight between the main good characters and society. Their will to bring back dogs is against what their society now traditionally believes in. All in all it was a wonderful Wes Anderson movie, some of his best work in my opinion and I think if I had watched this movie as a child I would've loved it even more.",Isle of Dogs
423,maxsalisbury,"Isle of Dogs - handsome, engaging, unique",10,31 March 2018,"Bursting full to the brim of mouth watering visuals, stunning production and flawless stop motion animation, Isle of Dogs shines as one of the best animated films ever crafted technically, and possibly the best film by unique and stylised filmmaker Wes Anderson. The film executes an unexpectedly complex story somewhat well, although it doesn't really focus on a main protagonist. Characters like Atari and Koboyashi lack personality, not only due to the language barrier and Anderson's common blank slate characters but also because there is not enough time spent exploring them compared to other supporting roles. I felt if the film was even 10 minutes longer, we could have seen relationships thicken and characters explored more than they were, rather than devoting time to supporting characters who felt more like protagonists as well, thus making the film full of side characters and no focus. Despite this, ""Isle of Dogs"" still feels special, gorgeous, inspired and heart-warming. The dogs are likable and appealing, and every frame of the film feels as though all the care in the world has been put into it. The astonishing production team has to be commended. Every performance was well done, including the child actors. Although Isle of Dogs features a cute array of animals and a whimsical, childish appearance, it is certainly not a film for young children. With most of the engagement coming from the dialogue driven plot, and an overall dark tone with references to cannibalism, suicide, euthanisation and concentrated genocide - don't take your 7-year-old to this movie but do take your teen to see it. In conclusion, Isle of Dogs is a sweet, aesthetically driven, technical masterpiece which, while lacking in character depth and a consistent tone (like most Anderson flicks), is still a must watch for film lovers and teens and up alike.I would recommend Isle of Dogs.",Isle of Dogs

I was never bored during the film and it was great that there was bearly any scenes were nothing was animated and all scenes contained no effects or cgi, all of it was practical in clever ways. The bad things in this film are very small and not very important but can bring something down. The twist were the main dog that they are looking for (spots) is found out to be the pack owners brother. The twist annoyed me but it would have been better if the main dog was spots because it would make out that this character that is tough and violent was a kig caring pet that forgot the luxury days of his life.

427,ewzzang,used the images but ignored the history,1,31 March 2018,"I finally watched the hottest film, Isle of Dogs. And it made me confused and even so mad. Well, the film could be seen nicely directed with exotic images, if you don't have any background knowledge about imperialism period of the country, Japan.Although the movie explained its time setting as the future, it obviously borrowed the images from Japan in the imperialism and colonial period such as costumes, hair style, how the government controls the people and how they were controlled. And from the point of view as a Korean, a person from the colonial victim country, it's not just about the cute dogs.There is an isle called Gunkanjima which was called 'Isle of jail' by Korean people near a city of Japan, 'Nagasaki', just as there is the isle of dogs near a virtual city in the movie, 'Megasaki'. From 1940 to 1945, approximately 800 of Korean people were drafted into the coal mine which was filled with high temperature poisonous gas above 50C for compulsory labour. They were literally treated like 'dogs'. And 122 of them passed away in the 'isle of jail'. Moreover, Japanese government didn't inform most of the deaths even to their families.If you still can't understand why I feel so mad, I can explain it more easily by metaphor. Just imagine there's a movie which German people in the Nazis period style appear in, and they commit 'Dogs' to an isolated isle. It can't but remind of 'the place' where all we know.Freedom of expression should not be respected always but only when with responsibility. If Wes Anderson just picked the country and the city because it's his favorite as he said, he should have known enough and well. And I would blame on his ignorance. However, if not, I am really wondering what he wanted to say through the film.",Isle of Dogs
428,hinesalex,An improvement on an already solid formula.,9,9 April 2018,"Wes Anderson creates meticulously detailed worlds. This is true for all his films, but this one is specifically evident of this fact. Possibly the most ""Wes Anderson"" film I've ever seen, ""Isle of Dogs"" is in many ways a spiritual successor to ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", the only difference being overall technical quality. ""Isle of Dogs"" takes the elements from Anderson's previous foray into animation; particularly stilted and short dialogue, whimsical sound design, solid comedic elements, and a vibrant array of color, and improves on every single one. It has enough lighthearted character to make it a genuinely enjoyable theatre-film, but also enough interesting shots and subtext to warrant a second viewing. Though I wouldn't recommend this to someone who doesn't already enjoy Wes Anderson's style, or to anyone under the age of 12 for fear that it would just go over their head... I had a great time watching this film, and would tell everyone else to go see this soon-to-be animated classic immediately.",Isle of Dogs

Read the reviews and had no idea who Wes Anderson was and why people were raving as though he was some kind of movie God. The animation was pretty terrific and the story line was good altho you knew how it would mostly turn out. Humor was good. My 14 and 12 yo boys were quite bored. Mostly thought it was quite slow. Definitely more of an adult movie despite the main theme of a boy doing everything he can to reunite with his dog.,Isle of Dogs

I didn't like how they split it into chapters, they didn't really need to do that and I feel like the narrator was unoriginal and I feel like they could have done something a bit more creative. Also the puffy girl character could have done more, because she didn't really do as much as she should have done in the amount of time that they gave her. That is basically everything I have to say about this movie, I think it is great and if you haven't seen it, then do see it.

Thus the magic of having a human who understands SADB (Standard American Dog Bark)...oh that would be me...to bring this crisp content to non-canine moviegoers...virtually anyone. #sweartogod)Straight away I admit to mixing a cocktail of both regard and rebuke for Isle of Dogs (referred to hereafter as IOD to cool my boiling carpal tunnel).Doesn't that beg the question ""What is this movie NOT about?"" Decidedly not whale migrations, failed PHD theses, or the lack of a good crème brûlée in Oklahoma. And yet, in spite of the myriad topics not presented, the membrane (synonym for film) is an allegory. We posit good versus evil. Has that clash yet to receive a full treatment in any art or literature? That is question 6 on your homework assignment. So we have a megalomaniac running Megasaki - appropriate. He sends the infected dogs to quarantine on Trash Island. (Bakersfield with a lean shellac of animation.) Imagine conjoining ""101 Dalmations"" with ""Schindler's List"". All right don't. But when I think about IOD, mostly during the time I spend spinning in three circles before I lay (laid? lain?) on my Pendleton shirtish bucket by the fire (I know it's July but light it anyway), I face plot holes so substantial and off-white that no matter or radiation can escape. I scraped that from Wikipedia but it somehow works. Or doesn't. You decide. You can stop reading now. Go ahead I dare you. And I will scratch up some dirt on you and yours.Aside: somebody just came up to me, I'd been drowsing, and said ""Where's the ball?"" Really? So I am supposed to look keen and spirited? You know where the ball is. You pushed it under the couch. :end of aside.Just a few of the miscalculations from Wes Anderson and the other writers:-- How could a band of renegade pups not take a licking? Isn't that what they crave? Unto themselves and each other?
-- How fur can you go with the ""Abused Dogs Stage Coup"" device? 
-- Notice the cut-rate ""Canine Ex Machina"" in the trending1 ""bucket on a wire"" scene. (1Wes bought 1.5 million Twitter followers from Cambridge Analytica.)
-- Think on Rex, King, Duke, Boss, and Chief. Why didn't they flea when presented the opportunity?End of miscalculations.I don't want to kibble on small points but the leash I could do is scratch a hole in the new carpet. (There was something alive under the pad #sweartogod squirrel most likely). 
I discussed this for seven and a half hours with the other dogs on the block that comprise our karass. Our managers were all out ""working"". Right. So we talked and Gunner said that the one actress put the poo in poodle. Fair? Probably not. Other views held her to be fetching. Bear said that the mayor was so simple he should have been put into a witless protection program. My tenet was empathy for the mentality of the pack. Seeing them eat garbage reminded me of trying to find any watchable shows on DirecTV.Other principles we noted: inside every black dog is a white dog waiting to be shampooed and announced.I lift my leg and give IOD 4 Hydrants and a patch of grass. And I will now accept my chew toy.",Isle of Dogs
432,leguizamo-29452,"Enjoyable, far from being the best work of W.AY",7,17 May 2018,"Anderson's narrative is not felt, unlike Fantastic fox the plot is locked and all its characters are not so interesting.
An admirable and beautiful work, however, Anderson forgets artistic ideas and prefers a simple story.",Isle of Dogs
433,mattbloom-23962,"I love dogs, but this sucked",1,27 June 2018,"I am reading through reviews and have no idea how people think this movie was worth watching. Luckily I have movie pass so this pile of excrement didn't get my money, or I'd have asked for it back from the box office. The movie is tediously slow with below average imagery and poor writing. You know exactly how the movie is going to go, and just don't care about it the whole time. I couldn't sit still in the theatre because all I wanted to do was leave, which half the theatre did already by the end of the movie so it wasn't just me. Please don't do a sequel.",Isle of Dogs

435,TheMetalsoft,The best film of 2018 so far,10,22 July 2018,"I am a huge Wes Anderson fan, seeing as he is my favorite director of all time, so buying a ticket for this film was a no-brainer.
The only thing I'm gonna say is: see this right now. It's on Blu-Ray, so no excuses.",Isle of Dogs
436,ebsdy,The art of simplicity,9,9 October 2018,"Movies nowadays are very high tech and require a lot of work. An example of this is the recent movie hit Avengers Infinity War, which took so much time just to make a part one as well as took many movie actors hours and hours of practice just to do one scene. Isle of dogs is different in the way that it uses clay figures and use animation to make them move which is a very unique way to film, that many directors just do not do. The thing about this movie is the art of its simplicity, especially in their storyline. The movie is basically all about Japanese people hating dogs because of a corrupt dictator from the cat army who decided to put a disease in a dog which spread fear into the people, giving him power to kick out all dogs. A young boy named Atari is not happy about this, so he decides to leave the country to find his servant dog who was with him during his injury. I love the Visual Design aka Mise en scéne of the movie. The actions are so well timed, the characters are simple yet beautiful,and even the storyline, although somewhat cliché, it doesn't take away the beauty and overall greatness of the movie.Isle of Dogs is unique in the way that even though the language is Japanese, and dubbed to English, there are still parts that are in Japanese. Mr. Anderson was very wise in this decision as those words that are in Japanese hold a very deep meaning that I'm dubbed, could make the viewers not fully grasp the intention of the words used. What it lacks however is that it doesn't fully develop the side characters as when Atari was in trash island, he met a dog and his squad, and after some character development, he gets close with the one dog that doesn't really like him, but after some time and some problems happen, and the other dogs are in danger, and released, their story ends there. The ending doesn't even reveal how they ended up. Basically, what I just stated was merely nitpicking and that didn't really affect my overall perspective on the movie, which is it is great. I actually enjoyed the movie from start to finish and I would definitely recommend other people to watch it if they have the opportunity to.",Isle of Dogs
437,arthermain,"Isle of dogs, a unique movie in itself",7,11 October 2018,"Isle of dogs is not your typical film. Sure it has some big name stars voice acting in the film, but the way they show it is different from what we have seen so far. They used clay and moved each of them part by part and used it for the film. Over all I liked the film because it is not something you see everyday. It is unique in its own way, some people might find it weird but some might be intrigued by it. The films cinematography is good in the sense that they do not jump to different places all of a sudden. The general plot of the story is also different and the sound is clear when watching. The film is mostly spoken in English or translated from Japanese. The dogs in the film all speak english while the humans in Japan obviously speak Japanese. Even when the people were talking, there were no subtitles provided in the film. I think this was done to sow the difference between humans and dogs. When we speak, dogs are unable to comprehend what we are saying. Same for us when dogs bark, we have no clue of their intention. This is because we are watching the film through a dogs perspective. They understand each other while they do not understand the people. This helped show how different dogs and man are even if dogs are called a ""man's best friend"".",Isle of Dogs
438,marvinuy,A Man's Best Friend,10,11 October 2018,"The Isle Of Dogs has been a movie I've been exited to watch ever since I saw the trailer, and having the opportunity to watch it was really worth it. It has this sense of uniqueness amongst other animated films as it utilizes traditional Japanese puppets, utilizing it in modern methods. One things that stood out in the film is its, sound design. I feel as if every song or sound effect were utilized effectively and it really made me feel as if I were in the movie itself. The whistle the young boy plays, really struck me the most as it was repeated throughout the film and it really made a mark for itself as I've personally grown addicted to whistling it myself.I personally think the reason behind Wes Anderson's decision on not implementing subtitles for the Japanese parts is that it probably servers as an element of mystery for it is with this added element that prevents us from knowing what's gonna happen next. If the Japanese were to have subtitles, then we would be able to know everything completely hence Wes Anderson made it so that us, the viewers have to figure out and fix out pieces in this movie so that we will be able to fully comprehend what's happening.",Isle of Dogs
439,johnjacobgo,Isle Of Dogs -- Brief Film Review,9,12 October 2018,"I very much enjoyed watching the movie, Isle of Dogs, mainly because of the cinematography and visuals which were very unique and interesting. The way Anderson was able to use stop motion to his advantage and executing it perfectly to the smallest detail. This really caught my attention and was one of the main factors why I love this movie. The cinematography also made scenes more impactful especially those in which strong emotions like humor and anger are involved.Another thing that I found very interesting in the movie was the way Japanese was used. With a Western and English-speaking audience, it would be assumed that Japanese be subtitled by Anderson in order for viewers to understand what these lines mean, but then, to my surprise, he didn't. There must be a reason behind this, and I believe that this measure was done in order to make the audience think. Viewers are used to having information served onto them on a silver platter but then having un-subtitled Japanese forced viewers, forced me to pay attention to every single minor detail in order to use them as context clues to decipher the hieroglyphics that is Japanese. This really helped me appreciate the stop motion animation and the movie as a whole.",Isle of Dogs
440,amerycaleb,Unique and Beautiful,9,13 October 2018,"Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is a beautiful, well-made movie that stands out in its genre. Its setting is a gritty dystopian Japan in the future where dogs are all sent to an island as a way to quarantine a disease that has spread among them. The mayor of this dystopian world's son, whose dog was the first to be exiled, flies on a plane, but crashes on that island which has been overrun by the dogs. This boy, Atari Kobayashi, is then set on a path to find his lost dog.This movie has a very unique animation style that is different from other animated movies. It blends modern animation technology and stop-motion puppet animation. You can clearly see the effort put into the creation of the film. The movie itself is certainly more adult than most animated movies, however I believe that its PG-13 rating is fit for its type. Its own story is very unique, and its characters are developed very well. When watching the movie, I got attached to lots of the dogs, though of course I may be biased as a dog person. My favorite part of the story is how, despite its futuristic setting, many of its concepts can be seen in today's society, such as people being desensitized to many of the problems happening. Its soundtrack focuses on traditional Japanese music, which is very fitting to its setting.One major part of the movie is that most of the dialogue is spoken in Japanese. Aside from the foreigners in Japan, most people speak to each other in unsubtitled Japanese. The dogs, however, speak in English. A reason for this could be to show the movie in the perspective of the dogs, who cannot understand anything we say. In a way, it is Wes Anderson's way of making the viewers think like the dogs.Overall, Isle of Dogs is an amazingly made movie that excels in its genre and is able to provide a unique experience for all of its viewers. It is recommended for a more mature audience who would be able to see its themes and messages, but enjoy its style of animation and of course, its dogs.",Isle of Dogs
441,weilbenjamin,My Current Favorite Movie,10,16 October 2018,"This is an amazing movie. After Fantastic Mr Fox, I thought Wes Anderson was done with the medium of animation. I thought he couldn't make a comeback, because I hated Moonrise Kingdom and thought Grand Budapest Hotel wasn't his best movie. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't rely on cliches. Most of Wes's films are comedies, but I find this one to be more of a drama. The untranslated Japanese offers actually made me connect MORE to the characters, because I can relate through more subtle means. This is a very subtle movie, so if you like blockbusters a lot, you'll probably hate this. The political allegory is very strong and relevant and capturing it through the lens of a 12 year old helps understand it from all point of view's. Atari's story has a happy ending, but the movie makes clear that the dog flu isn't the only political conspiracy in Japan. I loved all the characters, but Chief seemed to represent most a great character journey. He goes from being a stray, and hating humans, to starting to like Atari, to becoming his new dog at the end. It was a very interesting character journey, especially since Chief spoke in English. I loved the movie. Highly recommended",Isle of Dogs
442,mollycole-24288,WES ANDERSON DOES IT AGAIN,10,24 December 2018,"Before going into this movie I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. Just a simple golden retriever in the frozen section at a local super market, so I thought. Little did I know this 97 minute film would change the course of my life. Seeing Chief for the first time made my knees go weak. Ever since my lord and savior, Bryan Cranston, played Hal Wilkerson in the early 2000s American sitcom, Malcom in the Middle,I knew he could turn any trash into treasure. Chief showed me true bravery. After being an active marine for 30 years I thought I knew what bravery was, but boy was I wrong. I think everyone can take some life lessons from this very close knit distopian Japanese community. Family always comes first. These pups showed loyalty in the most difficult of situations. If you are ever faced with such difficult situations just remember... what would Cheif do? 😌",Isle of Dogs
443,jodiryan-81333,Wes Anderson's best film since The Royal Tenenbaums!,9,27 January 2019,"I was pleasantly surprised! And as a fan of his work, I have watched all of his movies- my favorite being The Royal Tenenbaums! However, not knowing what to expect when first watching Isle of Dogs, I must say that there is nothing about the movie I do not love! The characters, the screenplay, his very unique view and direction! Honestly, it reminds me a lot of The Royal Tenenbaums, but completely different and worth watching over and over! I quickly bought it and I have enjoyed each time I've watched it so far and counting!",Isle of Dogs
