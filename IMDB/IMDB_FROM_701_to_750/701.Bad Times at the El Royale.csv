0,MartinHafer,"If I had it to do again, I'd skip this film....even though it's very well made.",8,11 December 2019,"""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is an extremely intelligent film when it comes to the writing. It's very complex and a film you just can't stop watching once you start because there are so many strange twists and turns in the script. That being said, in hindsight I probably shouldn't have watched the movie because it is ultra-violent and unpleasant....and afterwards I felt a need to watch DIsney+ just to get my mood back to normal! After all, you'll see quite a few people shot up close and personal as well as a lot of blood....and I generally avoid films like that. So, whether or not you see it depends on the sorts of films you enjoy and your stamina! Think about it before you try it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
1,Leofwine_draca,Generally likeable,8,26 January 2020,"BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE is a generally likeable crime thriller that keeps you guessing for a while before letting rip with a high-energy climax. It's another single location type movie set in the lobby and various rooms of a slightly sleazy motel, but the good news is that it's a lot more intelligent than Tarantino's similar HATEFUL EIGHT. The first half takes a little while to get going with character stories presented as sub-plots that mingle together in a way similar to the likes of 11:14, although not quite as good. The ending really picks up with actors such as Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth shining in against-type roles, and the unknown-to-me cast members pull off effective performances too. Not quite a classic, but still a fun way to spend an hour or two.",Bad Times at the El Royale
2,SnoopyStyle,too many MacGuffins,6,26 December 2018,"It's 1969 Lake Tahoe on the border between California and Nevada. El Royale is an empty destination motorlodge with its best days well behind it. Four strangers check in with the hotel's only employee Miles Miller. Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and Emily Summerspring arrive with some hiding secrets.This is a stylish pulpy noir action thriller from Drew Goddard. I do like most of it but there is a little too much of it. I'm not sure if it needs the tape. There're like two MacGuffins. Concentrating on one MacGuffin usually works better. When Billy Lee shows up, it gets to be craziness overload. At that point, I want the characters to gather in one place and have a climatic conflict. I don't really want to insert another character. Drew obviously expects that more is better. It's a little too more.",Bad Times at the El Royale
3,boblipton,Actually Writing A Script,7,15 July 2020,"A man enters a motel room, moves all the furniture, rolls up the rug, pries open the floor, drops a satchel into the hole, puts everything back in place, hangs around, answers the door and is blown to smithereens.Ten years later, a priest, a traveling salesman, a girl singer and an angry hippie chick are checked into the El Royale motel by a deaf hotel clerk. Only one of them is what he or she claims to be.It's an elaborately, almost flamboyantly written neo-noir. Clearly writer-director Drew Goddard has seen Quentin Tarrantino's pictures and has learned his stye of writing a movie: take a bunch of great shots, and write a script that gets from one to the next. Add in some shock value and a great setting -- the Arte Moderne El Royale is clearly modeled on the Cal-Neva Lodge, the glitzy hotel half in California and half in Nevada, that was bought by Sinatra and Dean Martin fronting for the Mafia. A great music track is necessary -- 1960s girl-band hits. Where he has bettered Tarrantino -- with whom I have reached my limit -- is that it's not necessary to go all potty-mouth all the time, and if you can't remember a great shot to steal, why, you can write your own.Gasp! What an insane idea! Thanks to cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, composer Michael Giacchino and the other talent behind the camera, as well as a solid cast led by Jeff Bridges, it works very well... although about ten minutes from the end something bumped my concentration to make it clear all this was scripted.In sum, there's nothing absolutely original about this movie, but it's pretty well put together and will keep you guessing until the end.",Bad Times at the El Royale
4,Horst_In_Translation,Fun times at your local theater,6,10 November 2018,"The El Royale - Not a place for a priest! ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is a new American 2018 film written and directed by Oscar nominee Drew Goddard, actually only his second full feature movie as the director and this one is probably gonne be at least as iconic as his first. At almost 2.5 hours, it is indeed a very long film, but there is so much fun and tension in here that it feels considerably shorter. The man in the middle of it all is Oscar winner Jeff Bridges playing a (not so holy) priest. The rest is actors who may not yet have received great Oscar glory, but you will recognize most of their faces immediately such as Jon Hamm from Mad Men, 50 Shades star Dakota Johnson as well as Thor Chris Hemsworth. Director prodigy Xavier Dolan plays a minor character too. And Nick Offerman from Parks&Rec (not the only one) has a fun role at the very beginning. Cynthia Erivo I am not really familiar with and from this film here she won't stay in my memory for very long either. Her singing was amazing, no doubt about it, but acting- and character-wise she seemed really pale next to Jeff Bridges, with whom she shared most scenes. And Bridges wasn't even the best thing about the film. Jon Hamm is a clear scene stealer in the first hour. He is fun very early on and he is also great to watch when he discovers the secret path. Then again, being a big Mad Men fan I am clearly biased here. Johnson wasn't too bad either, but I really struggled with her character at times and the whole purpose she had. Was she trying to trap the cult leader early on? Maybe. And she mistook Hamm's character for an aide to him. Oh well, never mind. This obscurity does not take away from the film's quality. One major disappointment was Hemsworth though. He had so great material to create a cult (no pun intended) character in the last 45 minutes, but it all felt so false and gimmicky about him. What a wasted opportunity really. He was completely style over substance in this movie.Away from the characters and as for the film itself, I enjoyed it a lot. There were moments when 3 out of 5 is certainly not enough. And there were also fun moments where you will immediately move north in your seat like the first not so friendly encounter between Erivo's and Bridges' characters that came really out of nowhere. The ending with the revelation about the military assassin felt a bit weak too just like the final scene between the two I just mentioned already. Film could have gone out on a higher note for sure. The seemingly heartfelt relationship between these two also was not effective enough to carry the film in terms of emotion which may have had to do with Eriwo's acting. But still there are some great moments like him digging down in her room while she makes sure nobody recognizes. I have seen others compare this film to Tarantino's movies and I would not say it is inaccurate at all, especially if we focus on his earlier, i.e. faster, films. So if you love Q as much as I do, then go see this one. I am actually curious what he thinks about it himself. Gonna go check after finishing the review. What else can I say. Don't go for this one if you want bold realism. It's a very absurd film with some great dialogue writing, highly entertaining and very fearless from start to finish. Maybe the very best of its niche from 2018. Don't miss out if you can stomach the violence we got here. I give it a thumbs-up.",Bad Times at the El Royale
5,Prismark10,Hotel Pulp Fiction,6,1 September 2019,"Set sometime in what looks to be the early 1970s. The El Royale is a strange seedy hotel that has fallen on hard times. Half of it is set in Nevada, it has a casino on that side but it has no gambling licence. The other half is set in California.Checking in are a set of disparate and maybe even desperate guests. They may not all check out of the hotel. Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who might not be a genuine cleric. Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) a lounge singer who once might had been destined for stardom but now sings in low rent bars and sleeps in cheap hotels. Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm) is a garrulous vacuum cleaner salesman who we immediately suspect is someone entirely different. Later a sour surly Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) shows up at the hotel. Her actions sets the film in motion as she brings to her room a young kidnapped woman.The hotel clerk, Miles (Lewis Pullman) is nervous when the priest shows up and is aware of the hotel's dark passageways and secrets. Laramie finds listening devices hidden in his rooms which he expertly finds. He also finds a corridor and rooms that have two way mirrors and sees Emily bringing in an extra guest.Director Drew Goddard has crafted an intriguing, intricate film. Unfortunately it is very much a homage to a Quentin Tarantino movie. It feels like a tribute act very much in the style of some of Darlene's songs. This is emphasised when another character played by Chris Hemsworth joins the proceedings later on as the film takes an increasingly violent turn.Bad Times at the El Royale is an overlong jumbled up noirish thriller with some killer retro songs. It is just a shame it was not more original.",Bad Times at the El Royale
6,nogodnomasters,A man who likes to talk alot,8,22 October 2018,"The film takes place in Tahoe during the ""Age of Nixon."" The El Royale has lost its casino license and is barely operating above water. Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman) is the sole caretaker. We meet the characters as they check in. Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) has dementia. We suspect he is looking for a particular room, one where we saw money hidden in the opening scene. Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) is a singer from LA. She has a gig in Reno. Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm) is a vacuum cleaner salesman. We quickly discover he works for the FBI and is looking for a film of a famous person having sex with someone. A young woman with an attitude (Dakota Johnson) also shows up. We discover her name later.The film gives us the backstory of each individual while moving forward. This is a cultish type of film, not recommended for everyone.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Bad Times at the El Royale
7,kosmasp,Good times,9,3 May 2019,"Check in for a good time. Well that's not what the movie tells us of course, at least not generally. Because for the viewer this is fun. A lot of odd characters, a lot of mystery, a lot twists and turns and a lot of secrets. If you are into this mixture, you will love this too. So it is quite specific and almost niche in a sense that it was made for a particular group in mind (one would be excused to think that at least seeing the movie).Really good acting and storytelling. The set is more than nice and the production design is amazing too. You will know what I mean once you see it. Don't be afraid of violence. This can get quite brutal, so not for the squeamish either. Decide for yourself: are you in or are you out?",Bad Times at the El Royale
8,classicsoncall,"""Sh_t happens. Get the whiskey!""",9,10 March 2019,"Whoa, pleasant surprise here! The movie delivered a lot more than I was expecting with a title like ""Bad Times at the El Royale"". Seems like Jeff Bridges can't miss ever since ""Crazy Heart"", with follow up grizzled, ornery characterizations in ""Rooster Cogburn"" and ""Hell or High Water"". He was great here as the dementia challenged old timer bent on reclaiming an old score from ten years prior during a robbery that went South. But he's not alone among a cast that includes relative newcomer Cynthia Erivo, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson and Chris Hemsworth, who provides an additional layer of intensity with an appearance late in the story. Part of my fondness for the film comes from an appreciation for Tarantino-esque story telling with a non-linear chronology, which was very effective here and not too difficult to follow.What really got my attention in the early going was when Calhoun Appliance salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Hamm) placed a call to J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI..., wait, what? Then it gets weirder and weirder with the El Royale's secret passage containing two way mirrors, listening devices and secret recording equipment. The principal story takes place in the mid to late Sixties, with a very satisfying soundtrack recalling some of the big hits of the era, which nicely redounds to Cynthia Erivo's character, a promising lounge singer attempting to make it big with nearby casino bookings. But as the viewer, you're never quite sure what direction the story is going in until the all but invisible Billy Lee (Hemsworth) shows up in the sixth chapter to turn things upside down.So with a lot of twists and turns and some unconventional characters, the film turned out to be a pleasant surprise for this viewer, who hadn't heard anything about it until running across the title at my local library. I'd strongly recommend it except for the fact that it won't be appreciated by anyone turned off by chronologically challenged stories with less than savory characters. That would be like getting whacked in the head with a whiskey bottle, which by the way, figures prominently in a particularly jarring scene. One of the many surprises in a film full of them.",Bad Times at the El Royale
9,lee_eisenberg,Wes Anderson's style meets the Coens' style,10,4 February 2019,"Drew Goddard's ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" reminded me of a cross between the filmmaking styles of Wes Anderson and the Coen brothers (a previous reviewer called it a cross between Hitchcock and Tarantino, which I agreed with also). This story of an assortment of people who converge on a rural motel one night in 1969 has some shocking scenes, but I loved every minute of it. The movie kept me guessing as to what was going to connect to what. I suspect that this is one movie that they enjoyed filming. It won't be for everyone, but it's not one that you're likely to forget any time soon. I liked it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
10,BandSAboutMovies,A long way around the hotel for no real payoff,5,15 January 2019,"Remember when Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction made their initial splash for Quentin Tarantino and studios rushed to get their own chopped up narrative films in theaters? Killing Zoe, 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, 2 Days in the Valley, Smoking Aces and plenty more, it seemed like everyone was trying to make a movie that didn't follow a linear track, had overly erudite killers with a skewed moral code and plenty of strange MacGuffins. As if 1992 was back again, I threw Bad Times at the El Royale into our blu ray player and sat back to watch.One night in 1969, on the California/Nevada border, seven strangers all spend the night in a shady hotel -- the El Royale itself. The hotel -- which has seen better days -- is split in half between the two states and is pretty much a ""pervert hotel"" now, although once it was home to the Rat Pack when they weren't in Reno or Las Vegas (the hotel is based on the Cal Neva Resort and Casino that was once owned by Sinatra).Catholic priest Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges), singer Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo, the best part of this movie), vacuum salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm) and Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) all arrive and wait for the hotel's only worker, Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman).Much like Tarantino, each section of the story overlaps and features title cards. It starts with the reveal that Sullivan is really an FBI agent who was sent to remove listening devices in one of the rooms. After finding double digits worth of them, he also discovers a tunnel filled with one-way mirrors and cameras that film everything in each room. Although he witnesses what he thinks is a kidnapping in Emily's room, he is told by no less than J. Edgar Hoover himself to not interfere and to sabotage all of the vehicles so that no one can leave until he finds a critical piece of film. However, he can't stop himself from trying to rescue Emily's captive, who ends up being her sister, Rose (Cailee Spaeny). Emily ends up blowing him away with a shotgun.Meanwhile...Father Flynn and Sweet have dinner at the hotel's automat diner. She notices him spiking her drink, so she knocks him out and tries to escape. As she watches Emily murder Sullivan, he recovers and discovers the hidden hallway and Miles confesses that the management of the hotel has asked him to film incriminating moments. However, he has kept one film that incriminates a recently killed public figure. As Miles watches the hostage situation in Emily's room, he catches buckshot from her killing Sullivan right in the face.Sweet tries to escape, but the cars have all been played with. Father Flynn gets into her car and reveals that he's really a criminal who has spent the last ten years in jail only to learn that he has dementia. He knows that his brother (Nick Offerman) has hidden money in the hotel, but he has no idea which room it's in. He offers to split the money if she'll let him in her room. As she sings (this scene took over twenty takes of live singing), he finds the money.Emily and Rose discover the tunnel and start to question Miles, who somehow survived. The older sister has removed the other from a cult run by Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth, who even has his own Hairdresser to Mr. Hemsworth employee in the credits), a Manson-esque figure who is responsible for the killings we keep seeing on the TV in the hotel's bar. Even worse -- he's on his way to the El Royale.The killer and his cult arrive, playing a brutal game of roulette with the lives of the survivors. After a Mexican standoff -- yes, another Quentin trope -- lives are lost, people are absolved and a few people survive.This is 2 hours and 21 minutes long and the last act feels like forever, with near glacial pacing. At first, I defended it to my wife that everything was leading to this. However, it went on. And on. And then on some more.This movie was written, produced and directed by Drew Goddard, who also directed The Cabin in the Woods as wrote Cloverfield and adapted World War Z for the screen. He was also part of Deadpool 2 and will be working on the next sequel, X-Force.TV lovers will enjoy seeing William B. David (the Cigarette Smoking Man from The X-Files) show up as a judge and Jim O'Heir (Jerry from Parks and Recreation) as Reno host. These are simply cameos, but still nice to see these actors in a major movie.Some may enjoy this film, but the more I thought of those unremarkable wannabe Tarantinos, the more this film felt like it fit right in. It's certainly not a bad film, but it's not one that you need to go out of your way to see. It just is. With time so limited these days, I feel like things have to be better than just fine.",Bad Times at the El Royale
11,grantss,Quite flat for a thriller,6,28 July 2019,"Early 1970s. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel was once very popular but is now deserted, staffed by a single desk clerk. Some of the new guests' reasons for being there are less than innocent and some and are not who they appear to be.Had potential but ultimately just okay, not great. Writer-director Drew Goddard (director of The Cabin in the Woods, writer of The Martian and Cloverfield) doesn't build the tension well or create character engagement: things just happen and you go along for the ride. Character development is minimal and, and from what you know of them, none of the characters are really that supportable. One is okay, but doesn't get much attention initially.This leaves the whole affair feeling rather flat. There's enough action, twists and turns to keep you interested but it is never engrossing. The action does ramp up towards the end, but even then there's a few predictable developments.Ultimately: watchable, but nothing more.",Bad Times at the El Royale
12,neil-476,An absolute cracker,10,21 October 2018,"It is the 1960s. The El Royale hotel/motel/casino sits on the California/Nevada border. Staffed only by youngster Miles, a number of guests arrive. Each has a secret, and no-one is quite who they might appear to be at first sight. A very eventful night is under way.This noir crime(ish) thriller starts with an intriguing opening scene before settling down to tell the main story. This is peppered with backstory flashbacks for the various characters, small narrative rewinds so that you can see events from alternative points of view, and a succession of reveals and plot developments which have you constantly on the wrong foot.It is a narrative delight. I love to be kept unsettled, and this throws things at you which you never anticipated, yet never unfairly. You might not have had any warning, and to that extent you can cry ""Deus ex machina!"" but such elements are not inconsistent with what has happened previously.The script was fun. The casting and performances are uniformly great. And the direction is excellent - the film looks great. For a long film - the exact same length as First Man - the time fairly zips by.Others have compared this with Tarantino. Not me - it doesn't have that smug self-reverential air to it which characterises Tarantino's films.This is one of my favourite films this year.",Bad Times at the El Royale
13,morrison-dylan-fan,Good Times at the El Royale.,9,4 March 2019,"Nearing the end of ICM's best of 2018 poll,I looked for films to view in the final days to fill out my top 20. Speaking to a family friend,I was told about a Neo-Noir that sounded so special I booked a ticket for the El Royale hotel.View on the film:Coming back to film making for the first time since The Cabin in the Woods (2011), writer/director Drew Goddard & cinematographer Seamus McGarve (who shot on film and in Panavision) blaze a 2 and a half hour explosive Neo-Noir epic. Set in the dying days of the 60's, Goddard and McGarve open the hotel up to the burning embers of the decade, via long panning shots along the corridors stepping into the dust covering the hotel whose better days are long gone, and the blissful Soul songs (along with Michael Giacchino's flickering score) given a soaring sound design, filling the place like a haunted mansion.Hanging a neon greeting sign at the entrance, Goddard sinks the location into a burning Neo-Noir atmosphere, sparked from whip-pans screwing in the anxiety knotted round each loner, and glistening slow-motion long-shots across the pits of fire within the El Royale hell, burning to the blistering shudder of neon red blood splattered across the floor. Greeting all the guests in a never-ending storm outside, the screenplay by Goddard keeps the big run time moving at an incredibly light on its feet pace, thanks to Goddard building each Neo-Noir loner in an episodic manner that unveils their hidden backgrounds and gives a depth to their current decisions.Gradually drawing everyone together with thrilling multiple perspective views on the fatal shot which gets them together,Goddard spins the wheel on each of them having to confront their pasts, with hard-boiled Dock O'Kelly having to find value in his soul for the crumbling Miles Miller, and Darlene Sweet fighting to find the value of her voice within the lonely echo of El Royale. Each booking a room for differing shady deals, the ensemble cast are united in giving absolutely outstanding turns, pouring from Jeff Bridges reflective O'Kelly and Lewis Pullman's jittering lone hotel staff member Miller, to Dakota Johnson gunning for Emily's conflicting family loyalties, and Cynthia Erivo having Sweet fill each room with a tragic soulfulness, before they all check out of the El Royale.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Anyway, the former is the lead star of Bad Times at the El Royale, a rather stylish film that keeps you guessing until the end. There's quite a bit of backstory to the cast of characters. I thought the former robbers would come and collect at the end, but not to be.I sometimes get Bill Pullman and Jeff Daniels mixed up. Anyway, Bill's son Lewis has a key role at the El Royale.",Bad Times at the El Royale
15,christopher-underwood,a late great showing from Jeff Bridges,8,8 November 2020,"For the most part this is a really good, if not excellent film, with a fantastic central performance from Jeff Bridges, ably supported with an equally compelling performance from Londoner Cynthia Erivo who I recently saw in Stephen King's The Outside TV series. beautifully shot and confidently and surely constructed to have us spellbound but not fully aware of just what is going on. Is it the hotel that is weird or just the people? Jon Hamm is great in the early stages and looked a bit like a young Robert de Niro. Things really only go wrong, for me, in the last half hour. The film is certainly some fifteen minutes too long and there is simply too much time allowed for Chris Hemsworth to unconvincingly develop his character and similarly with Lewis Pullman who had been great as the hapless bellboy cum hotel manager but with whom we spend a little too long in the end. Disappointing end or not this is well worth a watch and always going to be worth it for a late great showing from Jeff Bridges, and those 60s songs where even just a line or two can be surprisingly effective, indeed it is 'strange how potent cheap music is.'",Bad Times at the El Royale

Great acting, never knowing what to expect, twists and turns. It did miss something, though. It was very difficult to empathize with any of the characters other than the main two (which I am not going to spoil).

And the film seems to have strange happenings occur. The story is good as 7 strangers stay at an old hotel right on the Nevada and California state lines and the place has a past, it seems so odd as secrets of each character come out. The chemistry and acting is all star from the cast which includes Jon Hamm, Chris Hemsworth, Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, and newcomers Cailee Spaeny and Cynthia Erivo.Bridges's character shines as an apparent ex father of faith and Cynthia Erivo lights it up as 1960's lounge singer Darlene as her voice has her ready for stardom. Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny are two mixed messed up sisters Emily and Ruth with messed up past.Thru it all the film has plenty of drama, suspense, secrets revealed, guns, blood, action, fights, people tied up and gagged now you name it, really this is some wild wicked crazy stuff to expect when strangers get together!",Bad Times at the El Royale

19,Lejink,"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...",6,8 September 2019,"My stepson, a modern film buff, knowing I love film noir, recommended I watch this recent example of neo-noir and got myself more up to date, so his mother (my wife, obviously) and I sat down to watch it. Well, my wife gave up on it halfway through which is its own criticism of the movie but I persevered and got to the end.
Yes it is long and slow and very stylised, although it certainly rouses itself for a fiery and bloody finish. It's also unnecessarily clever-clever and overdoes the cinematic referencing with for example pointless title cards inserted throughout I presume for some unknown thematic reason. I liked the prismatic, multiple viewpoint handling of time at the start and the slow reveal of the characters, with one held back until towards the end of the film.
The director sets up some wonderful tableaux to peruse, from the recreation of the late 1960's sleazy, faded hotel which gives the film its name, with its red neon light infusing countless scenes, the thunderstorm outside acting as a deterrent to anyone attempting escape and the pyrotechnic finale. The characters are a deliberately odd mixture of a psychologically disturbed hippy-chick and her murderously protective sister, an FBI agent masquerading as a redneck salesman, a fake, forgetful priest, a struggling female R and B singer, the troubled hotel attendant apparently on duty alone and a Manson-type charismatic shaman who gets his just desserts by the end.
Yes, the editing could have been tightened, the direction less indulgent and overthought and the characters less like cardboard cut-outs in a game of Cluedo, all of which might have helped better my wife's enjoyment. Me, I additionally didn't care for Cynthia Erivo's too frequent unaccompanied singing of the so-hip-it-hurts soundtrack but the ensemble acting was generally first rate especially by Jeff Bridges and Lewis Pullman.
New-noir could still learn a thing or two from old-noir I reckon in terms of pacing and character development but there was still enough here to make me curious to seek out other examples of the genre.",Bad Times at the El Royale
20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A worthy effort, but a little too over indulgent for its own good",7,11 February 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning1969. Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges), and Motown singer Darleene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) are two new arrivals at the El Royale motel, a cool, funky new joint in the middle of the desert. Unbeknownst to them, there is a secret underground chamber where the guests can be spied on, and guilt ridden employee Lewis (Miles Miller) has seen them in private. Meanwhile, Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) and her younger sister Rose (Cailee Spaney) have escaped from the clutches on cult leader Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth), who's determined to come after them. However, everyone may not be who they say they are, and there's a small fortune hidden from sight.In a time when everything's pretty bland and uninspired, it certainly takes you by surprise at least, when something comes along that's at the very least a little different, and looks like it might give you something you haven't seen before. Newbie director Drew Goddard certainly assaults your senses, from the dazzling, colourful poster, to the experience itself. Heavily influenced by Tarantino, in terms of the writing, dialogue and delivery, it's an inspired, clever idea with a fair deal of potential, that is sadly a bit too lengthy and over-indulgent, and doesn't have a strong enough central plot to sustain it that long.Crucially, it fails to draw you in at the beginning, and in a film stretching at just under two and a half hours, that's a problem. Even if it does perk up a bit a little further in, and starts to formulate into a more structured and dynamic story, it's hard to retrieve your attention. It's unnecessarily drawn out, crammed with sub-plots and red herrings, many of which could have been edited. A few of them are even forgotten about, without any satisfactory resolution, which just shows how much Goddard got carried away with himself.It certainly boasts an all-star cast, with a host of hot young and old faces, from Bridges to Hemsworth, all of whom reliably deliver their roles with as much conviction as they can, as well as a cool, funky 60s soundtrack to sail it along, all revolving around the familiar set-up of a group of strangers meeting at a remote motel. If only Goddard could have put them all together in something a bit more condensed, restrained and, ultimately, effective. ***",Bad Times at the El Royale
21,MOscarbradley,Highly imaginative and hugely enjoyable.,8,11 November 2019,"At 141 minutes it's certainly on the long side and it's not perfect, (mucking about with the time spans and juggling several plots it sometimes feels clever just for the sake of being clever), but nevertheless Drew Goddard's ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is still hugely imaginative and really good fun, something most movies just aren't these days. The plot or plots may stretch credulity but a terrific cast, (Cynthia Erivo, Chris Hemsworth and Lewis Pullman have the best of it), and Goddard's imagination, (he both wrote and directed it), carry the day and despite its length it moves with the speed of a rollercoaster, pulling a few genuine surprises along the way.

22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"There are no bad times at the El Royale, just a compelling, character-driven story.",7,15 October 2018,"'Bad Times At The El Royale (2018)' is certainly unpredictable, with many of its many surprises (both micro and macro) being genuinely surprising (even, to an extent, if they were unfortunately spoiled in the trailer). It's also constantly entertaining, a stylish thriller that intertwines multiple well-realised characters to essentially see what happens when their individual baggage soon becomes everyone else's. It never feels like it is, in itself, pulling the strings to get things to play out a certain way, rather that all of its events stem from the characters and the way they interact with one another. There is, on occasion, a sense that certain beats are perhaps unsatisfying but this is usually due to the fact that events don't go down the way you'd expect, for better or for worse. This means that the moments that might 'tie things together' in another picture simply aren't here and that, I feel, is actually a strength, something that sets this apart from the others in its genre. It means that the film relies solely on the stuff it sets up early on, mainly its core characters, to provide the twists, turns and general enjoyment as opposed to anything that could seem artificial or forced. Though the antagonist does feel much more like a archetype than the other players, in that he's clearly identifiable as an antagonist, I don't that his appearance derails the film, as some people have suggested. It also doesn't break the character focus of the flick, even if his characterisation is the weakest. In the end, the piece takes its time to relish in its in-the-moment shocks and simultaneous story-telling style but it never comes close to being indulgent. Instead, it's a compelling and enjoyable thrill-ride that'll keep you guessing and, more importantly, caring. 7/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
23,ThomasDrufke,Consistently Entertaining Homage to Tarantino,7,21 October 2018,"If there's one thing I can undeniably say about Bad Times is that it always had me guessing. There's not a single moment where I had the plot under my control. I never truly knew where director Drew Goddard was going to take this story. Was it going to take its Tarantino roots literally and have a bloody and twist filled third act? Or would it go its own route? It's more of the former, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The performances of the entire cast are fun and characters are constantly changing motives, or at least our perceptions of their motives change. It all leads to a climax that plays both eery and disturbing, but entertaining all the same.7.6/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
24,lesleyharris30,"Thrilling and Fun,",8,4 June 2019,"Bad Times at the El Royale is a smashing, riveting thriller that is both unique as well as delivering on its potential to a reasonable extent, it certainly had me invested from beginning to end, and its long runtime was no concern to me as I was frequently invested in these characters, wanting to learn more about each of them.There are great performances all around, including some impressive turns of typecast from the likes of Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson and Chris Hemsworth, as well as some very impressive acting from lesser known stars such as Lewis Pullman and Cynthia Erivo, whose relationship with Bridges was certainly the film's highlight for me.The movie suffers mostly from its ending, if I am being honest, and that's where the final rating stumbles for me, as it never truly delivers the anarchy or mania that it seems to be promising from its bonkers execution. I was very underwhelmed when the credits came up and, despite its length, still felt like I was only getting half a movie.An intriguing story and brilliant characters. Great fun from beginning to end, I would recommend Bad Times at the El Royale to anyone looking for a good thriller.

25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,6 January 2019,"Bad Times at the El RoyaleThe best thing about living on the Nevada/California border is that after sinning you can go straight to rehab.Mind you, the hotel guests in this thriller tend to favour the immoral side of the boundary marker.A priest (Jeff Bridges), a singer (Cynthia Erivo) and a salesman (Jon Hamm) walk into the lobby of a hotel that rests on the border between the two states and check-in with their baggage. The trio is later joined by a kidnapper (Dakota Johnson) and a cult leader (Chris Hemsworth). Each visitor has a secret they're running from or towards. And it comes to a head one-night at the El Royale.While the multiple narratives are somewhat engaging, the assortment of oddball characters intriguing and the direction stylish, the overall production falls short thanks to its laborious pacing and less than snappy dialogue.Moreover, the only conversation hotel guests ever have together concerns the location of the ice machine.

Yes, it's a knock off of a familiar script of robbery goes wrong; perpetrators spend time; get out & search for hidden loot. Except that there were lots of twists & subplots to keep the attentive guessing at outcomes. One subplot represents the traumatic changes as the '60s progress from innocent romance to tumultuous discord.First off the set was amazing - basically built an entire hotel/motel complex in post deco style in/on one cavernous stage. You have the soundtracks of that time to give you plot hints, and the actual live singing by Erivo was ""Voice"" finalist quality. Can't leave out deco jukebox situated right on the state border line of CA & NV which runs straight through the center of the hotel. Pay attention to the clock - it's in synch w/storyline.
The color schemes, lighting, and especially props for each state's side were meticulously spot on. Ex: Fonts & graphics in a map of the El Royale complex, so real. Kudos to the intelligent dialogue & the actors for pulling it off. A bit of violence which, for the most part, did not follow typical formula movie expectations.",Bad Times at the El Royale

29,The-Sarkologist,A Tarantinoesque Mystery,8,12 October 2018,"From the tailer, and I must say that the trailer was annoying since it did reveal one of the major twists in the film, is that it looked at lot like a Quentin Tarrantino film. In fact it looked so much like a Quentin Tarrantino film that I had to look at the page multiple times just to check to see whether it was or not. Well, it turns out that it isn't, but it is pretty clear that this film has been heavily influenced by the works of Tarrantino.
 Basically, the film is set entirely at this hotel that happens to be on the border of Nevada and California. The hotel has certainly seen better days, but today, four people arrive at the hotel looking for rooms. Needless to say, the people that tend to end up here aren't really the type of people that you really want to be associating with, which is why the bellboy suggests that the priest look for another place to stay.
 The thing is that each of these people have their own reasons for turning up here, but you aren't quite sure what the reason is. As the film progresses, you basically are given flash backs for each of the characters, and thus it becomes more evident as to why they are here. Like your typical Tarrantino film, there are quite a lot of twists and turns, and there are quite a lot of things about these characters that aren't quite evident at first sight - especially the bellhop. In fact, I thought that the bellhop was the best character among them, particularly since what he was searching for - that is forgiveness. I guess this is one of the main reasons that the priest was such a major character.
 I guess that was the thing that really grabbed me about the film, because at first you see just a normal bellhop, and suspect that he is basically a minor character, but it turns out not to be the case. In fact, like your typical Tarrantino film, the characters that seem to dominate the film end up being minor characters, and the characters that you expect to be minor characters end up carrying the plot. In a way this is a place where people go to escape, to hide, and to hope that prying eyes don't reveal what they are really getting up to.
 The thing is that your sins will always find you out, which is the nature of this place. It becomes evident pretty quickly that this place is riddled with secret passages, bugs, and one way windows to mean that what you thought was a secret is actually being recorded for all the world to see - that is blackmail and extortion. The place seems to be out of the way, to be hidden from the world, yet in many cases it is impossible to hide. In fact, discovery is one of the main factors of this film. Whether it be from an external agency, or whether it being your own sin that is slowly eating you away, in the end one simply cannot hide from their sins, because they will always, in the end, be revealed to you.",Bad Times at the El Royale

33,cruise01,A thriller with a sense of style is fun but with a little slow burn.,7,13 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale (3.5 out of 5 stars).Bad Times at the El Royale is a slick neo-noir thriller that has a sense of style which has a variety cast ensemble, a mystery plot, and a sharp direction. Director Drew Goddard second film after the fun horror film The Cabin in the Woods which is one of the better movies were the plot changes and has plenty of twists. Now, I was hoping Bad Times at the El Royale was going to be something similar to his previous film with plenty of twist and turns and a plot that comes together in the end. However, the plot in this film does not have any big twist reveals like how the film was setting it up for it. It was a straightforward plot of several strangers all coming to the motel El Royale which is divided on the border of California/Nevada. The only thing is these several strangers all have a deep secret of their own which can cause a problem to each other. The plot is one of those things were it is best and fun to see it than read about it or watch any trailers. Basically, several strangers stay a night at the El Royale. Father Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who shows up seeking for a specific room after his contact has informed him about it ten years earlier. Darlene (Cynthia Erivo) a struggling singer, who rehearses in the room and hoping she can make it big in Reno. Emily (Dakota Johnson) a hippie style girl who is escaping from someone and has a kidnapped young girl Rose (Cailee Spaeny). Dwight (Jon Hamm) a vacuum salesman, who has a hidden agenda on why he is there and who is he seeking? And than there is a motel concierge Miles (Lewis Pullman) who has hidden corridors in the motel and knows a bit of secrets behind the motels history. Last, there is Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth) who is a cult leader. The first hour or so of the movie is a slow build up. Learn about every character and their backstory. Especially, the hidden corridors in the motel were every room has a secret window. I was hoping for a big twist in the end or for a bigger ending. But sadly, the film was quiet and smaller with the climax. The cast was great. Jon Hamm's character though was a little underused. And left some questions about his backstory. Compared to everyone else that gets a little story and why they are there. Chris Hemsworth's performance was amazing as a cult leader. The direction, cinematography work was sharp. And the music score that brings in some soundtrack from the 1960s was fun. It does feel like Drew Goddard's script tries to be like Quentin Tarantino's films with its over drawn dialogue in every scene and its slow build up. Which was also the problem with the movie is it does get slow with the pace before any thing happens. Overall, Bad Times at the El Royale is a pretty fair film. Great cast. Great mystery of a plot. Which should have been a little more and fun. Sharp direction and concept. It does get slow with its prolonged dialogue. For a 2 and a half hour movie, you can definitely feel the slow moving pace.",Bad Times at the El Royale
34,Floated2,Strong build up but doesn't quite deliver,6,19 June 2019,"Having heard much praise about this film following its release and since it didn't do well at the box office, it has been labeled as ""underrated"" and a ""hidden gem"".The film starts off interesting and quite different and engaging, when we get introduced to the characters. We expect things to get crazy and unexpected but most that happened was quite predictable and tame. Of course once a character does get killed, things start to get out of hand and we see the other characters panicking and the mystery does start but the film never quite delivers greatness.Once Chris Hemsworth's character enters with his own title card scene, the film slows and drags down. A decent performance but the film does downhill from here.The final 20 minutes weren't that great either, and we were left with a disappointing and predictable ending, with a typical gun fight showdown type ending killing all but two of the lead characters. Was expecting some major twists and turns.Bad Times isn't a great movie or a bad movie but given its hype, it was somewhat disappointing and expected a better finish.",Bad Times at the El Royale
35,eddie_baggins,The destination isn't worth the journey,6,15 October 2018,"There's a lot to like about Bad Times at the El Royale, the type of dialogue heavy and stylistically star-stuffed film that would've been right at home in the mid-90s, but despite so much good, this overlong and strangely forgettable film feels like it could've been a whole lot more.The first film from Drew Goddard since his cult hit Cabin in the Woods from 2012, El Royale sees the talented writer and director indulge his cinematic desires with an A-list cast (that features a breakout Cynthia Erivo performance) and a loaded story, that brings together seven mysterious strangers who find themselves in a spot of bother one cold and stormy night at the El Royale hotel that sits smack bang in the middle of the Californian and Nevada border.It's a fantastic setting and set-up for a film and the utilization of the hotel and the eye capturing sets designed by the production crew are top notch, as is Goddard's skilful direction that maximizes a number of long takes to showcase the surrounds and hidden secrets of the establishment, yet despite this and a great opening half, El Royale begins to quickly lose steam as we begin to understand the true nature and destination of our journey.As is the case with these type of ensemble film's, that are filled with colorful characters and multiple story strands, El Royale throws a lot into its two and a half hour runtime but after Goddard explores each character and what's bought each of them to this time and place, it begins to become harder to care as Goddard's self-indulgence (there's far too much time spent on Erivo's Darlene Sweet singing and shots of records being spun on a jukebox) begins to take hold.A solid thirty minutes could've been cut from the film and it would've suffered very little, its arguable that perhaps the film would've even flowed far more fluidly and even though Goddard's cast are largely on song, it doesn't make the film anymore involving outside of its stylistic flourishes and splattering's of standout individual scenes.Of the cast, young Lewis Pullman is the biggest surprise of the lot with his mild mannered hotel concierge Miles Miller a genuinely nice addition to a loaded cast, of which Chris Hemsworth comes out of worse for wear as cult leader Billy Lee, a by the numbers villain that arrives late and makes very little impact, giving the film a rather so-so finale considering what had arrived before.Final Say -Outside of the initial hook and ripping set-up, Bad Times at the El Royale is a fine but unremarkable experience, victim of a director drawing things out too long for a story that doesn't say or do anything of real substance and isn't as smart as it perhaps thinks it is.3 wolves out of 5",Bad Times at the El Royale
36,leonblackwood,"Promising, but failed to deliver! 4/10",4,26 May 2019,"Review:
This is yet another movie which had a brilliant concept and a great cast but failed to at the last hurdle. I really enjoyed the first half an hour of the film, were a Catholic priest Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a singer Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Sweet), a salesman Leramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm), and a hippie Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) arrive at the El Royale at the California-Nevada border, but the director seemed to have lost it after that. When it's revealed that Leramie is really an FBI Agent, sent to remove FBI surveillance equipment from the honeymoon suite, I found the plot intriguing, and I really couldn't see where it was going, especially when he found additional surveillance equipment of unknown origin. He also discovers a secret corridor from which guest's rooms can be observed via two-way mirrors and filmed via a 16mm camera setup, so the plot could have gone down many avenues, to make this movie special. Once Jon Hamm is taken out of the picture, the film goes drastically downhill, and the long singing scenes, along with the weird appearance of cult leader Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth), really let the movie down. His lecherous and sadistic, but charismatic demeanour didn't really work for me, and I couldn't get to grips with the way the concept switched direction from the beginning. I liked the storyline behind Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman), who played the hotel's only remaining employee, and he put in a brilliant performance, alongside all of the A-listers in the cast. The director portrayed the 1969 time period well, and the attention to detail in the El Royale was quite impressive, but the storyline became a bit of a miss towards the end, and the characters that were interesting, were dropping like flies. I did like when they showed a certain point of the film, from different angles, which must have been hard to shoot, but I personally think that each of the characters back stories could have made their own movie, hence why the film felt like a right mess. Anyway, Jeff Bridges put in his usual top performance, and although I didn't see the point of adding Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth) to the cast, I did think that he played it convincingly well. With so much going on at once, the ending was pretty poor, especially when the old vicar was beating a young a butch Billy Lee to a pulp, but I couldn't help rooting for Miles when he switched to a super sharp sniper. On paper, it must have looked unique, which is why so many top actors agreed to take on the project, but it really didn't have to be 141minutes long. On the plus side, the soundtrack was great, and the whole Tarantino ""noir"" approach, made the film different from other movies in this genre. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Drew Goddard, who also brought you the Cabin in the Woods, which also starred Chris Hemsworth. As this is only his second major release after 7 years, it might explain why he tried to cram in so much material in two and a half hours. He also earned an executive producer credit for the Martian and The Cloverfield Paradox, and he wrote the screenplay for Cloverfield, the Cabin in the Woods, World War Z, the Martian and the Daredevil series. Judging by his previous projects, this film was a step in a different direction for Drew Goddard, who must have been disappointed with the box office takings after all of his hard work by making the hotel from scratch. Personally, I think that it was a waste of a brilliant cast, and he wasted to much time on insignificant scenes, which didn't play a big part in the core of the plot. Although this movie didn't make a profit, he still has been chosen to direct X-Force with Deadpool and Cable, which is in production at the moment, so I hope that he has learnt from this experience, and taken into account why this movie didn't go down too well with audiences.Budget: $32million
Worldwide Gross: $32million (Terrible!)Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller

Before comparing it to Tarantino style films pls watch Jean-Luc Godard's films.,10,23 December 2018,"The film starts with a man moving all the items of a hotel room in one corner, he then removes the carpet n the floorboards, stashes a bag underneath n puts back all the things in place.

Comparison to The Identity is present but please do not compare it to Tarantino style films jus cos it has a nonlinear approach.
Fellas who r comparing the nonlinear film style to Tarantino's films ain't aware of Jean-Luc Godard, the pioneer of nonlinear filmmaking.
Is it a coincidence that the surname of the director of this film too is Goddard.
Drew Goddard is in full Jean-Luc Godard-esque mood.
Attention is required as every person at the El Royale has a story n
the background story of all the characters were properly interwined.
Some of the scenes r way too slow n the editing needed some post production work.
Jus few days back i saw Chronicles of the Ghostly tribe n i wrote in its review that the flashbacks were confusing n not at all gripping but in El Royale the flashbacks were intriguing n not at all confusing.
The film is visually striking and offers a high level of ambience.
It has lots of eerie mood, good suspense, a great sense of dread throughout. The background story of one of the character which is shown towards the end is a bit shocking n well placed.

In true film noirs, there's not a guess or twist at every turn.Oh and then there are the flash backs used to explain the action. They are annoying.Picorially the movie resembles a David Lynch film. Sets are creative, acting is good, but the story becomes very boring about half way thru. There's also too many songs.At the end of the movie you feel empty.

40,southdavid,Mediocre Times At The El Royale,6,17 October 2018,"Less than the sum of its parts. ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" tells the story of four strangers who arrive at a motel that straddles the border between California and Nevada. Through interaction and flashbacks the we learn why the four characters, played by Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo, John Hamm and Jeff Bridges, have come to the El Royale and learn the dark secret of each, and the hotels own sordid history. I didn't dislike the film, that's probably the first thing to say about it. It opens with some sparky Coen brothers/Tarantino-esque dialogue and then begins to display its chapters in a style similar to ""Clerks"" or ""The Hateful Eight"". Given that the film is full of great actors (add Chris Hemsworth, Cailee Spaeny and Lewis Pullman to the ones mentioned above) their performances are generally engaging and entertaining. Some, but not all, of the subsequent scenes retain that zippy dialogue and the film slowly reveals its characters to both each other and the audience. The musical choices are also excellent. But, and it's a bit of a spoiler I guess - but I'll not be specific - the film is never really going anywhere particularly interesting. It's lacking in a final reveal or twist to make the journey worthwhile. Maybe if they'd kept Chris Hemsworth out of the film and the advertising altogether, until the last part of the film, it might have been better. It also never really makes much use of its location, despite making a big deal out of it. I kept assuming that the state boundary was going to play into the plot somehow, but it never does. It's also takes a long time to not go anywhere, and at times you can feel the two hour plus running time. I so loved ""Cabin In The Woods"" that I was hoping for something of that ilk, unfortunately though by no means irredeemably awful ""Bad Times"" is nowhere near.",Bad Times at the El Royale
41,imseeg,"Decently made, yet lacking in suspense and punch. They tried to make it look cool, but it just isnt comparable to any Tarantino flick, which it tries to copy miserably...",5,11 June 2019,"The story: a bag with money is buried underneath a hotelfloor. Lots of gangsters want to find the bag. A cat and mouse game ensues. Who will prevail?Everything is done DECENTLY in this movie. The acting, the settings, the soundtrack, the photograpy, one can really see that they tried to make a cool and suspenseful gangster movie. But it turned out to be way too much polished and neat and not cool at all. That flaw would perhaps not have been so problematic if they only had speeded up the story a bit.Half an hour could have been cut out of it with ease. But they did NOT speed anything up, on the contrary, this 2 and a half hour longwinding movie really becomes tedious to watch. Adding numerous flashbacks, which take out the speed of this story even more, doesnt help either.Conclusion: this is one of many Tarantino copies, which tries to look cool and smart, but fails at it. Still decent enough to not get irritated by it, but nowhere near suspenseful enough to keep me fascinated for 2 AND A HALF HOUR. 6 stars would be a better rating, but I downgrade it to 5 stars because I got bored.

42,Vartiainen,Mystery that gets nuttier and nuttier the longer they stay at the hotel,8,29 November 2018,"From the man behind Cabin in the Woods comes another style overdose extravaganza. This time the tale is about an old has-been hotel. It used to be the place to be a decade ago, but nowadays it sits mostly empty. Until one night when guests start pouring in. Some brought in by the foul weather, others with a more sinister purpose.I really enjoyed Cabin in the Woods for its style and its way to build a presence. And that is very much present here as well. Every single shot, every single frame of film is well-thought-out, meticulous and oozing with character. This is one of those films where you definitely notice the framing and all the cool tricks of the trade, but in a good way. The film pulls you in and delivers a gut punch when you least expect it.The characters are also a ton of fun. Each one is given a detailed backstory and their own segment, dedicated solely to them. And I guess that's behind some of the critiques that claim that the film is slow to get started. But really, can the film be called slow if you're never bored by it?That being said, if I had to name a flaw in the film, I'd say that the final act was not as tightly written as the rest. Chris Hemsworth as the antagonist never felt truly menacing to me and the scenes dragged just a little bit.Still, this is a fantastic film to check out if you're looking for something with flair and style to spare.

43,jtindahouse,A quirky but possibly forgettable film,7,8 March 2019,"'Bad Times at the El Royale' is a very serious film. It doesn't necessarily take itself overly seriously (although it might - it's hard to tell at times) but the content itself is very hard-hitting and severe. I think I expected more of a dark comedy going in, but this film makes no efforts whatsoever to make you laugh. It's unquestionably heavily inspired by Tarantino's work, but it lacks one thing that always makes his films shine - the dialogue isn't as edgy and interesting as it always is in his films. While the non-linear story-telling, quirky scenes and flashbacks are right up his alley, the dialogue sadly can't match it. To be fair though, very few in the business can match dialogue with Tarantino.This is quite a long movie at 141 minutes for a single-setting film. It's a patient movie in that sense. It never feels like the director was rushed or forced to edit or cut scenes he didn''t want to. This is a director's cut from start to finish. All the characters are a lot of fun too and the great cast helps with that a lot obviously. This helps a lot to prevent the film from becoming tedious and ever feeling over-long.There's ultimately not a lot of depth behind this film and for that reason I suspect people may find it slightly forgettable. There's nothing thought-provoking about it that will have you thinking after you leave the cinema. Still though, I had a fun time with it and would recommend it to most types of people.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It does have a good late 1960's setting, and the hotel becomes a character in it's own right.

45,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,10 June 2019,"Ok, Wow, I don't think I've seen a movie like that since the 90s. Some have gotten close, but this one absolutely stinks of clever 90s independent film......at least in that era where studios were putting serious bank behind indie films in an effort to score awards and produce something new that audiences would eat up.The wow sort of starts with the soundtrack, which is brilliant found music that not only fits the era, but fits the film like a globe.The casting is perfect, with a special shout out to Cynthia Erivo who sold her role as an R&B singer as if, well, she is one, but the delivery was absolutely brilliant on her end, despite the fact that she is one in real life. I guess it's where basically playing yourself pays off in spades.She was brilliant, but then, so was absolutely everyone else.And this is all put together with a plot that twists and turns and situations that just move from bad to worse in the best possible Hollywood way.It's a movie you have to see.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The writing's not bad, the setting (a motel) is fertile ground for ne'er do well behavior, but some the performances are lacking. I feel like Johnson and Hemsworth were both miscast (c'mon, Thor as a cult leader?), but Bridges and Erivo were aces. Aces, I tell you. Some nice little twists, plenty of action.

47,stevendbeard,One Heck Of A Night,8,13 October 2018,"I saw ""Bad Times at the El Royale"", starring Jeff Bridges-Kingsman:The Golden Circle, The Men Who Stare at Goats; Cynthia Erivo-this is her first movie, although she has been in a few tv shows; Jon Hamm-Tag, Baby Driver; Dakota Johnson-The Fifty Shades movies, The Social Network and Chris Hemsworth-The Thor & Avengers movies, The Cabin in the Woods.
This is a mystery ensemble about a group of strangers with secrets, that all meet up at the El Royale motel in Lake Tahoe for one heck of a night. It takes place around the 1960's-it has some good music-and the El Royale is located right on the border of California and Nevada so that half of the motel is in each state. The run down motel doesn't have much business now days but it does have it's own dark past full of secrets. Jeff plays a priest looking for something, Jon a vacuum salesman, Cynthia a singer on her way to a job, and Dakota, well, she is on the run from Chris, who is the leader of a cult. It's directed by Drew Goddard, who also directed The Cabin in the Woods-which also had Chris Hemsworth in the cast. All the actors are good but Chris really shines as a Negan styled villain and Cynthia-whom I've never seen or heard of before-is someone to watch, both as an actor and a singer.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug content and sexual content-including brief nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Not that it is forgettable in the familiar sense, it just requires several viewings to to really get the whole thing but each viewing will be captivating.The still, warm tone of the hotel's interior provides an eerie and rich setting of unlikely alliances and distrust, losing nothing for the many flashbacks.With a calm, slow burning power, this picture takes the time it needs and no more.

51,alindsay-al,A good Stylish film,7,15 October 2018,"This film has a pretty big a list cast in it so I gave this film a watch and there is a lot of good things about this film though it falls short of being a truly great film. The premise of the film sees 7 people converge on the El Royale Hotel with their own secrets and agendas. Jeff Bridges is the main character in this film and is also probably the most interesting character in this film, he delivers a quality performance like you would expect from him. Cynthia Ervio is most definitely the surprise performance in the film as she does a great job, her singing is extremely moving and beautiful and really adds something to this film. Jon Hamm and Chris Hemsworth are in this film and do really good jobs, Hemsworth owns the scenes he is in and adds something fresh into the last act. Dakota Johnson is in the film and she does a decent job in the film though she doesn't really stand out. The story has some real intrigue to it as you try and piece together what is exactly going on, however, this film's plot is very convoluted and feels like it is this way just to show how smart it could be. There are certain things in this film that aren't really explained as this film crams so much into it. The script has some decent heart felt moments in it that helps build the characters in this film, but the humor is attempted and just doesn't really work at all. The style is clear to see as the time period is very flashy and the way the film is structured is very reminiscent of a tarantino film just without the polish that he had. The film drags quite a bit and feels really long which hurts the overall quality of the film. Overall this is a decent film that deserves a watch but probably won't be a particularly remembered film.",Bad Times at the El Royale

I didn't expect such a clever film that feels like a classic on the first viewing; or on the second viewing that you immediately want to take in. It is hyperviolent, pulpy and utterly engrossing. The way the stories interlock is really fun and best of all the film kept me guessing about the final resolutions. I love the details of the film, whether it is the way each character gets a flashback at just the right time or the retro look of the el Royale everything is just perfectly placed.Obviously, the acting is quite good. To me the real stand out was Pullman. His Miles is delightful mix of Norman Bates and Peter Parker. Pullman is asked to anchor the film emotionally and he carries the critical scene with grace and strength. But all of the cast is quite good in this.Great Thriller.",Bad Times at the El Royale

55,kirbylee70-599-526179,SOLID STORYTELLING,9,17 January 2019,"When a movie can combine different stories into one singular tale it can either result in a mish mashed mess or an intricate story that pulls the viewer in. Fortunately BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE falls into the second category.Taking place in 1969 a group of travelers find themselves staying at the El Royale hotel located literally on the state lines of California and Nevada, half in one state and half in the other. The group consists of four individuals. Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is on his way to see his brother in Oakland. Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) is a backup singer from a Motown group going out on her own and singing in Reno the next day. Laramie Sullivan (John Hamm) is an obnoxious and talkative vacuum salesman. And Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) is a less than friendly hippy on the road. The only person we find working at the hotel is Miles (Lewis Pullman).But all is not as it seems. Each of these characters has their own secrets they want to hide. What follows is a breakdown by room number of each of the characters. We begin with Sullivan who turns out to be an FBI agent sent in to debug a room set up previously. He discovers not just the bugs the FBI placed but more placed by someone else. In addition to that he discovers a secret pathway behind each room allowing each occupant to be observed and filmed. His walk through the pathway provides insight into each of the other characters.The Father is tearing up the floors on the room he is in, no doubt in reference to the prologue of the film where a man buried a bag in his room before being killed. Darlene is rehearsing and this is where we discover she is a singer. And when he gets to Emily's room he finds her carrying in an unconscious kidnap victim and tying her to a chair. He immediately calls the home office and is told to carry out his mission, to collect all evidence, prevent anyone from leaving until then and not to involve himself in the kidnapping.Which is where we learn more of Emily's story. The victim turns out to be her sister. Both had been abused when young, run away and fallen under the spell of a charismatic Manson like cult leader named Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth). The ""kidnapping"" was Emily trying to save her sister from Billy. And the cult has just begun their killing spree when she took her sister.The movie swerves back and forth between the present and brief past as each story unwinds. We move forward in one only to trip back a little and see what the other characters were doing while that story was told. Eventually they all combine to give us the complete picture but not before things take an altogether different twist. Billy and his group arrives and we learn their story. That tale brings everything to the climax of the film and it truly becomes a bad night at the El Royale.Most of this amounts to just half of the film. It sets the stage for what is to come, the culmination of the various stories that each of these characters brings to the hotel. It is a fascinating combination of tales presented in the most entertaining way. The dialogue here is snappy, crisp, clean, well-written and pulls you in to the story. No words are wasted and each one propels us forward.The acting is some of the best you'll see in some time. Every actor, not one or two, delivers here in the most amazing way possible. Each one brings life to their character and fills them out. These are not cardboard cutouts but complete individuals whose paths cross in the most unlikely way at the worst moment possible.The movie looks great too with a nice polish on sets and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey whose made movies like GODZILLA and THE GREATEST SHOWMAN. He shines here. And while only having 5 films to his credit as director, including CABIN IN THE WOODS, director Drew Goddard pulls it all together to make for a movie I hadn't expected to enjoy as much as I did.A bit violent for the younger crowd my guess is that everyone else will enjoy this movie. It may be a bad night at the El Royale but it will be a good night for movie fans.",Bad Times at the El Royale
56,kluseba,Great times at your local cinema,9,29 November 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is one of the greatest Hollywood movies released this year. Set in a remote hotel on the California-Nevada border that has seen its best days decades earlier, the movie follows an intriguing set of characters that end up meeting there. We meet an aging Catholic priest who is suffering from an illness, a female black singer, a communicative salesman and a sarcastic young woman who are welcomed by a nervous receptionist. All these characters have secrets to hide and aren't exactly who they pretend to be. Things take a sinister turn when the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a mysterious blackmail organization and a murderous sect get involved. When extortion, kidnapping and murder take place, the remote hotel becomes the setting of an explosive showdown.Filmed in the key of Quentin Tarantino's movies, Bad Times at the El Royale starts with sluggish but atmospheric pace to introduce all relevant characters and locations. The film gets a grislier turn as more and more secrets about the characters and locations are gradually being revealed. The final thirty minutes are bloody, brutal and intense as the film ends on a particularly high note.The location of the rundown hotel is quite fascinating as it also reflects the characters whose days of former glory are long behind them. When a storm arises and the characters are stuck in the remote location, the movie gets a quite claustrophobic vibe. The film takes place in a shiny lobby, simple hotel rooms and a few secret locations that are quite surprising to say the least.The actresses and actors are particularly convincing and play their roles with empathy and precision. The audience quickly sympathizes with some characters and easily scorns others. The fates of the characters won't leave anyone unimpressed.Bad Times at the El Royale offers relentless action, unique characters, intense dialogues, stunning locations, dramatic moments, creative plot twists and uneasy tension in two and a half particularly entertaining hours. You should definitely watch it at your local movie theatre.",Bad Times at the El Royale

58,masonfisk,WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT 25 YEARS AGO...!,5,5 January 2020,"A past its prime endeavor from director Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) from last year. Remember that point in cinema history when everyone & their mother went to see Pulp Fiction & then got it into their heads they wanted to go home & make their own version of that lauded game changer. The conventional wisdom was the poor imitations started popping up around the time of Fiction's release but I guess Goddard got it into his head to sit on this screenplay & make it 25 years later which serves what purpose? The story revolves around a group of individuals holed up in a hotel where their stories intersect reaching a violent conclusion which ultimately I didn't invest any empathy or reaction to which stems from the tired story-lines & hackneyed characters & not from the filmmaking muscle being used. A fine cast which includes Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cynthia Erivo & Chris Hemsworth are thoroughly wasted but I'm not worried, Goddard has enough talent & wherewithal to do better next time.",Bad Times at the El Royale
59,peterp-450-298716,You like Tarantino? You'll definitely like this flick.,8,20 February 2019,"The El Royale is a bi-state establishment.
You have the option to stay in either the great state of California...
or the great state of Nevada.
Warmth and sunshine to the west...
or hope and opportunity to the east.
Which would you prefer?Let me get straight to the point. Yes, this film by Drew Goddard refers to several masterpieces from the past. And yes, it has the atmosphere, story structure and the look of a Quentin Tarantino film. You will probably read this on every movie site. Is this necessarily a bad thing? Does this mean Goddard doesn't have his own style? Is it necessary to compare a brilliant film such as ""Bad times at El Royale"" with Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre? Personally, I don't think so. When I get sucked into the story while watching this film, just like ""The Hateful Eight"" did with me, then this is a merit of Goddard himself. If a movie succeeds in keeping my eye fixed on the screen for more than 2 hours, then it's worth a compliment. And when one compares it with another grandmaster, I guess it's a compliment for both of them. I'm sure Tarantino will like this film as well.In any case, the location where the story takes place is in itself already original. A captivating motel/hotel built on the border between Nevada and California. You cross the border, as it were when you walk from the reception to the jukebox. And different laws are applied in every part of this unique hotel. But since a while, it's abandoned. Far away from other metropolises so consequently it's also cheaper. In earlier times though, the ""El Royale"" was a secret location where public figures stayed over for a night and where they could engage in rather appalling practices, far from civic life. This is where the entire story takes place. A story with different storylines with each time a character in a leading role who happens to looks quite ordinary at first acquaintance. As the film progresses, it turns out they all have their own hidden agenda. And all these storylines are entwined with each other until it finally ends in a rousing apotheosis.So, it's not a secluded cabin which is unreachable thanks to excessive snowfall (I know. I'm comparing again). And the pawns that are set out at the beginning (like in a game of Cluedo) are a priest (Jeff Bridges), a soul singer (Cynthia Erivo), a vacuum cleaner salesman (Jon Hamm), a rebellious young lady (Dakota Johnson), and a shy young receptionist (Lewis Pullman). A grab-bag of people who apparently happen to spend the same night in El Royale. After the introduction of the characters, the film is divided into episodes and a fragmentary web of storylines arises in which the dark secret of each character comes up. And before you know it, the vacuum cleaner dealer is someone who resembles a secret agent, the priest is looking for something more valuable than God's message, the rebellious lady is on the run from someone devilish and the receptionist has a past full of victims. Only the soul singer seems authentic and has a damn good voice.Maybe it sounds a bit vague. But believe me: the less you know, the better. I was surprised again and again by the various twists. And those twists sometimes come from an unexpected angle. It wasn't only the way of filming that pleased me, but also the subtlety with which it was all interwoven. Some story elements were shown from three viewpoints. Time and time again in a new storyline. Normally this could lead to confusion. But here it fits perfectly. And this all in a typical 60s setting with accompanying props, appropriate clothing and a Wurlitzer that produced that distinctive Motown sound. Take ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""The Hateful Eight"" and you get a movie like ""Bad times at El Royale"" after a good shake-up. Simply wonderful.Let's talk about the renditions. Actually, there is no character that disappointed. Each has his/her reasons for being there and has his/her own personality traits. It was clear from the beginning they were all enjoying themselves while playing their part. Once more the acting of Jeff Bridges as a priest was a joy to watch. Even though he talks as if he's nibbling on chewing tobacco or a hot potato as in ""R.I.P.D"" and ""Seventh Son"", I simply thought he was sublime as the priest with Alzheimer's. And certainly, the interactions between him and Cynthia Erivo are simply great. She also has a beautiful voice that came in handy in a specific splendid scene.Personally, I thought Lewis Pullman was the most imaginative character as the labile receptionist. And Dakota Johnson not only had the most titillating body contours, but she also took on the most insane part. And finally an honorable mention for the admirable performance by Chris Hemsworth (he's forgiven for his role as Kevin in ""Ghostbusters""). He's a cult leader who shows up as a dead calm Jim Morrison-like creep (Watch him dance). The beginning of an out of control denouement.""Bad times at the El Royale"" is definitely recommended and is not boring for a second. I thought it was an original tinkered story that ends in a shrewd way. Add to that a top cast and an atmospheric décor that is put in the picture with the help of masterful footage, and you can be sure that you'll enjoy the full two and a half hours. And claiming that the film is right up Tarantino's alley, certainly is true. But to assert that it's a shameless imitation, I find a little bit exaggerated and a typical sour note from a sourpuss.",Bad Times at the El Royale
60,dierregi,Stylized thriller,7,28 October 2018,"If you like stlylized settings, period-perfect costumes and decor and a decent thriller, you'd probably enjoy this movie.El Royale is a bi-state motel, set half in Nevada and half in California, both halves being equally sinister. After a gory introduction, the story really starts with a ""ten years later"".Enter Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo as suspicious customers, soon joined by Jon Hamm, in his Mad Men most genial mood and Lewis Pullman as the hapless receptionist/ jack-of-all-trades.Finally, Dakota Johnson makes her grand entrance as an obnoxious hippie and from then on, everything slides downhill very fast.In these times of politically correct and #MeToo, the female Afro-American stands out immediately: predictably, we discover a history of discrimination, which she faced with integrity and honesty - and therefore she is the most deserving and most likely to make it to the end. She is also a singer and after a while, the movie starts to look like a promotional clip for Ms. Erivo next album.I mean, there is A LOT of her singing that does not move the plot forward, but only adds minutes to an already long story. Interesting to note, Deep Purple's ""Hush"" is the only song used with negative vibes.... as if them being a band of white boys sort of deserved it.The climax of the story is reached with the appearance of a mostly shirtless Hemsworth, which does not hurt the eye a bit - despite him being a hideous character (but you should have guessed it by now, being a white, young male ...)Half way through the plot turns into very predictable, but it still has some punchy moment (the Russian roulette, the receptionist dark secret....). I would not bother with any comparison with Tarantino, because this type of storyline has been done for years, way before he was even born, only with less gore and less PC.",Bad Times at the El Royale

For about the first hour, I really did, but by about the two-hour mark I was ready for the film to end, and by the time the credits rolled I found myself walking from the theater slightly disappointed. ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" was written and directed by Drew Goddard (""Cabin in the Woods""), a man whose work I've been largely split on, but whenever he hits the nail on the head, his stuff really works for me. This film started off great; there were lots of great twists and turns, memorable and diverse characters, and a mysterious premise. But as the film rolled on, and the character's secrets were unveiled, I found myself growing disenfranchised with the film. Goddard continuously hints at darker things happening, but he never really delivered what he promises. The movie felt like it was trying to emulate the overlapping storylines of ""Pulp Fiction"", and even some of the dialogue felt like it was Tarantino-esque, but Goddard never quite reaches the level of snappiness Tarantino infuses into his films.

64,davidmvining,"May need another viewing, but I enjoyed its mysteries the first time around",7,22 November 2019,"Drew Goddard went ambitious with his second feature film, but it's the kind of ambitious that could be accomplished without that much money. The narrative is sprawling, but the physical scope of the action is actually quite contained in that eponymous hotel on the California and Nevada state line.There's a lot going on in the film, but after only a single viewing I'm a little unsure of how cohesive everything under the surface is. I'm not convinced one way or the next whether it's a mess or a masked work of great talent (could be both), and it will require at least another viewing to really get a handle on that opinion. That's a problem with walking into something like this with no idea what's going to happen. The movie goes at you sideways almost from the beginning, and it's hard to settle yourself in for the ride because the movie is constantly throwing you curve balls.Four guests show up at the nearly abandoned El Royal hotel at the same time. There's a young black woman, an old priest, a vacuum salesman, and an angry hippie chick. The one employee, who acts in every roll but manages to do few of them well, is a bit overwhelmed by the influx of customers and disappears for long stretches of time. As the guests go to their separate rooms, we begin to see bits of their backstory and no one is who they seem to be. The black woman has the look of a housewife or maid, but she's a singer going to Reno for a paying gig. The old priest is actually an old thief looking for the loot his brother left behind in the hotel. The salesman is an FBI agent and has a direct line to J. Edgar Hoover. The hippie chick has her sister kidnapped in her trunk and tries to begin to deprogram her from some mind washing.These six characters go against each other in different ways in separated chapters (that evoke Tarantino almost explicitly) until a seventh character shows up late, Billy Lee, a Charles Manson type cult leader.Through all of this action are some subtexts that keep weaving in and out of the narrative. The hotelier is a lapsed Catholic and is obviously fighting demons, begging the priest for forgiveness. Billy Lee leads a talk about how there is no good or evil, or if there is the point is to not play (I'm surprised there wasn't a reference to Nietzsche from him, to be honest). The singer refused to play the big label game in order to get a contract and made her choice to play a small place in Reno instead. The hippie chick is trying to force a choice on her sister. I can see ways that these connect, but it's all under the surface to such a degree that, on a single viewing, it's hard to dig out meaning in significant enough chunks to satisfy my intellectual curiosity.On top of that, though, is a movie built on mysteries. Since no one is who they seem to be, we, the audience, are constantly playing catch up. That can be both entertaining and frustrating, and the movie ends up working more towards the former than the latter. It's also flabby, not awfully so, but enough to cause distraction. The movie is 140 minutes long and probably would have worked better with a 10-15 trip just to tighten things up, especially in the second long section.In many ways, the movie really reminded me of The Hateful Eight. A group of strangers (seven instead of eight) show up at a remote hotel (haberdashery), lie to each other about who they are, and a bunch of them die in a nearly apocalyptic vision. It's not a mark against the movie, just a curious observation.",Bad Times at the El Royale

 -Lyrics from the Eagles' Hotel CaliforniaWelcome to the El Royale Hotel, a landmark structure that is centrally located on the state lines between California and Nevada and lost somewhere in its glory days of Rat Pack coolness and 60's glitz. The hotel has few guests now. A bright red line still divides its retro lobby as if daring anyone to cross it. And seven characters foolishly do just that, bringing along their own motives, secrets, and personal baggage. All will be slowly revealed in Drew Goddard's highly entertaining mystery thriller, Bad Times at the El Royale.The cast of characters, of course, never appears to be who they really are. It is a central part of this puzzler as their reasons are exposed and they begin to interact with each other. Miles (an engaging Lewis Pullman), the hotel's jumpy manager, has his perspective guests sign in. There's Father Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who may have more to confess than Darlene Sweet (a terrific Cynthia Erivo, making a memorable film debut). She plays a back-up singer looking for that big break. Also arriving is a foul-mouthed hippie with an arsenal of firearms named Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) and Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm), a brash vacuum cleaner salesman some peculiarities. Yet to come is Billy Lee, a seductive cult leader (sexy Chris Hemsworth, with his tight-fitting, low-hung jeans displaying his even tighter body abs) and his sect of non-peaceful followers, including a little psycho babe nicknamed Rose (Cailee Spaeny).The entire cast is wonderful and act the bejeezus out of their roles. Writer / director Goddard combines all of the action and suspense effortlessly, but it almost feels like a retread of a Quentin Tarantino film with lots of endless dialog and his trademark ""when strangers meet"" set-up, akin to his recent 2015 feature,The Hateful Eight. This highly derivative film is essentially a updated film noir western complete with a bloody shoot-out finale. Non-linear storytelling bounces from past to present to tell the characters's backstories. Sometimes this approach works very well; other times it undercuts the action. Goddard's homage to Mr. Tarantino even separates its segments into chapters with title cards and has some sudden violence thrown in to help build more tension in this one-set staged melodrama.Bad Times at the El Royale has a stylish look about it. Hamish Purdy's moody set design is nicely crafted, Seamus McGarvey's photography is sensational with its highly saturated colors and off-kilter composition, and the director wisely showcases Ms. Erivo's monumental vocal talents to provide the perfect atmosphere with a string of Motown tunes. What's not to enjoy with Bad Times at the El Royale!Mr. Goddard delivers quite a good time at the El Royale. Fine acting, great music, a nifty little mystery, and strong production values await.

Within time, chaos ensues between said strangers in the form of stabbings, shootings, privacy invasions, and kin kidnappings. There's a kind of Twin Peaks fantasy flavor going on here. Oh and did I mention there's also a shirtless cult murderer involved? That's the overlong blueprint of the decently acted yet look-at-me personified, Bad Times at the El Royale. Yup, it's my latest review.Starring the likes of Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, Lewis Pullman, and the slinky-strutting Chris Hemsworth, ""Bad Times"" equaled ""mixed"" times for me at the theater. I will say this though. The film gave me a new appreciation for The Mamas & the Papas ditty ""Twelve Thirty"" and of course, Deep Purple's ""Hush"".Bad Times at the El Royale with a running time of 142 minutes, could've been trimmed down by at least a half hour. It's a fire and brimstone flick that gives the year 1970 a reason to reach its equivocated ""Waterloo"". Basically, ""Bad Times"" is part Hateful Eight, part 1985's Clue, part Death Proof, and part Pulp Fiction (look for numerous title cards, some graphic violence, 1960's restaurant signage, and skewed timelines).Director Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) becomes an effective modus operandi behind the camera. He fashions ""Bad Times"" as scorched noir, with a 60's/70's Rat Pack look, a forced confrontational pull, and a scintillating jukebox soundtrack comprised of timeless oldies. It's a shame however that Drew's storytelling skills and screenplay are too thinly stretched out to encapsulate such a prolonged production.Bottom line: Bad Times at the El Royale is the ultimate exercise in style over substance or Tarantino mimicking over natural distinctiveness. It's a ""Royale"" with cheese that doesn't quite melt all its flavors. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Bad Times at the El Royale
69,justin-fencsak,If you like Pulp Fiction then you'll love this movie,8,2 March 2019,This movie is amazing. It's wholly original and takes pages from classic Quentin Tarantino cinema and adds an all star cast on a good budget. The soundtrack is classic and there's some slow spots that made me fall asleep but once the final act happened with a lot of action i was sucked in it!!! Worthy of a rental.,Bad Times at the El Royale
70,Easygoer10,At Least it's Not a Comic Book Source,6,9 June 2019,"Jeff Bridges turns 70 this year. I remember watching him on TV when I was very, very young on ""Sea Hunt"" with his dad (Lloyd). Much was filmed underwater, and there were many reruns. Needless to say, Mr. Bridges has had a long, distinguished career, and I truly love several of his films. In particular, John Carpenter's ""Starman"" (1984) with Karen Allen. It is a terrific romantic science fiction film. Also ""Fearless"" (1993) with Isabella Rossalini and Rosie Perez, and ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" (1989). I'm leaving out a many good films he's been in. Unfortunately, the past decade or so, most of his roles have been quite strange. His voice has changed, in an odd way. He reminds me of a ""seer""; plus he's been cast that way. Can we see Chris Hemsworth in a film where he doesn't take his shirt off? Yes, he's ""ripped"" and, I do believe in the old adage, ""If you've got it, flaunt it"". In much older films, it would be a woman, and get typecast into bimbo roles. Fortunately, he knows this, and has started dsterering away from some of those films. Still, I would like to see more of him in more cerebral roles, like Michael Mann's ""Blackhat""; although Mann ""disowned"" the theatrical version (I can see why; there are obvious plot holes). Sadly, you can't get the director's cut, which he screened in Austin (SXSW). In this film, I like the fact he's the antagonist, and plays it very well. It reminds me of Brad Pitt in ""Kalifornia"" (1993). An odd ball out here is Cynthia Erivo. Her character just doesn't fit her. Maybe it's just the film. Also, Dakota Johnson. Watching her holding a shotgun simply doesn't suit her. That entire ""50 Shades"" mess was so over-hyped and over-publicized. I can think of many actresses better suited for her role. I do like Jon Hamm a lot (a very underrated actor). The film starts quite well, but goes downhill, especially near the end. It loses any authenticism it had, which wasn't a whole lot to begin with. Overall, I gave it a ""6"", and I was being kind. It's worth a watch, but please note I was definitely not overwhelmed. I would never watch it more than once.",Bad Times at the El Royale
71,vengeance20,"Good, but dragged....!",6,26 October 2018,"Seen this on Tuesday & found it to be a pretty decent film. Only issue was it dragged.The film is about a hotel named the El Royale, it is split into 2 sections. Nevada & Carolina. The film is shot & filmed in the sort copy cat way a Quentin Tarantino film is filmed. It is filmed in different chapters with each other showing different perspectives of different characters as the chapters play, leading to the conclusion.I found the film (at first) to be pretty solid & cool. But as it got to the 1hr & 30-40 min mark, it fizzled out & got boring, so much so, my arse felt numb & I myself began to yawn out of tiresome. I mean it wasn't terrible what the lateral half had, but seriously, cut the crap when it comes to editing as the film went on for far too long at a staggering 2hrs & 16mins. I mean if it was like The Hateful Eight (2016), then fair do's. But for this, it seemed to go nowhere & the final part seemed a bit dull, well really dull & drop dead boring. in all brutal honesty. The final part seemed nothing in comparison to the 2hr wait we (the audience) suffered. I'm just saying. Honestly.Overall the film was good, but it could've easily been 40 mins shorter than it actually was.6/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
72,elliotjeory,Incoherent mess,2,27 October 2019,I knew in the first 5 minutes this was going to be a bad film. It's cringey and it's not worth watching. You cannot imitate Tarantino.,Bad Times at the El Royale
73,krocheav,Bad Times At The El Royale - Bad Anytime,3,8 August 2019,"This one gets you in with a nice Intro, look and feel, well, for about 30mins or so, but what follows just about defies description or deserves any credence. All the ingredients of today's consumer moviemaking are there IE; add a pinch of Cohen Bros, large dollops of Tarantino, and Scorsese, stir and watch the money roll in - but guess what, it didn't happen. Often when you see that a movie was produced, written and directed by the same person (Drew Goddard - with the family as associates) you would be right to feel uneasy - there have been the odd times when this can work well, but that's all too often rare. I doubt this mess would exist if the maker hadn't paid for it himself, still, he only stood to lose his own money (and did).Some good performances are wasted along with neat set decoration and stylish cinematography, while the viewer gets to be bludgeoned over the head with wall to wall violence, crude language, plus a ridiculous and rambling script (like 2hrs 21mins!). As for Aussie Chris Hemsworth, he gets to make a fool of himself with a hedonistic performance as a deranged Manson type killer in a loser of a movie (better think twice next time Chris) Those who enjoy seeing the same clichéd stories, and impossible characters rolled out in movie after movie, will find some sick enjoyment but most, as the box office returns show, will leave the room very disappointed.",Bad Times at the El Royale
74,martimusross,Dreary And Slow......Don't Bother!,3,1 November 2018,"Just not a good copy of a Tarantino movie, what was missing, firstly humour, totally absent from this slow paced dreary movie and secondly and most importantly motivation.In every Tarantino movie the narrative drive and dramatic impetus stems from the converging motivation of the protagonists. Here is was totally lacking, we didn't care what happened to the characters and the near torture scene at the end had no real reason for happening at all.This is, to my mind, a movie that should never have been made so just don't bother to go and watch it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
75,RNMorton,Really Awesome Tarentino Light,10,17 April 2020,"And believe me, it's fair to say that there are bad times ahead at the El Royale, a shadow of a once grand motel on the Nevada/California border. Several worlds collide one fateful day at the motel and we're off and running. I enjoyed the fact that the stories behind the characters were difficult, at best, to fathom. There are still a few characters and situations I don't understand, and I've seen it or most of it 3 or 4 (or more) times. Jeff Bridges in priestly garb and Cynthia Erivo are fantastic and drive the movie, as well as Lewis Pullman as the modest desk clerk with way more than he can handle. Originally I didn't like the extended Hemsworth Manson-esque story line, but I'm growing used to it. Not for everyone, but great for those who enjoy these quietly over-the-top type of flicks.",Bad Times at the El Royale
76,areatw,"A hollow, style-obsessed mess",3,3 November 2019,"'Bad Times at the El Royale' received rave reviews when it first came out and even though these have since calmed and the ratings aren't as high as they were, this is still one of the most overrated films of 2018. I thought 'Bad Times' was awful - an incoherent mess from start to finish that tries way too hard to be stylish and 'cool'. It's clear they were trying to replicate Tarantino's style, but the material isn't anywhere near strong enough for it to work.The problems start with the pacing, which is all over the place. The first half or so is painfully slow with next to nothing of significance happening. A lot of scenes could have just been cut out completely as they contribute nothing to the plot and only add stylistic value, which was obviously the director's main focus. I didn't like 'Bad Times' at all - a Tarantino rip-off and a bad one at that.",Bad Times at the El Royale
77,vithiet,Great mystery thriller that could have been excellent,8,27 January 2019,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Great plot, great characters, great writing and cinematography, talented cast giving awesome performances. Unfortunately because of the genre and the style, it's very hard to ignore the fact that it feels like a not-so-great-Tarantino movie. There are also a few moments that drag on a bit too long without adding much and disrupt the pacing.
That said, I still very much recommend it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
78,MadamWarden,OK but not quite there,6,13 February 2019,"In the style of the Coen Brothers but not up to their lofty standards. As much as I love Chris Hemsworth, I think he was miscast and definitely didn't hit the spot. Abs aren't enough.Jeff Bridges was great as was Cynthia Erivo and Jon Hamm. Sadly the script was slow and the music over emphasised and basically boring.Why a 6 star review? It kept me interested, if not enthralled. The sets, costumes and some characters were good but it ultimately was just Ok...",Bad Times at the El Royale

Aside from the really good directing, Drew Goddard did a phenomenal job on the screenplay ,, it was easily followable yet so mysterious and didn't spoil the element of unpredictability .As for the cast ,, i mean do i really need to say more !! Jeff Bridges with his facial expressions of ""i lost my memories"" and teary eyes, it was all satisfying, Jon Hamm did really good at the beginning of the movie i wanted him to stay a bit longer ,, Chris Hemsworth with his fanatic cult-y ideas :D did well too , the hotel boy ""Lewis Pullman"" at the end got a really good bunch of the script it was satisfying,.. Cynthia Erivo and Dakota Johnson and the whole cast did not disappoint.Before i end my review ,, not forgetting the soundtracks !! WOW ,, heightened the Drama/crime genre mix and made the movie top the expected suspense-.Again ,, the movie came out in September/October ,, and i'm a guy who follow and watches a lot of movies ,, but hearing about this movie accidentally makes me wonder !!

81,aciessi,A Good Time,7,1 September 2019,"Sooo.. people didn't like this movie? Why? I thought it was pretty good. In fact, with a healthy trim, there's a masterpiece located inside of Bad Times at the El Royale. Perhaps that's what's most frustrating to people. Sequences of amazing quality stick out in my head. The opening vignette, the AMAZING sequence with Jon Hamm inside the secret Hotel tunnel, the intense final act. Drew Goddard nearly made his masterpiece, and yet through over indulgence, that masterpiece is squandered. This film didn't need to be 2 and 1/2 hours to tell it's story. Plot wise, it's delightfully convoluted. This is Twin Peaks meets The Hateful Eight. Purposely, you begin to have trouble connecting the dots and figuring out what in God's name is happening at this hotel. You can pay as close attention as you can, or zone out. Either way, the atmosphere keeps you in there. The performances from all are pretty strong here too. You can tell Goddard wanted to make a strange little movie, with multiple nods to Quentin Tarantino. In fact, Tarantino seems to have like this homage to him, because he borrowed at least 3 songs from this movie to use in the amazing soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. You wouldn't think he'd be inspired by one of his copies, but then again, he'd totally do that.",Bad Times at the El Royale
82,rockman182,Bad Times at the El Royale (2018),8,13 October 2018,"October usually signifies the turning point of the year where we start gearing towards the memorable blockbusters and the academy darlings of the year. I really was excited to see Bad Times at the El Royale because the trailer does a job of not letting you know what to expect in the film but still showing you the type of adventure to expect. Also, please give me Dakota Johnson anytime (I dub this month her month with the highly anticipated Suspiria remake also coming out later this month).The film is set within hotel located smack in between the Nevada and California border. This hotel, called the El Royale, is the site where seven strangers come together for a night involving all types of debauchery and craziness. The inhabitants of the hotel all have secrets and are not who they seem. Its hard to go more in depth with the plot outline of the film without giving away key elements of the film. The film also has a wonderful cast including Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, and Chris Hemsworth.First thing I have to say is that there is never a dull moment at the El Royale. The hotel and locale looks wonderful, and seeing as how almost the entire movie takes place in the hotel it had to be alluring. The characters are all mysterious but that's what draws you into them. You don't see the twists and turns and character elements coming so the film keeps you going with its thrills. You really can't be ready for some of the fast action and twists that come with the film. Its filled with good performances as well.I am also super impressed with this incredibly original script, penned by Drew Goddard himself. Its got elements of everything and still there is a longing to know more that was not revealed. Not really surprised at how much I like this, the premise and trailers and cast did a wonderful time selling the film. Its a long film but surprisingly doesn't feel its length because of the sheer investment I had in it. I definitely recommend checking in for a night at the El Royale.8/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
83,gilgongo1980,Bad Movie at the El Royale,4,21 February 2020,"The story was nothing special or interesting, the story would be more suitable for a short film.

84,RforFilm,"Take the key and enjoy the stay. Bad Times at the El Royale is a fun, Tarantino-style thriller that't kept me engaged through the long runtime",9,22 October 2018,"In the age of 2018, many movies that promote nostalgia love to go back to the 1980's. It makes sense as the millennial generation are now in between their twenties and thirties, not to mention have their own families and try to expose what them happy as children, hoping that same joy will get the same reaction for their offspring. While I myself love material from the eighties, I don't consider myself raised by that era. I'll bet that there is a bigger crowd nostalgic for times they never lived through. I think we all dream of worlds we've never been to, and different time periods might as well be new worlds.In the case for Bad Times at the El Royale, not only does it remind me how different the world was from the sixties and seventies, but I realize that director Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods) has a lot of passion for the style within that era. In fact, the story seems to be about nostalgia from different angles. The hotel itself is from another era, several characters from other eras, and even the music represents a joy from a different era. It honestly all comes together in which only Bad Times at the El Royale could have.In 1970 near Lake Tahoe, several people stop at the El Royale motel. This place is famous for being in-between California and Nevada, giving people the option to stay in either side. It was also once a big hangout, but has fallen on hard times. Regardless, the people checking in include a traveling salesman Sullivan (played by Jon Hamm), a backup singer who dreams of going solo Darlene Sweet (played by Cynthia Erivo), catholic priest Daniel Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges) and a flower power hippie Emily (played by Dakota Johnson).All three go to their assigned rooms and the rest of the movie each focuses from their perspective. They all see that the hotel is a cool piece of nostalgia, but they also know that something odd is going on. They can't put their finger on it, but they go about their business. Things get crazier then a storm forces them to stay put and people seem to have their own motives, despite everyone saying their going to Reno. Things get crazier when they receive a visit from a Charles Mansion-like cult leader Billy Lee (played by Chris Hemsworth).What I love about this movie is that it understands what makes for a great story; great characters and their relationships. Drew Goddard has an eye for casting, because everyone here is great. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling it, but let's say that everyone of them has secrets and each of those secrets reacts to the other secrets before everything gets out of control. If I did have to pick my favorites, that goes to three; Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo and Chris Hemsworth. Again, I can't give it away, but the stories showcase why their all good actors.Bad Times at the El Royale takes a lot of the same tone and pacing from Tarantino. Goddard want to recreate the same feeling of character interaction and the more anarchic and random style of storytelling where actions have consequences and yet still come out like a orchestrated story. If there was something to separate this from other Tarantino films is this this seems more inclined to stick to a plot. Even when things turn, it still feels like were going forth from the same story that was started from.The movie is defiantly a long sit. Running at nearly two and a half hours, it does unfortunately suffer from pacing that can come off as too slow. It could have used maybe a ten-minute cut, but I was never board. It came close, but I was kept engaged through the majority of the movie. It just happens that the characters are so full and rich, that you could have made a side movie about each one and probably have been satisfied with all of them. It also helps that their all played by great actors.I'll give this nine motel keys out of ten. This is definitely going on my best of 2018 list of movies. Like a great nostalgia trip, I felt like I got transported to a new world that was real, but I could never visit. Bad Times at the El Royale is something that might be a bit long for some, but give it a chance and I think you'll be just as engaged as I was. Grab the key, watch the movie and enjoy the stay.",Bad Times at the El Royale
85,Holt344,"Written, produced and directed by Drew Goddard, a superb mystery and visually stunning film",10,30 April 2020,"Bad Times at the El Royale, a magnificent story and a visual masterpiece. Drew Goddard have written, directed and produced a great mystery film, with that said it isn't for everyone, it's special but in a good way. For me the pacing and length was perfect as it's a mystery film, we don't get the details immediately but we have to wait to get them and I like that. Instead of the usual pacing we got something unique and incredible. The set of El Royale is simply stunning, they created something amazing with the set design and the costume and prop department also did some splendid work. All that made it immersive and got me stuck into the world Drew Goddard had created and it's nice that people are able to these kind of movies, letting their artistic self get working. There's so many shots that are just amazing, beautiful to look at and the color tone and lightning helped out.The opening sequence was simply incredible, the cuts and montage like editing was so nice. I don't want to spoil anything else other than the opening sequence sets up the main story arc of the movie. The whole movie was incredible, each scene shot beautifully and acted superbly, thanks to the ensemble cast which has some big names and actors able to do the performances and give them justice. I can't name them all or what scenes, other than the script they worked with was superb and made them able to do Oscar worthy performances. Too bad this film didn't get any nominations or the attention, as it should.

86,carbuff,Tarantino-lite,6,27 October 2019,"""Bad Times at the El Royale"" will hold your attention throughout, but it's a pretty blatant rip-off of Tarantino's films, except that it pulls its punches too much and the verbiage isn't nearly as slick. The plot flips between being unpredictable and predictable. The sets, cinematography, and the production values make this film worth watching all by themselves--they're some of the best and most compelling I've seen, especially since I don't care for special effects for the sake of special effects. I prefer plot-driven movies with the appropriate mood, which is done brilliantly here. No spoilers, but it only got six stars because periodically it gets too sappy, a problem which gets worse near the end. Unfortunately, the editors didn't learn from Tarantino's better films how to keep the edge sharp from beginning to end. Still, this film, which is definitely trying too hard to be quirky, is still way better than most films out there. Even given it's playing time, I very much doubt you'll be tempted to hit fast forward, although you might want a second bag of popcorn.",Bad Times at the El Royale

88,bankofmarquis,"Check Into the El Royale, you'll be glad you did",8,6 February 2019,"BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE is a bloody movie about bloody people doing bloody things at a bloody hotel.It's also bloody good.Showing the same original style and panache that I have come to expect from Director/Writer Drew Goddard (THE CABIN IN THE WOODS), BAD TIMES...follows the storytelling device of a Quentin Tarantino flick like PULP FICTION or THE HATEFUL EIGHT in that it follows a seemingly disparate group of people - each with their own story - who's lives intersect.Goddard's reputation has, obviously, preceded him as on the surface this film looks like a ""B"" flick filled with gore and violence, but in Goddard's hands - and with some strong acting talent and VERY strong production qualities (the sets, costumes and music help tell the story), this film is elevated to something much more than a ""B"" flick.Jeff Bridges (HELL AND HIGH WATER) stars (at least in one storyline) as a mysterious Priest who shows up at the El Royale for some reason - and it's not to change the Bibles in the rooms. He is joined in the lobby at check-in by a lounge singer played by Cynthia Ervino (WIDOWS), vacuum cleaner salesman portrayed by John Hamm (BABY DRIVER) and by a mystery women played by Dakota Johnson (50 SHADES...) - all have secrets to hide and through flashbacks and chance encounters, their stories erupt on each other. And erupt they do when into the mix comes charismatic, mostly shirtless Cult Leader Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth) and his cult followers.Goddard orchestrates this group of strong actors well, giving each character/actor moments to shine and play off each other. The dialogue, while not at a Tarantino level, was interesting and intriguing as much as what was NOT said then what WAS said.But, make no mistake about it, this is an action movie - and action there is. Bodies, bullets and blood start flying as soon as these characters collide at the El Royale and bad times happen, for sure.But, for me, this was a GOOD TIME AT THE EL ROYALE. If you like Pulp Fiction, Baby Driver, Hell and High Water or John Wick, then you'll like this flick. Check in to the El Royale, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Bad Times at the El Royale
89,rzajac,"Stylistically interesting, but doesn't quite meet the ""genre challenge""",6,10 April 2020,"Interesting to watch. It was stylistically quite good, and not without even some pathos.But, in the end, doesn't quite vanquish what I call the ""genre challenge"".A genre has an implicit challenge. Bad Times is a ""crime flick"".The challenge of a crime flick is as follows: Compel me to care about the outcomes involving some criminals: Why should I care about them? They notoriously don't care about us: Why should I be interesting in what happens to them?There are various ways to meet this challenge. Think of Pulp Fiction or Miller's Crossing to get a bead on how that challenge can be met.You meet it by either (or both) achieving insights into criminality or(/and) by creating an arc with mythic dimensions.Bad Times aims to achieve that first goal, but to my thinking doesn't quite get there. I can't say that there was a profound mythic payload. It ends on a smaller-but-truly-touching redemptive stroke for the hotel clerk, and a larger picture of evolving trust and respect--eschewing the life of crime--for others (to stop short of outright spoiling, I think).Again: Stylistically, it's a sturdy flick. I wouldn't steer you away from it. But if you're looking for a crime flick that meets the challenge I mention, you might want to skip it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
90,joebloggscity,Smarter and more engaging than most current fare,7,10 November 2019,"I've got to give this one credit. It may not be a classic, but in this era of movie universes, franchises and box sets, we have here instead a good self contained story of characters in an intriguing setting.The story is kind of derivative, seems to pay tribute to certain classics in the field like Identity and Ten Little Indians. We have a motley crue of strangers arriving at the El Royale Hotel straddling over two states. Obviously they have dark secrets and it all goes to hell from there. We have a mock priest, a singer, an undercover FBI agent and a Mansonesque cult escappee (the film is based in the late sixties).Acting, direction and pacing is all excellent in this film noir, and I enjoyed. The problem is that the story backbone may have been good but just couldn't tie everything together. A difficult one. Maybe it's not as smart as it thinks it is, but in this age it's still intelligent.It's dark and enjoyable and I would very much recommend this one to everyone.",Bad Times at the El Royale
91,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Tarantinosic thriller with solid acting performances,9,14 January 2019,"Bad Times at the El Royale is a Tarantinosic thriller with fantastic acting performances by the entire cast. I watched this film without having seen the film trailer and so I had no preconceived opinions about the film. I did not have a clue about what kind of film it would be.What makes it this film Tarantinosic to me is that it borrows the directing style of Quentin Tarantino with a single timeline shown repeatedly from the POV of each of the main characters. All of the characters are well developed with their quirky particularity and motives. Each of these characters have their own personal backstories, but all find themselves together at a travel lodge located right on the borders of California and Nevada. Each character has a seemly unrelated story to the rest of the group, but as the film progresses, connections between each other begin to materialize with excellent suspense.Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) is a struggling singer trying to make ends meet with her vocal talents. She is hoping at a crack at stardom. She sings Motown hits for a living and her singing really adds to the 1960s ambiance of the film. I really loved her singing in this film. Her character's personality is really good at looking through the facade of the others and seeing people for who they really are.I was blown away by Jeff Bridges, Lewis Pullman, Cynthia Erivo, Chris Hemsworth, Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny performances. To have two or three great acting performances is too much to ask for sometimes, but all six of these actors just nailed their characters so well. Jeff Bridges did a really amazing performance of a character with dementia was too realistic.Chris Hemsworth did an amazing portrait of a hippie, Mansion like cult leader. I kept seeing Jim Morrison fluidity in him with his body movements. Damn, he is really good in this film.Lewis Pullman had me at the point of shedding tears for him at the end of the film. Throughout the whole film he looks like the most fragile and innocent of characters from the lot. But as we learn more about him, we learn he was once of the strongest characters that had so many heavy crosses to bear. In the face of certain death, he accepts his fate but looks for faithful redemption and forgiveness for his deeds.Dakota Johnson has surprised me twice this week. First in her character role in Suspiria (2018) and now in this film. I had written her off as a possible good actress prematurely because of her foray in 50 shades of grey films. But in these two past films, I was premature. She can really belt out good acting performances. I am really happy for her because I have been a fan of her father too.This is a must watch film if you like Tarantino's films. It has some violent scenes too, perhaps not as bloody and gory as Quentin Tarantino films, but it does have that same ambiance. I loved it.",Bad Times at the El Royale

93,allanmichael30,Help me father for i have sined help me father flynn,6,30 August 2019,This movie had lots of suspense and hidden stories that connect and great music soundtrack which was kind of like a quentin tarantino movies.

94,bob-the-movie-man,Why is everyone not raving about this movie?,10,27 October 2018,"Imagine a ménage à trois of Agatha Christie, Alfred Hitchcock and Quentin Tarantino at the Overlook Hotel with a banging 60's soundtrack. Got that unpleasant vision in your mind? Good! You're halfway there to getting the feel of ""Bad Times at the El Royale"". And they really are bad times!It's 1969 and an oddball set of characters arrive at the faded glory of the El Royale hotel at Lake Tahoe: ""a bi-state establishment"" straddling the Nevada/California border: so describes the manager-cum-bellhop-cum-bartender-cum-cleaner Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman, soon to appear as Maverick in the ""Top Gun"" sequel). The motley crew include Laramie Seymour Sullivan, a vacuum cleaner salesman (Jon Hamm); Father Daniel Flynn, an oddly-acting priest (Jeff Bridges); Darlene Sweet, a struggling Motown-style singer (Cynthia Erivo); and Emily Summerspring, a rude and abrupt hippy-chick with attitude (Dakota Johnson). But noone is quite who they seem and their twisted and convoluted lives combine in a memorable night of surprise and violence at the El Royale.This is a truly great ensemble cast. But out in front of the pack are the simply brilliant Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo, an actress new to me who has a great voice and made a big impression. Scenes between the pair are just electric. Jon Hamm is as quirkily great as ever and Dakota ""not Fanning"" Johnson is far better in this film than any recent stuff I've seen her in. Another standout was another newcomer to me - young Cailee Spaeny as Rose, looking for all the world in some scenes like a young Carey Mulligan. While we're on lookalikes, Lewis Pullman (best known to me for ""Battle of the Sexes"") looks very like Tom Holland in some scenes. One star name not yet mentioned is Chris Hemsworth. He actually does a great job in his demanding Messianic role of Billy Lee, but I just had trouble equating the ""Thor"" star as being ""all kinds of bad"": this felt like a slight misstep in the casting to me.I found this film to be just enormously entertaining. It is very Tarantino-esque in its claustrophobic nature (compare it with ""The Hateful 8"" in that respect) and with its quirky episodic flash cards (compare with ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Kill Bill"") but for me was much more appetising since - although very violent - it never stooped to the queasy ""blow your face off"" excesses of Tarantino, that I personally find distasteful. Where it apes Hitchcock is in its intricate plotting: the story regularly throws you off-balance with some genuinely surprising twists and turns that you never see coming. And the interesting time-splicing and flashbacks also keep you on your mental toes. To say any more or to give any examples would be a spoilerish crime, so I will refrain. This is a dish best served cold (so avoid the trailer if you can).The film has a marvellous sense of place and time and key to establishing that is some superb set design; some brilliant costumes; and - most of all - an exquisitely chosen song catalogue. The great Michael Giacchino is behind the music, and he does a truly fabulous job, not just with the song selection but also with the background music. This never seems to intrude noticeably until the end titles, when you realise it's been insistently working on you all the time: the best sort of soundtrack.There are some films that make you marvel how someone sat at a keyboard and got a screenplay down on paper so satisfyingly. While it could be accused of aping Tarantino somewhat, for me this is still one such film. The writer/director Drew Goddard has come from the J.J. Abrams stable of ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", and has previously written the great screenplays for films including ""Cloverfield"", ""The Martian"" and ""World War Z"". His only previous directorial feature was ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (which I've not seen), but after this he is definitely on my movie radar: his next film will be ""X-force"": a ""Deadpool 2"" follow-on with Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz, and I can't wait to see that.If there's a criticism it's that at 141 minutes its a tad long. It never to me felt like a film that long, such was the entertainment value, but while I just loved the development of character just a few of the scenes felt a little leisurely and superfluous. Trim 10 minutes off the running time - no more - and it might have felt tighter still.This film is without a doubt going to storm into my Top 10 for the year. It's an entertaining delight, full of twists, turns, deliciously wordy dialogue and a satisfyingly open ending. I can't believe this film hasn't been top billing in multiplexes up and down the country for WEEKS on end. If you get the chance, my advice would be to seek this out before it disappears.",Bad Times at the El Royale
95,ofpsmith,So glad I didn't spoil this for myself.,9,9 June 2019,"I love this movie. The characters, the setting, the style and aesthetic, the dialogue, the storylines that everyone has, I can barely find a bad thing about it. I highly encourage you to go in without knowing anything. I don't want to talk about the story that much because the twists and secrets to be unveiled are too many. I'll simply say that the actors are all amazing at bringing equally amazing characters to life. The only complaint I can think of (and the only one I've really heard) is that it goes on for too long and yeah, I'd be lying if I said I didn't know where that was coming from. But other than that, I have nothing else that I can think of that would detract in any way. Bad Times at the El Royale is absolutely exhilirating. If this is your first time seeing it then I envy you.",Bad Times at the El Royale
96,kjproulx,A Good Time at the Movies,9,17 October 2018,"Director Drew Goddard is the very definition of a filmmaker who's far more talented than the amount of work that they actually work on. Only having directed one film before Bad Times at the El Royale, being Cabin in the Woods (which was a great spin on the horror genre), he hasn't really been able to make himself a household name for most audiences, which I figured would've happened by now. That being said, if he continues to make quality and unique films such as this one, then I believe he's well on his way. Bad Times at the El Royale is a very fun mash-up of genres and I had a blast with the dark tone throughout the course of the entire film. While not for everyone, I believe this has the potential to please many film fanatics.The basic plot is that seven strangers all end up staying at an old hotel known as the El Royale. During this one fateful night, each of their characteristics come out to play, exploiting their harshest natures. Each of their pasts will come back to haunt them in different ways, but the way these stories intertwine themselves is well worth the price of admission alone. With things going on behind the scenes at the hotel itself, as well as a staff member who isn't all that he seems, this movie doesn't hold back in terms of going for constant twists and turns. When a film is able to be as original and unique as this one is, and ends up risking it all by having so many stories to tell, I need to give it props. This is also where I found the biggest achievement in the film as a whole.Each guest is given their moment to shine and their backstories are quite thoroughly explored. This is where the film could've easily derailed, due to the fact that too much backstory can make a film feel overstuffed. With Bad Times at the El Royale, it sort of embraces the fact that it may be going overboard, but it does so with care and makes you either despise or truly care about some of the characters. Everyone is so different from each other that it becomes up to you on who you wish to relate to or root for. This was easily my favourite aspect of the movie. Everyone is a main character (in some shape or form) and when a movie can pull that off in a great way, it will always win me over.With a cast that includes the likes of Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm, Chris Hemsworth, and Dakota Johnson, you know they'll be bringing their A-game. What surprised me the most was the fact that the newcomers in Cynthia Erivo, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman were all the true standouts here, particularly Pullman. I was either having a blast at how twisted this character was or simply drawn into every line of dialogue he was speaking. I haven't seen this actor in any other films, but based solely on this performance, he surely has a bright future ahead of him.In the end, Bad Times at the El Royale is a film that would be immediately salvageable with its great cast, even if the script was terrible, but the fact that both are absolutely fantastic in their own ways, I found myself loving every second of my experience with this film. Yes, there are some overused tropes here, but the originality of the overall movie is incomparable to other films in 2018. It's not perfect, but I'd be hard pressed to say I had as much fun with another movie all year. It may be a little slow for some viewers, but that slow pace worked for me this time. A unique premise with great execution.",Bad Times at the El Royale

99,anselmdaniel,Slow and worthy build-up,8,21 March 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Bad Times at the El Royale is a thriller movie that premiered in 2018. The movie is directed and written by Drew Goddard. The movie stars Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, and Jon Hamm. Strangers with no connection with one another connect at a country hotel. Through the night, the audience learns of each of the characters as a mystery unfolds.Bad Times at the El Royale is a slow thriller that takes its time in building its characters. The movie uses its long running time of 141 minutes to establish the setting, characters, and plot points effectively. The movie wants the audience to care about the characters and setting that it establishes. The movie does succeed in this aspect as the setting feels consistent and well-realized. The movie is a great self-contained setting with its characters each having reasons for existing in the movie. The audience gets to know each of the characters one-by-one in its running time as the mystery unfolds. During this time, a cult run by a man named Billy Lee enters the El Royale hotel.The problem with Bad Times at the El Royale is in its pacing. Whenever the movie utilized a flashback to tell the audience more about a character, the main plot slowed to a crawl. The main plot is the most interesting part of the movie and the character's backstories offered character motivation and skills. However this flashback forced the story to a halt as the movie needed to explain the character. An example of this is the FBI agent Broadbent being present to retrieve surveillance equipment from the El Royale hotel. I thought the twist of the character was an interesting idea, however the character only served to help the cult. The character dies incredibly quickly and he could not be considered as a main character in the movie. The movie likewise explains the other characters in-depth and it would have been better to have another way for the movie to introduce them.The performances by the cast in this movie are impressive. There is a wide range of actors portraying a wide range of character traits. This is one of the movie's best traits as the movie has many grand aspects that work to its benefit. I felt that the movie could utilize its cast members well and that the characters themselves were well-written. None of the characters felt out of place or random.I would recommend 'Bad Times at the El Royale'.Grade: B",Bad Times at the El Royale
100,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,20 October 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Everything about this movie excited me: the single location aspect of the story, the Quentin Tarantino vibe, the confined mystery-thriller that I'm a fan of, the fact that Drew Goddard writes and directs, Michael Giacchino composing the score and finally an astonishingly talented cast, filled with legends and future stars. Bad Times at the El Royale is one of the most underrated films of this year, I can't believe how many people think this is just ""okay"".Gosh, I'll say it straight away: Jeff Bridges delivers an award-winning performance, even if he gave better displays throughout his career. He incorporates Father Daniel Flynn in such a heartfelt and powerful way that I wanted him to be on-screen every single second. His character has an unique trait which conveys hopelessness and depression, making me care so much about him.That is, in fact, my biggest compliment to the movie: its characters. Drew Goddard writes fantastic scripts, each with their own subplot which carries tremendous character development. I couldn't find a single drop of lazy exposition or meaningless dialogue. Every line in the film has a purpose and every character a role to play. I love how everyone has secrets, and Goddard's idea to structure the story through chapters is absolutely brilliant.Cynthia Erivo gracefully portrays Darlene Sweet, a singer trying to catch a breakthrough. Cynthia is marvellous, and she sings like an angel. Her chemistry with Bridges is palpable, and their interactions are some of the movie's best. Jon Hamm is terrific as Laramie Sullivan, bringing his charm and humor to his performance. He handles long takes like no one else, and he has an exceptional scene involving an obscure part of the hotel.Lewis Pullman steals the show as the receptionist, Miles Miller. This guy can act! Extraordinary performance from this future star, I genuinely hope this film can catapult him to some more prominent parts. Finally, I left the last three to the end because they are my only issue with the movie: Dakota Johnson (Emily), Cailee Spaeny (Rose) and Chris Hemsworth (Billy Lee). These three deliver great performances, especially Hemsworth, as expected. My problem is not there.While every other subplot or backstory is passionate and captivating, the story of this trio seems, at least, farfetched. Having in mind the tone of the film and the other characters' stories, the chapters involving Emily, Rose and Billy feel strangely cliche and unrealistic. Goddard's imagination and creativity are some of his best attributes, but due to his exaggeration of these characters' backstories, the last 20-30min of this movie feel ... Awkward.Nevertheless, he compensated this problem with a masterful direction. Seamless handling of the camera, shooting some long takes and outstanding dialogues that are stuck in my memory. The set design is superb and feels so resemblant of what a famous motel would be, giving it a realistic vibe. Excellent editing, great cinematography and a score worthy of listening for weeks without end. This is yet another proof that a film's soundtrack can be as important as the scene being filmed.The R rating elevates this movie to a whole other level. There is no fear of showing blood or very intense shootouts. When things start going down, they REALLY go down! The action in display keeps the audience on edge and constantly entertained. The mystery surrounding each character and the hotel itself is intriguing to the last minute. This might not be at The Hateful Eight's level, but kill me if it's not freaking awesome!Since this film came out in the same week as First Man (at least, here in Portugal), I can see a lot of people choosing to watch the latter and I can't blame them. Both movies have a phenomenal cast and a director who understands the craft of filmmaking. If you prefer an artistic biopic about one of the most impactful persons in humankind's history over a gritty, bloody, vein-pumping confined mystery-thriller, go ahead. You won't be disappointed with any of your choices... I know which one I would choose, though.In the end, Bad Times at the El Royale is probably going to be a bit overlooked, and it's undoubtedly one of the most underrated films of the year. If not for an understandable slip in a trio of characters, this had everything to be at the very top of the best movies of 2018. Phenomenal cast, with outstanding performances from everyone, especially Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo. Drew Goddard is making his way up my list of favorite screenwriters, and he's got his name on the list of extremely competent directors as well. A lost narrative structure is brought back to elevate a brilliant R-rated mystery, filled with memorable scenes and a fantastic score. Please, don't miss this one or you'll regret it!",Bad Times at the El Royale

102,eva3si0n,Bad Times at the El Royale by the beginning raises high expectations,6,4 January 2021,"Bad Times at the El Royale by the beginning raises high expectations. Looks at first glance the film as Identity only without the charm thriller and in the antourage of the 60s. The plot is as if served with cliffs, the characters do not have time to reveal, the ending is predictable and unambiguous. An absolutely grey film that tries to turn something interesting is Chris Hemsworth 's acting",Bad Times at the El Royale
103,Alexander_Blanchett,A future cult classic,9,23 December 2018,"A great thriller in the tradition of Quentin Tarantino. The film is twisted, well constructed, full of great symbolism and interesting characters.
The less you know about the plot the better it is because it turns out totally different from what one would expect. I love films taking place in locations like hotels where a bunch of characters that seemingly have nothing to do with each other are put together. The magic of Drew Goddard's vision is that the film gives you hints you think you know whats happening next but then totally turns it around and those clues just end up being random.
There are a few powerhouse performances to mention. First of all the revelation of Cynthia Erivo who absolutely shines and gives the films best performance. She is an artist and performer to look out for in the future. Already great in ""Widows"" she really blows your mind here. Then there is the always great Jeff Bridges who just adds one further iconic character to his resume. A great performance as usual. Lewis Pullman is another great discovery of the film and Dakota Johnson is getting better and better the farer aways she is staying from those little soft porns.
Jon Hamm also commanded the screen well during his screen time. Oh and last but not least there is Chris Hemsworth in a role you wouldn't expect him to be and he does it so well! Great to see him doing more variations of roles as you would expect Thor to do. The screenplay and direction is great. The look is wonderful and the film, even though quite long, is constantly entertaining and mysterious. One of the rare truly original and creative films of the year. Especially when you link it to real live events of that time.",Bad Times at the El Royale
104,cardsrock,Pretty good times at the El Royale,8,23 October 2018,"As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew this was the type of film I would like. The old school style is so unique and the soundtrack is retro cool. Bad Times definitely leans into its Tarantino influence with its nonlinear storytelling, and though it doesn't have the dialogue or payoff to completely pull it off, it does an admirable job. While the film drags a bit in the middle, it picks up again near the end and keeps you guessing throughout. All of the performances are great and Chris Hemsworth is particularly menacing. Above all, this is an original film that deserves support and one which is a lot of fun for people who enjoy stylish thrillers.",Bad Times at the El Royale
105,CANpatbuck3664,Definitely Worth Checking In to the El Royale,8,17 October 2018,"This movie had an awesome trailer that got me excited to see the movie. The moody atmosphere, the characters all giving each other the shifty eye, the anonymous threat and then the visible one with Chris Hemsworth walking in like he owned the place. The first thing I want to talk about with Bad Times is the top notch visual and audio work. The movie looks excellent, they made good use of a mid range budget and delivered some beautiful cinematography, some solid set design and even some great sound editing (the violence is packs a punch, the gunfire cracks and fights have some good sound work). I also really dug the soundtrack of the movie. It had a similar vibe to Guardians of the Galaxy where it fit the movie perfectly and had me tapping my foot despite its not the kind of music I typically listen to. It didn't hurt that Cynthia Erivo was singing most of it, she anchored the movie with her performance and her vocal work was just as good.This movie boasts a pretty big cast and we don't have a true protagonist, so the movie functions as an ensemble. Cynthia Erivo maybe gets the most amount of screen time as Darlene and she's excellent both by herself and with the other heavyweights in the cast. Her character is easy to like and that's also a credit to her performance. Jon Hamm is always charming, and it was cool to see him get to do something a little different with his character. Jeff Bridges was also good, I would expect nothing less from him. His characters eccentricities were handled in an off way that didn't seem authentic, but his performance was solid. It was also nice to see Dakota Johnson in something different, its hard not to immediately associate her with the 50 Shades franchise. She did her job capably and I'm glad she can put that franchise behind her. This is a step in the right direction for her. Chris Hemsworth is the actor performing most outside his comfort zone and I think he largely pulled it off. He's a better actor than he's given credit for (check out Rush to see how much range he has outside of Thor) and I think this was a good showcase for his ability to do different types of roles. He makes a threatening villain and I think his performance will be one of the things people are talking about when they leave the theatre. I also think Lewis Pullman does good work as Miles, he's pretty expressive and I think he made the most of a character that has much more to him than meets the eye.Most of the criticism surrounding Bad Times is that the plot and how they segment the story is something you might see in a classic Quentin Tarantino film. That criticism has some merit but if you turn on this movie for that reason, you're the problem, not the movie. There are a bunch of genuinely surprising twists, they create some interesting characters with complex motivations and there was never a point in the movie where I wasn't interested in what was going to come about next. Writer/director Drew Goddard knows how to build tension and the movie does a great job of playing with your expectations. Bad Times does rely on segmented storytelling, but it isn't done as a ripoff, they frame it with their own device and it plays well. I didn't love this movie wholeheartedly but to just dismiss it as a Tarantino knockoff isn't fair. This is a really good dark thriller and I enjoyed this more than The Hateful Eight.The biggest criticism I can lobby against Bad Times at the El Royale is that the movie needed to move at a quicker pace. I sympathize with director Drew Goddard, there isn't much obvious fat to trim, but the movie did drag even though I was enjoying it through to the credits. A couple of instances is that I enjoyed the opening scene with Nick Offerman, but it went on too long and undercut how well filmed it was. The other one is how long it takes Billy Lee to actually get to the hotel, Hemsworth gives a charismatic performance, but I did get tired of waiting for him to show up. His character is worth the wait, but it might have benefited the movie to have more of him in it or to get him to the central conflict a little quicker. I got to see this with my best friend and while I liked it a little more than he did, his comment walking out was that the movie did almost everything well, but it wasn't special in any way. I generally agree, its a well rounded movie that's shot well, it has solid acting, enough mystery to keep the audience engaged and intriguing characters that you want to more about. But its not as tightly edited it should be and although I'm happy to actually give it an 8.5/10, it does feel like there was a little bit of missed potential with this project. That's why I'm rounding down to an 8/10. Its too bad this isn't doing better at the box office, but it does fit in an awkward spot where it may not be arty enough for critics but not as action packed as audiences want. I still really enjoyed this, and I get the feeling I might like it even better after a second viewing. Its worth paying to see, I'd even chip in the extra dollar for the room in California.",Bad Times at the El Royale
106,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,28 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...What a great movie! Every aspect of this film was very well done - the cinematography, the soundtrack, the plot, the acting, the pacing, the direction, the editing ... there really was no weak spot to be seen. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Bad Times at the El Royale"".Our story starts out with a lounge singer arriving at the motel to find a priest standing outside the entrance appearing to be lost. They meet and go inside. They find another man, another apparent guest, already within waiting for the desk clerk to come out and assist him. They all meet. The clerk finally emerges to sign them in to their rooms. Then another young woman breezes in through the front door - they all meet. Now the stage is set. All of our guests are harboring a secret - including our desk clerk - and one by one, they all come out to the forefront in an explosive night that none of them (IF they survive) will ever forget.The movie is presented in chapters along the way, much in the same manner as another well known neo-noir film, ""Pulp Fiction"", that all eventually tie together at the end. As I was watching, I wondered if Quentin Tarantino had seen it, and if so, did he like it? It certainly had that flavor to it. It was crisp story telling and good camera work - with very twisted characters. You are immediately sucked into the movie and once they've got you hooked, you're all in for the entire show.I really liked this one. It does play a little long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but the story is so engrossing, it really goes by pretty fast. I highly recommend this one.

111,garethcrook,"Slick, menacing, psychological fun.",8,11 June 2019,"I remember seeing the trailer for this and being instantly taken with it. Something about the throwback nostalgia of the 50s Americana, mixed with the unnerving underbelly of knowing all is not well, not right and clearly headed for something terrible (really quite terrible). The characters are strong, Hamm is very good, but Bridges is scene-chewingly masterful. It's Cynthia Erivo that steals the show though, it's one helluva show and she's awesome, slowly prizing the limelight away from the big name stars as the crime caper meets diabolical character study unfolds. The compartmentalising of the characters in their individual motel rooms is very effective, adding tension, with as much to be derived from what's not seen as what is. Separate stories waiting to entwine as the hotel, central to begin, makes way for their back stories to unweave. Visually it's highly stylised, dark rainy neon lit nights, punctuated with blows to the head as scenes begin to replay from all angles.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Overall, Bad Times at The El Royale is quite watchable and can have fun. Chris Hemsworth disappointed as his role was so absurd and useless and defeats the movie's style.",Bad Times at the El Royale
113,statuskuo,A Nice Tug At Your Nostalgia Strings,7,20 October 2018,"I wasn't old enough to know all the doing of the Rat Pack, but much is written about them. Crammed at the border of California and Nevada was a hotel called Cal-Neva where a LOT of very important people did dark things. Yes, this was a real place. In this instance, writer/director Drew Goddard named it the El Royale.
Seven desperate souls all from different walks of life meet at this place for their own reasons. A lot has nothing to do with the hotel, it's only a cool setting. The jukebox plays hits from the 60's which warms your heart to the ugliness at the underbelly. That is what Goddard is known for. The normal being so abnormal it's weird. But I loved it. The characters are familiar (which I won't get into since some of it reveals the plot). We have all the icons of the late 60's. But it's also cruel in its abandonment of these icons. Much like the people who go to it, it also feels like a place that people go to end their lives. A hideaway to do awful things.
I dig this movie a lot. The ending does get drawn out and the final outcome isn't the most satisfying of endings...when everything goes to Hell. You feel there should've been more of a swell of payback for the cruelty of one of its characters. But they're all broken in many ways. The standout, I'd say, is the Darlene Sweet character played wonderfully by Cynthia Erivo. She is a session singer who works for a Phil Spector type character but is resigned to take gigs at a po-dunk Reno bar. There is a heartbreaking moment where as she is singing, and slowly comes to terms with herself, and removes the wig that has created a personae who she is not. That is when her voice is lifted and she is powerful in her acceptance of her own being. Not to speak in hyperbole, but it matches the power of when slave chains are broken in ""Amistad."" Her fear and life of rejection no longer requires she hustles for anyone but herself. It's beautiful moment, in an ugly scenario.

I know it's been mentioned but I did feel like it was a worse hateful 8. That said I loved the music. I also loved when Darlene smashed the father with the bottle. That scene just took me off guard and got me more into the movie. Solid 7/10. Good but could have been great.,Bad Times at the El Royale
118,latinfineart,"Incomprehensibly terrible. A wanna be Tarantino, without the hipness or style",2,19 October 2018,"I had reasonably high hopes for this film. Good cast. Interesting premise, and felt there was some potential here. But the first 45 minutes was so lacking in context, by the time the action started, I just did not care anymore. I admit, I have been growing increasingly intolerant with Hollywood's inability to tell a decent story lately. This amps that intolerance up a notch.El Royale has one too many reference points, making it feel like it lacks any substance, pleasing to look at but out of reach from the plentiful 60s themes it tries to incorporate. Key on its mind are surveillance and identities lost to a cause, keen themes to make for some classic noir that ultimately never really amount to much more than window dressing. Its most inventive narrative sparks also go frustratingly undeveloped: the legalities of the border-hugging locale, the sinister watching eyes of government agencies, and the Manson-esque cult led by a clothes-allergic Chris Hemsworth. It's both off-road and a dead end.The film is rather unevenly paced, with each new chapter stalling the film rather than intensifying it. Its most exciting element is the gorgeous period pizazz of Martin Whist's production design, creating a fancy-chintz world like a mean older sibling of his work on Down With Love. Though Goddard does graft the film with some nifty and moody long takes, the film becomes lethargic with reams of aimless dialogue and stakes that are glacial in revealing themselves. When the film does click into its concept, it hums with entertaining paranoia and a clear vision. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey offers some saturated sumptuousness to amp up the tension and popcorn sleeze. But by the time Hemsworth's ab janglin' evil spiritual leader shows up to dole out punishment before a most lethargic third act, even the pastiche is can't keep us all that enthused.I really wish I had waited to watch this on DVD. It is not worth the price of admission, unless you are feeling desperate for entertainment. Even then, bring a heavy does of patience with you.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The cast is wonderful for this type of movie, everybody plays their character very well, and they all have an interesting backstory. The way they play off each other is also good and creates some very funny, intense and great moments. The setting is also brilliant and truly becomes a character on it's own! It is never boring and is beautifully shot, so it is always nice to look at. The story is told in a manner that makes it so it maintains it's momentum throughout.

120,sweidman-28016,Good Movie Making No Money,7,28 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale Review:Bad Times at the El Royale is directed by Drew Goddard, the man who wrote and directed the cult classic The Cabin in the Woods, and stars a whole bunch of famous people. Seven stranger, each with a secret, all happen to meet up at the El Royale, a hotel that is half in Nevada and half in California. Over the course of one night, secrets find their way out and everything turns to chaos. I wasn't pumped for this when I saw the first trailer. It seemed like it was going to be kind of like the recent Murder on the Orient Express, which was ok but not great. I forgot about the trailer and watched it again a while back and I got a little bit excited the closer the release got. I liked this movie. I thought that it had a clever story and caught my attention. The performances were really good in this. The biggest standout for me was Lewis Pullman as Miles Miller and Jeff Bridges as Father Daniel Flynn. The others I really liked were Cynthia Erivo (Darlene Sweet), Dakota Johnson (Emily Springsteen), and Chris Hemsworth (Billy Lee). The story very interesting. From the first moments of the movie it grabbed the audiences attention, and also had some interesting editing that worked. As the story progresses everything starts to tie together and more secrets come out. The suspense in this movie was great. You didn't know what was going to happen. The actors were fantastic as I mentioned before and added a bit more flare to the story. I really loved the relationship between Darlene and Father Flynn. Those were the most interesting parts. The directing and was good. You could see some of Goddard's techniques from The Cabin in the Woods and shared some similarities. The cinematography was pretty good. The set decoration was really good, another possible Oscar nominee. Side note: there has been some really good set decoration of recent this year. I don't know why but I love it. I liked the costumes. The fit the time period well (1969) and they had the personality of the character too. The score was good. I really liked the music in it and Cynthia did sing in it and I will say she has an amazing voice. There was one scene in particular that had some really interesting stuff happening and all we could hear was her singing. I loved it! As for flaws, it was a bit of a long movie. It was 2 hrs 20 min and some stuff could've been cut down a little. There's stuff involving a sister which made sense for the plot but there was a little something that just felt a little bit off. It may just be because I didn't like her as much. Towards the end a secret from Miles Miller comes out and it's supposed to be like a big thing but then when you learn about it, it wasn't that big of a bombshell. I feel like they could've changed that. Another thing happened involving a tape which kind of felt a little off just because I would forget about it and then it would got back to it. Also this really isn't a flaw but some people were advertised a lot but barely in it so I felt a tiny but disappointed but it worked out. This is a clever movie that made barely any money on its first weekend (only 7 million with a 32 million budget). It seemed like a big movie but I guess people wanted to see Venom (not really good) and A Star is Born (very good) more. I would recommend it. Either see it in the theater or wait for it to come out on blu ray.My Grade: B+",Bad Times at the El Royale

Unlike the glut of kooky talky oddball flicks to be inspired by Tarantino in the 90's, Bad Times actually understands pacing. And I would expect nothing less from the extremely talented Drew Goddard. Bad Times takes its time and doesn't rely on hyper kinetic editing and weirdo sound effects to string its po-faced madcap adventure together.
It's got some superb production design, a dark wit, and obviously a stellar cast and while the vignette idea is a little passé, and prevents really getting into the picture, it's still a cleverly budgeted, well shot, twisty turny little caper that I enjoyed.",Bad Times at the El Royale

AND, the opening scene is really good!But, the bad times outweigh all of this. It is slow and boring, and by the time we get to the Billy Lee chapter, I just didn't care about the film anymore.

129,Mike_Devine,"Not a cult classic, but may come close",7,4 March 2019,"Every now and then a film comes along that tries to make a statement, but it more of less gets lost on the general public. Drew Goddard's 'Bad Times at the El Royale' fits this bill, as the west coast-set Coen brothers wannabe drama mystery shocked, startled and skeeved out audiences upon release in 2018.Despite an all-star cast, 'El Royale' struggled to find a foothold among other more mainstream movies geared toward adults. Combined with a long runtime and some interestingly architected scenes, it's almost better to watch the film as a work of art rather than a motion picture. But of course, not everyone appreciates the same works of art - as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For some, there are just too many uncomfortable situations to sit through.For others, 'El Royale' offers some amazing exchanges between the actors, particularly Jeff Bridges as a bumbling priest and crafty Cynthia Erivo as motown backup singer Darlene Sweet. The unlikely pairing makes for an exciting set of events that unfold, and the Isley Brothers' ""This Old Heart of Mine"" gets a spotlight unlike ever before. Then there's Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny, who are the most interesting sister pairing in quite some time. And of course, this film wouldn't be complete without a mostly shirtless, psychotic cult leading Chris Hemsworth who's out for blood.'Bad Times at the El Royale' will never be looked at as a cult classic like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs,' but it will find its audience and appreciation quietly over time.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Tense and odd but brilliantly executed the general plot is so interesting, Goddard pays magnificent attention to detail in every scene all of which becomes useful at a later stage and some of the action was strangely beautiful and original playing with lighting, environments and elements which I can honestly say I've never seen before.

No award for this performance ? She was so convincing in her role. Vulnerability, attitude, singing all worked ! Great job. Same for Dakota who portrayed a very broken and lost character. You can tell pretty much from the 1st scene that everyone has it's own very dark, hidden agenda. There have been quite some shocking hard scenes, mostly not to be anticipated which was part of the coolness of bad times at the el royal.

133,jamiedarlow-37510,A true mystery/thriller masterpiece!,10,14 February 2020,"To say anything about the plot would be spoiling part of the experience. It's a film filled to the brim with suspense and there's a lot of fun to be had in the uncertainty of what is going to happen next and what exactly the characters motives are. Writer/Director Drew Goddard (The Cabin In The Woods) has crafted, along with an extremely talented cast and crew, a mesmerising portrayal of right, wrong, desperation and guilt.
Jeff Bridges is really quite incredible as Father Daniel Flynn; one of his very finest performances that you have got to see on the big screen for the sheer power of it. The exact same goes for Cynthia Erivo as Darlene Sweet who is a stunning revelation; a massively captivating screen presence with the voice of an angel. Some of the many astonishing scenes in the film focus on events happening around the characters at the same time and her voice is the soundtrack of these scenes, making for a poignant and compelling study of the darkness in humanity and the peaceful serene core that can be found in the underbelly if everyone stops to look. Chris Hemsworth is wonderful as always in perhaps his most intense role yet and Lewis Pullman is extraordinary in his portrayal of a very troubled character. Editor Lisa Lassek (Avengers Assemble) splices everything together beautifully to enhance the non-linear narrative into fully functioning visual storytelling, reminiscent of the late great Sally Menke's work (A frequent collaborator of Quentin Tarantino's) The camera work provides a lot of the films most memorable moments; elegantly gliding along with Jon Hamm walking side to side in one scene and stopping to focus on what he is observing; I just loved this scene and its simple beauty! The close ups of Flynn's face when he is telling his story and Darlene when she is singing her heart out. I think this is what makes this film stand out; it has occasionally eerie but always effective beautiful moments in between all the chaos and tension",Bad Times at the El Royale

Cynthia Erivo is the best actor in the entire movie, although Jeff Bridges does prop her up for much of the movie, she stands out well on her own. Dakota Johnson was pretty bad and forgettable.I felt the movie did an excellent job of showing how cults can make monsters out of decent people. Big tech has taken all of the methods from cult leaders from the late twentieth century and applied it to the way they promote and market their products.

137,ginocox-206-336968,Stylish film marred by muddled social commentary,7,29 December 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale (2018) is a stylish production with many intriguing elements. The acting is excellent, with particular kudos to Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm and Lewis Pullman. However, it sacrifices a coherent plot for incoherent social commentary.At one point, a character removes a wig and seems to transform from Diana Ross to Angela Davis. What does it mean? Blacks who embrace the system are radicals at heart? Black political activism is superficial? One can only survive by adopting radical philosophies? The scene is deliberate and protracted, so must have some deeper meaning.At another point, a character slyly removes a bottle of knockout drops and spikes a lady's drink. Where did he get the drug and why would he carry it? Who knows? The intended victim somehow sees or anticipates his action, races across the room and knocks him out with a blunt instrument. A nod to #MeToo? But why assault him? She is fit and half his age, while he moves at a snail's pace. Is this an endorsement of Stand Your Ground laws and vigilantism?One of the film's MacGuffins is evidence of a sexual indiscretion by some important person who has since died. The intimation is that it is John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy or Martin Luther King Jr. Another reference is made to a brutal sexual assault by a senator, who may or may not be the same person. The evidence may or may not relate to that assault. A character destroys the evidence, presumably to avoid besmirching that individual's reputation. Is this intended as some rebuke of #MeToo? Are the filmmaker saying women should not be heard? Or is it a double standard that applies to liberal torchbearers?The film is set in 1969 at a resort modelled after the 220-room Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, which straddled the California-Nevada state line. However, the El Royale seems to have only eighteen rooms, judging by the keys hanging in the key safe, considerably fewer judging by the floorplan, of which only four are rented. All four guests arrive within the span of half an hour or so, to find the resort entirely unoccupied. There are no other guests, diners or gambler at the casino. No staff either, other than the concierge/desk clerk/housekeeper. Most of the rooms have been unoccupied for so long, they haven't even been cleaned. Very Kafkaesque, but how does such a resort remain in business? With two non-guests, there are seven central characters. The suggestion that they represent the seven deadly sins and the hotel represents heaven and hell has considerable appeal. The guests prefer rooms on the heaven side, and none has any interest in gambling, although they are later compelled to gamble. Beyond that, this potentially fascinating theme isn't really explored in any depth.The film seems self-indulgent in several respects. Much is not as it originally seems. The vacuum cleaner salesman isn't. An apparent kidnapping isn't. Mirrors aren't what they seem. One character claims to have committed over a hundred heinous acts, but they weren't what one might expect. Darlene doesn't have long hair. The priest isn't. All this misdirection distorts what seems obvious efforts at social commentary. What first seems a drug-assisted sexual assault isn't sexual. Is this a cautionary message regarding #MeToo? Is the underlying message that acts that may seem like sexual aggression may be something else entirely?Music is an important element. A vintage jukebox loaded with 1960s classics provides much of the background music. When it is silent, Darlene (Cynthia Erivo) is often heard singing. The action is often contrived to provide an excuse for her to sing. Ten or twenty minutes of the running time is occupied by her singing. Perhaps it's some sort of allusion to the Christian imagery of angels singing in heaven. Later, her singing is dismissed by another character, ""I've heard better.""Like Jeff Bridges's character, the movie has a lot of interesting ideas and a lot of style, but has trouble expressing ideas coherently and often seems more concerned with obfuscation.",Bad Times at the El Royale
138,mgd_m,"Nineties flavor, good overall",7,30 January 2019,"This movie is a must-see. Not a masterpiece, but it's fresh, well-acted, and compelling. The attention in building the first two acts, and the syntax used in the movie are two things that I missed badly in the last 15 years (with the exception of Tarantino, of course). In its complex layout, in its friendly yet not-pandering tone, it reminded me of a lot of movies from the nineties.
The first sequence in the one-way glasses corridor is a masterpiece in absurdity. The concierge revealing at the end is very good also.
The FBI setup is nice. Bridges is fantastic.
Thrilling, creepy, mysterious, with lots of twists.
Overall, you have a mix of many things and genres, and it's great entertainment.
There are many reviews here lamenting the lack of a purpose and a satisfactory ending, but there are at least three purposes here (the story of the 2 main characters; a moral; and the sake for a fabulous mess in itself). The ending is, well, an ending, it's a story of redemption, and the characters succeed in escaping with the money... What kind of ending are they talking about then? It's just a pulp/noir movie, guys.On the other hand, I agree with two flaws cited in many other reviews:
It's a bit slow at times, and 10-20 minutes too longHemsworth's character is weak, and Hemsworth himself is heavily miscast in that Manson-style role.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Drew Goddard the director of Cabin in the Woods has hit it out of the ballpark again with this.",Bad Times at the El Royale
140,themadmovieman,Frustrating and simply far too long,7,14 October 2018,"An A-list cast, a fun premise, great production design. Bad Times At The El Royale may have a lot going for it on the outside, but the truth is that it's a painfully frustrating film that darts back and forth between various narrative tangents, all over the course of two and a half painfully slow-moving and unnecessary hours.On the whole, this really isn't that great of a movie, and we'll get into why that is in just a bit, but beforehand, let's look at the few positives on display, the biggest of which comes in the shape of the excellent collection of performances.An A-list ensemble cast isn't always a gold mine for individually outstanding turns, but often leads to a great display of talent all working with one another in very entertaining fashion. In that, Jon Hamm is very smooth in his role, Jeff Bridges brings a good bit of mystery and uncertainty to his character, and Dakota Johnson's patient but ultimately rather effective performance is great to watch throughout.Those A-listers are all strong right the way through, but if there's one performance that is a real individual stand-out, then it's that of Cynthia Erivo, who proves an immensely likable central presence while still bringing an impressive level of unexpected grit and darkness to her character, making her an equally fascinating watch.Along with the performances, special credit has to go to the production designers here, who do a fantastic job at creating a bizarre world in the isolated El Royale Hotel, with excellent attention to detail in the 50s/60s motel styling of the building. I would have liked to see a little more attention given to the Nevada-California divide within the hotel, and a more vivid presentation of just that, but the production and sets are fantastic throughout regardless.Speaking of the Nevada-California divide, I really enjoyed the premise at first, with the ambiguity of a hotel straddling two states looking to set up some good fun and action later on. However, while it seems fun at first, I have to say that it's a fairly pointless and underwhelming plot detail that really doesn't have any impact on the story at all - and is hardly even mentioned apart from the nifty state-shaped keyrings.And this is where my main problems with the movie start to come in, because the story is just a little bit all over the place, and while a lot of attention is put into making the plot as watertight as possible - which it admittedly is - the way it's presented over the course of two and a half very long-winded hours is what ultimately makes Bad Times At The El Royale such a frustrating watch.With the exception of a very sharp and exciting twenty minute period in the film's middle portion, where we see all the hotel guests' stories interweave in a very complex yet well-executed and satisfying way, this isn't a film that ever manages to keep itself together, too often going off on ridiculously long tangents to explain the plot that could have realistically been achieved with a single line of dialogue.The good thing about the story is that it doesn't leave out any details, meaning that what could have been a totally confusing mess isn't quite so, but director Drew Goddard is far too indulgent in his film throughout, seemingly refusing to cut anything about the characters' backstories even if it means drawing your attention away from the main proceedings for a good ten or more minutes at a time.The film's slow pacing doesn't do much to help that, and for what should be an intense thriller, things really do drag on, particularly into the final act. The first two-thirds of the movie, while not exceptional, still have a little bit of mystery about them, as you try to figure out what everybody's motives are, and what is so strange about the hotel itself, but once that's all revealed, the final act is a fairly pointless exercise as it drags once again to the finish, and again interrupted by a series of infuriating tangents and backstories that make it a painful slog to get the film over and done with.Overall, I wasn't all that impressed with Bad Times At The El Royale. Yes, it's got a great cast with some strong performances, as well as some brilliant and immersive production design, but it failed to grab me with its poorly laid-out story, dragging on and on and on over the course of its undoubtedly overlong runtime as it flies back and forth between random tangents that really distract from the potential excitement of the main action.",Bad Times at the El Royale

142,williampsamuel,Tarantino Meets the Coens,10,29 November 2018,"Four very different people with their own secrets and stories to tell check into a once grand but now faded hotel. It's a tale that's been told many times before. But never like this. Not with so many twists and surprises. Not with so much blood. And probably not with so much style and wit either. This isn't Grand Hotel or Agatha Christie. This is Big Lebowski meets Pulp Fiction, but even darker.In fact, the whole movie feels like equal parts Coen Brothers and Tarantino. The episodic structure, intersecting storylines, and shocking violence are all straight from Tarantino's playbook, while the disparate cast of shady characters, dark secrets, and touches of black humor are classic Coen. So Bad Times may be a bit derivative, but in the best way possible.It all starts simply enough. A brief pre-title scene set ten years before the rest of the film establishes the tone, then the main characters arrive, make small talk, and after some delay are checked into their rooms. From here the story just unfolds and unfolds as their agendas are slowly revealed and the twists and revelations build on each other at an ever-increasing rate. This is the kind of movie where nothing is what it first appears, and every time you think that things can't possibly get worse, they do. And like all the best thrillers, this is one that will keep you guessing till the very end.Goddard has assembled a splendid cast of talented newcomers and experienced stars, and every one of them get their chance to shine. Jeff Bridges is easily the best of the bunch: charming, friendly to a fault, and just the slightest bit fishy as elderly ""priest"" Father Flynn. Cynthia Erivo also makes a strong impression as a down on her luck but fiercely independent singer with a voice like silk. Hemsworth is downright unsettling for his part. And while Lewis Pullman's young clerk takes the longest to fully develop, his arc may be the most rewarding.As dark, and frequently violent this picture is, there are some truly touching moments. From Father Flynn's failing memory to the singer's faded dreams and Emily's broken childhood, these people had hard lives and we feel for them, even as they scheme and two time each other. Even some of the worst people in this movie are as much tragic as evil.The soundtrack is worth mentioning. Consisting of some of the best rock and soul of the sixties, it deepens the sense of time and place while providing a perfect accompaniment to all the major scenes. And when Cynthia Erivo starts singing, the music takes center stage. If Goddard had wanted to do this as a full on musical she could have made it work.If this movie has a fault it's that the runtime is rather long, and the ending is a lot to take in at once. But the whole thing is so engaging and masterfully crafted that you won't care. This movie could be three hours and you'd still be eagerly watching till the end.And what an end it is. Every thread is tied together, every lingering secret revealed, and in a manner more shocking than anything that's come before. What's more, it's also surprisingly profound. In the end Bad Times is actually a message movie. And that message it that there is always time for absolution and a chance for a new start.",Bad Times at the El Royale
143,patriciogl10,I guess I expected a lot.,6,20 September 2019,"At first, it seemed such an interesting premise, there was an obscure haze of mistery around it, and the cast multiplied that interest. However, neither is the build-up enigmatic as intended, nor is the development and climax in any way satisfactory as I could have expected. Having said that, I don't consider it to be a bad film. It was engaging to a certain extent, but it didn't come through at last.In my opinion, Chris Hemsworth is brilliant here as Billy Lee, the cult leader. His character takes the film through different moments, hostile and dark moments, the most enticing of the entire film.So, in other words, it fell short. I'm not entirely sure if I would recommend this film to somebody, well, maybe to Chris Hemsworth fans, cause
he is the best thing in this film.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Good story, excellent direction, fine performances by main cast (especially young Mr. Pullman and Ms. Erivo), great musical score ... You name it. Although somewhere in ""Tarantino waters"", this movie is far better. I really can't understand why is Hollywood forcing J.J. Abrams when they have such an exquisite talent of Mr. Goddard at their disposal. This man knows how to translate a good storytelling into a movie. Can't wait for his next job. Highly recommended.",Bad Times at the El Royale
145,itsbobr,Good Mystery,9,3 January 2019,"In 1969 an aging priest, a struggling female singer, a too talkative salesman and an unfriendly woman go on vacation at Lake Tahoe's now rundown El Royale Roadshow Motel, and all have a secret. The motel is operated by someone with many secrets. Then later someone much worse than those mentioned arrives.This is a mystery unlike you have ever seen. You will find yourself mesmerized trying to figure things out. We see time lapse scenes, flashbacks and a motel on the border of California and Nevada so each guest can decide what state he or she wants to sleep in, and yes, so much more.The movie opens with someone tearing up the boards in a motel room and tossing a bag under the floor and then covering all up. Then he is shot.Ten years later we see guests arrive. Father Flynn (Jeff Bridges); Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) a struggling singer; Laramie Seymour Sullivan (John Hamm) a very talkative salesman; and Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) a very uptight woman, maybe a hippie.What we see. The motel is not an ordinary motel and the guests are not what they seem to be. We see a murder, a possible kidnapping, and Salesman Sullivan finding listening devices in the telephone and other places in his room; Darlene closing the curtains to sing (she has a job in Reno and needs to practice); and then we see Father Flynn tearing up things in his room.Notables: Lewis Pullman as Miles Miller the bellhop who knows all the secrets of the motel; Cailee Spaeny as Rose Summerspring, the bound woman and sister of Emily; Chris Hemsworth as Billy Lee, a cult leader.The acting in here is first rate. Some scenes take a while to get going, but the music is of the toe-tapping variety and you will tap your toes. Guaranteed. Yes, Darlene's singing went on for too long at times. Good, but too long.There are questions I have: who was monitoring or investigating the motel and its operation? Never addressed. In the beginning a TV was on talking about a murder. Was it related to the motel? Was Rose involved as there was a moment when Billy Lee was about to spill some beans? Again, not addressed.Thoroughly enjoyable. An Oscar for Jeff Bridges? Hmmm........... Why not? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: No
Language: Yes, mostly in the beginning.

148,Gresh854,Savvy Work Goddard,6,1 November 2018,"Drew Goddard's Bad Times at the El Royale is a puzzling maze of intuitive, mind-windling schemes that estates back to the golden ages of the ""Agatha Christie"" strain of mystery enigmas. It's a film that delicately takes its time to explore the fundaments of the legion of piling scenarios which conclusively-for the most part-always acquired a tasteful aura of enchantment. What enhances Goddard's thriller to its most brimming bars, however, are the intrinsic performances, chiefly from Bridges and Hemsworth. A gratuitous third act, as well, benefited the charisma of the film's global outcome. (Verdict: B+)",Bad Times at the El Royale
149,carlos37andre,I loved it,9,18 June 2019,"Well, starting with the performances. Everyone is great in it. Even Chris Hemsworth that I first thought wasn't the best choice to play and evil kid abuser dude was able to hide his charisma and makes us he his character. I just didn't get what the hell his character was about tho. Why are those people falling him? What was that thing in the beach? I mean, it took me out of the movie completely.But man, I have to give Lewis Pullman the most praise in here, uau, he did great, the dude destroyed in the role, you for some reason care so much about his character throughout the movie, you feel his pain, his agony, the fact that he's lost and just doesn't know what the hell happened with his life. And for real, the cast has, Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm and Chris Hemsworth (the fact I'm talking about HIS performance says something).I love the cinematography here, the colors always full of life, but in a dark way. The whole vibe of the Hotel fits perfectly the situation. I was sad Hamm's character died that early into the movie tho, up to that point he was the best one for sure (Pullman hadn't have that much screen time yet).I love that you never feel like you know where the movie is going (besides Miles' death at the end, it was clear that, that bitch was going to kill him). But, one of the only issues I have with the movie is that sometimes the format of stopping the current plot and explaining someone else's background through a flashback can hurt the pace of the whole thing. Mainly in the finale, with Miles' one. But don't get me wrong, I think that for the most part they nailed the whole different points of view converging style. But I think some people might have a problem with it, sometimes it can feel like you're watching something longer than it really is.And before I forget: The score. MY GOD! The score. The soundtrack for this movie is amazing, every music, in almost every scene, seems like it was designed entirely for the purpose of being in this movie. The music choice is 110% accurate, and it adds so much to the whole vibe the movie has. Incredible, and may be my favorite aspect of the whole thing.Sort of off topic: Ok, I've seen any of stuff online talking about the movie's plot (if there is any), I just saw the movie and am writing the review like 5 minutes after. But I'll bet, giving the year the movie is set in, the footage was Kenedy's. Just a thought that came to mind. I wondered if anyone else thought the same seeing it.Overall, Bad Times at the El Royale is a great movie, with storylines perfectly tithed together, with awesome performances, great cinematography and an insanely good soundtrack.",Bad Times at the El Royale
150,quaseprovisorio,"it's a bit style over substance, but it's a good movie in general.",7,3 April 2020,"Welll. the beggining is the best part. Maybe the first hour, when we're revealing the histories of the people checking in at the hotel. Drew goddard wanted to make a ""everybody suspects everyboby"" kind of movie, but compared for example to tarantino's the hateful 8 this flick fells short. Maybe he'll get there one day. Styllistically speaking it's very very good, even though some of the songs are predictale - but it works on giving you the right atmosphere.The problem is when he starts to develop the characters and most of them aren't that interesting. plus, the movie lacks pace - it's a good slow burn until a certain point, and then when certain characters enter it fells a bit flat. Some of the characters seem to be there more to give answers than depth.This could have been darker, and in general better told. it's not bad at all, i think it's a good film, but maybe goddard will get it better next time. i absolutely loved cabin in the woods.This is a very different flick fortunately, but because it lacks rythm and some character depth it's not as effective (even though they're very different films). still is a good attempt of a tarantinesque experience that succeeds sometimes. i would advice to watch it, even though it might disappoint a bit after a certain period - but it starts very well and it is a good movie all in all.",Bad Times at the El Royale
151,harrylosborne,"Bold, brave, but a little too broad",6,16 April 2019,"This film doesn't give you time to breathe - from the first second, tense character meetings and hostile intentions are the focus, all disguised by everyone's ""innocent"" backstories. As guests stay longer in the hotel, more dark motives become clear, but more questions present with each new answer.This trend continues, but nothing ever seems to get resolved - the deeper the plot goes, the more convoluted it becomes. By the end, you're enjoying the soundtrack and the 60s style more than the story. Good performances from Jeff Bridges/Chris Hemsworth/Cynthia Erivo help the narrative along, but aren't enough to fill all the holes.",Bad Times at the El Royale
152,Bertaut,"Derivative, predictable, and dull",5,22 October 2018,"Following the genre-bending, utterly insane, and extremely funny The Cabin in the Woods (2011), Bad Times at the El Royale is the second feature from writer/director Drew Goddard, who has also accrued writing credits for Cloverfield (2008), World War Z (2013), and The Martian (2015), as well as TV shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997), Angel (1999), Alias (2001), and Lost (2004). In short, he has an impressive résumé. As it stands in relation to Cabin, Bad Times is a similarly stylised cine-literate genre mash-up. However, whereas in Cabin, the twist upon twist upon twist had a cumulative effect, with the story getting better the longer it went on and the weirder things got, in Bad Times it's a case of ever diminishing returns. By the time we reach the end of the lengthy 141-minute runtime (more on that later), with everything and everyone shoehorned into neatly explained niches, the film has been shorn of its vitality, leaving one with an overriding impression of ""meh"". If Cabin was a genuinely new spin on a clichéd old story, playing with and subverting genre at every turn, Bad Times is singularly unable to free itself from the most oppressively derivative of its generic constraints.Set in 1969, the film takes place almost entirely in the titular El Royale Hotel (actually a motel, and obviously inspired by the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino), a once popular but now fading novelty spot situated half in Nevada and half in California, with a line literally running down the centre of the property to delineate the border. To say too much about the plot or characters would be to ruin some of the twists (which is ultimately all the film really has going for it), but the basic set-up is that over the course of one night, seven people will encounter one another but not all seven will leave. There's Fr. Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a Catholic priest on the way to see his brother; Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo), a singer travelling to a job she doesn't want; Emily (Dakota Johnson), an intensely private woman who wants nothing to do with any of the others; Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm), a slick vacuum cleaner salesman; Rose (Cailee Spaeny), who appears to be Emily's kidnap victim; Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth), a cult leader obviously based on Charles Manson; and Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman), the motel's receptionist/bellhop/maid/barman/manager. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that not only are few of these people who they claim to be, but the motel itself is hiding its own dark secrets.If that set-up reminds you a little of Identity (2003), you're not completely off course. Bad Times shares very similar DNA, at least up to the point where Identity goes totally batsh#t crazy; both are set in an out-of-the-way motel where a group of strangers are trapped overnight, and all, or some of them aren't who they appear, with the audience slowly filled in on their backstories via flashbacks. However, whereas Identity failed because the last half-hour is patently ridiculous, completely undermining the excellent build-up of tension and mystery, Bad Times has the exact opposite problem - the conclusion is decidedly underwhelming, failing to build on an excellent set-up, with the last twenty minutes or so lapsing into utter mundanity, and, most unforgivably for a mystery film, twists for twist's sake. The structure also somewhat recalls Lost (a disparate group of strangers forced together at a mysterious location filled with secrets, whilst a flashback-heavy narrative fills us in on who these people are), and, perhaps more obviously, the high-concept, perspective-shifting, often achronological Pulp Fiction (1994) imitators of the late 90s; films such as 2 Days in the Valley (1996) and Suicide Kings (1997).To start on a positive note though, Bad Times looks terrific - Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is faultless, whilst Martin Whist's production design is superb, with the ultra tacky period detail dripping off the screen. Directorally, Goddard also has his moments with some eye-catching compositions, locked-off cameras, POV shots, and lengthy single-take Steadicam sequences. However, it's in relation to this last point where one of the film's most immediate problems is to be found - the solid directorial work is completely out of step with the vapid writing, as if a screenplay intended for Michael Bay ended up being directed by Michael Mann (although Goddard is certainly no Mann). The barely-there storyline seems to be nothing other than a hangar onto which to drape a tone and style, rather than generating that style.Perhaps in relation to this disparity between style and story, the film's second strongest sequence is the opening scene. Shot entirely from a fixed camera position, and looking for all the world like a stage play, the scene is completely wordless, and charts the course of several hours in one of the motel rooms, as a man whose face we never clearly see checks in, moves all of the furniture to one side of the room, pulls up the floorboards, hides a bag under them, places them back, puts all the furniture back, relaxes for a while, and is promptly shot dead. The scene is a masterclass in slow-burning tension - we know something bad is going to happen, but Goddard refuses to pull the trigger prematurely, so when the violence does erupt, it's a pseudo-cathartic moment for the audience (incidentally, the film's best sequence is similarly abstract, slowly plotted, and mostly sans dialogue, but as it involves the discovery of an important and unexpected location within the motel, to say any more would be a spoiler). The problem is that the heavily stylised and brilliantly directed opening is so good, it spoils the audience, establishing a tone to which the rest of the film mostly fails to live up.In direct contrast to the opening, the ending is both narratively and directorally formulaic, predicable, and trite, with the least compelling and well fleshed out character taking centre stage, mano-a-mano good guy/bad guy dialogue aplenty, and even a ludicrous shoot-out. The whole things smacks of ""been there, seen that a million times."" Additionally, whereas the opening is effortlessly enthralling and distinctive, as the film lumbers on, and Goddard begins to run out of directorial tricks, there are sequences which scream ""look how cool I am."" For example, Billy Lee whirling toward the camera, eating pie, shirt agape, hair soaking wet, dancing to the sounds of Deep Purple's ""Hush"" is so desperate to appear iconic that it instead comes across as self-parody.Another significant problem is that the characters all feel like generic archetypes ripped out of other films, with none giving the impression of being a real-person, with their own agency and interiority. They are, in essence, walking plot-points. The script is also exceptionally weak in how it handles exposition (of which there is a significant amount). There seems to have been little attempt to organically introduce heavily expositional scenes, or integrate them with the surrounding material. Instead, on several occasions, the plot literally stops whilst characters explain things to one another. A particularly bad example of this is when Flynn and Sweet arrive at the motel reception. Sullivan is already there, and begins to tell them the inner workings of the establishment, having stayed there numerous times in the past. Then Miller turns up, and begins to recite a rehearsed sales pitch. Simply trading exposition from one character to another doesn't mean it's not exposition - the scene is painfully slow, dull, and pointless, telling us precious little that we actually need to know. Indeed the entire issue of the motel being bi-state is strangely pointless. Aside from the novelty value, it is never factored into the narrative, and one wonders why Goddard set the film in such a specific location if he had no plans to use that specificity thematically.A final problem which must be discussed is that 141-minute runtime. Padded, and massively self-indulgent, there is enough narrative content to barely fill a 90-minute duration. One of the most egregious missteps in this respect is Goddard's tendency to ponderously play out the same scene from multiple points of view, but in such a way as to give the audience only a smidgeon of additional information, so by the third time we're seeing a scene (which was too long even the first time around), it becomes an endurance test. Also, with this runtime and so little content, needless to say, the bottom falls out of the film entirely during the middle section, as things become unrelentingly slow and contrived. Goddard seems to equate curiosity about who the characters are with filmic suspense, meaning things take a decided turn for the mundane long before the underwhelming dénouement. The interesting set-up earns him a fair bit of wiggle room in relation to this, but he abuses it, pushing the audience far beyond the point where they simply give up caring about anything on screen. And when he finally does get around to wrapping things up, the last few twists are nowhere near enough of a reward. Personally, I was left feeling that the mysteries were more rewarding than the explanations.Part 1930s-style pulp fiction, part 1940s and 50s-style film noir, and part 1960s-style paranoid thriller, the film flirts with a few themes (redemption, forgiveness, karma, political corruption, the seductive nature of power), but none get off the starting grid, and ultimately, Bad Times isn't really about anything. Hyper self-aware, and attempting to both subvert and celebrate generic conventions, Goddard seems to think he has a bonafide epic on his hands, a portent piece of celluloid mastery which samples the best of hard-boiled crime fiction, and imparts valuable lessons in the process. He doesn't. It's more self-indulgent folly than paean of universal truth. And it's painfully dull.",Bad Times at the El Royale

156,scb_coldsteel,A good suspense driven film that falls prey to style over substance.,7,15 October 2018,"So I watched Bad Times at the El Royale at the theater. I was looking forward to this movie as the preview looked quite interesting and I am a fan of the cast. Overall though the movie was a bit of a mixed bag. Yes it did have its strengths, but in the end it was a bit style over substance and originality.The plot of the movie introduces a motley group of shady characters all with interconnected stories trapped at the hotel the El Royale. As the story progresses macguffins are introduced, people are killed, and the film unfolds into a mystery thriller that does keep you guessing as you try to piece the multiple puzzles together. The film genuinely had me on the edge of my seat through many parts trying to figure out what would happen next.The biggest strength of the movie is it stylish presentation. The film constantly switches narratives and perspectives as the film slowly doles out the character's backstory and their interactions. While this did add a certain flare to the plot progression is also unintentionally slowed down the movie in many parts. At 2 hours and 21 minutes this film definitely needed to be cut down in length to keep the forward momentum going. Of course the ensemble cast of eccentric characters is really the centerpiece and driving force of the film. All the characters were well-acted and combined a nice mix of comedy and drama into to their roles. Despite the actor's best efforts though there really wasn't a memorable performance in the film. No one did a bad job, but the characters just did not have a lasting impact. At times it seemed like the characters were trying too hard to be cool and edgy for their own good.One particular aspect that did continuously bother me throughout the film though was how unoriginal the movie felt. With it's directing and narrative style the movie borrowed heavily from Quentin Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Hateful Eight. There's nothing wrong with paying homage to a director, but at times this felt like outright plagiarism.Bad times at the El Royale was not a bad movie. In a lot of ways it was actually a pretty good movie. It certainly kept me entertained and held my attention throughout the film, but the pacing and narrative choices really slowed down the film. While it was a fun noir at times in the end it was a relatively forgettable movie. A 7.25 out of 10.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The acting was good too but some moments just didnt feel right. The movie feels stretched in the certain parts and makes the build up too boring.

160,hunter-friesen,Bad Times proves to be a good time,7,17 October 2018,"A priest, a singer, a vacuum salesman, and a drifter walk into a hotel. They all have a story and need a room for a specific reason, but only one of them is telling the truth. Each one is untrusting of the other and plans out how to survive the night as a severe storm moves in. Then enters a crazy cult leader who wants to exact revenge on the one who wronged him. With five seedy characters and a suspicious bellhop, a one night stay at the El Royale may come with a fatal price. ""Bad Times"" is directed by Drew Goddard, who previously directed and wrote the comedy/horror ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and wrote the screenplay for ""The Martian"". Goddard does well at directing this film. He does make some mistakes from time to time, but they aren't too severe. The first of his mistakes come from the pacing and overall length of the film. The 141-minute runtime is weird as the film felt like it could easily have been cut to two hours or justifiably stretched to three hours. This is due to some areas of the story being dragged on more than need be and some areas getting not as much as attention. The first act of the film slowly builds up each separate character with their backstory and motives. Then the second wizzes by and the third needlessly slows everything back down again.Goddard does do good work with the camera as he gives the film a dark washed overtone to match the 60s era feel. He also uses a wide array of camera techniques to tell the layered story. Some scenes are played out multiple times from different angles to convey each character's viewpoint. There also is a hefty amount of symbolism and thematic imagery within each frame that pushes the narrative along without the use of words. One scene that really stands out is a seven-minute tracking shot where the camera follows one character as they go room by room and spy on the others. It's a suspenseful sequence that gives a good amount of insight into each character in a short span of time. Along with directing, Goddard also serves as the sole writer for the original story. He divides the film into chapters based around the room a certain character is staying in. The technique works well to distribute time to develop each character. Not everyone gets equal time, but everyone gets enough to make them important to the overall narrative. The intersection of many different character's stories leads to the script being filled with lots of fun twists and surprises that continually come out of nowhere. Some of them are predictable once revealed, but many aren't and keep you on the edge of your seat.There are some plot holes and untidy loose ends that are quite obvious near the end. However, they really don't harm the quality of the story and are more of an afterthought.""Bad Times"" boasts a sizeable and star-studded cast. Most of the actors fare well with some doing better than others. Jeff Bridges does pretty well as the elderly priest looking for a little vacation. Bridges is able to make his character be believably evil as well as have a sympathetic heart. It's not his best work, but nowhere near his worst. Cynthia Erivo is the best out of the cast as she plays the singer making her way to a gig in Reno. She provides her own voice to the role and confidently takes charge of each scene. Dakota Johnson and Jon Hamm kind of just skate through and don't provide any real defining moments. They're not bad, but it feels like anyone could have filled the roles. Lastly, Chris Hemsworth does good work as the Jesus-like cult leader who likes to preach with his shirt open. Hemsworth brings both his comedic and dramatic skills together and creates an uneasy character that keeps the suspense high throughout.""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is a fun thriller that tells a complex story in an enjoyable fashion. It doesn't always perfectly work, but the minor mistakes aren't enough to ruin the overall product. In a fall season full of heavy films trying to send a message it feels good to have a film that only wants its audience to sit down and have a good time.",Bad Times at the El Royale
161,mgruebel,Hitch-tino,7,19 January 2019,"Much is made in reviews about the Tarantino-esque nature of BTER, but this film's homage goes much further back to Hitchcock. A character that seems central is suddenly knocked off at a motel? Hmmmm. For those that complain that this film is ripping off Tarantino, well, Tarantino ripped off Hitch aplenty. And John Williams ripped off Dvorjak aplenty, who ripped off Beethoven aplenty. They're still all good!The story warms up quickly as a set of seedy customers check into a motel exactly on the CA-NV border before the proverbial dark and stormy night. Where all could have gone quietly, mayhem ensues as they interfere with each other's shady purposes. In a way, this film is a horror movie (aka a group of people are confined in a place they can't escape from, and then terrible things happen to them). Just like the director's first feature, co-written by Joss Whedon, ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" also a 7-star film.Great style and set design are definitely assets of this film, with all the customers symbolically checking into the dark Nevada side of the hotel instead of the sunny California side, which costs $1 more. I loved those CA- and NV-shaped room keys!These days, it's not easy to surprise viewers with the untimely death of a character, especially one NOT played by a rich and famous actor (like Sam Jackson in Deep Blue Sea), but BTER actually manages to do so. As a minus point, much of the surprise arises because it seems almost unbelievable that a trained FBI agent wouldn't start out by handcuffing a perp he just knocked unconscious.There are a few such plotholes in this film, but not too many to get really annoying. For example, it's hard to believe that word did not eventually get out that the management is filming customers through one-way mirrors for extortion, and really big fish would still check into the place to be victimized.The film lovingly introduces its seedy characters one-by-one with flashbacks. I enjoyed every one of these, which were evenly spread throughout the film. For some young audience members with smart-phone-age attention spans, this may be a bit much, but anyone who enjoys a bit of backstory to divide up the often brutal mayhem will find this a nice relief. Frankly, without these flashbacks the film for me would be an overly intense sequence of gruesome killings; with the flashbacks, the killings become choreographed mayhem with just enough of a pause to recuperate for the next one. Just like a good horror flick. Kudos to director Drew Goddard for making that time.Another amazing feature is that Goddard manages to impart some 2018 sensibilities to his 1969 period piece, but without heavy-handed political correctness that would be totally out of place for the era. The interactions of down-on-her-luck singer Darlene Sweet with the other characters are handled very deftly.This is a fun film to watch, and I think it will attain minor cult status. It is a bit of a rip-off of various thrillers from the 60s to 00s, and has some improbable plot elements (unlike the Hitch or the Quentin), so 7/10.",Bad Times at the El Royale

So why does Bad Times at the El Royale sound so flat at the end?I bet the writer/director Draw Goddard has envisioned himself here as a new Tarantino, making something like a mix of all his oldschool films. If some machine AI algorithm tried to pick out the key components of Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction, it would find all of them here. But there was something the robotic mind was still unable to extract from the works of the young genius: a tiny little thing called fun.This film is just not fun. The convoluted intro drags, the characters feel invented, and the whole chemistry forced onto us. While the Tarantino stories were sick fun, their ""fun"" part prevailed to a degree when everything else, even the disgusting and otherwise shocking stuff, becomes fun as well. It's obvious that Quentin's guys have the time of their lives in front of the camera, enjoying every second of that bizarre masquerade, and that feeling transgresses the screen and makes you watch the ending credits with a light heart and a smile on your face.Bad Times, however, are just bad at being easy-going, and that unyielding seriousness, combined with more than two hours of running time, just wears you out towards the apogee, where at least something lively starts happening. Unfortunately, Chris Hemsworth's guy is simply not fit to be a sick puppy he tries to portray, not with those pecs he boasts so blatantly and those straight looks that make him such good Thor. He's no Steve Buscemi, and definitely no Samuel L. Jackson. So whatever drama he tried to peddle at the film's finale, it was way less fiery than the El Royale itself.Maybe if the film didn't try so hard to be so off the charts, it would actually be a decent drama/thriller. If it didn't try to be funny too, it could actually manage to pull off the serious part well enough. But, just like Billy Lee had preached to his devout following, Bad Times refused to pick just one side, just one color. And in that multi-layered gamble it started, it has lost. What can I say, bad times indeed.",Bad Times at the El Royale

164,lbowdls,"Fantastic atmospheric, uniquely original film",9,10 August 2019,"What makes a movie great? That of course is subjective and my subjective opinion is that this film is brilliant because it has brilliant writing, great direction, brilliant acting of the whole cast, especially I have to say Chris Hemsworth as a Charles Manson type character. But that's all I'll give away because it's like Forrest Gump type whodunnit and mystery. And the most amazing soundtrack as well. My husband actually thought it was slow- but I hate slow and draggy films so this definitely isn't. Instead it's a masterly atmospheric, Hitchcockian drama. It's definitely more Hitchcock than it is Tarantino, another reason why this is my newest favourite film of this century. There are so many surprises in the story both visually and plotting wise that I really have to dispute those on here who voted it low as to me it's thrilling and original with direction and editing that shocks from beginning to end. I really believe the majority of people will also be thrilled by the highly original story that utilises 'real' history and 'real historic figures'.

165,isaacochoterena,Entertaining,6,5 September 2021,"The film gets off to a powerful start, it cleverly raises the mystery but falls apart in the third act.The film has a good premise that works in much of the film, adding the mystery that is gradually being solved while developing almost all the characters, it has a good balance between satire and mystery, it has good acting, it has good direction, the plot twists are compelling and it has a good production design. The outcome is slow and disappointing, there is no closure for some situations presented at the beginning, the scenes where there are shots are not well done, also the editing in those scenes is bad and some characters are not well developed.In general, it is worth seeing since it is enjoyable in the first two acts, however in the end it becomes slow and ends with an outcome that is not up to the rest of the film.",Bad Times at the El Royale
166,PotassiumMan,Protracted final act sinks this would-be thriller,6,10 November 2018,"Where do I begin with how this film blew it? Frustrating as it is, I have to be honest and say that this film choked in the end because it doesn't know to conclude. That's the bad news.The good news is, this film boasts many strong performances in a nutty crossfire of mayhem that takes place in a quaint hotel on the California-Nevada border in the 1960s. Who are all the people involved? Some are more mysterious than others. Jon Hamm is an apparent appliance salesman with a flare for blunt wit. Jeff Bridges presents as a priest but might have more to his story then when he checks in. Then there's Cynthia Erivo, a soul singer who is still trying to hit the big time. And Dakota Johnson in a fierce role that becomes more complex. Lewis Pullman is the young concierge. Finally, how can one overlook Chris Hemsworth in a Charles Manson-esque role that finally brings out his true range?Unfortunately, this film squanders this impressive talent and acting with a narrative jumble that would make Tarantino dizzy. I understand the utility of flashbacks and developing each character's backstory, but after a while it's done quite haphazardly in this film. It's important for a film to lay a foundation, but when doing so stifles the film's momentum, the effect can backfire. This is not to say there were too many players in this story. Far from it, it was quite lively and exciting. But the narrative component was mishandled such that the film's running time gradually became visible and got me annoyed.This is an example of a film whose labyrinthine narrative proceeds to undo its achievement. If not for a few hiccups here and there, this would have been first rate. Recommended as intriguing, if slightly botched, escapism.",Bad Times at the El Royale

This movie leads several people with more or less sinister secrets to an Off-Road Motel.
From there we see their background and that some (all?) of them won't be able to check out.
The movie switches between the motel (present time) and background.
So this movie is not for everyone....at last not for those who just want to see action.
The actors are all superb. The camera and cut very good.
Best of all (it plays in the 60 - 70s) is the music.

170,MoistMovies,No idea what some audience members expect these days..,8,22 December 2018,"Just another recent movie that is trashed for the most moronic of reasons.
Seems the general audience out there will eat up regurgitated ideas if its in bland uninspired action film, or a comic movie, or a romanic comedy or even most dramas now. But if its stylized , and a throw back to films not made anymore. It's considered copy pasting in a degree i dont see many other films being criticized for doing, which are much more deserving of being called unoriginal. All the unoriginal 'horror' like the conjuring crap. All the reboots and re-imaginings, if they dont suck as just bad films.. i rarely see the shade being thrown at them for being unoriginal... And of course the franchise films like marvel, DC, star wars. Mindless fun sometimes, but unoriginal none the less.
It has similar characters to some grindhouse style/QT films, similar soundtrack choices, the pacing to me was different tho. The dialogue was its own. And to me, just because it pays homage to styles used before, its still definitely it own film. I think so many couch critics were looking for reasons to not enjoy it, after they noticed a small handful of similarities to films they'd seen before.
Just like another recent film 'Mandy' The type of people seeing these films dont really appreciate variation anymore and are looking for any excuse to tear something down for being unoriginal, even tho theres basically no other films being made like them and havent been for a long time now. Who says only one person like QT can make stylized films anymore...? Well it seems a lot of you. What a bleak and judgmental view of cinema.",Bad Times at the El Royale

172,calspers,A mess of a film,4,16 June 2019,"What a confused mess.My life and I discussed, whether writer/director Drew Goddard began and gave up on eight different film projects and had the outakes edited together in an attempt to do it all: comedy, thriller, mystery, musical, soapy drama. I do not spoil the plot by stating that he does not succeed.On the upside, the premise kept me semi-engaged, the cinematography and colour choices felt convincing and stylish, and Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Eviro and Lewis Pullman gave very solid performances. The rest of the cast, including big money makers such as Jon Hamm were mediocre at best. Chris Hemsworth gave a hit-and-miss almost direct rip-off of Brad Pitt in walk, talk, ticks, the whole lot. What an embarrasment for money. To top it off, Hemsworth's character was down-right disastrous and perverse.The film is nearly two and a half hours long, and roughly 45 minutes alone consisted of cheap and unimaginative use of 60's music along with numerous unnessecary musical elements from Eviro, who nontheless sang beautifully.Not recommended.",Bad Times at the El Royale
173,aliases-53334,Ending couldn't have come sooner,1,13 October 2018,"Where to begin... this film started off well. The first 1.5 hours are compelling, creepy, surprising and will catch your undivided attention.
It is true that the director has seen too many Tarantino films. A lack of originality is painfully obvious here, as the film unfolds into an ugly baby of ""Identity"" (strangers meeting in a stranded hotel) meeting ""Reservoir dogs"" and a bit of ""pulp fiction"" and ""Four rooms"".
Having an inspiration is not a crime, ladies, but creating a copycat out of several movies is a badly crime of fashion.
Still, the film was fairly compelling and enjoyable, until dear Hemsworth apeard, around 40 minutes to the ending. 
Somehow, this last, long, tortuous scene dragged the entire film to an empty dark hole of audience leaving the theatre or checking their phones.
No more fun and games! From now on its bad cinema and terrible pretenious cult-leader Hemsworth, shaking his belly abbs in a bad Reservoir Dogs wannabe to a ""cool"" song, preparing to be very mean and violence. It all turns into an uncomfortable, annoying last scene that dragged forever and became sadly pointless as we learn more about some of the characters (details we did not want or need to know) and got a chance of seeing more of Hemsworth's body (at least some eye candy to make us feel better about all this).
The whole film (literally) began smoking up in flames as it tries to show us it is actually about good and evil (?), the wrongs of men, racism and sexism, bad sisterhood, military and war (seriously?) and who knows what else. 
The point is, at this stage, nobody cares. Best part was the movie finally ended in the end.",Bad Times at the El Royale

I was glued to the screen and even though it's a long film I could of sat a little more.

177,silicontourist,A Dark Noir Style Gripping Crime Drama,9,9 January 2021,"It would be interesting to know what film noir movies of the 1940/50's influenced the way Drew Goddard, the films Director, created this very stylish outing. Although the story is not set in the 1940'/50's (its set in late 1968/69; maybe 1970/1971) era that old style of film production is very clear from the outset (not a single piece of modern direction style from any of the late 20th century masters).I have watched many of the film noir style films, having been a huge film buff/fan all of my life, and this did the style superb Kudos! The camera work/cinematography, lighting and design was outstanding and, all of that coupled with the excellent acting from everyone puts it, for me IMHO, in the top 5 films - from the West - for 2018. It will keep you glued to your seat and have you guessing what's maybe going to happen and shock you when something you were not expecting to happen does!No high tech CGI and no flashy special FX etc. Just a back to the entertaining, gritty and thoroughly enjoyable times of what its all supposed to be about. Put a good acting crew together, who can truly feel the story, and you will always have a good result. If you are lucky to put the right director at the helm then, you have an Oscar worthy powerhouse such as this!The only reason I gave it 9 stars is because the length would have been better at the 2 hour mark. The opening 20 minutes was dragged on too long and almost got boring. Also I did not like the blatant, and unoriginal, Charles Manson cult thing going on with Billy Lee (the Chris Hemsworth character) and his followers.

Starting with the plot which is scattered and never gripping and so is its direction. The film is around 2hours and 22mins long and yet failed to provide important details. At points some scenes were good with some nice set design of Hotel El Royale just dissected between the border of Nevada and California, along with fair piece of acting by its ensemble cast but these weren't enough to make this movie through.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Chris Hemsworth in particular seems to be revelling in not being the hero or Mr Nice guy, instead playing someone I imagine is loosely based on Charles Manson, and he is terrifying!There are plenty of twists and turns as the night goes on, but as it does the events instead of building tension or menace, just seem to move along to progress the story and fall rather flat.It's a shame because the film has all the ingredients to be a fantastic thriller, and the cast in their entirety do a great job.

It's pretty cool see one side is California and the other side Nevada.During the end I loved how the story came together. The negative side of this is the pacing of this movie. Certain scenes were slow. This movie had some amazing moments and simply was pure genius. One scene uses a woman singing, while the guy uses her tempo to get something from the floor and the killer is watching at same time. In beginning I kept asking myself why is she singing and the camera pans the room and you see the guy. I thought that scene was genius!Enjoyable but I wouldn't say it is great!

I'm not surprised it did badly in cinemas, where you have to sit through stuff the silly director failed to cut.Irritating, because cut down to 90 minutes it would be excellent.With fast-forward it is OK.I was still irritated by repeated instances of Cynthia Erivo doing a dull practice sing rather than a proper song.

* Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is supposedly a priest, but turns out to be an ex bank robber looking to get the money his brother left under the hotel floor.
* Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) who is supposedly just a hippee that turns out to be some supposedly evil kidnapper that turns out kidnapping her daughter (so she's not bad) that turns out to be someone perfectly fine with killin a cop.
* Laramie Seymour Sullivan (John Hamm) is supposedly a vacuum cleaner salesman that turns out to be a FBI agent or something.
* Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) who is supposedly a singer that turns out to be... oh wait, she really is a singer. c-c-c-combo breaker!!5 people, 4 of whom are fake.

Flynn and Darlene escape because they're good, well Flynn did rob a bank and they both ran away with the money, but meh. Also, Sullivan is an FBI agent with a wife and little kid, and he died, but again, meh. Agent Sullivan notified his superiors, was promptly shot, and nothing ever mentioned again about him or the investigation. It was the most interesting part too... wish they had done something with that instead. but no, seeing Emily with a shotgun and a hostage, Sullivan decides to bump her in the head and not secure the area or the kidnapper so that she can shoot him in the chest. .The movie started off really nice and I felt I was in for something special, but it ended up just being a hostage movie that went nowhere until the end.6/10.

199,SimonD1900,"Intressting, a bit wierd, a lot of attention to detail.",8,16 September 2020,"I have to say I really enjoyed this movie actually and didn't really firstly expect to do so.I've read some other reviews that say this movie is trying to be a Coen movie or a Tarantino movie. Well, sure, it might have some of those vibe. I've heard that expression before also, it's almost like Tarantino has a known style in story telling and movie making that has become a certain genre almost, the same with the Coens. I do find it a bit strange though to say that Coen movies and Tarantino movies are a like, because they're very very different. But maybe people see something I don't.But sure, both the Coen Brothers and Tarantino are directors that made well known names of themselves, with their movies. Because they have such a strong visions for their projects, or work of art is perhaps a better description, that when you watch one of their movies you can immediately reqognize their style, almost right away, that's a very unique ability to have for a director. And when your watch either a Tarantino movie or a Coen brothers movie, you can feel comfort, because you're watching a movie were the director is also the writer, with a strong vision for the whole thing, that they put a lot of thought behind, and that they also makes their movies with such passion, they think of everything. So you're watching a flawless movie, were you can't find misstakes, you can only find new things you previously missed, on second viewings. Very unique indeed, I can only think of a few other directors that has this precision to detail combined with a distinguished style and vision for the whole. Naturally movies like these will have copy cats, like all great art. But remember these directors themselves also most definitely been inspired by others as well, even though they know how to turn it into their own thing, still, most definitely have they been inspired by other movie makers also.I also wonder, what it just is that defines that vibe of a ""Tarantino movie"" or ""Coen movie"" that so often gets mentioned. Don't know, hard to put into words, all though many seem to make this refrense and mostly you know what someone mean when they do. Is it the nihilistic tone? The often morally grey and complex characters? The portrayal of that brutal violence or extremely unpleasant situations actually can be almost humorous? The witty dialogue? The attention to detail? Or maybe nothing of that. I don't know. These are elements I myself believe are used in all Tarantino and Coen movies, but still I also again have to mention, to me there is a very big difference from a Coen movie and a Tarantino movie and I don't believe they can be compared at all in any way actually.What I do think on an other hand, is that Pulp Fiction may have created something back in the day in Hollywood, that made other directors go ""you can do that?"" And that opened up doors and almost created a new genre of movies. And some have tried to make ""a Pulp Fiction"" and failed. And some, even fewer, have actually to some degree succeed too, I really enyojed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for example, one Pulp Fiction wannabe of sorts, that I personally thought worked well, even though not at the same class as Pulp Fiction, still a very enjoyable movie.Anyway, now, after all that long into to this review, let's get to Bad Times At The El Royale. I will review this movie completely as it's own thing and I don't care how much the director and writer Drew Goddard may have been inspired by Tarantino or the Coen brothers, if he was. (He probably was).Bad Times At The El Royale has a bit of a mixed thing going on, it's slow paced but at the same time filled with insane events and action moments that come on after the other, so there is always something going on though it moves kind of slowly, slowly but steady one might say. I think this can give mixed feelings, if either you want one or the other. Personally, I liked it. Though it took me a little time to get into the movie, in the beginning I was very conflicted, but not for that very long.What I also liked about this movie was that it is one of those movies were it's actually impossible to predict what's going to happen. For some people this might even give a feeling of uncertainty or discomfort, in a negative way, which I think is silly if it does, but if you feel like you don't like movies like that were you don't know were its going, don't watch this. I also appreciated that the many things in this movie that at first seemed strange, got explanations down the line.This movie also uses a narrative with chapters and it also bounces back and forth in time a little bit, or in some cases you get to see the same time period from an other characters perspective. This was done very well and never got confusing, it flowed seemingly effortless. How it should be; I don't think a director should take credit for making a smart film, by making the audience confused.The characters in Bad Times At The El Royal are very ambiguous, the only thing you can tell is that there is more about them then they first lead you on to believe. This is this movies biggest strength. And all these characters are played very well by the actors. And that the entire movie takes place within the motel, with only a few flashbacks for the characters that takes you out of it, is to me a type of movie that I personally very much appreciate when it's done well, and it is here.The cinematography is excellent really. This movie actually looks beautiful, even if it's shot in a small space. You can tell the crew put so much detail into the making of the motel also, which I believe they built on set.The only thing I might not have liked about this movie, might have been some parts of the conclusion in the ending, were a lot is going on in one big drawn out scene, which all in all mostly was good. But I don't know, it was fine, so nothing to actually really complain about. Also I thought the soundtrack was very well picked and music actually has a sort of a theme in this movie, which I also liked. This movie was all in all very good to me, the whole thing as a whole. And even if it might have lended some from other more famous directors, to me, it still felt fresh somehow. I really really enjoyed it. I also think this movie is very much worth a second viewing, which a rarely do.Drew Goddard keeps it together here, he keeps it tight and I couldn't find any leakage even with the somewhat convoluted script. You can see he's a director that put a lot of thought and care into this movie and the result is great. I'm very interested to see any new project of his from now on. Cabin In The Woods was also a really fun movie actually and a fun spoof on the horror genre that still stayed a real horror movie in itself while being a spoof. He also seem to be able to work with and get great actors and crew to his movies, so yeah, I'm interested most definitely and will be looking out for upcoming projects of his.I would recommend this movie to anyone that feel they can sit through a 2 and a half hour movie about morally questionable characters and that is up for something new and different but still also a bit familiar. If that description fits you, I think you might enjoy this movie.Thank you and have a good day.",Bad Times at the El Royale

202,Katz5,"Put Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, and David Lynch in a blender",8,13 February 2021,"...And turn it up to ""high."" I knew going into to this one that QT and Coen Brothers were on the mind of writer/director Drew Goddard, whose ""Cabin in the Woods"" is loved by many (but not me). This movie came out a year before QT's ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,"" and makes one wonder if Tarantino saw this, and loved it, and incorporated some elements into his 2019 film (certain songs on the soundtrack, and the hippie cult aspects--although the cult leader in this film is not supposed to be Charles Manson). As for the Coen Brothers, you need a clicker to keep track at how many of their movies have important sequences in motels or hotels - the grungier, the better. The presence of Jon Hamm in a late '60s-set movie also recalls his work in Mad Men, and his character even has some shades of Don Draper in him. It's best not to reveal too much of the plot - but if you view this as a homage to the aforementioned filmmakers, and not a rip-off, you'll have a better time. Jeff Bridges never turns in a bad performance, and he continues his great work here. A character with a questionable past that still generates mounds of sympathy. And Dakota Johnson - quite an acting powerhouse. Following in mom and dad's footsteps for sure. A fun time at the movies - the only drawback being its nearly 2 1/2 hour running time (once again, shades of QT: EVERY main character's back story is explained).",Bad Times at the El Royale
203,tin-B,Just a long commercial for Cynthia Erivo,6,30 October 2018,"It was ok. Although the premise was intriguing, there was no real thriller about it, due to how it played out. It was filled with minutes of Cynthia singing, but the choice of songs were odd for the type of setting and it simply felt like I was being hand led to listen to Cynthia several times throughout the show. A show rather than a story. But it was entertaining. Cynthia is a good musical performer, the songs just weren't right for this movie. It went into minimal detail to explain the background of each character during choice moments which were well-done Chris Hemsworth's character just wasn't evil enough, perhaps more scenes of him behaving evilly would have added the tension this movie lacked. I didn't even care who was on the video they found.All actors did a good job and I would give the best award to Lewis Pullman for his character Miles, the hotel manager.",Bad Times at the El Royale
204,jackson_ro,Bad Times at the El Royale,4,18 February 2019,"It was in fact very bad times at the El Royale, and equally as bad for the viewers. The film feels poorly paced and poorly pieced together. On its own, the characters do have interesting backstories that is worth exploring more, but unfortunately the film never really got into them and requires us to read between the lines ourselves. While that is fine if done correctly, their actions do not seem to reflect stories of their past. The film at times feels a slog to get through, but occasionally has style and great music to make up for it.",Bad Times at the El Royale

206,andrewmerritt-31652,It had so much potential,7,4 November 2019,"Bad Times at the El Royale stars Jon Hamm, Jeff Bridges, and Dakota Johnson, and is directed by Drew Goddard. The film revolves around seven strangers who check into the El Royale each with something to hide. I knew nothing about this movie let alone it didn't even exist, but I happen to come across it, looked at the back to see what it was about, and it looked interesting to watch so I decided to buy it. And the first hour into the movie had me hooked because it reminded me of something out of an Alfred Hitchcock movie. But after that hour, the movie becomes real dull that I began to ask myself what happened? Its is if there were two people working on the script, with each of them deciding should we go with an Alfred Hitchcock approach or do something completely different. But they went for the latter and that to me felt like they dug themselves into a ditch that they couldn't get out of. I'm not going hate on this movie because on a positive note the movie does provide us with an original story, which proves my point that they're movies out there with original ideas. And while this may have an original idea, I felt cheated on because I found this movie, happened to like it, spent my money on it, only for the movie to be a total ripoff. So in the end, even though Bad Times at the El Royale is interesting, its best to watch it on Netflix rather than buying it.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It really was hard to choose the best 10 movies with 5 honorable mentions, it was a very poor year for movies, and I hope 2019 be better than it. Anyways, it was very hard to choose, yeah! But Bad Times at the El Royale is definitely one of the best movies of 2018!Bad Times at the El Royale is directed and written by Drew Goddard, and starring Jeff Bridges, Chris Hemsworth, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson and Cynthia Erivo.Seven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe's El Royale, a rundown hotel with a dark past. Over the course of one fateful night, everyone will have a last shot at redemption... before everything goes to hell.I missed this one in theaters, so when I went to buy it when it came on Blu-ray, I didn't know anything about it but its poster. It was a very good experience to see a movie without knowing anything about it!I found it really unique, stylish, smart and attractive, it still has flaws, but let's start with the good things about this movie:Let's start with the direction, Drew Goddard did an amazing job, I really loved how it was twisted and shot, it has one of the best cinematography of the whole year! He also did a great job with the script as well, only sometimes it gave that impression ""huh?!"" But afterwards I got it!Let's move to the amazing, talented and beautiful performances, everyone was so convincing, I found no mistake with the performances for the whole duration of the movie! BTW the duration was so fitting for this story, though it was 2h 20min I wasn't bored at all! Drew Goddard knew how to make a fascinating, hooking and attractive movie!
Chris Hemsworth is a great Thor, and he can also be a great villain as well.Now let's go to the best thing of the whole movie: THE STORY! It's so twisted -but not confusing- very hooking to the very end, and very rewatchable as well. I won't go so deep about it, to not to spoil anything to you in case you didn't watch it.As I said, it's an amazing movie, but still flawed, so let's move to the flaws of this movie:First of all the first scene of the movie, the death of ""the guy"", it's not very obvious who and why did he kill him at all, I was like ""They will explain this any minute now... Wait for it!"" But nothing happened!!!Secondly and lastly as well, the character of Chris Hemsworth, people were treating him like a god, I know why, but it's not that convincing for me, there is a scene when we get to know everything about it, in that scene I wanted to see more, to get to know more about it, but unfortunately, I didn't!So Bad Times at the El Royale is a very good movie, memorable, twisted and well shot, it has lots of things that I needed to watch in this disappointing year.. still flawed, so I'm gonna give it an A-!Alright, guys.. happy new year, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews.",Bad Times at the El Royale
211,ElliesWonder,Excellent acting. Nonliner Narrative: too many messages in a pot doesn't taste good.,6,27 December 2018,"Cast acting was excellent, every breath and wink depicted a story.The movie is dark, every hotel guests have a secret and dark past (maybe except the singer), and the editing technique is a nonlinear narrative that parallels distinctive plot stories, also narrating past stories into the main plot. The first 25 mins was meh, the entire first hour came with many broken pieces from different characters and the suspense tension was not strong, it barely kept my interest.The most excited part for me was when Billy Lee (The Thor actor) appeared unexpectedly and the following unexpected reverse from Miles. (PS. the actor of Thor is really HOT when he moves his hip and abs 😍) But the character, billy Lee was hard to follow, he only brought out a nonsense heresy story, sexy body and morbid killing game.The movie comes with so many absurds, crimes and cults. It tried too hard to put different elements together like the Vietnam war, the racial issues, hippies and FBI, etc. And I do believe it's trying to metaphor the mysterious hotel belongs to the government, and exaggerated those surveillance recorded tapes, made it a bunch violences. It's over the top and I don't really see a message that is clearly sending out. Overall, each reverse plot brings a little excitement, but never eventually reach the climax.",Bad Times at the El Royale
212,Eclectic-Boogaloo,A good time at El Movie Theater,6,17 October 2018,"Drew Goddard somehow managed to make a mystery crime thriller that satisfied each of the aforementioned genres conventions. Impressive. The acting, directing, music, writing, and set design are all commendable. There were a few legitimately great scenes and a couple of terrific surprises. But the highlight of the movie was Cynthia Erivo, who stole the show as Darlene Sweet, an aspiring singer caught in the middle of the mayhem.Bad Times at the El Royale is a legitimately good film, though the setting, pacing, and run-time, make the second act drag a bit (I got sleepy). The only reason I didn't enjoy it more is that the payoff of the movie didn't resonate with me. Why? I'm not sure... but it may be down to the movies wide focus. I may have needed to spend more time with one of the movies two major characters. Maybe one of them could have been given clear stakes emotionally.

215,DVR_Brale,Highly symbolic and entertaining,7,29 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is one of those movies which start relatively benevolent but then continue to develop a dark story. First you see a couple of very different people getting acquainted with each other at the motel which has a very symbolic meaning since it is located at the exact border of two USA states, one half being in California and the other one in Nevada. I urge you to keep that fact in mind throughout the movie. After the initial setting of the story takes place, narrative starts to turn to past explaining the background of each character separately. That shift from present to past is done abruptly, taking you to the past and then returning to the present situation. That insight about past gives you a whole another perspective on the current situation and relationships which protagonists developed. You can in a sense start to feel sorry for what is happening. At several points you even get a historical perspective on motel; what kind of motel El Royale is exactly. I emphasize this present to past and back turn since it's fundamental to the plot which is evident at the very end.Religion is not central to the movie, but is not peripheral neither; it has a somewhat important role which becomes more obvious in the final scenes. One character being a priest turns out to be important especially in the light of sect and its capricious leader who has ""spite inside his dna"" after they show up. Other thing I want to mention is music; it's very conspicuous and gives a peculiar note to tumultuous atmosphere. Soundtrack is going to be a big plus for you if you reckon it important. Taking everything together, Bad Times at the El Royale is at the same time entertaining and introspective in a way Pulp Fiction is. I recommend this movie, particularly to those of you who like to think about symbolism in the movies since there's a lot of material here!",Bad Times at the El Royale
216,Chrimle,"""I rather listen to the rain""",4,31 August 2020,"The story overall is quite bland, but told in such an unusual manner that it feels confused throughout until the very end. Perhaps it is the premature unveiling for the audience that the story feels very predictable and the audience knows everything in advance of the characters. That is one issue that arose with the movie centring around all of the characters - and they are not very well fletched out, nor appealing. The acting was not at all good, as it was either flat or forced.Some noteworthy directing aspects would be that some parts are not in chronological order and there are also flashbacks giving each character more back story. These were very much needed, but the timing of them ruined the pacing and furthermore, giving characters the first glimpse of back-story so far into the movie was bad move in order to better connect with the characters. So did the drawn out singing sequences as well as the focus on the music playing on the jukebox - a mind numbing move...",Bad Times at the El Royale
217,Jim-Eadon,PC lecture on the 60s,3,26 November 2019,"This is what I would expect from woke film-makers trying to make a cool movie about the 60s.
The opening was promising, but, as is so often the case, nowadays, the movie loses its way. The characters are unsympathetic, except for one who shows up early, but is not around for long.
By far the most annoying character was the singer.
Also there was no chemistry between the hippy sisters and the hippy who turns up later. In fact, there was no chemistry between any of them. The movie was dead, an exercise in copying Tarantino, who himself went drastically downhill after his second movie.
The movie does not resonate at all with what the magical 60s were about, it's trying to foist the PC 2010s onto the 60s.",Bad Times at the El Royale

221,Vivkon,Driven by Dreams,9,31 October 2018,"""Bad Times at the El Royal"" is a spectacular and colorful movie. The plot, entertaining and simple, has some references to ""Indiana Jones,"" ""The Hateful Eight"" and ""the Revenant"". However, in general, the movie is about setting the goals and following dreams. Whoever is driven by dreams and having a big goal, can survive, even in incredible situations. Some of the characters prove this. The greatest mismatch in casting is Chris Hemsworth, whose character Billy Lee is a creepy molester and fanatic of some cult which promotes violence. However, he comes off as sweet, engaging and a bit of a comic persona. Dakota Jones and Jeff Bridges give terrific performances. Cailee Spaeny and Cynthia Erivo are fresh, new faces expressing a great deal of talent.

The dialogue is almost as slick although sometimes the writing lacks the pazaz, and at the end you might feel like some of the storylines didn't go anywhere.The complaints about the pacing and timing are not very substantiated, although the movie could have comfortably cut out around 5 minutes of singing without losing anything (although one singing scene is incredibly tense).The arrival of Hemsworth is where the film loses a lot of its momentum and at times it did feel like the writers wrote themselves into a corner.When all is said and done, it's a great effort by Goddard and here's to hoping that the industry finally recognises him as a great director who can do anything from horror to comedy, and do it all very well.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Good grief, most of the El Royale scenes were enjoyable and I love how they playing the characters nicely.What I don't like in this film is the appearance of Billy Lee and his cult. I just find he seems so out of place and just make the plot (which already quite easy) becomes easier (the penultimate scene also quite a bummer ... by the same reason), and left me looking at the premise and asking to myself, is it really the right premise?

231,palacerevolution2000,Intriguing At First,4,4 June 2019,"A lousy film ultimately. A dash of Tarantino, a dash of ""Identity"", any film about record labels in early 60's. Plotwise, and scenes, characters - all one derivative and clichee after another. there were several sequences of plot that just fizzled out. Jon Hamm as FBI agent - his story was engaging, and he was just 'poof! snuffed out way too early in the film. The whole notion of the heist and initial murder was too vague , and not touched upon often enough during the bulk of film. The sisters...I mean wtf? What actually happened in their life to bring about this desperation. We have a notion, but it is a major story arc, and gets no screen time. Bridges' brother - one important character, albeit in the past; still all we get is a few seconds of him in a mask taking orders. The roll of film - it has no reason to be in the story. I am being very literal and pedantic here, but I wanted to name specific examples.It is also a startling reminder, to witness once again what is considered 'good enough' from the new generation of actors. You can't really blame them, since they are all being groomed for CGI superhero flics. where there is no depth required; where mannerisms go only as far to generate cheap laughs. I'm referring to the concierge/bellhop/junkie. Not a bad actor, but not very good either. The big names did well: Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm. I thought Cynthia was awesome. yes, a lot of her singing. But it was so damn good; the a cappella version of ""You can't hurry love"" was jaw dropping. The plot held absolutely zero surprise. No twists, nothing original. And the last 3rd of film is when the bottom really dropped out. Hemsworth (not sure which one) was ridiculously miscast. I have nothing against him; a fine super hero. But the whole build-up of this character as this invader of minds, this svengali who held all these followers under his spell by animal magnetism and danger; his power of will was absurd. Hemsworth doesn't have a sly bone in his body; he's a good guy, always. He is also one of those actors, who simply can not take on mannerisms that are not of this new millennium. It is in every implied gesture or facial twitch. He had never held a cigarette in his hand, let alone smoke it - why even bother? Hollywood has gotten lousy. Go Euro or Asian.",Bad Times at the El Royale
232,kq999,Best I've seen in a long time,10,20 December 2018,After watching Bad Times at the El Royale I did something I have only done one other time. I started at the beginning and re-watched it right to the end. Not because it was difficult to follow or understand...just that it was so very enjoyable.Film noir influenced. Different from most movies of the last few years. Heavily detailed. Nostalgic. The actors fit into their roles perfectly.,Bad Times at the El Royale
233,filmklassik,A hotel worth checking into - mostly,6,27 December 2018,"Tarantino-inspired mayhem with such by-now familiar QT tropes as chapter headings ... frequent, stylized ""nobody talks like that"" speechifying ... an often digressive narrative ... and, on occasion, non-linear chronology too. All set to the cool soulful sounds of groovy, late sixties funk.Good lord.Now, leaving aside the whopper of a coincidence that gets the story going (colorful G-Man arrives at hotel looking for incriminating film-reel ON SAME NIGHT former-hold-up-man-disguised-as-priest arrives to retrieve loot hidden years before ON SAME NIGHT two Manson-family-types arrive while escaping from their homicidal cult-leader) - leaving this off-the-chart coincidence aside - did this flick REALLY need to be 2 hours and 20 minutes long?It did not.The same story could've been told far more effectively in one-hour and fifty minutes.That said, there are certainly strong plot twists along the way, as well as some excellent performances from Jeff Bridges (of course), Dakota Johnson, and - perhaps surprisingly - from Chris Hemsworth as the charismatic Charles Manson-type.This isn't a bad movie by any stretch. And it's always nice to see a well-produced, straightforward suspense picture with no IP attached (that is, one not based on a book, play, video game, graphic novel or previous film or TV show) being made for theaters. Hollywood used to turn out such ""programmers"" by the bushel once upon a time, but no longer.I just wish this film wasn't so bloated - or so obviously inspired by the work of Quentin T.",Bad Times at the El Royale

237,mallaverack,A wonderful surprise.,8,21 February 2019,"At last, a movie that is beautifully filmed, compelling from the astonishing opening scene to the last. Most of the acting is of an excellent standard, particularly from Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Lewis Pullman and John Hamm. And although a bit on the 'cheesy' side, the performance of Chris Hemsworth is a mile away from expectations.
This film stands out from most of the movies I've viewed this year because it is excellently produced, has a wonderful soundtrack and provides such freshness with its wild and unpredictable story line. I did not know what to expect beforehand but having now viewed what to me is one of the year's best films, the future work of writer and director Drew Goddard is really something to look forward to.
Indeed, a wonderful surprise.",Bad Times at the El Royale
238,bsamad-50088,Started well then.....,6,5 December 2019,"The first 45 minutes of this movie were truly promising and you get the feeling that you going to watch one of the great movies ever , sadly, everything was ruined afterwards, i have feeling that the director of this film Came up with a great and complicated story and created some mysterious atmosphere then with all this complexity he didn't know how to finish it and then just messed it up, first of all the police or agent who works undercover, we never knew why he was sent there ! He was just killed and we left with no explanation and this is just stupid , the hotel is deserted and 5 people just checked in !! This looks weird and after i saw that agent searching for wires and stuff my speculation was that something is going on in this hotel and i was excited to watch what will happen , then he died and story goes on with no real purpose and that was disappointing , the path this story took is just bad , really bad , what was the point? That little girl is in love with this charming men and he was the reason her sister abducted her then she called him when she had the chance and he comes there and some needless violence started to take place ! Is that how you finish a well started story !! They just ruined ! I gave it 6 for the sake of the first 45 minutes!!",Bad Times at the El Royale
239,dschlatter,The Jurassic World of film noir,6,13 October 2018,"The trailer promised a twisted every-man-for-himself scenario full of great performances and unusual storytelling.
First, the strong points: The characters as well as the setting were well-chosen. An interesting mix of people. The performances of the acters, especially Jon Hamm, are solid. The build-up is slow, but that is not a bad thing. As an audience you are patiently waiting for things to pick up (because the trailer suggests, that they will).
But then they never do. (Now come the weak points.) Too much time is wasted on slow-paced build-up. As a result, none of the characters really matters. It's as if the movie refuses to give the viewer the necessary information. The strongest character is Jeff Bridges as an old crook. All the other characters fail to matter. Their story is either untold or it comes too late to matter. Like Lewis Pullman. During the finale we are told, that he is traumatised from the army. Too late.. why bother?
And i can't believe that this hotel just has a handful of random strangers and ALL of them have skeletons in their closet? Unconnected skeletons, even? There is not one random (innocent) tourist caught in this story? Please! 
So why am I calling my review Jurassic World? Because they both have a ton of elements thrown into the story. All of it with great potential. None of them succeeds in reaching the potential. Sadly.
So towards the climax, I was actually relieved to see the story end.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It's kinda corny and this movie is anything but corny. It is the ultimate ""who done it"" that's been missing lately. I loved the cast, the storyline, the set. And while I am a big Chris Hemsworth fan, I hated his character because he played it so well. This is a very well-cast movie with Cynthia Erivo and Lewis Pullman doing stellar jobs with their characters! I really enjoyed every moment of this movie and I didn't think it slow but taking time to develop characters and story. So when things started to move quickly, you have a good sense of the ""why's"". Kudos to the always-good Jeff Bridges. And since Man Men, I've always liked Jon Hamm. To be able to make a good movie like this on virtually one set is amazing.",Bad Times at the El Royale
242,ranblackman,"Needs a solid tone, buts it very well done.",8,18 July 2019,"I liked this movie a hell of a lot. It's epic. The cast is brilliant. It has a ton of dark, twisted, suspense-filled moments of tension, most of which are unbearable in how drawn out they are. The story is complex. Plots move ina and out of each other and are played out steadily and. Engagingly. The only parts of it I am a little critical on is length. I honestly feel this movie is far too long and does throw a bit to much into it. Some scenes felt endlessly tacked on. It also is not the most consistent in tone. It is both a suspense film and an attempt at dark comedy. None of which go together. It even tries to be a serious drama at times, and possibly even an outright horror movie.None of these things are bad on their own. In fact, most of them are done quite well. However, as a film all together, they stand out. Its a shame that these negatives are here and are so noticeable, cause this is a damn good movie otherwise, one I would highly recommend.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It grabs you and holds you...the set is as much a part of the effectiveness as is the acting of one and all. But, sadly, towards the denoument or denouments, the film blows up in various directions, particularly in the Hemsworth-intrusion and the resultant damage to the film. BUT...and this is a big 'but'...Until that occurs, this film has the hallmark of suspense excellence as solidly done as any I have seen in a long time. The rating reflects the film until it crashes.

We have ""vacuum cleaner salesman"" Laramie Seymour Sullivan / Dwight Broadbeck (John Hamm), ""aging priest"" Father Daniel Flynn / Dock O'Kelly (Jeff Bridges), down-on-her-luck back-up singer Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo), hippie-chick Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson), her little sister Rose (Cailee Spaeny), and hotel front desk clerk / bartender / cleaning staff Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman). Cult leader Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth) shows up later in the story.Everyone has a backstory and it's always a surprise. Things are not what they seem! An FBI agent intervening in something he has been told to leave alone is the catalyst for a series of events that gets everyone involved to varying degrees, and the story is told from different viewpoints until the big climax at the end.I thought it was fabulous. The flashbacks and alternate points of view were really well done, the setting was a bit surreal, and the 1969 soundtrack was great!I hope to see (and hear) more from Cynthia Erivo. Lawd! She can sang!
That only major complaint is that the ""brief nudity"" mentioned in the rating is a very blurry (and very brief) view of the spectacular Chris Hemsworth from behind as he walks into the ocean on a gorgeous summer afternoon. That scene alone deserved at least a half-hour of screen time! Come on people!I also found it odd that there's a scene in one room that involved a shooting and the people in the room were very casual about the open door. That wasn't realistic at all, but crucial to the plot. There is also a fire that goes on way too long before spreading as it should have.Other than that, I really enjoyed the ride.Recommended!",Bad Times at the El Royale

Some very intense religious themes, a legitimately obscene flashback, and a completely ridiculous main character in Billy Lee. 5 good 5 bad. Lots of solid killing and some not so solid obscenity. Would not recommend to my parents. On the positive there is wonderful singing and before the action starts it is a great film, Jeff Bridges speaking through the fourth wall is incredibly powerful. Veterans maybe shouldn't watch this- just my opinion. Once again I have to say the Billy Lee character is completely ridiculous and downright stupid. Starts very strong and then falls apart into something bad (obscene).",Bad Times at the El Royale
251,EpimetheusA1,This old heart of mine,9,20 March 2019,"Wow! This film was a wonderful surprise. I'm a big fan of mysteries and suspenseful thrillers and usually if a film (or book) is advertised as a ""rollercoaster ride of twists"" I'm skeptical and eight times out of ten I'm able to spot said twists from a mile away. With this, not so.A group of strangers, each with their own secrets and agendas, sign into a hotel with its own sordid history and as those secrets begin to collide the night becomes a grisly fight for survival.Some twists were easier to spot than others but there are some twists that just knock you off your feet. What I liked were the characters; how no role was wasted and how each character fit into the plot perfectly to lead us to that explosive finale. The music was a nice touch, not overdone and, except for maybe one song, serving purpose to the overall plot.This is a must see for fans of thrillers.

I couldn't figure out every detail of the plot simply by watching the trailer... thats something new.But my God am I glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters!! What a steaming pile of Tarantino wannabe crap. Tarantino is a rip off artist himself but at least he's never boring! Whenever I watch a film I try not to think in terms of is this film good or bad but instead... did I feel anything, was I engaged, etc.Well, no and no! I was bored out of my mind! We started with a beautiful black woman and ended with her alive and well. A lovely site to behold in any movie. But when I say I didn't give a damn about her character I really mean it!I'm not familiar with the actress but calling her wooden is the understatement of the century. From her monotone delivery of every line to the bland puddle deep backstory... I just didn't care. I actually skipped whole sequences where she was singing.I found myself on my phone through entire scenes... listen... when I pick up my phone during a movie, thats a really bad sign. When it keeps happening throughout, well that says it all.Honestly didn't care about a single character... not one. Jon Hamm died? Okay then. Dakota Johnson? Thank God.Lewis Pullman tried his dang heart out and I'm sorry this was his first big role. But on the plus side... he's got his old man's good looks and all american charm -- he'll be fine.This movie was hot steaming, boring, drawn out horse crap. How it got all these big names to sign on mystifies me.Chris Hemsworth for all his undeniable talent and great looks can't for the life of him make a good movie outside of Marvel. He better hang onto Thor for dear life or fire his damned team because he is better than the crap they keep feeding him.What a disappointment.

The violence isn't gratuitous, either, which helps maintain the focus on the actual happenings.All the characters were played well by their respective actors, but I do feel at least 20 minutes could've been shaved off the finale without detracting from anything.Definitely a must see.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Overall nice cast and performances wasted on a stagnant script that is 3 acts of exposition, flashbacks, and singing. Weak dialog. Great production design, costuming, and cinematography. Unfortunately it's all a waste. Some great moments, but mostly lots of missed opportunity. This film isn't fun past the first 30 min and doesn't make you feel anything worthwhile as it drags on for far too long to a boring conclusion. It struggles to stay ahead of viewers as you'll see a lot of plot points coming a mile away. Interesting characters are introduced and killed off with no meaning, but ultimately there's not much reason to care for any of them or their plights.

Bank robbers, murderers, cops, or priests. Whoever they appear to be, they have secrets to hide. In this case, maybe just a little too many secrets.
Bad Times starts with a bang when a man robbing a bank is shot hiding the money. But after that they film slows very much down to almost a crawl at points. Whether it was points that needed to be made, most of the movie is watched just urging the movie to hurry up and make its point. As characters are introduced they try to build long looping backstories, but when you have so many characters and famous actors you got to pick and choose. This movie they didn't, and you felt it.

265,smithpaulusmc,Good Times for Both the Casual and Investigative Viewer,7,19 August 2020,"The most often remembered element of a film is its cast. Writers and directors like the Coen Brothers and more recently, Rian Johnson (Knives Out), have used this truth to their advantage. Joining these visionaries is a new media giant with a knack for strong stories that feature dynamic character sets. Drew Goddard's 2018 work Bad Times at the El Royale is a powerhouse flick that incorporates all the best parts of the quintessential spec script.Bad Times at the El Royale spins the tale of seedy hotel you might assume is haunted for all the mischief and mayhem that finds its way into the well-furnished lobby. The plot revolves around a robbery gone wrong, the search for lost bounty, and a myriad of wayward wanderers who patronize the El Royale on a fateful evening. Every character is pristine, offering dazzling performances without outshining the next. Jeff Bridges is arguably the film's lead as he portrays Father Daniel Flynn, a good spirited man with a mystery surrounding his essence.If there is one thing I must brag on Bad Times at the El Royale for most, it's the brilliance of its set design and color palette. Each shot is vivid and fun. My eyes were transformed by the richness of color across every scene. Even the darkest, most dimly lit sets maintained their own warmth and clarity.
Realistically, there is not much bad to say about Bad Times at the El Royale. My single note of criticism resides with the pacing of the third act. I feel as though the second acts crescendo outweighed its successor. Even though the action drew forth and was ostensibly grander, I felt as though the real story was already behind me. Perhaps a few edits and shortenings would have remedied this issue.Despite my single qualm, this film is not one to miss.

272,wackywhovian11,I only came for Dakota and Chris,5,13 October 2018,"As you can see by my title I only came to see bad times at the El Royale mainly because I am a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and I do enjoy Chris Hemsworth. now that we have my reason for going to see the movie and let's get on to the review. The movie itself it's not really that hard to understand seven strangers go to this hotel in the middle of nowhere and basically throughout the night tragedy strikes almost everyone who comes in contact with this hotel and the individual members staying there. I will admit that the reveal at the end of the movie for me was kind of lame to be honest but I won't spoil it because I don't do spoilers so you'll just have to see for yourself what I'm talking about. like I said in my title of this review I love Dakota Johnson I mainly went to support her but her part was pretty limited even though she is a main part of the cast but she only had about maybe three or four scenes in the movie which was pretty good. Of course Chriss Hamesworth was walking around with no shirt on 90% of the movie which was a bonus but not really necessary since we already know he's a hot guy that was done to draw an audience which worked but kind of tapers off after the first few minutes. I will admit that the film is interesting but the plot itself really didn't captivate me because like I felt the ending was lacking in the shock value of the movie itself. I kind of wish that they would have developed Dakota's character a little bit more because when you watch the movie your left with a lot of questions that are left unanswered but like I said I don't do spoilers so you'll just have to watch it for yourself. And the singer I felt like she was in the wrong place at the wrong time situation but no spoliers.
 Now the one positive note that I do have about this film is it does have a great soundtrack now the girl who plays the singer she was really good. Her singing it was very very on-point I loved it and it does have a lot of great music from the 50s and 60s. 
 Admittedly even though I do love the Dakota I wish that I had waited and saw this on Redbox and save my money to see a stars is born but you don't know if it movie is worth watching until after you've watched it and honestly it's not worth going to the theater to see it.

Stupefyingly slow, garish, idiotic characters and plot, grotesque violence, rampant cruelty, a grotesque man/underage girl sex subplot, and enough beefcake to populate several 1960s sword and sandal movies.

Does anything come of the two way mirrors and recording devices, not really. Do we ever find out why the FBI was there, no. Ok so that whole part of the story is pointless. Then there is the cult thing, the robbery thing, the sniper thing, and most innocuous the singer thing. It comes to a boil at the end but who cares at that point.

Loved Cabin in the Woods and Drew's work in general, but unfortunately this is way, way off what it should have been. With a firm editor and some zip in the dialogue this could have been a nice 90s-Tarantino-esque noir, but as it is it is a collection of tiresomely overlong scenes held together by a storyline that is far from engaging on any level, and with a heavy tone ill-fitting the material. Every scene could (and should) have been slashed by 25% and nothing would have been lost (well, an awful lot of singing). There are no crackling verbal exchanges in any of them, and despite what remain good performances from an excellent cast, by the end (and maybe the 33rd or 34th flashback to another character's backstory) I just wanted the lights to come up and for it all to be over. 5/10 for the acting, a couple of good moments/surprises and the look of it, otherwise it would have been a 2 or a 3.

277,Anttell,Mixed feelings,6,22 October 2018,"Drew Goddard's directorial debut, The Cabin in the Woods, was something I really enjoyed, and because of that Bad Times at the El Royale was a bit of a letdown for me. The first half is really intriguing and mysterious but I didn't care for the third act, I was expecting something bigger/twistier/crazier from the plot ala The Cabin in the Woods after a promising start. The last 45 or so were a bit of a bore for me. The film isn't a comedy though, so maybe TCITW isn't the best possible comparable to begin with.The film has a good cast of notables mixed with a couple of less known names including Cynthia Erivo who has a pivotal role and whose musical background is on display - she'll also star in Steve McQueen's Widows so she's definitely up and coming. Jon Hamm's probably my favourite here though, not because he's better than the rest, but because he's in a lot of the scenes I really liked in the film. With Chris Hemsworth it's the opposite.All in all, Bad Times at the El Royal is a mixed bag for me.Rating: 6/10",Bad Times at the El Royale

280,TheJohnnyPHreak,Character Driven Thriller That's Not What You Expect,7,18 December 2018,"Drew Goddard was at the helm of one of my favorite movies of all time. Cabin in the Woods is a film I make sure everyone I know has seen. Even if they don't enjoy horror movies. I saw The Martian late. As in I didn't get to see it until it was on cable. But I enjoyed it. This was without the notion that Goddard had written the film. (It's also the best Ridley Scott film in a year, another topic for another day) I was totally confused when I heard about Bad Times. I wasn't sure what it was going to be about. But when the name Drew Goddard flashed at the end of the teaser trailer I almost screamed: ""Sign me up!""After writing that, I have different thoughts I need to spill on the film. I won't be going into much plot detail. The less you know about this film the better. The film is about a group of people who stay in a hotel, a semi-famous hotel that is on the border of California and Nevada. But when night falls all hell breaks loose. The film is brutal, it's vicious and it's a character driven. The story unfolds from each character's point of view. In many instances we see the same few scenes happen from different perspectives. The whole film has a very Tarantino feel right down to the title cards of each chapter.Don't expect anything, but I didn't see a lot of things coming. I was kind of shocked at some of the places they go with the story. Goddard's direction is excellent. There are some good tracking shots, a few nice tracking shots and the opening scene is very well edited. The focus is on these characters, so we got to know deeply. Others don't get as much storytelling. The film would have been even longer if they went in-depth with each person in the hotel. This also one of those films where the smallest detail might mean something larger later.Jeff Bridges is fantastic as a preacher who is not what he seems. There's a deep dive into his character through mostly dialogue. The film seems like it was built around him. There's never a dull moment when he's on screen. Even if he just talking about food. He entertaining and so intriguing. Alon with Bridges a stand out is Cynthia Erivo as a singer just looking for a bigger break. She the heart and part of the soul of the film. She stands side by side with Bridges and is his equal in every scene. (Just to mention she's great in Widows as well) I hope this helps her breakout because I want to see her in more. Plus, she's got a damn good voice.Newcomer Lewis Pullman (son of ID4's Bill) is a scene stealer. His character gets the best evolution in the film. His story takes a while to unravel but when it does it adds so much weight to the story. Dakota Johnson seems like she's having a good time as the tough as nails with purpose. She doesn't get as much screen time as I would have liked. Jon Hamm is playing a role he's played before which is okay. His character is somewhat predictiable. And I know that Chris Hemsworth's character is the big unknown of the bunch but it very much seemed like he was only hired to play the pretty and crazy. I've seen him do both better.The film is dialogue heavy. Many times it's just to explore the characters. There's not much exposition. Which is nice. The story unfolds on screen as the characters are finding out what's going on. There is a few time jumps when we see what lead these characters to the El Royale. We are not really given a year. The information handed out is assumptions. One of the assumptions is about McGuffin that shows up about halfway through the film. Even when the credits roll not everything is solved.I didn't know what to expect with this film. What I got was something different. It's an old-school style character-driven thriller. There are many threads and mysteries to unpack. Not all of it gets explained. But it has a few very excellent performances, a great soundtrack, and some nice camerawork. I'd say this one is gonna play well with the film geeks on blue-ray. It does get me excited for what Goddard has up next.",Bad Times at the El Royale
281,getconedproductions09,Bad Times=Good Times,9,5 February 2019,"Bad Times at the El Royale:
Written and directed by Drew GoddardBad Times at the El Royale is a movie that needs to be seen to be understood. It was sold on its mystery. The movie has a large cast of characters that each have their own secrets that affect the trajectory they find themselves in. All points converge on the El Royale hotel.Trailers are no longer sold on mystery. They show you pretty much everything or they deliberately mislead you. This movie's trailer on the other hand is vague enough to lay the groundwork for the mystery element. I'm intrigued movie. Let's see where this takes us.Right from the get go, you have a very Tarantino vibe to the proceedings. The conversations are vibrant with colorful prose. They spent a good bit of time getting to know each other. The characters are the home. The movie wants you to get to know them as much as possible before their secrets begin to rear their ugly heads. Not everyone will go for the dialogue heavy opening. This movie wants your patience. It will reward your patience as well.The production design of the hotel/motel was fantastic. It was just so beautiful and deliberate. The camera moves smoothly. I might have mentioned this before but I love when camera work is smooth. Now of course fluid camera work does not always work for a particular story but the jumpy work especially when it's not needed takes me out of the film. I just appreciate when the cinematographer is exceptionally well versed at their job. In this movie they are. The person behind this exquisite work is Seamus McGarvey. I tip my hat to you.The performances are all top notch. You get drawn into what each story has to offer and the movie is methodical in its approach. Each character's story is important and really the converging of these stories is really the point. The history of the hotel is prevalent in each story as well. There are so many mysteries to explore and so many webs to weave.This is an excellent movie. I really dig Drew Goddard's work. His first film was The Cabin in the Woods and that was a terrific break down on horror movies. He was also the showrunner on the first season of Daredevil and man I really love that first season. I give this movie an A.",Bad Times at the El Royale

283,cinemawithcj,Bad Times at the El Royale - CInema with CJ Review,8,1 December 2018,"Bad Times at El Royale is Drew Goddard once again being a brilliant writer/director. Amongst other things he made the meta-horror-comedy Cabin in the Woods which I pleasantly enjoy, and now he's brought us what is essentially Four Rooms if it were consistently good, and with even more Tarantino/Rodriguez feels.An ensemble piece that keeps you constantly tense, Bad Times could stand to be a little better paced, but goddamn does it grab you.It certainly helps that every actor is on point here. From Jeff Bridges to even Dakota Johnson, they breathe life into a diverse cast of not exactly role models.The true highlight of the flick is how the story is told. Many other parts of this film can be celebrated, whether it's the music or the brilliance of match cutting or the design of the El Royale, but it's Goddard's script that makes this all work.Through all its quirk of the setup, when it gets to the big events and how they unfold it holds you until the credits finally roll.There's just something about the episodic nature of the developing plot, and how plot threads are spread out across the rooms before overlapping and intersecting and seeing the same events through different POVs in effective succession. The narrative continues to give this broader, fleshed out feel that also piles on the reversals and interesting divergences. Much like Cabin in the Woods, Bad Times keeps you on your toes and it's all the more rewarding for that.It's a strong two hour package, full of life, intrigue, tension, twists, turns, and sudden outbreaks of violence. Bad Times at El Royale gives you that mid-90s indie crime thriller feel with all the DNA of the interesting screenwriters in Hollywood of that era and beyond. A must for fans of (Drew) Goddard, Tarantino, Rodriguez (when he was good), the McDonagh brothers, and so on.Not quite perfect, but it scratches that itch for some legitimately good film.",Bad Times at the El Royale

285,pinemaples,Good Times at the El Royale,9,18 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is a mystery crime thriller written and directed by Drew Goddard, and features an all-star cast including Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Cailee Spaeny, and Chris Hemsworth. The movie starts out like you might begin a joke: a priest, and hippie, a singer, and a vacuum cleaner salesman meet at an empty hotel. What follows next is a crazy story of deceit and duality, where nobody is who they seem to be.
The El Royale boasts a very distinct, Tarantino form of style and story structure, broken up into distinct chapters that each focus on a different character. These characters are where the movie really shines. Jon Hamm is likable as always. Jeff Bridges does some of his best acting in years, and his patented mumble of the past decade is gone; I haven't heard him this articulate since Tron: Legacy. Dakota Johnson plays another subdued role, but still proves that she can act when she's not chained down by bad writing and directing. Chris Hemsworth has never been more intimidating, and I've never heard him put on a better American accent. I want to draw special attention to Lewis Pullman, who, despite being relatively new to the screen, gave perhaps the best performance of the movie as the meek hotel clerk Miles.
My complaints with the movie were very few. They all boil down to a couple scenes that drag just a bit. Other than that, Bad Times at the El Royale did not disappoint in the least.",Bad Times at the El Royale

287,df4205,A well balanced mystery romp,10,9 August 2019,"I'm one of those people, who within 5 minutes of meeting each character I can predict the entire movie from then on. I know who the villain is, who will die, what the 'twist' is...etc. So I really enjoy non-linear out-of-sequence movies like this, especially when they're done well. And this one was done amazingly well. It plays to the 'puzzle' aspect of a mystery, you're given one piece at a time, and have to put it all in the proper order, and I for one like that. Rather than being handed the answer from the get go. All of the actors are spot on with their roles and with how they play them out of sequence. Allowing room for their character to move from a jerk suspect, to a figure of sympathy and trust without it seeming like a bi-polar mood swing. I really wasn't expecting much from Jeff Bridges as he always just seems to be playing The Big Lebowski again and again, but he managed to push it aside...for the most part. Chris Hemsworth surprised me as well, it was nice to see him playing the villain role. He managed to impart just the right mix of creepy, menacing, crazy, and intelligence into the part..and a villain needs those things. The movie also maintained a great balance between the time spent developing each character. Yes, as the leads, you spend a good deal of time with Jeff and Cynthia...but at no time do the other characters feel short-changed because of it. Great movie, well worth a watch (and a few re-watches!). If you're a fan of suspense and mysteries (especially puzzle mysteries) you should give this a go through...highly recommended.",Bad Times at the El Royale
288,GoldenBlunderbuss,A visual spectacle as tense as it is beautiful,8,4 November 2018,"'Visually stunning' is the first thing anyone will say about this film, which should be closely followed by 'incredible storytelling' and 'amazing soundtrack'.The story left me physically aching from the tension and exhausted from the near constant twists and turns (in a good way of course). Multiple unexpected revelations and occurrences gave rise to audible gasps from the audience. The moody and neon lighting helps to accentuate the dark tones of the narrative and underline the subtext during the key moments of the script.Everyone is given one last shot at redemption before all hell breaks out on a single fateful night at the once grand hotel. Subtext around shackling yourself and loved ones to a single way of living (a religion, a job, a mindset) is prominent throughout the film but builds to a climax in the film's phenomenal final act - tense doesn't come close to describing it.This film deserves to be seen more than it has - I had to travel some way to go to a cinema that was showing it, and I'm so glad I did. Bad Times at the El Royale will likely make it into many lists of top films of 2018, including my own.Best quote: ""It's a game. It all starts with a simple choice. Which side are you on? Right?

292,jg_1977,Good times had seeing Bad Times,8,13 October 2018,"First off let me say, Bat Times at the El Royale is most certainly not for everyone. The way the story unfolds and how information is withheld/presented is quite complex. Although this may make it a bit too convoluted for some, it makes it an absolute treat for anyone willing to dig beneath the surface and get analytical. Not unlike Cabin in the Woods (Drew Goddard's directorial debut), Bad Times plays with your expectations. Goddard takes painstaking care to build tension throughout a scene, only to have it all upended by a sudden twist. For that reason, I anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what will happen. However, if you are a fan of Goddard's previous work, it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. I also need to talk about the cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance. Each person plays their part incredibly well, but Cynthia Erivo and Chris Hemsworth are the definite stand outs. Hemsworth especially shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy Norse god. This movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see it again.

Brilliant, witty, quirky, original, violent, complex and perverse, it was a fun roller coaster and perhaps the best movie of the year. Think Pulp Fiction meets Killing of a Sacred Deer, but rather than being derivative, borrowed only the best aspects and built on them to make an original masterpiece.Everyone put in an award winning performance, but I have to say I thought Lewis Pullman, who was supposed to have only a supporting role, stole the show.

On other levels it exposes human failure, pure evil, weakness, hate, brainwashing cults etc. Many layers of failure and victory.

John Hamm, Jeff Bridges, the superb Cynthia Erivo and Dakota Johnson are among the folks looking to check in to the establishment that has clearly seen better days. Over the next hour Goddard whisks the audience through a beautifully edited series of vignettes that add back story and context to the characters, whilst somehow managing to expand the all-pervasive air of mystery.Yet this cannot last and the film careers away into the desert of great failed film ideas the moment that Chris Hemsworth's Manson-light cult leader pops up on the scene. What had seemed like a delicately balanced series of potential conflicts, where nobody is quite who they appear to be, and no one is sure of coming out of their predicament intact, becomes a ponderously plodding slog through action movie cliches. Ultimately, the whole affair has a whiff of Tarantino hubris about it, slick and smartly executed, but this masks a rather soulless and mechanistic narrative motor.

BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALEAll of us have secrets. All of us seek redemption.But what if the secrets are deadly and the redemption is phoney?In Bad Times at the El Royale, writer/director Drew Goddard takes us to a run-down hotel/motel on the border between California and Nevada (near Reno) in the late 1960s. The border is more than geographical, it is an existential border between lives that could be and lives that are.The 'prequel' opening shows a man burying a bag under the floorboards of one of the rooms. Ten years later ....Four travelers arrive: a traveling salesman (Jon Hamm), a priest (Jeff Bridges), a singer (Cynthia Erivo) and a mysterious young woman (Dakota Johnson). Each of them appears to be something other than who they claim to be. Even the motel clerk (Lewis Pullman) is a bit off - he is preoccupied by something other than his simple duties.What happens in the next 2 hours and 20 minutes is a roller coaster ride that starts slowly in order to build up to its dramatic moments so that it can get over that peak of background detail and start the real ride. And while Reno had very little rain in the 1960s (its yearly average has nearly doubled in recent years due to the fake global warming) its yearly average rain falls in one night soaking the characters and their shimmering world.It is difficult to review a movie when almost everything you can say about its plot is a spoiler. So, let's forget the plot - it's just a vehicle like the cars you ride in on the roller coaster.The real story is the interaction of the iconic characters that Goddard takes from classic film noir movies: the good/bad guy, the beautiful and beautifully talented victim, the child-like bad girl, the break-the-rules cop, the killer seeking redemption and finding it only through doing what he does best, the charismatic psychopath cult leader - yeah, there's a lot going on in this movie. All of this is wrapped in up in reflecting mirror paper that gives it all a House of Mirrors quality.Vaguely reminiscent of a score of film noir classics, but still its own wonderful mixture of crashing iconic plots, Bad Times will take you to places you have only nightmared about.Finally, it has one of the best juke box scores of any movie in recent years. With more than a dozen hits from the 60s, many of them sung by the impeccable Ms.Erivo (who won a Tony for her performance in The Color Purple), Bad Times is - ok, I gotta do it - Bad Times is a guaranteed good time for you.

309,eclarkdog,Very good ensemble flick..,9,28 June 2019,"This is the type of movie that one should go into with no expectations. And really, unless one reads a bunch of articles on the movie, one likely has little idea what it's about before watching anyway. That's the idea. That's the way it should be.For comparison, think about movies like ""Hateful Eight"" or ""Two Days in the Valley"", but set in the late 60's. The movie does a great job at portraying this setting, even though with the exception of a few flashback scenes for each character, most of the movie is set at one location - the hotel El Royale.With that said, plenty of action, shocks and twists here. But mainly this movie is about the characters. Who are these people and what drives them to do what they do? Are they who the say they are or who we think they are? Are they bad, good, or something in-between? Those questions essentially drive the plot and leave the viewer guessing much of the way through.Technically I found the movie almost flawless. The production, acting, music, screenplay were all excellent. The movie clocks at almost 2.5 hours, not unlike many epics, but it does not feel like it at all. Every minute is entertaining. I've always like Jeff Bridges, but sometimes he can be a bit hammy. Here he is perfect. Cynthia Erivo, who I've not seen before, is excellent. But special shout out goes to another actor that I've never seen before - Lewis Pullman - who plays a young clerk at a seedy hotel with a surprising past. I just read that his Father is Bull Pullman..interesting...I see this young man having a similar interesting career.In closing, this movie may not be for everyone. It's not conventional. If you like Tarantino's stuff at all though, you will certainly like this movie. Honestly. while 7.1 stars at the time I write this is not bad, I'm surprised the score is not a bit higher, but again, it may not be everyone's cup of tea. If you like your action/crime movies with a little bit of thinking involved, then stay at the El Royale.",Bad Times at the El Royale

311,Andrew_Wiper,"Entertaining, well-acted and worth your time.",9,24 October 2018,"Bad Times At The El Royale was written and directed by Drew Goddard (The Cabin In The Woods). He likes those longer titles doesn't he? The less you know about this movie going into it, the more you will enjoy it! I'm sure other people have stated this in their reviews as well. So I could talk to you about certain scenes in the movie and certain characters that do this and that, but that would simply ruin it for you. All you need to know is this is definitely worth watching in the theatre. It is fun, it is violent, it is an interesting watch. I was never bored watching this one, so there ya go. It's set in 1968, the music is good, the acting is very well done and Chris Hemsworth proves here he can play other roles besides Thor, and quite convincingly I might add. The setting at the El Royale is done in a way that really accentuates that whole 60's vibe. The movie was well shot and yes it is Tarantino-esque. That is a good thing! Go watch it. 8.75/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
312,DylanAnglin,Bad Times at the El Royale Review,7,12 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale was a movie I was looking forward to. I had heard from people this was similar to a Tarantino movie, and I would have to disagree. The film follows a group of strangers as they check into the El Royale hotel, each with their own secrets and past to be revealed. One thing I can say is that the acting and cinematography are on point, with Jeff Bridges being the star of the show. The story itself started off ""fun,"" but as the film progressed it felt like a slow burn. The movie tries to give you twists and turns, but with everything going on, it's easy to be distracted from what the movie is really about (which honestly I'm still not sure), and as the movie came to its conclusion, I felt sorta confused and still had more questions then I should have had. Bad Times isn't a bad time and can be a good time if you give it a chance, just don't expect anything amazing. 7/10",Bad Times at the El Royale
313,fmbr-1,Tarantino by another name,8,21 February 2019,"I'd never heard of this one until early this year, and then I heard of it from three different sources all within three weeks. So, I thought I'd see it for myself.Unfortunately, I wasn't really in the mood for a Tarantino-esk film, and this really is. It's got cute little cuts between the main characters, lots of flash-backs and a big serving of both psycho and violence.Despite all this, I still thought it was very good and if you are a Tarantino fan, you should probably like this film. Plus, look out for Miles, the desk clerk, who is played by Lewis Pullman, the son of Bill Pullman.",Bad Times at the El Royale
314,self-username,Slightly overrated but tolerable,6,31 October 2021,"The movie's slightly overrated, should be in the 5.5-6/10 range. It's pretty slow and doesn't have a great story, but the screenplay and setup of the story save it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
315,jezfernandez,"Amazing start, but then what...?",6,5 January 2020,"The set up for Bad Times is deliciously intriguing. Four guests arrive at a deserted motel, check in to their rooms and get up to all kinds of perplexing activities. There are a couple of scenes that are completely left field and you think this is going to be an amazing ride. Unfortunately, director Drew Goddard tries too hard to do a Tarantino, and he simply hasn't got the flare.The pacing falters in several places, especially in the third act where Chris 'Torso' Hemsworth shows up, principally to show off his abs. He's a villain, but not a particularly menacing one, and the peril factor never quite clicks.The extensive use of music is vintage Tarantino, but it's overdone here and often feels like an excuse to sell a soundtrack album.At 2hrs 15mins, Bad Times is at least half an hour too long, one of the most interesting characters is killed off far too early and you're left wondering what Goddard's point is.Bad Times isn't a disaster, but it is a big disappointment.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The acting, sets, dialogue, themes, etc are all incredible, near perfect. The only complaint I've seen that I can actually call legitimate is that the pacing is too slow. I certainly didn't feel that way, but I can admit that it is a semi slow burn, however, the climactic explosion (metaphorical) that is the ending more than offsets any pacing issue.

Good lord, the folks who hated it know nothing about the art of film. Kudos to Goddard. History will be kinder to this film than the initial reception was.There is nothing linear here. That includes the dramatic structure. Things slow when you expect them to accelerate, they explode when you expect a pause. The editing and cinematography are world class, and the sound track is a perfect evocation of the time period, avoiding the easy cliches but not drowning in show-offy deep tracks.There is so much to admire and little to disrespect. Jeff Bridges, as always, sizzles. Erivo is a revelation. And Helmsworth? Who knew he had this much. Ending was a bit too abrupt, but for nearly 2 1/2 hours, for me the time flew. Gonna watch it again next week.In the end, like one of the great Tarantino's, you just get on the roller coaster and enjoy the ride.",Bad Times at the El Royale
319,ashishagupta,"Finally, a really good movie. If you are over 30 you will doubtlessly enjoy it",9,22 December 2018,"With a few exceptions, this movie should be entertaining for almost everybody. For those who enjoy cinema, this movie delivers in spades.Style:
This movie is to most other movies out there as Soul and Jazz music is to Pop music. You gotta have a bit of style in your bones to feel it.Multi-layered narrative:
The movie is brilliantly written. It has many layers in it. To the credit of the filmmakers these layers are beautifully subtly intertwined with the narrative thread. It manages to cram in several culturally relevant topics of late 60s America into the movie. Many viewers may well not even realize the social, cultural, and political commentary in the film and think of it as merely a crime thriller.Cinematography:
The cinematography is awesome. Most viewers will easily spot the homage to Tarantino's movies in this film. There are other references as well.Music:
A lot of good music. Again there is nothing in the movie just for the heck of it, there is a reason for it. The lyrics of a song underscore or complement the ongoing scene. This is just so satisfying as a gripping conversation between the characters unfolds without a word of dialogue.Acting:
Excellent acting from the entire cast.Thriller:
Take my word for it, just go see the movie. Don't spoil it for yourself.Multi-Dimensional Characters:
Pretty much every character is 3 dimensional. How amazingly refreshing is that!
Kudos to the writers and film makers.Respect:
The film makers show respect for their audience. The characters are deliciously flawed. Not a single event feels forced. There is no action scene for the sake of action. Any viewer would do the same as any of the characters if they were in their shoes. So the story feels real and therefore really thrilling.It takes a lot of writing effort to drive plot forward with believable characters. Anyone can create an action scene with stupid people doing stupid things. But to create a thriller where everyone is smart and doing smart things and right things. That is exceptional.Go see the movie!",Bad Times at the El Royale
320,johntheholder,the title they chose ironically warns what you're about to watch in a sense. Generic ( but good),7,29 June 2020,"I thought of "" Fast times at Ridgemont high "" when I saw the title. Thats the only connection those two films may have , but that said it is a fair warning that something has been copied here.The problem of course is Tarantino in particular. This is a Tarantino film not made by Tarantino. It is good yes , but something is off when one thinks about it. If we ignored film history and what has been done till now , then watching this film with fresh eyes I think most reasonable people will agree that it is fine.
Production is fine , nicely detailed costumes and scene sets, nice direction , nice cinematography. Acting is just fine with the exception of Chris Hemsworth ( not his fault perhaps) that was just too much. The story is nice as well. It's just that its not that original like I said , thats the only problem. We 've seen too many films , we want something else , not just good. 7/10",Bad Times at the El Royale

Still, the comparison is made because the parallels are there. This isn't a knock off, the director adds his own stamp to the proceedings. Being compared to Tarantino is no bad comparison though.It's true that this film isn't for everyone. A lot of the scenes seem to just be filler to make the film longer than it needs to be. A lot of things are set up with no apparent pay off too.

329,rightkeith,Excels where Hotel Artemis failed,8,22 October 2018,"About 4 months ago, I sat through the relatively unheralded movie Hotel Artemis. If you compare Hotel Artemis and Bad Times at the El Royale on paper, you have essentially the same starting point for a movie- mystery/crime/drama takes place at dingy, retro hotel, a bunch of shady characters, each with their own room and varying motivations who serendipitously come together on the same night resulting in violent repercussions.But that's about as far as the similarities go. Where I found Hotel Artemis predictable, clichéd, and lacking depth, Bad Times at the El Royale exceeded. The characters and events may have been just as far-fetched, but El Royale actually had style and made it believable. A nod to the casting director here. Each role was made for the actor who filled it. Jeff Bridges could've breezed through this one and collected a check, but he brings an intimacy I was not expecting. Jon Hamm, Chris Hemsworth, and even Dakota Johnson played their parts well. The music choices were clever and fit the setting.El Royale genuinely surprised me. A few times. This movie had a terrific format of giving you an answer, and then asking the question. Multiple times we are shown answers to questions before we even knew we were asking. The movie does plod along at a methodical pace, but I took the time to absorb the atmosphere and ponder the mystery. When the violence does hit, it is abrupt and matter-of-fact, a refreshing 180 from the typical drawn-out Hollywood fight scenes.There were some flaws, but nothing really worth carrying on about. 8/10 stars for this surprisingly enjoyable flick.",Bad Times at the El Royale

331,sugarnspices,What happen?,4,18 August 2019,"I was under the impression this was going to be a more of a ""who dun it"" kind of mystery. I wasn't expecting a wanna be Tarantino film, not knowing what it wanted to be.The movie started off great, the characters trickling in and their interaction (mainly by Jon Hamm) was entertaining. There was enough mystery behind the characters and their reason to be there, plus the hotel itself was its own interesting character.Sadly this movie started to go down hill once Jon Hamm was suddenly killed (and his affairs never mentioned again). The sisters and the cult? The woman and her singing...over and over and over again? Ugh. Don't get me wrong, she has a beautiful voice, just not sure why she had to have so many solos in this movie that seemingly had to do about nothing.By the time Chris Hemsworths sexy self showed up, the movie was a complete snooze fest. I actually drifted off for about 10 min when he tied everyone up. The feral sister did nothing for me, and I couldn't care less about her and her sister and this cult leaders ""back story."" The 5 min scene of action hero and sniper ace of little Miles was too little too late and just there so he could then kill everyone for our two ""main characters"".All in all, the 4 stars are for the first 45 min -1 hour and Jon Hamm. But overall, this movie was completely random and didn't need to be made. They couldn't decide what they wanted this movie to be. An FBI/secret agent crackdown? A Manson/cult storyline? A robber/fresh out jail inmate finding his lost fortune? A cover up for 60's senators? A singer wanting to hit it big solo? Why and how did they just happen to all come together on this random day in this forgotten hotel?Who knows.",Bad Times at the El Royale
332,Money4Nothing,There can only be one Tarantino,6,15 October 2019,"Drew Goddard, I'm sorry my man... I have no doubt that you're a talented filmmaker but don't do this to me. There are people in every industry that are so unique that they're industry for themselves... There's only Picasso, only one Rolling Stones, only one Mahatma Ghandi and only one Tarantino. This movie is not too bad, if it wasn't trying to mimic Tarantino style I'd probably give it 9/10, but since it's just a bland attempt of that style I can't do more than 6.Oh and Cynthia Erivo is absolutely gorgeous",Bad Times at the El Royale
333,Yee_Reviews,Wannabe Tarantino Film,6,1 October 2018,"Good: The time period 1969 provides a great stylistic approach to a hotel that has property on both California and Nevada, which adds to the idea of having a good side and a bad side and the hotel also creates a sense of entrapment. The cinematography is great as it makes slow pans to unveil the secrets of the characters and the El Royale. The hotel, costume design, and soundtrack help create a nostalgic setting. The directing and editing are also well done when incorporating sound/music to scenes especially when Cynthia Ervio sings. Erivo's musical performance is filled with heart and soul and helps develop the character and conveys her emotions. Other standouts are Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth just has a charming presence and provides the slight dark tone of his character. Bridges plays his character well as he connects with Erivo and tries to execute his actions. However, the rest of the cast have trouble making their appearance known...Bad: At a whopping 2h 20m runtime, the film is a slow burn where it takes a painstakingly long time to make it to the end and even the finale becomes a disappointment. At times it tries to be funny, but the humor is not a standout in this film. There is a lack of emotional pull to the characters which is evident in the finale where the characters are still not fully developed. The concept was there, but the creativity lacked, which ended up in poor execution. Overall: Style over substance. I wanted to like this movie for the trailer was great with its editing, soundtrack, and cast, but does not live up to Drew Godard's directing predecessor ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" or have the writing creativity from ""The Martian."" The film reminded me a lot of Quentin Tarantino films as it was divided into chapters and had the same style with flashback stories to gain background, however, I would rather watch ""Hateful Eight,"" or any of Tarantino films that have excellent dialogue and action.2.9/5 (Not fresh)",Bad Times at the El Royale

He is the best writer/director of our time. The reason why I mention this is because I have seen no other movie similar to a Tarintino film, until El Royale. There are only two differences, first the dialogue is not as well written. This is not to say the story isn't great because it is. I mean the dialogue between the actors is a little less crisp as it would be in a Tarantino film. Second, it's not as violent. It sure has its moments, however any fan of Quentin will no the difference.Now for the movie itself it is best to not know much. It feels much shorter than the actual length. The intertwining stories are all engaging, even though some are better than others. The acting is fantastic!! Anyone who says the acting was bad must not know the difference between good or bad. Everyone feels perfect for the role they play. The casting director honestly deserves kudos. There is a small twist at the end I did not see coming. I think I would call anyone a liar if they said they did.All in all if you like a Tarantino style film you must see this. Even if you like the style of his films, but find his dialogue offence, you'll prefer this. It was a wonderful surprise. I would rank it in my top five of the year.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Lewis Pullman is the star of the show, he is clearly taking after his dad Bill. A great performance. 
As for the rest of the film, the story is clunky and retold from different points of view throughout. The supporting actors are not brilliant, Jeff Bridges is showing his age a lot also.

Also the start is a bit slow and takes some time to find itself. Also the third act although probably the best act is a bit predictable. All of the performances were great, some of the best I've seen from bridges in years and probably near the best performance from Chris hemsworth I've seen tbh. The cast is Stella and I would have loved to see more of John Hamm's character a bit. What did annoy me, and I believe it was intentional, that not all things were filled in and require you to fill in the blanks. There is this running thing about a film reel with someone on it, and we never really find out (sorry spoilers), and that really annoyed me as it could have led to a neat twist or something. Maybe the director was trying to make us think and wants a sequel or something. As for the soundtrack it was amazing, with some very cool tracks. The direction and cinematography was good and it was just not a bad movie, but far from perfect. It could of dealt with a shorter run time. Also my major gripe with this film is that it's plot feels very convuleted. It keeps doing flashbacks and different perspectives from things we've already seen, and it inhibits the ability for the plot to progress as we are just seeeing the same thing over and over. It really takes you out of the story and it loses its momentum. But overall I would recommend this film, but maybe go see something like first man or a star is born instead as those are better in my opinion, but this is still a nice watch.

Thirdly story is well written. It makes you wonder about the future of the happenings. I couldnt guess it easily that's the best point in my point of view.

I can not recommend this movie enough.There was very little to not like in this movie. But there was one thing, that I really really didn't like. I didn't like the whole thing about the cult. It was stupid as hell. But, it would have been tolerable as a back story. However it didn't remain as a back story. It spilled into the present (the story's present). Then it became even stupider and unbelievable. And, it really pissed me off when the girl chose the cult over her own sister. I think it was a very bad decision by the writer. If not for that I would give this movie a 10. I still want to. But, as soon as I think of that, I can't let myself. I wish I could give it a 10 total, and a -10 for that.

It's worth watching this film for its opening half hour alone.What follows doesn't disappoint. There is a criticism that a couple of singing scenes are overly long, and that may be the only weakness of the entire film. Whether you like the story or not, whether you like the characters or not, the whole thing is consistent and believable, and makes for a compelling experience.It's a credit to the writers that the characters are multi-dimensional, that their actions are entirely congruous with their backgrounds and futures, yet can't be predicted. Elements of the backstory are revealed, adding context for current actions, but the viewer is trusted to fill in other gaps themselves.This is a superbly written film, beautifully shot, exceedingly well acted and entirely recommendable.

This one has been solid in the first half, came to its peak at the three POV narrations of the first gun shot.
After that, the story slowed down, and it turned to a setup of a Tarantino climax, except there wasn't a real climax, instead we saw an presentation of why only Tarantino can make those scenes: you need a writer to create intensive dialogs, and actors like Samuel Jackson and Christophe Waltz to carry it.

There is a subplot about the FBI, and one about a 'Charles Manson' like dude who also seems to be a child molester, this wasn't necessary there should have been some other way to end this movie without using young girl who was sexually abused and her sister trying to save her from the ""Charles Manson' dude. Unfortunately this is who we end the movie with, it started as a movie about a bank robber returning to get the money his brother had stashed, and 4 people staying at what turns out to be a possible mafia motel, all there for different reasons, then we get a lot of flashbacks, which sort of help flesh out the characters a bit, but did nothing for the movie. They could have left the flashbacks out and not hurt the movie at all. As I said we really didn't need Chris Hemsworth prancing around barefoot with his shirt open all the way and his hip hugger jeans. That 'Charles Manson' like character ruined the movie for me, couldn't we have had the mafia or a random police officer come in at the end instead? Really the movie is about things going wrong for pretty much everyone in the movie. Then there was the music, music from my formative years, but there was just too much of it, the music and the flash backs just seemed like fillers in what could have been a better movie.

A remote and vacant motel which resides literally in the middle of California/Nevada border gets one day four guests at once: cocky salesman (Jon Hamm), black songstress (Cynthia Erivo), aged priest (Jeff Bridges) and tense young woman (Dakota Johnson). They all have dark secrets and ghosts from the past in their minds, and even young motel clerk (Lewis Pullman) makes no exception...Better-than-average ""Tarantino"" -copycat with its surprising twists and characteristics of the period in question, made especially clear by almost constant playing of brilliant rock/soul hits from that golden age. Acting is by and large satisfactory at least and what comes to violence it's as ruthless and pitiless as to meet anyone's expectations.But just as surely BTATER shuns away from a 'masterpiece' status right from the get-go with its ridiculous premise: why this particular group of people exactly at the same time? There's problem with some characterizations also, Pullman's and Erivo's eminently: the former being psychologically too unbelievable, and latter mandatorily made once again to this one and only ""good person"" of the whole bunch just because the actor is black (female).Still, what comes to that mysterious and politically/nationally most sensitive film reel, I think from the three choices the only one who's reputation even the governing elite might find necessary to protect posthumously could be none other than Martin Luther King.",Bad Times at the El Royale

So why not a higher grade?
There are really a lot of side stories and context that are left sketched, which is perhaps obvious as there are many of them, perhaps too many for a single movie. The Director respects the characters enough to give them all their due, but would have needed much more time (or less characters) to fully pull it off. The J. Edgar Hoover ""state within the state"" FBI, segregation, a Charles Manson-like cult, the scars of child abuse, the disposable in the entertainment industry, even the Vietnam war.

Man, can that woman sing! She's a great actress as well. Jeff Bridges is fantastic in every movie he's in. The kid who played Miles Miller was lovable.
His back story surprised me, but then the drug use all made sense. He was trying desperately to escape the pain of his ""sins."" Chris Hemsworth was awesome as the sexy, charismatic cult leader.

The first 45 minutes is diabolically slow. The next 1.5 hours felt like an eternity. Somewhere between realising I'd seen it before, and the end I lost the will to live. The characters were wooden and by the end you didn't care who lived and died. A run down motel spamming 2 states showed promise, then I realised I was watching a bad re-run of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. Unlike a Christie thriller, the plot here was hard to follow, perhaps because you've lost the thread due to boredom. Top rate actors should have been enough to save it, but not even a shirtless Hemsworth was able to save it. Some seeing it with me said they saw Tarantino, and this is perhaps why I hated the result. I was bored rigid by the time the wooden characters checked in. There was violence for the sake of it, in order to over the paper thin plot, terrible direction, stiff acting.

There were a couple of reasons this movie persuaded me to go and see it: the incredible cast, the plot, the setting, the vibes I got from it, etc. Now I've seen it and I can 100% recommend this to every fan of the genre.It really is a twisted experience when I come to think of it. During the opening scene it feels like you are watching an action comedy, then it turns into a spy crime thriller, then into a drama, then into a psychological thriller and it finally just explodes into a violent action fest. This movie had me guessing so many times and nearly each and every time I guessed wrong...and I loved it! From the moment the first body hits the floor you know that no one is safe, and that's a feeling that I absolutely love in movies and series. The characters are all exactly how they need to be: the likeable ones are likeable, the evil ones are entertainingly evil and there were a couple who I litteraly could not stand, but that's the whole point of the movie so I chose not to let it affect my opinion. The movie is filled with secrets and questions and you just have to accept it and let it flow, which is great!Now the big issue I do have with the movie is the occasional slow pacing. The movie starts with a bang, but then when the characters need to be introduced, it does take its time, and I do mean reeeaaally take its time, here again I noticed some Tarantino vibes. However, this is not like The Hateful Eight where it takes 90 minutes for the story to get somewhere, here it is litteraly only the first act that can be sloppy. The pacing does improve after a while and after that it's enjoyable fun. It also does take a long time before the actual villain is introduced and the final fight is entertaining and all, but it feels a little bit too rushed and also one character makes an extremely stupid choice which lead me to just facepalming myself. The movie also ends quite emotionally, which is fine, but I am not sure if it was right for this kind of movie, it felt more as if it should have ended on a fun or weird note, rather than on an emotional note.Still, this movie entertained me a lot and I can perfectly imagine me seeing it again. I can recommend it to everyone who loves a good old fashioned action/comedy/thriller with some very good acting and a lot of surprises!I give it a 7.5/10",Bad Times at the El Royale

So it was quite dissapointing.The style is on point, the camera work is excellent, all the actors are pretty good, and the plot is interesting. It just slowly starts to lose it's punch. It's a bit hard to pinpoint what exactly it is, but I feel like there are a lot of scenes that are a bit meaningless and some scenes only go halfway there.For example Rosie, who is probably a psychopath, and it's quite interesting and it's a strong scene when she coldly betrays her sister, or don't care about gambling for her life. That scene t could be much more emotional, but it's just half creepy, and we don't really get any explanation why she is so un emphatic for her sister and overly emphatic for Hemsworth character.
Idunno I just feel like if Tarentino did this movie it would have way more substance, and also stylish action scenes. The action scenes here were okay, but nothing huge.The first half of the film was pretty cool tho, so it was a nice try at the genre I suppose.",Bad Times at the El Royale

All the beats, all the flashbacks, all the music.The acting was good, but seemingly dialed in at the same time.Even the ending was one that came at a boring pace. If I hadn't seen it before in many other movies I would have liked it more.I kept expecting a twist, but just got twists that I saw coming, and I really hate seeing the twists coming a mile away.If you haven't seen a movie like this before, you will probably enjoy it.

408,Ska4Live,Your worst time at the El Royale,6,21 October 2018,"Worst time for You at the El Royale
I do sorry for your time, folks, if you decided to watch latest Drew Goddard - ""Bad times at the El Royale"". 2 and half hour of absolutely boring and tensionless screening, who tries shows to you meaningless hotel with flat clients. Each one of them has its own story...Well, at least screenwriter tried to write some stories. But they are so primitive and full of black holes that all you can do sitting on front of big screen is just yawning.
My lord, how I sad about Jeff Bridges and Jon Hamm. Mr. Bridges. This man, ""Dude!"" deserves much more than this ..empty movie. Hamm trying his best, but unfortunately his character - SPOILER ALERT - dies after 25 minutes.
Dakota and Lewis performance was weak no matter how hard they tried to do best.
But worst idea ever was to create from Chris Hemsworth some kind of leader of cruel hippie cult who acting as Joker(DC)+Steinsfield (Leon)+Silva (Skyfall)....anyway this is so dumb. 'Thor Oddinson' looks weak with his ideas and absolutely non scary, but of course female part of audience will be looks at his muscle torso. Overall this movie has very slight antagonist.
Cynthia Erivo is the true only one positive side of El Royal. Her acting performance together with vocals is stunning. Darlene Sweet character probably has full portrait. We understand her motives and decisions during film. Well done!
Oh yeah, few more things to mentioned. I give my credit to Michael Giacchino for amazing music and Art Department for beautiful hotel design.Generally, Drew Goddard doesn't show us anything worth. Except nice and shining but empty box, full of Hollywood stars names by it's sides.",Bad Times at the El Royale

BUT, here the last 40 minutes or so come, completely ruining it all with the introduction of that moronic Billy Lee character and a huge stepping down in tone that makes the movie feel like a teenage flick.

They must be younger than myself at age 62. This movie at 2 hours and 12 minutes always had me guessing. Just like Pulp Fiction is jumps into each character future, past, and present. But unlike Pulp which is more comedic this movie is a really scary ride the further it gets! Hat's off to all of the actors on top of their game and all of the research that went into this period piece that takes place back to the Nixon days right down to yellow phones, FBI, orange lounge couches, and seedy old run down Vegas/California Holtel's! And the soundtrack is fantastic even involving Barry Gordy and the Muscle Shoals band backing up the singers back in the day and I hope that's not a 'spoiler' IMDB.

Highly entertaining and unique. Numerous times surprises startle the viewer with unexpected action or plot changes. Bridges is superb as are most of the main characters. I expected a ho-hum movie and was delighted to watch a great one, worth more than the 7.2 rating it now has on IMDB.

416,irrelevantlife,An Intriguing modern mystery-thriller that is full of surprises,8,26 April 2020,"This movie is a masterclass in suspenseful development, bringing to the table a rock-solid cast of veteran actors and newer faces. Blending interesting story telling and engaging characterization the movie's plot unfolds in an unexpected way, enticing the viewer to keep watching for it all to unfold.Appearances can be deceptive and this movie employs this tactic to set up an arena of sorts where the characters at the hotel are forced to come to terms with their reality and forge interesting alliances.Bridges and Hamm are excellent in almost everything they have ever done, so and this in no exception. What really surprised me was Hemsworth's performance! Hemsworth's character comes out of left field and enriches the tension of the plot, and the Australian actor nails it this time around, delivering a very believable performance, proving that he isn't just a one trick pony who usually gets type cast as an action hero. Lewis Pullman is also very effective as the nervous hotel clerk who is hiding more than meets the eye.The female cast is nothing short of amazing, Cynthia Erivo is especially effective as the struggling Afro-American singer with a golden voice. Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny play well off each other as two sisters with a dark past.
Mixed together this becomes a total package of intrigue, suspense, interesting characterizations and ultimate pay off. What more could you ask for?",Bad Times at the El Royale
417,NjFabiano,"Very good. Not great, but better than expected...",8,2 June 2019,"I went into the movie with low expectations. You could tell from the trailer the plot was going to jump around, which it did.It was VERY Tarantino-esq. the multiple timelines, a big ""reveal"" that never gets revealed. Violence, etc..I'm not always a fan of multiple timelines, but I feel this director did it well. Most of the sub-plots were lengthy enough where it didn't feel out of place. The acting was very good. Jeff bridges is classically great. Jon Hamm is very good (wish he had more screen time throughout), and Hemsworth played his part perfectly. The characters were all very believable.SOMETHING was missing from it that could've really pulled the movie up. I'm not sure exactly what it was. Still a solid 7/7.5, it was just lacking a LITTLE bit.
Possibly the ladies in the movie. I didn't really care for Cynthia Erick as the female lead. Or Dakota Johnson for that matter. They didn't do a BAD job, but I feel the casting could've been better for those two.All-in-all: Worth the watch FOR SURE. Exceeded my expectations, and it's a fun movie.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It was only the last 5-10 minutes that really warranted watching. Jeff Bridges was, sadly, only bearable, Jon Hamm's appearance was, perhaps, all too brief, and beloved Hemsworth seems only capable of Thor and SNL. But I have to say that the lady, Cynthia Erivo, is the shining exception that stole the show from her costars with both her standout acting and soulful singing.

420,loveminuszero000,Best movie I've seen in a long time,9,1 January 2019,"This movie right here is old school. This is the kind of stuff 90's teens/twenty-somethings judge other movies by. The movie wasn't spectacular, but it was good. It's miles above anything that has come out recently though, so by comparison, it's a solid 9. Finally, a writer that understands the importance of character development. I kind of get the comparisons to Tarantino but not really. People who are saying that haven't seen any old school Tarantino for a while. I actually enjoyed this more than QTs work because it wasn't too flashy or contrived. QT's work can get a bit bogged down by paying homage to too many styles. The music in this was also much more cohesive than a QT soundtrack, and it was understated. I really loved the soundtrack and how it focused on the Motown/R&B music of the time rather than the tired old 60s hits that are in every movie set in that period.Jeff Bridges gives another brilliant performance. Cynthia Erivo was excellent and I felt her singing added to the movie and wasn't too much at all. Dakota Johnson and Jon Hamm were great as well. Chris Hemsworth was a little one dimensional and not quite believable in his role but I blame that on the state of today's Hollywood. The setting was perfect, the cinematography perfect, it had a real plot,(finally), and the acting was fantastic. I gave it a nine because it didn't have any ""wow"" factor.

There was a female singer that sings American idol type of songs, not my style but to each his own. There was like 5-6 times where she sings super loud with no other noise for 60-90 seconds.I just hooked up my loud speakers and I wish I didn't, I kept having to turn the volume down and even had to skip through scenes with the singing by the end.

432,AustinSober,Good Times with a Few Slow Waiting Periods,8,21 November 2018,"This is definitely one of the most memorable crime thrillers I have seen in recent memory. A solid cast brings life to seven strangers who all converge on a hotel, all with there own agendas that end up intersecting both inevitably and by mere coincidence. You will see the film from one character's perspective and then film gives you a title card to cue you to another character where you will often see previous events from a different angle. If you were expecting everything to tie to together into some upspoken mystery or twist who will likely be disappointed. There isn't much of a central plot. It's multiple plots just crossing threads. Luckily, they are all pretty interesting. This is all aided by an excellent presentation. I am a sucker for a well edited and shot film and this is probably the best this year in regards to that. Best of all, it doesn't feel like a modern-day film. It kinda feels like something that would have come out 20 years ago. Some say this has a Tarantino or Coen Brothers vibe to it and while I can see that, the script isn't nearly as punchy as something they would write. Not that the film is badly written. And the retro musical choices were all spot on. The film's one weakness is its length and, at times, its pacing. Clocking in at 2 hours and 22 minutes...I think they could have cut 22 minutes out. This movie just felt long and I saw this on the same day as ""First Man"" which had the same length. That could be my issue. I shouldn't have seen two long movies in the same theater on the same day. I need time to process what I have just seen. I need to wait a day at least. But, I still think they could have trimmed the film. There are a couple of sit down dialogue scenes that could have been snappier in my opinion. Still, this was a very well made thriller and I will likely check it out again.

436,dpaterson-2,A Screenwriter Spider Got Drunk,1,22 February 2020,"This is an entirely worthless film with more flaws, red herrings, and film gobble-de-gook than any ""7"" rated film imaginable. My image is that the screen writer / director, Mr. Drew Goddard, got drunk, became a spider (consistent with the film he was about to make), and spun about a half dozen plots -- one in the corner, one on a window sill, one outside, etc. Being still drunk, he hauled them in a grotesque empty hallway and spun them all together.I appreciate very much the actors trying to make something of this. They all tried very hard and were entirely professional in the attempts. But they were all trapped in webs that made little to no sense.1. Who are the ""owners"" or the outside FBI group or whatever? Leaving this completely unaddressed and finally abandoned is irresponsible, especially if the response is, ""didn't you figure that out"" or ""ooo, that's the mystery, isn't it.""2. Just FYI, check all the ""goofs"" listed. Embarassing.3. Gratuitous use of the Vietnam War and a mini Gone-with-the-wind array of bodies is unpardonable, especially when it concludes with the mouse character sinking to his knees to beat the catholic penance theme to death.4. The male misogyny throughout is unbearable, and the entrance of Billy Lee with his abs to his hips as objectionable with gratuitous violence as his fake 60's Charles Manson knock off cum Once Upon a Time . . in the woods messiah trash.5. The layering of time a la Pulp Fiction serves only to lose us in a story about a robbery we just don't care about -- esp with the low-rent Point Break masks.6. What is this wretched motel / hotel? anyway Because we never find out ""the owners"" we can't really know. But really. Did any of he patrons have a reservation? Can anyone just walk in and stay in this Woolworths Chainsaw Hotel?7. How does a 70-year-old Jeff Bridges priest suddenly become super geezer and take out the bad guys -- for a looooooooong time as Darlene and Miles reverie the past for at least 3 undisturbed minutes. Well, one way is to get that gray-wigged stunt guy in there quickly.8. And be sure that the fire that is raging has no smoke whatsoever because, you know, this is an unusual hotel.9. Returning to the misogyny, how does Emily get Rose away from the evil Billy Lee and drag her tied and gagged into this particular unusual hotel? Even more, how does Billy Ray get to the door where Priest and Darlene are just making their escape (and ending the film a half hour early -- please, please). How does that pivotal coincidence happen? Perfect timing. Almost like the script writer / director knew it was going to happen.10. But since the script writer cut his teeth on a long series of ""Buffy"" movies and clips, we should not expect reasonable actions. Ever again.11. So, all those who have rated this at 7 or above, please reflect, then go back and lower those ratings a lot. The only reason for this high a rating of such a mess of a film is that the cast and crew and all their friends logged in their 10's.

Then things start happening, a (to me at least) shocking death and from here on it just sinks in deep. The events that unfold stop to seem like shocking twists and just start to feel like amateur writing to find a way to explain things and making the plot move forward. And I won't even mention the way Chris Hemsworth is actively introduced in the whole thing. It's pathetic, believe me. Even with all that, I have to praise the acting and directing. They almost make you forget about all the bad stuff, so much so that I started writing this review giving this movie a 6 and only by really thinking about it to write this, I had to drop it to a 4.

Goddard demonstrates that he is one of the best directors working today by making a plot that relies on the wonderful seven characters he created. From Darlene Sweet to Billy Lee Goddard creates characters that you not only care about, but that seem real. I feel like if I was unlucky enough I could end up at the El Royale. Thats a feeling most movies can't make you feel.

455,curran-55613,Weird but very good,9,14 October 2018,I loved this film but I don't think it's for everyone. I knew nothing about it before going to see it. Basically it's about a bunch of people that end up staying in a creepy hotel and only 2 survive. Chris Hemsworth and his body make for pleasant viewing 😉,Bad Times at the El Royale
456,davedflores,"Great time, watching the Bad Times",9,30 October 2018,"With quite a few movies coming out this fall, Bad Times at El Royale stood out in 2018. With little information given about the film, only knowing that well, bad things happen at El Royale Hotel, it takes the audience on an interesting ride, discovering more about each character.
The film starts on the had-been famous El Royale Hotel, that is split between the middle, half of its occupants being in the state of Cali. and the other Nevada. After a group of residence settle in the hotel for the night, strange things begin to happen and we discover more about each person in a series of flashback and different sides of the same story. It ends with many characters different than when they walked into the front doors of the hotel.
The movie makes you feel like you know very little and that you are dependent on the progression of the film to answer any of the questions that you may have.
It makes the audience think about things that happen at different points in the movie and how they are all interconnected, from characters you meet in the very beginning to ones you meet at the very end.
Written and directed by Drew Goddard, it shows many of his strengths. As a writer, his ability to have many layers in a story shows very solid, as he has many different characters each with their own distinct features and stories, all ones that stick out to the audience. As a director, he was able to put his vision onto film very smoothly, putting the story into different segments, ones that flow very easily.
Edited by Lisa Lassek, she is able to piece together the different stories of each character. Something done well was the different titles of the room numbers and characters, as it showed the focus of each part of the film, helping the audience have a sense of who it was revolving around next.
Lastly, Seamus McGarvey was the head cinematographer. With a film like this, lighting was key in storytelling. It drew the audiences eyes to different parts of the screen, highlighting characters to chow their emotions, moods and motives. In scenes that took place outside in the rainy night, the lightening flashed, adding a great dramatic effect.
If anything had to be done differently about the film, it would be the involvement of the later characters, earlier in the film, which would of helped build in the finale of the the movie, as the audience might not feel as connected with a very important character.",Bad Times at the El Royale
457,jimwww,Pretty much a Masterpiece of filmmaking..,8,27 October 2018,Sound Design is incredible. Focus puller knows what he is doing (finally in a film). Actors dream to be in a film like this with the range needed for this film to be believable. Beautiful singing from Ms Sweet. Quality of each and every part of the film is incredible. Trailers do not match the film. We are denied watching Chris Hemworth walking in the rain.. but see it in the trailer. Very much in the venue of The Hateful Eight. DOP is wonderful but not consistent. Flashbacks are spot on of what you would remember of your past. The thought process behind this film I see on the screen. Go see it on the big screen. I suspect it will not translate on a smaller screen.,Bad Times at the El Royale
458,ihyousf,"Long, boring and uninteresting",3,7 January 2019,"This movie is simply too long. The first half the movie is really slow and almost nothing interesting happens. You could only watch 3 scenes and skip the rest, you wouldn't miss much. Second half is somewhat better, but it's still too slow and dragged. And the singing... my god the singing. This is when I just started fast forwarding scenes. Much better way to watch this movie and it allowed me to finish the second half in about 30 minutes. People who are rating this 9/10 must be either really young or paid trolls. If you want to watch an interesting hotel/motel movie, go watch From Dusk till Dawn or Four Rooms. Both Tarantino classics. If you would watch them today for the first time, they might be a little aged, but it would still be alot better than this crap.",Bad Times at the El Royale

461,briner8397,Why so violent?,4,28 October 2018,"I saw ""Bad Times"" because of the motel/neon/noir setup and loved all that, but the party was spoiled by over-the-top violence - sudden, loud, and excessive. The gratuitous violence pretty much ruined this movie for me. It would have been eight stars from me but descended to four stars overall.",Bad Times at the El Royale
462,lilac-31582,"Pretty good, but no real point to the movie.",7,26 December 2018,"The music, the cinematography, the hotel, the acting, spot on! We were on the edge of our seat. But you knew who was going be the killer at the end & having a killer wasn't even the point of the movies. Which leads me to saying, there wasn't a point to the movie at all. Just a bunch of different peoples lives coming together for a series of unfortunate events. But I love Jeff Bridges, so that's that!",Bad Times at the El Royale
463,ailishcrombie,"It is good, but a bit slow and convoluted at times!",6,17 October 2018,"This is a good film if you like thrillers but there weren't as many twists in the tale as I would have liked or was expecting. Cynthia Erivo is a fantastic singer, however there was a little too much showcasing of her singing at times and I don't feel it added to the plot! Chris Hemsworth was a very convincing baddie and was both amusing and terrifying, sometimes both at the same time! Jeff Bridges was brill as always, and gave a very complex performance. There was also less violence than I was expecting but this maybe suits some viewers. The plot itself was a little confusing and at times over the top. Overall it was a good watch but a bit slow to build to the main action.",Bad Times at the El Royale
464,jamesshugart-58518,Don't know why the critics don't like it,8,23 July 2019,"This movie revolves around the interactions of several hotel guests who each have something to hide. It is very similar to the Hateful Eight. The movie could have been shorter and some scenes are too long, but the amazing cast, who all give excellent performances, combined with the witty and captivating story, great soundtrack and shout-outs to 1960's era problems more than make up for it. Takes a bit to get into the movie, but once invested, it's really captivating. I went in with lower expectations after seeing critic reviews and it surpassed my expectations. It's a fun, if not perfect, movie that plays on some tropes, and has enough of an interesting story to justify the exceptional cast.",Bad Times at the El Royale

468,giox-76380,The Hateful Seven,8,1 November 2021,"I did not expect this movie to be this good. I really enjoyed this fun movie especially the 3rd act. Chris Hemsworth was great as a villa in even though he isnt in the movie much.The acting in general was great and there were some other very strong performances, one obviously being the man himself, Jeff Bridges.The movie has a lot of the same feels as the Hateful eight. I myself loved that movie a lot so when I figured out this movie had the same style I got instantly excited. And that excitement didnt disappoint.The story slowly unravels following different point of views from the main characters. Its done in a fun way giving us new information every time, and it all slowly leads up to the 3rd act. The tension rises and you have no idea how the protagonists are gonna get themselves out of their predicaments. When they eventually do, its done in what I believe to be a great way.It all felt a bit like a typical Tarantino movie and there was absolutly some violence to be found in this movie.At last, I thought that the flashbacks used in the film were done really well, giving us some great backstories about the characters. Especially the last one I enjoyed very much!All in all, this was a very entertaining movie right up my alley. There for I would rate this movie a 7.9/10.",Bad Times at the El Royale

470,Mistrcoffe,A very very good watch,9,5 July 2019,I passed by this many times and then decided to watch it because Jeff Bridges is in it. He was Jeff Bridges awesome. I really enjoyed how it cut to vignettes to show the events that led up to the climax. I had not seen Cynthia Erivo or Dakota Johnson before but I am now a fan of both. I kept thinking I had some things figured out and then I would find I was wrong. There were moments I did not expect at all and they were holy cow moments. I would say it is worth a couple of hours.

474,wileyschmitt,Tries too hard to be great,6,14 October 2018,"It wasn't bad, but good might be a bit of a stretch.

475,irogov,"Made well, but for whom?",5,1 February 2019,"It is not a bad movie as such, as it is executed with style and pushes all sorts of your emotional buttons with agility. .There is no believable story behind it, or rather mish-mash of criminal fiction, with cartoonish characters.Yes, ""Pulp Fiction"" comes in mind right away - with all its over the top, absurd violence and social caricatures, yet Pulp Fiction revelled in dark, sadistic humour; setting it from a start as postmodernist theatrical showpiece.
This movie takes itself too seriously, almost like the current crop of social justice warriors believing in their mythological studies more than in facts. Is this movie made for this sort of public? As for me there was no suspension of disbelief to start with and disappointment at the end.

Each actor gives an amazing performance, bringing this tight screenplay to life, no scenes feel wasted as everything in this film plays an important role and all off it gradually builds up the tension and opens up new mysteries. With that the secluded setting adds extra tension and style to the film paired up with an amazing score which throws you into that time period. This is a definite recommend if you like old school mysteries and Tarantino films",Bad Times at the El Royale

Movie is sewed from well known pieces but surpassingly for most of them time it works quite well. Good acting, strong characters few unexpected twists and decent cinematography makes it worth watching even if naive ending will disappoint you.

The twists and turns and scenes from every characters point of view really help this plot develop. It is a very engaging film, and well paced by starting out slow and getting more intense as the adventure captivates you. The only part that confuses me is why this didn't even get an Oscar nomination for best writing/adapted screenplay? This tightly written film is a true must see!",Bad Times at the El Royale

Don't really know why I've waited so long but glad to say I wasn't disappointed! A great cast playing characters with interesting back stories. Jeff Bridges is perfect in his role and Chris Hemsworth almost steals the show later on in the film. At almost 2.5 hours long it's a little slow in places but it didn't feel overly long.

Most movies are pretty easy to figure out in the first few minutes. This one had surprises to near the end. Hemsworth had the best role I have ever seen him in. He plays a nasty character and does it well. Johnson also had a role where she pulled off the ice cold character. Erivo had the most sympathetic character and nailed the role. Bridges was solid like he has been many times before. Pullman played his character well. Spaeny played the creepy role perfectly.

Everyone has their lives as due to their lives they end up in the same place and things starts to happen. I like this kind of film because I think its more real to me. Like a real life. We are where we were because of our decisions, our fate. But only one thing bothered with this movie, espcially twords ending, noticing that THIS COULD BE A WAY BETTER MOVIE. Because it has the potential. The main idea is so good that you can always do better.

The reason is the pacing for this movie is just right, the film make you in between the line of care or don't care with the character, and what makes me choose this is definitely the unsuspected badass kid and a concluded ending. For those review who said what's the point of this movie should watch NCFOLM and you'd be thankful for this movie.I know some would say that NCFOLM is gold, the best of the century, if you don't understand and don't like the ending than i should stick with Marvel movies etc but it's just not for me.

Such a great first 45 minutes with loads of genuinely good moments. The rest played out like a hundred other movies I've seen where sadly, none of the clever twists promised eventuate.
The opening grips you within seconds and leads to a murder but the perp is never identified, or even alluded to again in the following 2 hours. The hotel being on a state line, one of the big plays in all the hype, has literally the most tenuous link with anything that plays out. Seriously the hotel could have been in any state that allowed gambling in the '60's. No clever story around this Red Herring. I thought the bellboy/staff may had been the young robber at the heist, would have been an interesting development - he had been waiting at the El Royale for his payoff for years - nope another false lead. Infact this is what the movie provides in spades, Red Herrings. You as the viewer are looking for clues, all the way through that you think will all come into play in the final scene. There are none, don't waste your time. I expected so much more from the guy behind the Cabin in the Woods, one of the best horror movies for years. It was clever and not afraid to explore the genre in different ways. BT also felt like a showcase for the singing talents for Ms Erivo - every scene she sings in goes on for far too long and destroys the pacing of the movie. The good news is that the movie looks good and the performances are spot on. However, in the end, BTATER is nowhere near as clever as it aspires to be",Bad Times at the El Royale

I am not sure what this director/writer/producer's vision was because there WAS NOT ONE IOTA OF A CONCISE VISION. From start to finish, this film was a mess. The director/writer/producer decided to add as much meandering to such a thin plot to begin with and he thought he could ""make it beeter"" by adding more unnecessary scenes and more useless devices. I learned one thing frm watching this goulash of a film, films that are written/directed/produced by the same person NEED A BETTER EDITOR, one who has the guts to speak up and help salvage a film.
I am stunned that Jeff Bridges, whom I respect and admire, stayed on board this disaster. Bridges had an amazing monologue mid-way, my guess is that is the ONLY reason he took this piece of drek in the first place.

Like the movie Psycho, the suspense builds with some shocks along the way. It's not Psycho, but in a similar way, it's effective. Unlike Psycho, there is no twist ending, but it's not trying to have a twist ending. Not every thriller is going to have a twist ending.This movie doesn't dumb it down for the audience and doesn't speed up the pace for those looking for quickies. My only complaint with the pacing is there is too much Cynthia Erivo vocals. Just cutting out most of her signing would have made the movie ten minutes shorter.Some reviewers are saying it's a Quentin Taratino wanna-be. Those comparisons are unfair. It is a multiple perspective movie, that doesn't make it a Tarantino like movie. Telling movies from multiple perspectives has been around long before Tarantino was born.

I highly recommend this movie, its very suspenseful and the performances are great. This may be Chris Hemsworth's best role, hes fantastic, and Jeff Bridges is great as always.

506,popcornandfizz,In name only,10,7 February 2019,"A film like Bad Times doesn't need flashy CGI and the like, but it would need to carry itself with style and energy regardless. With the mastermind of Cabin in the Woods at its helm, the film succeeds in this regard. For one, the hotel looks excellent and suits the story pitch perfect. The performances are top-notch, with a stellar turn by Hemsworth as a charismatic cult leader type personality who's as threatening as he is charming. The music is snappy and fits tonally, with some licensed songs to the soundtrack which work for more than background noise. It's remarkably well polished overall.The narrative is exceptional, weaving multiple threads in a way which allows the story to stack layers on top of layers until it reaches a satisfying conclusion. Its cast of characters is intriguing and each member of it plays into the story well. The dialogue is great and helps some characters feel more distinct from one another in terms of how they're written. Though the films clocks in at 2 hours and 22 minutes, its pacing never left me feeling as if it was plodding along or wasting my time. In fact, I was consistently riveted. To me, there's no such thing as a film that is ""too long"", so long as it is paced well, and I think Bad Times has smoother pacing than some may give it credit for.Bad Times at the El Royale is an awesome flick that I enjoyed far more than I expected going in. It definitely doesn't deserve to have done as poorly as it did, and I urge you to seek it out if you missed it and it seems up your alley. You may not enjoy it as much as I did, but I think you'll definitely have a good time with it. Bad Times at the El Royale gets a 10/10 from me.Master-classSummary:
An impeccable and complex narrative, phenomenal performances, excellent production values, strong dialogue, and tight pacing which keeps its admittedly long runtime from ever dragging.",Bad Times at the El Royale
507,JanSti55,A facade can hide many things,10,13 May 2020,"Sometimes what it's hiding is much better than you expected. Other times what it's hiding is far more terrifying than you could have ever imagined.
From the innocent little sister to the timid desk clerk to the affable priest and on, this movie rips off the facades that people (and yes, places ) can wear.
It's shocking and provocative and I couldn't have enjoyed it more! I highly recommend it!",Bad Times at the El Royale
508,scottspurs,Tarantino Jr in disguise,8,29 December 2018,"Knew this was gonna be good! Gutted I missed it at the cinema. Very stylish, and dialogue driven, with many surprises along the way!I like the mystery that surrounds the setting, and story. We don't know a lot about what's going, but we know that it is important to stick with the lengthy runtime to find out. All the characters are interesting in their own unique ways, and seem heavily influenced by historical events of that time too.Tarantino/Coen Brothers-esque for sure
It's a shame this film bombed at the box office. To be honest I'm very surprised, considering the level of actors/actresses, and the mystery that surrounded the film. I just think it came out around too many big hitters like A Star is Born and Venom.",Bad Times at the El Royale

510,Reviewer1,Are we all watching the same movie?,7,24 December 2018,"It's amazing reading - skimming through, there are alot - the reviews here, that range from the extroadinary to the completely unremarkable through to sheer misunderstanding!
I found this film to be good, better than average but nothing exceptional.
The non linear story line has been done many times, but this plot line although at times a little repetitive, is enaaging enough that the viewer doesn't get lost but carries the plot line efficiently enough.
I enjoyed the film but as with 99% of the movies that I watch I wish they could be condensed, 2hrs 20mins is way to long for this viewer.

Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth were excellent. The tension isn't always high, which gives the audience a chance to breathe. Lots of surprises. Overall, walking out of the theater, I was happy I saw this.But - there's some wonkiness to the script which makes the relationships between the characters feel arbitrary and unbelievable. He hits a few tropes that will make you roll your eyes, and a few surprises don't really pay off. Some of the performances felt flat, which is probably more due to the script than the acting. I left wanting the film to be a bit more than it was. High concept, okay execution.",Bad Times at the El Royale

If I would have known I'd be subjected to Chris Hemsworth's terrible acting and stupid man-nipples, I probably would have passed. Aside from that not a bad film. I mean really though.

522,FrankNave,'Bad Times' a lukewarm mystery thriller,5,12 October 2018,"The best part of this movie is the directing and the set. Now for the bad news. This movie 'seems' to be going in an exciting direction, but in spite of all the twists and turns, the audience never gets to an exciting conclusion. The film chock full of excessive reminders of 'racism & sexism' that still lingered in the early 1970s. I'm fed up with white men being demonized as sexist and racist. The film is also very long for a story that ends the way it does. If you like mysteries, then you might enjoy this film more the average viewer, but don't expect too much from 'Bad Times At The El Royale.",Bad Times at the El Royale

524,donbear09,Both a good time and bad time,7,24 December 2018,This movie was good but it was really hurt by the runtime. It dragged on a little too long in parts. Two hours would've been sufficient compared to the almost two and half hour runtime of this. It has you wondering what's going on with all these characters and what's gonna happen at the end. It can get a little confusing with the multiple timelines but as long as you pay attention it makes sense at the end. The acting wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It's worth a rental but I wouldn't buy it. I will say if you get the message the film was trying to send or look it up online you'll realize that this film had deeper meaning than what you saw. If you watch it again you'll see it in a different light.,Bad Times at the El Royale
525,Tmpthatsme,Expectations...,6,9 December 2018,"With the cast of this film I went in expecting this movie to blow my socks off! Instead I got a movie that dragged very slowly. Put did finally pic up some speed. It did not take a rocket scientist to figure out what was going on right out the box. The actors in the movie did not disappoint they all performed well. Once the film finally does pickup it does introduce you to some strange characters at the hotel which is interesting. The scene with Hemsworth went on entirely too long & though he is eye candy, that scene could have been cut short 10 minutes for sure. The front desk clerk was my favorite character!",Bad Times at the El Royale
526,er-usmani,Kinda OK,5,11 August 2021,"Well, the cast was good, setting and atmosphere was superb, acting was great. The story was intriguing at the start but the OVERLOAD of old timey songs was just too much. The movie was pretty slow but I'm OK with that. But it has FAR TOO MANY SONGS.Well the songs could be tolerated but the thing I hate more than excessive songs is the unbelievably over the top characters. Those two girls man, do such characters actually exist in real life? Can they actually exist in real life? Their character and and acting was a wrong mixture of looks, innocence, street smartness, ruthlessness and criminal behavior. I just couldn't bear watching those unrealistic characters and gave up on chris hemsworth's introduction. I mean I don't even care what that character is and what's it going to add to the story.

A lot of the shots are just beautiful; I especially like the rain and contrast with the bright hotel.All the characters were very well done, with Flynn (Bridges), Miles (Pullman), and Darlene (Erivo) being the standouts.The pacing is great, after the first ""twist"" happens it really picks up pace and really doesn't seem like a 2+ hour movie.Critiques are the ending falling flat a little, wanting to see more of John Hamm, and a few plot lines that seem to fizzle out without much spark.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The Afro-American singer didn't have to sing so many songs for such long periods of time. I'm not here to watch a musical. The dialogue between the priest and the singer were so long and boring, I almost gave up.

The characters are very likeable and you even feel connected to them. Spectacular performances by the cast, I was truly blown away at how each character played off one another. The way the plot unfolds had me on the edge of my seat. Well thought out characters and a very unique plot, Bad Times At El Royale is one of the best thrillers in recent years.

533,ThatGuyReviews,A Visual Joyride With a Muddled Plot,7,27 November 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is only Drew Goddard's second time in the director's chair for a feature film, but he has slowly become a household name as a producer and writer. While, contrary to popular opinion, most of these projects where he was not directing fell short for myself, Bad Times at the El Royale proves that Goddard does much better when given complete creative control over a project. The film is definitely not for all audiences and some irritating flaws plague the script, but it is still a solid popcorn-movie at the end of the day.
Bad Times at the El Royale follows seven strange individuals over the course of one day at the El Royale casino/resort. The film investigates these individuals' interactions and the secrets being hidden by this run-down hotel as the mysteries we follow slowly collide unto a chaotic conclusion. The first thing of note about this movie is the clever use of color and the level of attention payed to the design elements, both drawing the viewer into a 70s atmosphere. The cinematography complements this nicely, with the forgotten art of framing being very prominent throughout. Unfortunately, the editing does tend to draw away from these beautiful shots, with some odd, yet minor, missteps sprinkled throughout that clog the flow of certain scenes and generally add to the confusion. On a larger scale, the sequencing of the film was unique and interesting in general for the first two acts, but the final act drags and can frustrate at times. This is not the only issue with the rather frustrating script, unfortunately. While much of the agony of unanswered questions seems intentional, certain characters' backgrounds are fairly underdeveloped, seemingly pointing to a cutting room floor littered with the potential for a four hour epic. On the other hand, the opposite occurs in the penultimate scene of the film, in which an odd ""twist"" results in an overly obvious tragedy that slogs on much longer than it should. All this work to hide motives and build suspense is effective, yet we are left with many more questions than answers by the end of the film. This was clearly the intent, and satisfaction should not be the expectation when sitting down to view Bad Times, but still something feels to be missing.
Besides the drawbacks of the third act, the film does achieve quite a bit cinematically with its vivid visual depictions of this shady, 70s hotel and the even shadier characters who visit it. On that note, the acting on all fronts is impressive, with the small cast providing tremendous depth to their characters. Though I was not entirely impressed with Cailee Spaeny's character, this is perhaps more so due to the flaws of the script and a certain ridiculous scene of her swinging from a chandelier that did not pan out in any aspect, completely taking me out of the moment during my viewing. The sound design of this film was gorgeous, however, with some very nostalgic tracks selected to set up the era complementing the beautiful (and noisy) chaos that unfolds. The film is a great audio-visual spectacle, but suffers dearly for its convoluted and forgetful script. At the end of the day, it remains a worthy watch and signifies that Goddard is a talent to watch.Bad Times at the El Royale Letter Grade: B",Bad Times at the El Royale
534,fatimah-52797,The movie was so perfect,3,17 October 2018,"Everything about this movie was perfect. In fact it was so perfect that they forgot to put some soul in or some heart to it there was no feeling. After awhile it just felt like we were wasting our time watching a movie. Even though everything looks so pretty and all the scenes were filmed just right except for two things. But all of the technicalities were playing and then we'll probably only one or two mistakes maybe three if you count the singer change the key to our song but she was being spied on to distract the Caucasian woman. But, I really felt let down I've been planning to see this movie for a couple months it was greatly Miss marketed or misrepresented. I was very disappointed the movie didn't feel good or anything like that I thought it was going to yank at my Heartstrings. The Bellboy give a super performance yes. But, it was too good for this feeling I think this phone was really put together to look cool",Bad Times at the El Royale
535,sportsnut-66935,Fun Times at the El Royale,9,13 October 2018,"This movie is loads of fun. From the brilliant performances to the wonderful soundtrack to the incredibly bizzare plot and characters, Drew Goddard's Bad Times at the El Royale delivers. It's a slow burn thriller that has a number of twists and turns and contains spurts of violence. Going into any further detail would spoil some things. 
The hotel itself looked awesome and the whole set and production design are brilliant. The score fits the tone of the film wonderfully, and the actual music is just icing on the cake. 
This movie starts out slow and progresses forward leaving you wanting more and then explodes in your face for like the last hour. It feels very reminiscent of Tarantino's The Hateful Eight (minus all the swearing). This movie has an interesting puzzle that moves the pieces slowly together and then shows you how great the finished product is. The performances are great!! Bridges, Hamm and Erivo shine. Hemsworth is just an oddball in his limited screen time. I was most interested in seeing what Dakota Johnson could do surrounded by all this talent and given her biggest role is from 50 shades of grey. She was pretty solid in a role where she doesn't have to say all that much, but her nonverbal acting was well done.
Overall, this movie is a slow burn mystery, that's fun, exciting and doesn't feel that long until the end. It drags a little there, but the film keeps you on the edge of your seat with Tarantino like twists of violence.

536,wgbraier-89628,60s Crime Thriller Drama Sure to Get an Oscar Nod,8,29 October 2018,"Drew Goddard's (screenwriter for Cloverfield, World War Z, The Martian and Director for Cabin in the Woods) wrote and directed a thrilling and violent masterpiece weaving the secret back stories of seven strangers that meet by accident for one fateful night at the El Royale, a once high-class casino, with a dark past, in Lake Tahoe circa 1969.The incredible ensemble of actors includes Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey), Chris Hemsworth (Thor Ragnarok, and Jeff Bridges, who plays a pivotal role as Father Flynn. Two of the best performances were provided by up and coming stars twenty something Lewis Pullman who plays a neurotic concierge, Miles Miller, and Cynthia Ervina plays, Darlene Sweet, a struggling Motown singer on her way to a gig in Reno.Another character in the movie, it the glitzy 1960s El Royale itself. Its interior has an awesome giant juke box that keeps the music rolling, and secret corridors with two-way mirrors (much like Goddard's Cab]bin in the Woods), that allows the audience to become voyeurs. Designed with a red line going through the hotel and parking lot to show it was built literally on the border of Nevada and California. Unfortunately, you can't stay at the El Royale, as it was built in Vancouver, the creation of set production designer Martin Whist (Cabin in the Woods, A Series of Unfortunate Events and RoboCop).
You will want to download the classic Motown and early sixties rock soundtrack which includes Bernadette by the Four Tops, Can't Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli, The Letter by the Box Tops, Bend Me Shake Me by The American Breed, Unchained Melodies by The Righteous Brothers, Hush by Deep Purple, and You Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, just to name a few that played throughout the movie in Dolby Atmos sound.This often-bloody violent Tarantino-esque crime thriller perfectly builds to a final dramatic crescendo.

540,pericsnezana,Worth watching,9,17 October 2018,"I went to see this movie at the last projection that day, and people who were watching it just before me, got out from the cinema so disappointed. One girl even told me to stay near the entrance so I can leave, because there is no way that I'm gonna want to stay till the end. Boy, was she wrong. Not only I wanted to stay, but I enjoyed every minute of it.
When I read synopsis i thought that it's an interesting idea and wanted to see what they are going to do with it in the film. It was very good and engaging, with good story for each character, and with nice way of telling it. Actors did a good job, all of them were really convincing. I loved the fact that you're not sure who is bad and who is a good guy, and it turns out non of them are just classic good or bad guys, there are different layers in every character, witch makes them that more interesting. 
It does indeed have elements that reminds you of Tarantino's films, but that's not bad at all. It was done tastefully and it goes well with the story. 
Only thing that I didn't really like were parts with singing, they were too long, there was no need for them to last that much in my opinion.
In my book this is a solid 9/10, recommend it",Bad Times at the El Royale
541,optionsf,"Great Music, Great Art Direction, Great Plot, Don't miss",8,14 January 2019,"If you have a brain and like to see more than just superhero movies, this sleeper is pretty amazing. I came across it by accident on Apple iTunes and was so amazed I watched it twice. Other reviews say a cross between Hitchcock and Tarantino, that's a good start....with a bit of Wes Anderson thrown in. Too bad the Eagle's ""Hotel California"" wasn't written in the 60s as this is the kind of place where they may check out but they never leave.Many won't know the talented Cynthia Erivo, she won a Tony for her performance in the Color Purple which I saw on Broadway. She is incredible and her performance is one of the highlights of this film. There are times when she sings acapela and the camera just gives her a big hug in one long take: my God you rarely see such honesty in filmmaking.Jeff Bridges is the most memorable for his part which he nails especially at the ending. While Jon Hamm and Dakota Fanning also turn in great performances, the surprise is by Lewis Pullman who as the hotel ""receptionist"" who manages to surprise and delight until his secrets are finally revealed.I won't ruin this with spoilers because it is best to see this with no expectations as I did, then rewatch it to pick up all the foreshadowing you missed! Chris Hemsworth has fun with his role and it's practically worth it just to see him shimmying his abs...how is that possible?With the 60s Motown music and period setting, fantastic cinematography and so many twists and turns you will be surprised and delighted.I can't imagine how this doesn't garner Oscar nominations...",Bad Times at the El Royale

It was a clever and smart story that interwove a series of individual/parallel stories together, was well acted all around, and generally well done (Dakota Johnson I didn't think much of, Ithough. I'm not sure what draws audiences to her as an actor). All others did a pretty good job. I couldn't give the movie a 10, but was tempted to give it a 9, although decided to go with 8 stars as, although it's well done and a good movie, it's not a ""great"" movie.

Acting and actor choices are good, but the way the story is explained kind of confuses anyone who watches. It was nice to see the story unfold at the beginning, but as we got deeper it got more confusing with the choppy editing of everyone's backstory. Some questions within the movie go unanswered. Either way after thinking about it I came to realize that everything comes full circle in the end.

It works up to a violent climax that is as unexpected as the the film is good!,Bad Times at the El Royale
560,maxtiggertom,Phenomenal Times at The El Royale.,9,23 October 2018,"This film is in my opinion is one of the best of the year. Why? Well because of the fantastic performances by all the star-studded cast, a fantastic set list of songs that fit the era that the film is set in so well. The beautiful shots that the film has in store, the shocks and surprises and the genuine care that the director: Drew Goddard has taken with this film is something to commend. This film to him is clearly a passion project of his and it most definitely shows. With a running time of 140 minutes, the film is a slow burner and it's all the better for it.El Royale shows care for its characters which in turn makes the audience sympathise with them due to the time that Drew takes in establishing the characters. Each of which have their own interesting and fascinating side of the coin which is told through some very captivating flashbacks. As mentioned before the fantastic cast which includes heavy hitters such as: Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth are mellowed out by the other cast members most notably: Cynthia Erivo who along with highlights like: Jon Hamm, Lewis Pullman and of course Chris Hemsworth. They all create this sense of a heavy foreboding atmosphere. That only stops when the credits roll.But in fact, it is the relationship that Bridges' character forms with Erivo's that really stands out to me. Every time I have viewed this film. All the cast play off each-other well, but it's those two that stand out. I personally can't wait to see Erivo in more roles soon. She along with Bridges steal the show. The 60's era soundtrack also deserves a heavy mention as it melts you into the atmosphere even more with tracks like: ""This Old Heart Of Mine"" by ""The Isley Brothers"" and ""Hush"" by ""Deep Purple"" all create a mouth-watering sense of dread that only continues to mount as the film progresses as each secret of the characters is slowly revealed.To be brutally honest. I loved this film to pieces it is easily in my top 5 films of the year. Something truly special would have to come around to knock this film from the high pedestal that this film has set for me. Dripping with style (and a surprising amount of substance.) This film is incredible. I ask every one of you to go and experience this film at least once in the cinema. It's a truly fantastic experience and one I will most certainly not be forgetting anytime soon.An intriguing thriller packed with great characters and a simplistic but very effective setting.5/5 Stars",Bad Times at the El Royale
561,aghallows,Great Times watching the El Royale,8,11 March 2019,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film as I was not a big fan of a previous film directed by Drew Goddard ""The Cabin in The Woods"". The performances given by these characters are always excellent especially Jeff Bridges who played the priest. The film goes back and forth with timelines but is executed well and makes it easy to understand. The movie does occasionally leave you hanging waiting for the next part as it moves on to another, personally I enjoyed that experience as it left me sitting in anticipation and wanting more as the film slowly builds these characters, however this type of timeline switching may not be for everyone. One thing I adore in films is went it is colorful and visually great to watch and the this film hits the nail on that one especially with the set design. I recommend anyone who is a fan of Tarantino films to check this one out as it does have similar aspects.",Bad Times at the El Royale
562,PaulyFidgets,Not A Bad Way To Kill A Few Hours,7,9 June 2019,"""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is a dark thriller set in a bizarre hotel that sits right on the California-Nevada border. When the guests check in they are asked which state they want to stay in. What's the difference? The California rooms cost a dollar more per night, and you can't drink alcohol in the Nevada rooms. The guests include a priest (Jeff Bridges), a vacuum salesman (Jon Hamm), a hippie (Dakota Johnson), and a struggling soul singer (Cynthia Erivo). There is a lot of plot in this movie, so I won't go into detail other than to say that each character has his and her skeletons in the closet.Many reviewers on here have compared this to a Tarantino film, which is pretty apt. It is not, as one reviewer suggested, anything like a Jean-Luc Godard film, though. The wry dialogue, multiple perspectives, and sudden violence are all Tarantino hallmarks, and they are nicely done here. The movie is intriguing and engaging. My only real quibbles are that it's too long, and that this sort of thing has been too many times. It's a perfectly enjoyable watch if you are holed up with a broken ankle and nothing to do, though.",Bad Times at the El Royale

I was pretty interested about the characters and where the plot would go with them but after an hour had passed it felt like it wasn't going anywhere... When Chris Hemsworth showed up it seemed like it was going to pick up the pace finally, but instead it went even slower.. I think the movie tried very hard to look like a Tarantino film but never actually felt like one...
Darlene singing for what it seemed like 5 hours to me, plus the absolutely annoying character of Rose made the film even worse. I really thought I was going to enjoy it, but ended up feeling dissapointed instead... The ending was fine, but nothing that will blow your mind, with the exception of Miles being in the Vietnam war, which was tottaly unexpected...",Bad Times at the El Royale

The acting was phenomenal, especially from Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, and Lewis Pullman. The character development was incredibly rich. The film, written and directed by Drew Goddard (The Cabin In The Woods) was beautifully shot. And where as most movies rely on a twist in the end, the twists came every 15 minutes or so, within the characters themselves. I can't recommend this enough. Someone PLEASE make Drew Goddard write and direct a movie every year. He has a talent within him that is vastly underutilized.

Chris Hemsworth's Billy Lee is a chilling recreation of the kind of guru Charlie Manson wanted to be. The whole premise of a group of people with pasts and secrets colliding at a 1970's Nevada motel one stormy night is pure Jim Thompson meets James Ellroy. A great cast that balances men and women: with no wordy cr*p from Samuel L.I'm 56. I've read a lot of thrillers, seen a lot of films and this is a great example of what a writer/director can achieve. Drew Goddard has produced a great film of the genre.

570,CountryRefuge2,A great example of neo noir film!,9,16 June 2019,"I'm going to go out there and make a guess that most of the lower ratings for this film come from those raised on more recent action films, or those with little exposure/appreciation of film noir...or both. I found this to be a great piece of that style and thoroughly enjoyed its campiness.Initially, each person checking into El Royale seems to be a perfect specimen of nondescript characters: a priest, a vacuum salesman, a struggling singer, etc. The composition of each scene thereafter combines a near perfect blend of writing, musical score and set design to reveal the slow peeling away of layers with each character. As this peeling away occurs, the facets of noir film making develop to create that overstated aspect that is signature film noir. The cinematography throughout adds excellent support for the development of characters and the story line.I'm so glad I found this to watch on a dreary Sunday morning!",Bad Times at the El Royale
571,HaggieMonster,A great cast that is utterly wasted,1,24 December 2018,This movie is a poorly written mash-up of a half-dozen overly used movie tropes. The plot is so predictable that we were actually shouting what we thought was going to happen next and we were NEVER WRONG. We actually predicted lines of dialog correctly several times. And when the plot isn't being predictable it is full of holes and inconsistencies.It's like Quentin Tarantino quickly wrote a script after taking an Ambien trying to get it done before he feel asleep.,Bad Times at the El Royale

Not as charming as I hoped it would be, and the build-up is kind of slow. This is a gathering of stories type of movie that does not manage to bore you to death. Everybody did a good job, and the story is very original - the trailers portray a lot of action and chaos when the reality is not really the case.

579,femkesratings,One of the best films of 2018,10,28 October 2019,"I became interested in this film because Jeff Bridges and Jon Hamm both rarely disappoint and I loved Drew Goddard's previous project, ""The Cabin in the Woods"". I'm still not sure which film I like better, that one or this one.I absolutely adored this film and it's definitely one of the best films I've seen in 2018. It's sort of a mystery thriller, but I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen before. The best thing about the film is the atmosphere, which is exactly right. Nothing felt too cliché or predictable. The film is filled with plot twists, but it never gets overcomplicated. The film and the characters intrigued me from the first until the last minute. You can tell from the beginning that there's something shady about every character, but the fun of the film is waiting to find out what that is.The film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack and even better cinematography. I loved the way the scenes where they look at the hotel rooms from the secret passageway were shot. And of course all the actors played their parts very well. I especially enjoyed seeing Chris Hemsworth in such a different role.",Bad Times at the El Royale
580,AndyMahooney,Strap on Your Sea- oh never-mind we're gonna take it a little slo- JUST KIDDING HERE WE GO!,6,13 October 2018,"Jon Hamm cunningly wields a southern accent to welcome newcomers to the strange hotel that is The El Royale.. This hotel was built on the border of Nevada and California. We get a funny explanation by a young concierge, ""Nevada is where the hope is. California is where you relax. And also it costs a dollar extra for California... Coffee is twenty-five cents."" I admired the distinctive look of the late 60's. The lighting is rich in neon and it rains frequently. The soundtrack plays nice 50s and 60s tunes, infused with a tense and haunting techno score by Michael Giacchino. It's smooth like the camerawork, each manipulated to suit that era. The actors' performances are like a crack of sunlight on a cloudy day; you know they're trying to come out, but ultimately the script is overcast and there's nothing we can do about the weather. Although one character whose quick backstory (all the characters receive dedicated flashbacks where we see them before entering the Royale) actually did add emotional resonance. His character arcs fully, truly dynamic, while the others were left watching him and wondering when their time would come (it doesn't). I heard the actors accepted lower pay in order for Goddard to portray his vision in full, which is commendable. Goddard's dark humor that added so much panache in his cult classic ""The Cabin in the Woods"" would've paid great dividends in this flick. I found the audience forcing out a laugh when nothing was funny, in order (what I predict) to counter the gruesome. It's understandable because we're primed for it. We're expecting the relief but we're left wanting. Everything seems a bit scattered, each character's story doesn't interconnect gracefully with another, so nothing seems to matter. This isn't to say the film doesn't entertain. There's very satisfying close-ups of a needle falling on an elevating record, a truly gorgeous shot with fire symmetry and some ultra fun gory violence that shocks.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Bad Times at the El Royal previews and trailers state from the creators of Cabin in the Woods. This leads horror fans ,who like Monster and serial Killers and the fact that a Charles Manson character, a singer, and tunnels like Cabin in the woods you would lead you to naturaly assume it's a bait hotel for serial killers.

584,sara-19498,Some great storylines but...,5,2 July 2020,"Overall this movie is kind of pointless. The beginning of the movie is actually very intriguing and for the first half of the movie you get invested in the storylines trying to figure out why these people are at the hotel but then it goes downhill. There are a lot of plot holes in the story that leaves a lot of questions unanswered and also the ending is kinda pointless.If I were to tell you the plot of this movie I wouldn't know what to say other than a lot of different storylines, with no connections to each other, meet at a hotel and that's it. Things aren't tied up in the end and stuff is left unanswered.
The movie could have been good if these things were done right cause the storylines are actually pretty interesting throughout the film - plus the acting is great and Hemsworth kills it.To sum up - movie is not good not really bad.

591,lanceaugust1,Audiences need to recognize and believe the behavior and choices the characters exhibit or else they check out.,5,13 October 2018,"In 'A Streetcar Named Desire' Marlon Brando was a violent brute who stripped off his shirt in a moment of passion. We could recognize his character as rooted in reality. In this movie, for no reason, Chris Hemsworth's character apparently spends his entire adult life walking around half-naked, even in the freezing rain. His preening and hip swirling are behavior that we see in strippers or in rare private moments of seduction; but it makes no sense in the context of this movie. It is indulgent behavior by an actor who has no idea what he is doing. (I couldn't help but wonder what an actor like Viggo Mortensen would have done with this character). In years to come, Hemsworth will cringe when he looks back upon this performance; and, if he is rich enough, he will try buy every copy of this movie so he can destroy them. This is a perfect example why people who play Super heroes should not be cast in roles that require an actor: his choices render his character idiotic and unrecognizable to people who live in the real world. A character this self-involved and narcissistic would not compel the loyalty of others absent the ability to provide them lucrative employment. Good directors don't let actors run amuck in indulgent performances. This movie worked up until Chris Hemsworth's character appears on screen. The vacant idiot child/girl who falls under his spell is also problematic. Her choices are those of a sociopath and hence we never understand the intense unrequited loyalty of her sister, Dakota Johnson. The purpose of flashbacks should be to fill-in gaps of understanding for the audience with biographical information that helps us gain empathy and a deeper insight into the psychological underpinnings of a character; and of course they should be entertaining. That is one of the great weaknesses of this writer. The flashbacks do not give us key information to help us care about key characters. The problems with this movie are too great enumerate. It is mildy entertaining in parts and mind-numbingly boring in others. I left this movie with awe for the rare and enormous talent of great writers who can keep us spellbound by characters who grip us with their humanity. As mediocre as this movie is, it is still better than 85% of the movies in theatres currently. At the very least I thank God that no characters had super powers and no aliens came down from outer space and no cars turned into robots.",Bad Times at the El Royale

And it may have inspired ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD. But BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE, employing a storytelling structure that reminds us of Tarantino's devices, is arguably better than anything Tarantino has made. It fully commits to the thriller genre. It fully situates itself - and actively reflects on - the historical era in which it takes place. Every member of the cast absolutely delivers his/her part. And the direction doesn't take the lazy way out of diluting the story with excessive, cheap comic relief - instead it lets the tension build to several carefully plotted detonations, which occur both via the characters' dialogue and their actions.

The script was in desperate need of an editor and I even wonder, did it get past the 2nd draft?This movie was trying very hard to be Pulp Fiction, with the disjointed story and title cards, but it has none of the witty dialogue, ediitng skill or charm.

The movie has filler scenses that make it too long in my opinion. While certain scenes are visually appealing other scenes lag and almost bore. I found the lady's singing voice annoying and felt like it went on for too long. I think the film needed better editing and a better pace.

601,mifsudm-75748,Subverting Expectations Gone Right?!,9,13 October 2018,"""Bad Times At The El Royale"" may initially scare audiences away with its long run time being almost 2 and a half hours, however, the reason the film runs so long is because it takes its time. Drew Goddard uses that time to prolong scenes to build tension or have intimate conversations where the story escalates or characters develop. At no point during the showing was I bored or waiting for it to end.But let's start from the beginning. Right off the bat, the stakes are set in one of the best opening scenes since ""The Dark Knight"". The camera never moves yet our interests are still high. After that, Drew Goddard tells us that at any point, a gun can go off, a death can happen. He is constantly surprising us around each corner and it never gets cheap.Now on to the performances. All of the actors perform beautifully, even Chris Hemsworth who plays a pedophile cult leader. Drew Goddard uses the entire film to develop the characters so even at the end we are learning more about them while they are evolving.Now one thing you might be thinking is that it seems like a skin-deep thriller that doesn't poke any questions. However, I would disagree. There are many allegories hinted to us during the film, such as that life is all about perspective. One person may seem evil, but we do not know their story. Everything changes when we step into their shoes. Another allegory is stated right to us by Mr. Chris Hemsworth, and that is that life pits good against evil while a third party steals everything right from our pockets. And that is reflected by the entire plot of the film.My only critique about the film is that a single question is still unanswered, and that is who killed Felix? We are never told who killed him right in the opening scene. And I am still wondering as I sit here typing this review out.Overall, ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" is a beautiful work from Drew Goddard that breathes fresh air to Hollywood. It makes us question who we are and the role we play in society. And that is why ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" ranks 4 out of 19 on my list of Movies from 2018 and 30 out of 208 of my All-Time Movies list.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The story, not sure what to think. There are many loose ends of this intricate string that are not tied up. Who cares what I think, nobody, thats who. I don't know what could have made this film really fly. Drew Goddard had a vision and I'll be damned if I would ever say he wasn't seeing 20/20. For me, as the credits rolled I just felt that something was missed. Or, something was missing. That said, every frame of this film was beautiful to look at. It rolls like Agitha Christie and Quentin Tarantino hooked up at a frat party, but the next day they just couldn't be sure what happened and waited for the other to respond. Neither did, nobody spoke up. It's not bad, just not filling. When you finished ""Pulp Fiction"" you were smiling and a little curious, When you finished ""Bad Times"" you were frowning and desperately curious. 6-10 NOT BAD! Worth a viewing, tell me I'm wrong, you might be right.",Bad Times at the El Royale

I don't mean that to sound belittling or derogatory, but on the same hand felt my mind wonder when there was long scenes of unnecessary dialogue.The character introductions are fantastic and really well thought out. You can see that the producers, directors and actors really took their time with the detial on this film as it shows.I also enjoyed the cinamtograohy in this film as again, feels well thought out and the attention to detail is high. Some of the scenes from various angles are remarkable to watch.Overall, a good film, but seemed to drag on, I'm not sure why as there are so many interesting and thoughtful scenes to this film but maybe mixed in too much with pointless and lost dialogue.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The best part about this movie is that you want to know more about the personalities of the movie, their past and how it did end to be here,
Yes there is a lot of big holes and more details you want to know about the characters of the movies but it still make you think a lot about it and I liked that.

614,mjpemboss,Great start ...,7,17 October 2018,"I quite enjoyed this movie. It had a good set up. Put me in mind of a Tarantino movie. It introduced these rich characters, that you cared about, who were played by exceptional actors, and took you through their experiences. It was quite engaging and complex. 
A lot of bits and pieces were interwoven in a rich tapestry of plot. There was quite a bit of intrigue and raised a lot of questions morally as every character in the movie has their good sides and bad sides (Except for Chris Hemsworth who played a bad guy quite well, I felt). 
The soundtrack and style of the film were fantastic. Cynthia Erivo is an amazing voice. I was mesmerised by her singing. 
So the set up was great. The ending left a bit to be desired. It seemed that the scriptwriters just didn't know how to bring it home. Built a lot of tension, particularly at the end of the 2nd act. But then it just ended with violence. There was nothing clever about it. 
Also, most of the characters didn't seem to have an end to their arch. They had a lot of potential to grow and learn something but none of them did (the ones that survived, that is). 
I still enjoyed the movie and would watch it again but was left a little unsatisfied for the first viewing.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Hemsworth nailed his character but his character was not really necessary. The whole sub plot with Rosie and Hemsworth was just weird and made the ending not so great.,Bad Times at the El Royale
619,movieMaoam,Very refreshing and exciting,7,23 October 2018,"The first trailer of Bad Times at the El Royale already looked really stylish and sleek, but I already worried, that the movie might be just another Blockbuster cashgrab. Fortunately it isn't!The detailed and well executed art direction gives you an immediate feeling for the motel and it's characters. We get slowly introduced into each of them and everything seems to hide a little secret. This special atmosphere builds perfectly and carries you through the almost two and half hours runtime. Until the last 20 minutes you never feel exhausted or bored, because of the thrilling storytelling, which keeps the pace in a pleasant balance between fast action based progress and dialogue focused story and character development. As metioned, the last 20 minutes fall a bit off, because the movie doesn't seems to recognize the main antagonist's potential. The story offers you multiple hints on how events could evolve and most of them motivate you to keep watching, sadly the storyline of the antagonist is a bit poor introduced and in the end not everything goes up, as it should. Which can't be said about the actors. While every performer gives his role a clear character, Cynthia Erivo is a true newcomer, which takes, with incredbile a cappella's and a cool character, over established actors like Chris Hemsworth or Jeff Bridges.
In addition to a strong storytelling, dense atmosphere and good actors, ""Bad Times"" shows off some really good looking shots and delivers a cool cinematography in general. In combination with a splendid 60s Soul soundtrack, Drew Goddard archieves with it's crew a really original and exciting movie.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The ending is the biggest flow of the movie but not the only flow, we never know about what the cop wanted who died earlier and the authorities he contacted earlier never show up, Dakota Johnson is damn hot in hippy role atleast until Hemsworth shows up and ups the anty with his sexiness",Bad Times at the El Royale
624,nguyenkhanhnam-18727,"Visually stunning film, and that's all",5,18 February 2019,"The only good thing about this movie is that the color tone, lighting, filming is quite fine.
I did expect a good plot, but the film failed to show one. It feels like a copycat of Taratino's, especially The Hateful Eight (I actually thought this film was Taratino's when seeing its trailer months ago). Even the chapter splitting does resemblance his movies, which was totally unnecessary. Just like Goddard tried to say: 'Hello, I'm a big fan of Taratino. I repeat: I AM A BIG FAN OF TARATINO!'
Acting are bit over-the-top honestly, except Jeff Bridges is still amazing as usual. Chris Hemsworth's role was very much puzzling to me, since beside of showing abs I have no clue why putting him into such a movie. His presence is absolutely dispensable, and feels like the character was just a lazy writing whilst the director just want to throw something into the film to end it in the most bloody but yet painfully predictable.
I expect to see a great film, and was left with nothing but disappointment.",Bad Times at the El Royale

627,dmziontz,"I never leave reviews , but it left me no choice",9,7 June 2019,"""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is an extremely well made film. The story was deep without becoming preachy, the undertones of the performances often communicated more to the story than the dialogue, and the acting is incredibly subtle even when the action was intense. The protagonist/antagonist roles were passed between the characters as the nuanced story slowly unfolded. Actress Cynthia Erivo's taught performance was on-point throughout entire film, even when sharing the screen with Jeff Bridges, who's pathos ebbed an waned so gracefully thought the entire film. The rest of the characters,, especially Lewis Pullman's Miles, pulled their weight quite well.
I felt a distinct omage to Tarentino's filmmaking, especially the overlapping timelines, and the importance of music in ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Hate full Eights's"" basicly one-location setting, and ""D'Jango's"" hard justice. The art direction of the film was activating,, mongering more of the deliciosly beautiful final battle between Orin Ici and The Bride in 'Kill Bill."" than Michael Madson's gritty death in ""KBII""

634,lempkecoleton,Book a room at a different hotel,5,18 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is like a hit in baseball that makes the whole stadium stand up and cheer, but then about halfway through you realize the left fielder is gonna catch it at the warning track. For the first 1/3 or first 1/2 of this movie I was convinced I was about to see the best movie I'd seen in theaters for awhile. The second half of the movie took that hope and promise and dismantled it into a heap of practically unwatchable wreckage.This movie ripped off just about every Tarantino movie I've seen off the top of my head. There were elements of Kill Bill story telling, and plot development mixed with basically the same setting as Hateful Eight combined with out of order storytelling from Pulp Fiction and a Reservoir Dogs-esque Mexican stand-off ending. Despite being almost impossible to ignore none of these blatant rip offs negatively impacted the movie for me. The only one that did was how it was a great movie for the first half, and then became horrendous in the second half like From Dusk Till Dawn.Initially you're presented with a diverse group of relatively dynamic characters whose motivations and connections to each other remain mostly a mystery early on. This combined with a mysterious, and increasingly creepy setting create a very engaging, suspenseful atmosphere. From there the director promptly ruins everything he has going for him one foul move at a time until the audience is either walking out of the theater, snoring, jeeringly laughing out loud at how bad the movie is, or checking mlb playoff scores on their phones (all things I personally experienced in theaters).First of all, Don Draper....I mean Jon Hamm.....easily has the most enticing storyline out of all the guests. He also does the most to advance what you assume is going to be the central plot line of the movie. However, instead of using this to keep a good thing going, they have him killed off by Dakota Johnson (who looked really hot in her hippy pants). My problem isn't necessarily that he died, even though I would've liked to see more of Don Draper....I mean John Hamm....my problem is how he does, and after he dies they completely drop anything regarding him or his storyline from the movie. First of all, an experienced undercover law enforcement agent is definitely going to secure who he believes to be a violent kidnapper before moving on and freeing a hostage. Instead he ignores her completely, doesn't check for any weapons, and dies. At least give me something more believable. After all, it's what Tarantino would've done. There's no more light shed on the people he was investigating at all, and all in all nothing really comes out of weird porn hotel operation they have going on at the El Royale. The only influence it has on the rest of the movie is vague references to a tape we don't get to see that has JFK committing some heinous sex act on camera. They don't even end up telling us what happens with the tape or who uses it for what it just disappears at the end.Second of all, for a movie that's 2 and 1/2 hours long we did not need 20 minutes of it to be Darlene, aka a blatant Diana Ross reference that gets shoved down your throat a million times like you aren't smart enough to catch it on your own, singing. Her practicing singing in her room...fine. Hemsworth making her sing at the roulette table....fine, but even then can we shorten it up a little bit?There wasn't too much wrong with Jeff Bridges character other than A.) for a guy with severe Alzheimer's he sure is able to recollect a lot of stuff after being drilled in the head with a glass liquor bottle B.) it seems like he can remember everything except his name C.) I understand him trying to team up with Darlene and explaining himself, but I didn't like how emotional he would get..it just seemed off to me.Dakota Johnson (man she looked good in those pants) and her sister are another example of this movie taking a good thing and ruining it. The vagueness surrounding her and why she's kidnapped her sister work well when combined with Draper's..........Hamm's.....investigation. Even after Hamm is dead you're still left wondering who her sister called, why they're running away, and why she had to subdue her sister. Despite all this promise they completely and utterly lost me when Hemsworth aka the handsome Marylin Manson strolled into town.By the time Hemsworth shows up, they've already killed off the best storyline, Darlene has sung for a total of about 4 hours, all mystery surrounding Jeff Bridges is gone, and I'm already sick of Dakota Johnson's seemingly feral sister. The absolute last thing the movie needed was to introduce another character, plus backstory, plus have him slow the movie down to a crawl. On top of that, we definitely didn't need the hotel employee to have a flashback giving us even more backstory on him so he could ""save the day"" I was perfectly content with heroin addict hotel employee who uses drugs to cope with his traumatizing job. Now he's a Vietnam vet too?! Not to mention I don't believe for a second his ptsd from the war would stop him from at the very least saving the priest he feels such a strong connection to.After the story was dismantled and I lost interest in all of the characters I was relieved when the final credits rolled. Save your money, don't even bother watching on Netflix, just wait to see Once Upon A Time in Hollywood if you want to see a real Tarantino movie set in the 60's.

Just when you think you know what to expect or who the real ""villain"" is, you get a new chapter that spins what you just saw on its head.
Special shout outs to Chris Hemsworth for what might be his best role in film at the time of writing. I've loved him since Cabin in the Woods & Thor.

As to why they come, the salesman's purpose is left unexplained. Also, he's the most interesting role out of the bunch, but unfortunately, he is squandered.

This one is different though and has one of my favourite actors (Jeff Bridges) in it...While watching the first hour and a half of it I couldn't help thinking it's a Tarantino rip off due to the non-linear story and the way the violence is portrayed... I like knowing NOTHING about the movie I watch so I didn't have any expectations from it whatsoever apart from semi-expecting it to be good for Jeff Bridge's sake.Despite a good attempt towards the character development during the first half of the movie, none of the characters are actually likable (maybe apart from Darlene).

If Tarantino himself had made this movie, you would not be surprised.This is an unconventional ""strangers in a hotel"" flick -- the kind where none of the travelers are who they appear to be -- only better. Even the hotel has its own secrets.The entire cast is strong, but Cynthia Erivo stands out in particular, delivering what must be close to 15 minutes of real vocal talent in her role as a struggling singer. Lewis Pullman, the son of actor Bill Pullman, is also impressive as the hotel's clerk.The dialogue is perhaps a bit flat, as I don't recall being impressed by any one-liners. Most movies have one or two real zingers, but after two viewings I still could not quote a single line from this movie.

651,Henry-Hill31,"Awesome, until Chris Hemsworth comes in and ruins it",7,12 October 2018,"I didn't have high expectations, so the film really blew me away the first 80 minutes. It was a fun thrilling ride with a little bit of a slow start, until the climax.Going into the final sequence of the movie, it really became a wannabe of Hateful Eight. This is around the time Chris Hemsworth makes his real appearance into the film.I always have a hard time seeing Chris not as Thor and in this case, the shirtless body didn't help with changing his Thor image. The wannabe Tarantino setting with things like ""I didn't ask you"" reminded me so much of the Pulp Fiction moment where Sam Jackson says ""I can't remember asking you a God damn thing"". Not only is Hemsworth not good enough to pull it off, the script just stretches way to thin to make it enjoyable.Even after the half way point I would rate this a solid 8, but after that it becomes a 6 at best. A 7 seems fair, I wished they made a better conclusion and left Hemsworth out of it.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It's a little too long. At times boring. Tries a little too hard to be like Tarantino but doesn't give you the satisfying payoff. The beginning started off good and had me interested in the characters. But after a while it felt like this movie wasn't going anywhere. There isn't any real twist or turns and it was very predictable as to who was going to survive in the end. I guess the writer had a good idea at start but he didn't know how to end it. Just a bunch of random violence. So out of a score of 10, I would give it a 5. Right in the middle. Started off good but fizzled out towards the end, especially when Chris Hemsworth's character shows up and slows the movie way down. There is a better movie out there similar to this and it's called Identity. And it has a way better ending.",Bad Times at the El Royale
660,skurtz-44443,Just OK,5,18 February 2019,"Starts out strong then fizzles. These actors are all too good to be wasted like this. I felt especially embarrassed for Chris Hemsworth. His character's backstory was interesting, but once he arrived at the scene he had little material to work with. It was as if he was in pain trying to carry the dialogue over the remaining half hour. It's also hard to imagine these 7 characters are the only ones at the hotel and are ultimately thrust together without outside invitation.

683,Kai_Proctor,Very Bad Times at the El Royale ... Rotten in fact,1,13 October 2018,"Funny how you can have $32 million dollars and still get a movie that quite frankly reeks.Length and pacing -
The first two hours of this movie (pun intended) moved at a glacial pace.
Far too much over use of scene setting and unnecessary fluff.
e.g. Too many characters literally standing about waiting for the concierge.
The last forty minutes is the only bit that is worth watching even then it's too contrived for it's own good.
The bug scene too long.
How many times do we have to see a jukebox operate?Characters -
Only one and half characters are of any interest or emotional connection or depth.Now I can imagine a few critics of this review state such as , ""but it was what the characters didn't say that was so important and it left a lot to the imagination to fill in.""
What they didn't say was the result of a script padded with exceptionally long pauses.
My imagination was wondering what was the point of all this over rated drivel.
Did it take a lot of imagination to throw together a few amoral (with the exception of one and half) characters and make a hostage crisis?>designated sarcasm zone> 
Wow that is so imaginative!
<end of designated sarcasm zone<Furthermore I had already lost interest as there was too much same scene - different viewpoint, killing the flow of the movie trying to rip off Rashomon. (Rashomon being infinitely better than this dumpster fire)
Then filling in with some back story that was too matter of fact to be engaging and killed the pace to boot.Then we have plot devices that sadly are there for the sake of closure or in this case non disclosure.
This entices the gullible viewer to lay in wait for the big reveal but sadly no.
Plot device : The reel of film with a passed away congressman having congress (sex) with someone he shouldn't have.
Plot device : Chekov's gun/knife/shotgun/bottle of whisky/impromptu improvised weapon.
Plot device : unresolved entities/people on the phone adds to the mystery or lack of thereof.As the old timers would say all the gear and no idea.Do yourself a favour and avoid this film like the plague.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Unfortunately, just at the critical moment when all the bits, pieces, and false leads should have started to gel, the movie ran out of gas. That moment occurs when Billy Lee--the Charles Manson-like cult leader--shows up with his entourage of armed disciples. This should have been the start of the ""grab your popcorn, sit on the edge of your seat"" climax, but it wasn't. Instead, we get the ramblings of Billy Lee, lots of people tied to chairs awaiting their fates (bullets are involved), and a film that has lost it's way. To save the action, we're expected to believe that mild-mannered, barely old enough to shave, Miles Miller, is actually a hardened Vietnam veteran, once an Army sharpshooter with lots of ""kills.""

In addition to the overall film the performances like authenticity, save a character or two.Otherwise in the positive column, the setting and Jeff Bridges' performance are aces.

Highlights for me were performances by Hemsworth, Johnson, Bridges, and Hamm. Hamm's character being killed off before 1st half of movie was a huge mistake in my opinion. He was the best part of the opening story. His portrayal as the misogynist cover for a righteous FBI agent was absolutely spot on. Additionally, Johnson was under utilized as the big sister on a mission to save little sister from ""Manson like"" Hemsworth character. Bridges does a solid job as the 1st stage dementia con dressed as a priest trying to recover hidden loot. My only criticism is the average attempt at a Tarantino storyline format and the overly stereotypical written Manson like leader of a hippy cult. Hemsworth tackles his role head on though and is still entertaining even while rolling eyes as how it was written. Spaeny, Erivo, and Pullman all do well with their given parts to play in story.

Spoiler Alert: It is just not acceptable that meek and mild, barely old enough to shave, Miles Miller was once a hardened Army sharpshooter in Vietnam.

707,Ancient-Gamer,Pretty good times at the cinema.,8,13 October 2018,"Bad times at the El Royale is a bit of fresh air in a landscape filled with superhero movies (which are also highly enjoyable) and long time franchises. And although the movie has a familair feeling to it, with twists and turns that regular moviegoers have seen al before, it does find ways to intrigue it's audience. A hotel is not the most original setting, but it's a nice set piece and well stylized. The pretty pictures are accompanied by a fine soundtrack making it a pleasing experience for eyes and ears. A movie needs more than just good visuals and music, luckily Bad times at the Al Royale mostly succeeds in providing an entertaining story. The small group of guests is an interesting bunch and almost all of them get enough backstory to make you care for them, or at least understand where they are coming from. Father Daniel (Jeff Bridger), Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo) and Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman) stand out from the crowd thanks to strong performances. The rest of the cast is solid enough, but have a little less impact on the whole movie. Chris Hemsworth does a decent job making Billy Lee a charming yet menacing persona. Unfortunatly he is not giving enough screentime to make him into a truely fearsome antagonist.Surely this movie is not for everyone (although that can be said about any movie), it has a strong Tarantino vibe to it. Meaning the pacing gets a little slow at times with longer diaglog scenes. So if you are not really into these kind of movies, there is a chance you will not want to check in to the El Royale either. However the movie avoids to reach the point where it feels boring. Usually it surprises you just at the right.Overal Bad times at the El Royale is a well made and entertaining movie, with a strong cast, mostly interesting story and beautiful cinematography. 
Like mentioned above it's probably not recommended to everyone, but most will find something to enjoy at the El Royale.",Bad Times at the El Royale
708,simon-755-70123,A patchwork of themes with poor finish,4,12 October 2018,"I really enjoyed the start of the movie. The setting had something of ""Hotel Budapest"" and the screen picture composition was really spot on. E.g. the initial scene when the money was hid. Also the revelation that every room had one way mirrors was really clever. Up.to here i would rate the film an 8. But from here it all went south. 
Billy Lee - his name should've rather been Byler Turden - Tyler's mustached brother! What a poor poor copy of Fight Club. Walking around all sexy through the yellow fields and giving his lousy speech about ""society"" posing as the alpha male. Every scene showed him topless. I wonder where his gym was when he trained his body down to 2% body fat and how he waxed his pubes when in his little jungle society. All the main actors are threatened to be killed by him - but it just didnt work. I felt 0 empathy for any of the main actors, except maybe for the singer lady, as they all seemed shady and had no depth to their character! Should i feel sorry for the big sister? No thanks. And the little girl with her daddy issues adding a poor the ""The Ring"" vibe to it all... This mix just got way too complicated at the end and the resolution of the plot felt really stupid. What a pitty after such a nicely composed build up! The last half of the movie I rate with a 2... So my verdict is 50%×8 + 50%×2 = 5.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Around 1h20m I said to my wife that this is the last movie I'll watch if it doesn't keep me interested in the first 30 minutes... the end was fine, somewhat righteous but you could predict it all.. that's why it's simple and offers nothing new or exciting to somewhat seasoned cinephiles.Don't waste 2+ hours on this.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Go in knowing as little as you can and I can guarantee that most of you will be blown away. The whole film is slick and stylish with great performances from it's ensemble cast and a truly killer late-60s soundtrack. Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo are incredible in their roles but Chris Hemsworth owns this film. Billy Lee is terrifying to watch but he is utterly captivating. This is the first time seeing Hemsworth as a villain (usually as Thor) but my god can he pull it off. On top of the performances is some truly wonderful cinematography and direction. The set design and color-coding is a treat to look at and Goddard uses the camera in an expert way to give some excellent tension to scenes. There are some great Tarantino-esque moments and I think a lot of reviewers got caught up trying to compare this film to Quentin Tarantino, but it's a lot more than just a clone of The Hateful Eight. I think if people went into this film expecting a fun mystery-thriller, they'd be satisfied. If you go in expecting Tarantino, you'll be disappointed. No one can do Tarantino like Tarantino. So go see Goddard do Goddard, it's a sight to behold. This film rewards patience as the run-time is pretty harsh but if you let yourself be engrossed, I guarantee the minutes will fly-by.",Bad Times at the El Royale

However the film only gets the shape instead of the essence, I can sense that it keeps trying to imitate, though entirely failing to show the exquisiteness of multi-line narration.Additionally, the whole film moves at snail's pace throughout, except the part before ending, but that part is actually sort of abrupt, things fell apart inappropriately fast. Anyway I just wonder how a film that features such thin and stuffless storyline takes that long time, 141 minutes, let alone it feels like 411 minutes in terms of watching experience.By the way, too many singing parts !",Bad Times at the El Royale

They do these flashbacks and its like we are looking at their thoughts, then the character might give a little bit of detail or more like a summary of what they were thinking to another character.Can't fault a single actor or actress in the film. Thought they were all very good.Cynthia Erivo was excellent. Especially her singing.

730,prettytwitches,An Amazing film that will go over some people's heads!,10,19 October 2018,"This film had me engrossed from start to finish. I love the wonders of cinema but have been so let down by films lately. I'm not a fan of the mind numbing drivel that Hollywood churns out. I feel like most of the time you have to be brain dead to enjoy what's out. However this is not the case for Bad Times at the El Royale. Brilliant storytelling, fantastic acting, amazing soundtrack and beautiful set design. The director wears his influences on his sleeve and I was grateful for it. I miss great movies like this, that has depth of character and story. Jeff Bridges was fantastic and without giving too much away, I really fell for his character. Jon Hamm is also wonderful and gives a great performance. Cynthia Eviro stole the damn show, she is a powerhouse and I can't wait to see more from her in the future. I have read some negative reviews about Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of a cult leader and although it's not the way I envision one. I think he did a great job of showing how absolutely ridiculous these types of people are, self absorbed and completely narcissistic just like any cult leader. I honestly can't fault this movie. It portrays 60's Americana so well. It's just a fantastic film that I can't wait to see again. If you enjoy good cinema I implore you to go see this.

734,LotsOfLogan49,Masterful,10,15 December 2019,"Okay, this movie has a few flaws, but before we talk about those, I'm gonna tell you why I LOVE this SO much. Firstly, you can't talk about this film without talking about the soundtrack. I love every single song in here. I remember after I bought the Blu-ray for this movie, the soundtrack was the only thing I would choose to listen to. Stuff like Bernadette, I Got A Feeling, Baby I Love You, 26 Miles and He's A Rebel are just some of the incredible hits on the soundtrack. Secondly, you can't talk about this movie without talking about the cinematography. The colours on this movie are beautiful and realistic for a movie set in circa 1969. The layout of the hotel itself is stunningly gorgeous. There's also this five minute, twice second long take involving Jon Hamm in the first act, that is masterfully shot! And since Drew Goddard directed, wrote and produced this movie, this is his vision for how he wants the movie to look and feel. So, I say thanks to you, Mr. Goddard for giving my eyes and brain a feast of greatness! Thirdly, the plot is extremely tense, and I love it! Something else that the movie does that's pretty interesting is that - and to quote Chris Stuckmann, ""It sets up little nuggets of things (and) asks you to be patient"" with them. I really love that idea, and for the movie, it just works! I also hear some people who have seen the movie, talk about the pacing of the movie (they went a huge fan of that). But I think the pacing is absolutely on point! Goddard knows what he wants to show the audience and nothing is on accident. Some of the scenes that may feel unnecessary - for me - continue to either feast on my eyes, or leave me unsettled (like one scene involving a TV right before the five minute, twelve second long take). Now, to point out the few flaws: There are some flashback scenes in the movie to show our character's backstories. Now, I definitely do like the idea, but sometimes, the way it comes along, and the time that it happens, sorta undercuts the dramatic moment that's happening now. I think only one of them really bugs me (it's the final flashback, for those who have seen the movie already) and one of them is just a little distracting (the third to last one). Other than the flashback issue, this film is a masterful work of cinema, destined to become a cult classic!",Bad Times at the El Royale

Figured I would give it a chance, since I loved Cabin in the Woods and Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors. I'm no film major or snooty critic, just a guy that enjoys movies. It is definitely a film that pays homage to QT, Coen Bros, etc, but I don't think it is trying to be one of their films as others have said. I'm impressed when a director can pull off an interesting story that takes place in a small setting, such as Hateful Eight, Cloverfield Lane, Devil, Insomnia etc. At nearly 2.5 hours, I didn't feel like the movie was too long, and there were several twists to keep it interesting. I believe all good artists are influenced by their predecessors, but they also put their own spin on it. I think if you are a fan of the above directors, you will enjoy the movie.

By far this is the best movie I have seen this year, and certainly will be a contender during awards season. Knew nothing about the plot, which is how I personally like to go into a movie. Jeff Bridges, who became an overacting gold star elite during his middle age, has really become a true actor during his latter years, and plays the perfect role yet again. He needs to give his agent some serious gifts this year for landing him this role. The entire cast is going to be giving gifts this year and receiving gifts in January. The film itself is going to win awards for set design, costume design, and possibly screenplay and director. It feels very Tarantinoish, which is never a bad thing to be compared to, in my opinion. Unlike most Tarantino films however, it actually fills the time perfectly. No place for a bathroom break, every scene needs to be seen. In the end, there is never a dull moment at the El Royale, and you will be glued to the screen the entire time. No Bad Times here. The El Royale is a must see.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Even at the end of it I'm still wondering if any any truth was told by the characters.

761,Zachary_goodwin,Complete subverts expectations and keeps you at the edge of your seat,8,2 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale is an incredibly captivating mystery / thriller, and completely subverts expectations within the first 10 minutes. With an all-star cast, the acting is solid from start to finish, and Lewis Pullman (Miles, the hotel manager) steals the spotlight even with Chris Hemsworth in the mix. The structure of the film feels fresh and simulating, with non-linear storytelling and scenes from multiple perspectives, though at times, the pacing does tend to drag at certain parts. The more energetic scenes are accompanied by an incredible soundtrack, with classics from the 60's; that create a warm and versed vibe. The topics of ultimatums and self reflection are presented, and exceptionally highlight by the cinematography. Several scenes have the character looking through a one-way mirror, presenting a shot with what the character sees and, in the reflection, his/her reaction. There are also parts with vivid color and or contrast paired with beautiful composition that forms a stylistic vintage look. One of the film's problems is leaving open plot threads to hang, one character is believed to be promising and crucial in the beginning of the film but slowly dwindles away all, and connection and potential is lost. Overall Bad Times at the El Royale does a phenomenal job at luring the audience into a story that is at points unpredictable.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Go in knowing nothing!With a great cast of exceptional actors, the movie really brings a sense of originality to the table. You have no idea what's going on, but you enjoy it because the cinematography, music, score, and acting are all great. My only critique is that I wouldn't really call this a Mystery/Thriller, I would just call it a Thriller. For me a mystery movie, has to have you guessing the answer to one large mystery the whole time and then tie it all together at the end. Where as this movie had different back stories for each character that brought them to the El Royale. But not so much one mystery that tied them all together. With that being said, the back stories, the intertwining stories, the unexpected plot twists are all really enjoyable. You begin to get so invested in the characters that at one point I was literally jumping up and down rooting for certain people and at the other points my wife she'd some tears for characters.The build up takes some time, but because of the nature of the movie I really didn't notice it, as I was trying to figure what could be going on with everyone. But once it builds, it goes from 0-100 in about 5 seconds and then it's a lot of fun.If you are a Tarantino, Wes Anderson, or Scorcese fan.

I loved the actors so I hung in there and I can honestly say i could've lived and been perfectly happy never to have seen it. The actors were wonderful with what they were given. I looked the whole time for just one moment of redemption and finally found it towards the very end when Miles saved the day. He went from being this mealy week character into a badass in a split second and then it was over. Sat through all of it for maybe 10 minutes of true entertainment. Do I recommend this movie yeah probably not is it worth watching maybe if for nothing else than seeing Chris Hemsworth be a bad guy and have his abs showing the entire time and then that tiny bit of redemption at the end.

The thing is, I didn't expect to love it so much.My favourite characters were Father Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) and Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman) because they were flawed, broken and had done awwfull but they were really trying to be better. Even though the acting was terrific these two stole the show with the way they portrayed the charercters, you could see the pain, the sorrow, the fear, all their emotions in their eyes.I am used to not getting surprised by plot twists but right in the first scene, I couldn't predict a thing! It captivated me through all the film but what I loved the most was the way you could feel sympathetic towards some characters, even knowing the questioning things that they did.The cinematoghaphy and the soundtrack were perfect too and, honestly, I only have one complaint. Sometimes I was so eager to know more that I was a bit impacient in some parts. (I hate to say it like this but I guess the pacing in some parts could be faster...)I must end by saying this: The movie was great and, if you like classics like pulp fiction, you will definitely love it and even if you don't, there is a very good chance you will love it too. This is not just a movie you see to past time, this is one of the films that deserve being talked about.4.5 ou of 5.0 stars",Bad Times at the El Royale

770,metalgearsolidx17,Solid mystery thriller that could have been so much more.,7,14 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale was a semi-disappointment. I had high expectations going in because it is from writer/director Drew Goddard (adored his screenplay for The Martian) and the ensemble cast (always love me some Jeff Bridges, Chris Hemsworth, and John Hamm). The marketing was solid and created an air of mystery since they didn't give away much. While the film is not up to my expectations fully, I can say that it is still a good movie but, what makes it painful is that it could have been so much better.Pros:
Style: El Royale's strongest asset, the film oozes this sleazy late 60's early 70's feel in a Tarantino esq way (like if reservoir dogs and pulp fiction had a child). The bright color palette of the El Royale itself created a nice contrast to what was actually transpiering. The excellent soundtrack helps immerse the audience even more.Acting: Everyone does a great job from Jeff Bridges playing a ""Priest"" to Chris Hemsworth basically playing his own version of Charles Manson. Even the younger, more unknown cast members like Lewis Pullman and Cynthia Erivo (can't wait to see what she can do in Widows) have breakout performances and were the biggest standouts.Cinematography: Interesting shots and angles especially a long, opening static shot that never cuts away.Storytelling: Original, similar to how reservoir dogs was told through flashbacks and various different perspectives.Cons:Story: It was decent with an alright payoff that could have been so much better by Goddard's standards. Some characters (specifically one) didn't have much impact on the story as a whole and was underutilized. It also has a sharp contrast between the first two acts and the third act as if it were 2 separate stories. Overall, it didn't have a lasting impact and a little style over substance.Pacing: This was the biggest problem for me. Has many highs and lows throughout. At two hours and twenty one minutes, it feels like it's twenty minutes longer. Could have been trimmed down and streamlined to help the story flow better.Overall, Bad Times at the El Royale is a good movie that could have been great, hampered by a long runtime and a so so story. It is still worth seeing at least once because of its style and fantastic performances by it's star studded cast.Verdict: Worth seeing but, temper expectations.",Bad Times at the El Royale
771,depentgunner,Gorgeous looking movie with a interesting story.,6,15 October 2018,Bad Times at the El Royale is very well written and edited movie. Some people say this movie is discount tarantino scenario like thats a bad thing. It has a very interesting story and characters.The movie has a great performances and part of that is how well they have been written. Characters starts up simply then we see their story arcs one by one then everthing goes wild in a good way. We see what this characters really are and not.I think his movie is on of those movies it would be very different in second viewing. Because you will be more focused at the little things about what to come.Overall this is a really good movie with interesting story also really good use of music and some of the best acting. With all these you cant have a bad time.,Bad Times at the El Royale

The acting, costumes, music and set all great, story got me thinking but left so many loose ends.There are the about nine story arcs. Are they really completely unrelated? About half of them are left dangling in the end.",Bad Times at the El Royale

778,andreanthonyfoster,The greatest Tarrantino Fan Film,9,12 October 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale was a superbly directed film. Drew Goddard truly shows his talent as a director by consistently keeping the audience engaged. For me personally I felt this movie never had a moment where I felt the least bit bored. The pacing was very consistent. In addition to that the cinematography was excellent and it really captured every single scene almost perfectly. Another thing I loved about this movie was the performances. Each character felt unique and engaging and that is thanks mostly to the writing but also to the acting. Chris Hemsworth's performance was one that truly astounded me. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but trust me, this role is unlike any other role he's been in. Other than Chris Hemsworth all the other actors were exceptional as well. Now a reason why I love this movie is that it firstly is a great, I guess you could call, a love letter to Quentin Tarrantino's films. The dialogue is very intriguing as each character seems to have something sinister hidden deep within themselves, and that is mostly expressed through the dialogue.
 I loved that none of the characters were cliché nice guys and I like how this movie makes you feel like any character could die at any point in the movie. It keeps your attention span and never fails at doing so. I also think it's a nice break from all those reboots, remakes, sequels and adaptations that are crowding cinema's nowadays. It's great to see a unique film like this one. It's sad that there aren't that many original ideas anymore.Overall this movie most definitely feels like a Quentin Tarrantino fan film. And while it never reaches the level of quality as some of his better films. It does come very close to that mark in my opinion. And that is honestly a high remark especially for a less experienced film maker. All I can say is that this movie is layered with talent all throughout the movie and I'd highly recommend you go see it.",Bad Times at the El Royale
779,kschuldt-49741,Not what I expected but...,8,25 December 2018,"I get the negative reviews. This movie was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be Smoking Aces movie (and I love shoot em up thrillers don't get me wrong). But it was much deeper than that. I grew up outside Detroit so I love Motown, but it wasn't just the music or my love of Jeff Bridges...the deeper story of redemption for what you thought was a minor character, the brief glimpses of what dementia is really like...and Chris Helsmworth is truely scary as a cult leader. As I said - not what I expected but I think i actually liked it more for that not less. Give it a chance without any preconceived notions and you might be surprised.",Bad Times at the El Royale
780,pruthvimg,Expect the unexpect,8,5 March 2021,"At the beginning, Even though the plot fail to grab attention it keeps on gaining interest later on in the film, The title perfectly suits the film. The chain of events is the interesting part and Many unexpected things happen when each character interacts between others. Bottom line the film wants to convey the message "" Karma is Boomerang"" very clearly, Obviously, every cast nailed the show....",Bad Times at the El Royale
781,aidanpetrie,Tarantino-esque,8,10 July 2019,The film is definitely worth watching. Each character is extremely intriguing that no matter who is in the frame your hooked to see what happens. Mostly everything about the film is great. Audio is probably what got me the most into the film. From every briefcase clip to every gunshot. The audio packs a punch that really makes everything more real yet keeping a very exciting stylised manner.,Bad Times at the El Royale
782,islam_zia,Mark my words - this will be another Jeff Bridges cult classic 10 years from now,10,6 July 2019,A great cast and a great storyline. Keeps you in suspense from start to finish. We are so engrossed with superheroes these days that a good storyline these days don't make money. But this will be a great hit in the long run.,Bad Times at the El Royale
783,zomedxbox,Poor mans Tarantino,1,13 October 2018,Not sure why people are comparing this to a Quentin Tarantino movie because the writing and dialogue in this is absolutely garbage and boring as hell and didn't go anywhere. the movie was just bad. don't waste your money seeing this.,Bad Times at the El Royale

786,ralphwigzell,Recommended movie.,8,4 July 2019,"I watched this movie on an Air France flight and became quite involved to the point that I only had and hour's sleep on the 8 hour flight. I initially fell asleep but was awakened by Cynthia's rendition of ""You can't hurry love"". I actually watched the last half first, because I fell asleep shortly after the debut, woke up to Cynthia singing the song, and then restarted the movie to watch the first half. A bit like watching Pulp Fiction.It would be a great coincidence for all these personal events to take place at the same time, but it makes for an audience-capturing story-line.",Bad Times at the El Royale
787,a-32796,Nothing Short of Encapsulating,10,24 October 2018,"With a vintage feel brought to life by a superbly coordinated soundtrack, perfectly crafted non-linear character development, and a constantly winding road of twists and turns that create an atmosphere of continual intrigue, 'Bad Times at the El Royale' could be easily confused as a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece. Alas, as far as I am aware, Tarantino had no part in the production of this film nor its script, however the brilliance of 'Bad Times' remains seemingly unhindered by his absence. My reasoning for a perfect score is simple: 'Bad Times' executes all aspects of cinema that sparked my love for the art to a tee. It creates a stylistically vintage atmosphere embedded with fantastical yet simulatenously realistic stories, woven together by its quirky setting and told through the differing views of its darkly mysterious characters - one of which is truly be the setting itself. As the story unfolds, more and more mysteries continue to build, however no question is left unsolved. What results is a thrilling series of events that will leave you captivated throughout the film, and satisfied upon its conclusion.",Bad Times at the El Royale
788,primusfan-33576,Definitely was hoping for better..but not all bad times,5,31 October 2018,"Well first and foremost I didnt think this movie was all that bad. the characters and vibe of the movie mixed with the music made it feel like a poor mans Tarantino film. It felt like it was gonna play out as a who done it, or clue typa movie, but unfortunately that wasn't the case at all which is really unfortunate considering how the first half of the movie went down.My problem with this movie was the fact that nothing really seemed to matter about the characters after the second half of the movie. Its almost like they had this great idea for a movie and then about 100 pages into the script they had no idea where to go next and they just decided to add a good looking guy (chris helmsworth) with no shirt on and just hope that his sexiness will carry the movie the rest of the way...well that didnt work at all...not even close I was so bored by the second half that I started picking the movie apart....Who was having sex on that film reelAnd they kept talking about the management. Why didn't they go in that direction and further the story that way? They could've had the whole helmsworth narrative end in 20 minutes and finish the movie strong that way.Anyway...not all that bad but cant recommend it 5 out of 10 stars",Bad Times at the El Royale
789,kasperdahlin,Beautiful film with missed potential.,8,23 October 2018,"Similar to ""The Hateful Eight"" in its ability to subtlety build suspense in a magnificent first and second act, only to fail in delivering a worthy and climactic end, this film leaves you both pleased and slightly disappointed.",Bad Times at the El Royale

795,maytheforcebewithyoumarko,Half of the theatre fell asleep during the movie!!!,1,19 October 2018,"I pick my movies like I pick my fruit - don't want anything rotten. But this time my girlfriend who isn't picky as me picked the movie.
I watched the trailer and thought ""Meeeeh nothing special and already made 100 times before but it might be OK and we both miss cinema so let's go for it.""WE WERE WRONG.
First scene was great and that's it. Rest of the movie is bad, pretentious copycat of the old suspension mystery thrillers minus suspension and actual sense. Only reason people find this movie fresh and great is because they never saw those original thrillers.
And I really mean it doesn't have sense because the main plot never gets resolved (I read the rest of the plot).Plus, the pace is so slow (don't get me wrong, I love Gaspar Noe, Jim Jarmusch, Copolla and other ""slow"" movies) my girlfriend almost fell asleep so we went out of the theatre during half the movie.
As we walked out I noticed half of the theatre are actually SLEEPING!!! Why don't you get out if the movie makes you sleep??????People sleeping in the theatre and then talking how this movie felt fresh and awesome is simply the proof they are brainwashed and won't try to think for themselves even when the movie is so bad it makes them fall asleep.I'm done with modern Hollywood.
Do yourself a favour and watch something from the pre-2000 Hollywood or something non-American or at least independet like Jim Jarmusch. We have awesome and way better thrillers of this kind in Europe.",Bad Times at the El Royale
796,scifiartman,A must see and decide for yourself roller-coaster film!,8,17 August 2019,"It's sad, but understandable, that so many can only reference Tarantino with this film, but the opening is pulled directly from his bag of tricks. There are also shades of Scorsese, De Palma, Godard, and Coen Bros. in this film - and yes, that's impressive. Some fine writing here too, and yet some room for improvement, in a perfect world. But the film is impressive, on nearly every front.Outstanding performances from all, but Bridges and Hamm stand out in my mind. The bountiful twists and turns would keep you on the edge of your seat, but for the sluggish editing in the second half. Tighten this back-end up and you could be brushing with greatness!Unfortunately, director Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods) failed to rise above the popular politically correct mistake of making the sole black character a noble and lily pure caricature with bold pretenses, whose only flaw is to be trapped in her own feminine victim role, making her ultimately useless when the chips were down and push came to shove (I thought she was street tough!? The bottle?). Which is a real shame. Blacks are blacks, and women are women - and both cartoon points of view need to be moved beyond! But Ms. Erivo does an exceptional job of her character of limited scope, but ample (too much!) screen time.The other characters in this film are wonderfully rich, flawed, textured, and unpredictable, and the impressive writing gave plenty of room to explore these delicious personality faults.This is a roller-coaster ride of a film that must be experienced, and each viewer decide on all they have experienced. It's worth the watch, and may be solid gold for some, but a near miss for others, like me. And yet, a second viewing may be necessary. Yes, it does have cult-classic written all over it!",Bad Times at the El Royale
797,sanderhagens,Starts promising but loses steam.,5,27 August 2019,"The movie starts very exciting with 5 characters, one motel and seemingly everyone having a motive for being there. The best actor though is the setting and the music. A beautiful old motel in the middle of the 70's while most of the nostalgia comes from the 60's, while the Jukebox plays the hits from that era.The movie pulls you in rather quick and you want to figure out what's happening. Unfortunately after the first character death the movie doesn't know what to do anymore and becomes a generic movie. Overall the eventual pay off isn't that exciting.The actors are hit or miss. John Hamm and Chris Hemsworth give amazing performances. Jeff Bridges is okay while acting wise even Cynthia Erivo does her thing. Too bad she's mainly focusing on 60's era racism (because we can't have a movie without that!) or singing (not amazing). Dakota Johnson is just not a good actress and this is again proven in this movie.The movie takes a lot of hints from Tarantino and the cult film Identity but never reaches their highs. This movie had a lot of potential but overall it's just okay. It has some good ideas but poor execution and finally drags on and on while you already know who are gonna survive.",Bad Times at the El Royale

The tarantinoesque ""chapter"" parts of the film didn't go far enough to establish any context along the main story line and ultimately led to me not really caring much about the films unfulfilling finale.The late introduction of the films main villain Billy Lee was lost on me completely. While I appreciate the film for what it was trying to become it didn't quite Crescendo like I expected it to from the trailer.It was like a college student took a Tarantino and Wes Anderson film and spliced it together cutting out all the good bits on the way.The result isn't a complete failure of a movie but a watchable, ""missable"", movie about some people in a hotel finding out some stuff about each other and that's kind of it.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Now we got the positives (that took me 1/2 an hr to think of) out of the way...Im by no means a film buff. But for some reason, I was quite eager to watch this film. Im not sure why, but hey.
Any-who. I fired up the ol' streaming sites & after 4 attempts. GREAT, I found one!
Within the 1st 10mins, I realised I was in for a slow death by pretentiousness. One of those Tarrantino rejects, that went on to be shelved by about 4 other directors before Drew Goddard got his hands on it.
The film tries to be clever, (too clever for it's own good) with many plot twists.
However In it's plight to be unpredictable, it somehow renders itself extremely-predictable.
This helps lead to a nonsensical plot, full of holes, that somehow ends up outsmarting itself.Its a shame, as stellar performances by a talented cast, couldn't save this poorly written, drawn out story.
With a 2hrs22m runtime, the film is long. Very long. Roughly About 4hrs16m longer than need be.At times I couldn't tell if I was watching a thriller, a horror or a super-hero movie. (Other genres are available.)
There's nothing wrong with that. I Love when films think outside the box & mix genres.
But when it's by accident, due to a clumsy plot... Not so much.
IMHO, it should have been produced as a dark comedy. The fact it tries to represent itself as 'serious', made it harder to digest for me.The final scenes of any movie, should be dramatic. Including ones that have no action for 2hrs13mins of it's runtime.
However a cliché super-heroesque soundtrack, whilst playing a game of roulette in a burning hotel!... s'up wid dat?
(Btw, why was the hotel burning?)
Mix that with an anti-climactic finish &... Voilà!! BTATER
Think of the superman theme playing whilst your grandma waits for the lights to change to cross the road, with a stolen loaf of bread in an otherwise empty basket...

822,johnteuben,10 years from now people will be talking about this,10,3 June 2019,This is my first review. So that means this movie is good enough for me to waste my time trying to figure out how to write a review. I am wrong occasionally. Like the time I watched the Game of Thrones. Or the time I watched Deadwood the series and then watched Deadwood the movie thinking that it was going to make up for Deadwood the series. What I am saying here is that you could waste a lot of time watching other stuff people talk about but it won't be on this. But based on the comments there are a lot of people who are either mentally incompetent and shouldn't be reviewing movies or I am. I have watched a lot of movies and perhaps I have just watched a lot of crappy movies lately. But I really liked this one.,Bad Times at the El Royale

825,ocseanqi,"Great concept, mediocre execution.",7,30 May 2020,"The concept and plot set of this movie is amazing, every character has a deeper representation of its own and reflects an aspect of America. I do think the director actively confuses the viewer if the scandal of the big guy is MLK or JFK. I lean more of MLK, since it does fit the plot that it's reputation needs to be ruined even after his death more as a spiritual leader for race equality. The rises of R&B music, the bad effects of the Vietnam war, race tensions, cult, even female empowerment are all mixed into the characters in a spectacular way. But the overly done flashbacks, too slow paced dialogue just bores me sometimes. My feelings frustrates from masterpiece to meh several times.

After all here is a man who is looked up by so many and apparently magically ""knows the truth"" and trashes it. Reading his summary and how many things he got wrong it is clear he did not pay any attention, does not like the makers of this movie because of some personal reason or is simply too old and tired to follow a plot this complex (not really complex = irony).This movie is a bit dark, still not overly depressing. Yes there is a heavy Tarantino wibe to it but so what. If you are into movies that are not self-explanatory or even give you all the answers in the end, this one is for you. Yes some characters seem do not enjoy a lot of screen time and is not brought in with an extensive backstory, but so what?Unlike mr Reed, I know how many persons actually checks in (not seven), who uses wrong names (not all of them), does what to whom (no-one shoots anyone under the influense of smack) and also I understood the characters without knowing their whole life stories.

The film starring Josh Brolin, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn sounded like one of the biggest and best films of the year on paper, but it wasn't an instant hit. But what do you do when a movie features Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, Chris Hemsworth, and John Hamm, among others?

I'm so glad I waited to watch this film, from the start it had me hooked usually I can workout what's going to happen but this film surprised me a good few times.
Now for the rant after reading a lot of the other reviews I have to say people need to stop comparing this to pulp fiction it's nothing like it, yes their is afew similarities to Tarantino films if any I'd say more reservoir dogs and hateful 8 with a lot of dialogue scenes and flashbacks to explain each character.
Everyone one gave great performances with probably best going to Darlene for her singing which was amazing.

Jon Hamm and Jeff Bridges also produced stand out performances, as one would expect from these exceptional actors, but the one everyone needs to keep their eye on is Cynthia Erivo! This British actress more known for her stage work, nails it and you can see why she has already earned a Tony, a Grammy, and an Emmy. She steals the show with this performance and has done her alma mater (The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) proud.

841,mail-885-983402,Just no. It leads to nothing and it's based on nothing,1,17 October 2018,"Everything is wrong with this movie. Nothing actually leads to anything. The best scene is actually and unfortunately the very first scene. It sets a nice tone, has good music and a nice set up. But after those first 2 minutes everything gets lost and you're up for wasting over 2 hours. First of al the randomness of the characters. You'd think they end up having some connection. But forget it. It couldn't be more random and disconnected. Same for how they all end up together at the end of the movie. Everything is randomly forced to become one. The whole fbi story. Why? He calls with hoover, disobeys without reason after apparently years in the job, dies and nothing? That's it? We have to be sad because he had a 2 second conversation with his daughter? Really? Then there's the kidnapping? Why? OK theres some sort of weird sisterhood going on there. Something that is build on in seperate scenes. But so weak it doesn't make you feel sorry. More like blaming them for being so stupid. Andthe way she sets up what becomes the worst performance of Chris on camera, is just too easy. And I won't even speak about the weak cult set up that supposedly makes him a god woman can't refuse. Although the fact that he dances half naked in every scene could be confused with causing that and is probably the reason all ladies are hypnotised. A bit sexist way of using Chris for this role. The singer story is sad. Yeah. Life's hard. But then what, you can become a murderer out of thin air? Again way too easy. And there's no explanation whatsoever of why she becomes so murder feeling. There's the watching you behind the mirror part, of the movie. It actually sets up an interesting storyline. But nothing happens with it?? Accept that it basically acts as a door. It's just there. Ugh so much more. I walked out of the cinema. And we were both like what the cookie did we just watch? Only coming here to see such high ratings!???",Bad Times at the El Royale

858,gune311,"Promising concept, disappointing execution",5,28 October 2018,"I was delighted to see this title at the movies and decided to go give it a watch, since it seemd so intriguing.
The thing about Bad Times at the El Royale is the set-up, premise and overall idea had so much potential, but the way it was presented was pretty disappointing.First of all, the props and interior design felt kind of... off. When I watched El Royale, I just didn't feel like I would have known it was the 60's . I only knew it because they told me it was. The costumes, props, and sets were so uninspired and didn't make me feel like the movie was taking place in 1967 at all. It was like they just mashed together some clothes and props to give it a ""vintage"" vibe, not even paying attention to the details of that specific era.
Second thing; Dakota Johnson and several other casting choices were poorly made in my opinion. Dakota Johnson's acting was pretty flat, boring and she just seemed really out of place the entire film. Her presence, acting, and the clothes she wore made it feel like I was watching a movie taking place in 2018 and she didn't add anything of substance to movie at all.Other than that, the cinematography was way too glossy and polished, and robbed the movie from the old-timey atmosphere and feelings they could have otherwise portrayed.The execution of the story was also a little weird.
The first half of the movie was dragging on and on, without anything really happening, it was just an hour of nothing significant or important taking place, which I assumed was some sort of build-up for something great, but that great thing never really... happened and the movie just dragged on and on with various messily executed events occurring that weren't really that interesting to watch at all.

869,Parham_Nik,Review - Bad Times at the El Royale,7,2 January 2019,"Pulp Fiction meets Ten Little Indians in a stylish and bloody 2018 thriller called Bad Times at the El Royale that will have the viewer on the edge of its chair for the majority of its running time before running out of gas with an overlong and over the top finale.It is 1969 and we are introduced to the El Royale, a hotel which was actually constructed on the border between California and Nevada. The rooms on the California side actually cost a dollar more than the ones in Nevada and the key chains for the rooms are in the shape of the states. The hotel has a staff of one, a nervous young man named Miles and the film opens with a man checking into a room, hiding a large amount of cash in the money underneath the floorboards of a room and shortly afterwards is murdered.Almost a decade later, we watch an aging priest suffering from dementia, a cocky vacuum cleaner salesman, a struggling nightclub singer, and a hippie with a mouth like a sailor check into the hotel on the same day. These virtual strangers not only prove not to be strangers, but none of them are exactly who they say they are, all have huge secrets which they try to protect before it all blows up in their respective faces.Director and writer Drew Goddard has experience in television and films, but what comes through mostly here is the Quentin Tarantino influence that comes through in his work...the occasional sacrifice of substance for style and the disjointed form of storytelling that requires undivided attention from the viewer. In Pulp Fiction, Tarantino tells his story out of order but that's not exactly what Goddard does here. We get parts of the same story told from different viewpoints and connecting story events like puzzle pieces, which is more akin to what Tarantino did in Jackie Brown. There is also influence of directors like Hitchcock and John Carpenter...Goddard displays an affinity for creating nail-biting suspense as well as the instantaneous ""Boo"" that makes the viewer jump from their chair. Sadly, Goddard does get a little full of himself with a pretentious and overlong finale which produces questions that shouldn't be produced at this point and definitely tries viewer patience.The film is handsomely produced with particular nods to art direction/set direction and some spectacular film editing by Lisa Lassek. The El Royale is the coolest hotel I have seen in a movie since The Overlook in The Shining. There are some terrific performances from Jeff Bridges as the priest, Jon Hamm as the salesman, Cynthia Erivo (who was also in this year's Widows) as the nightclub singer, Lewis Pullman as Miles, and Chris Hemsworth, surprisingly effective as a charismatic cult leader. Until the final 15 minutes or so, spine-tingling entertainment that definitely kept me on my toes.",Bad Times at the El Royale

It has a great, old school feel to it (with some Tarantino vibes) but it's fresh and keeps you anticipating what'll happen next.

But you'll soon find out that nothing is really the way it seem, nor are the people.This is a interesting and good movie with plot twists that were kind of expected but also kind of not. The colors and the way the scenes are shot is perfect, it reminds me of The Shining. Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Bridges' acting in this movie is outstanding.

BUT, although I happen to be okay with very violent movies, I can't think of a Tarantino flick that moved me as much emotionally with as much empathy and vesting in the characters even with relatively short character development.I looked up Lewis Pullman and see he is Bill Pullman's son and he did a great performance, arguably Oscar worthy in my opinion.

Walking into it, I had high expectations because I've been a huge fan of Drew Goddard's work from ""Cabin in the Woods"" to Netflix's ""Daredevil"" series. Very long and drawn out scenes and too many unanswered questions. It felt too much like a Tarantino film because of all the things happening without having any real expectations for anything. Hemsworth and Bridges were the only highlights in this film but only because they were in it; nothing to do with how great their characters were.",Bad Times at the El Royale

Very entertaining and intriguing from the start.

Not all it could've been, but THOROUGHLY entertaining.",9,16 October 2018,"The Tarantino'esq'ness is undeniable, and if your not a fan of Pulp Fiction type films, I'd keep my distance. But if so, the shared DNA feels more homage'y then derivative. Tarantino himself readily acknowledges the inspiration for his style, and the tradition continues here, but with a pacing and tension that feels new, at times engagingly uncomfortable, slipping deftly between driving the plot forward, and keeping you rooted in the scene. Admittedly, the final scene lost some of the momentum, but only was a mild distraction due to the brilliant spin up that preceded it. I was capitivated right till the end. Jeff Bridges can do no wrong in my book, and makes no exception here. The fact that several cast members chose to reduce their salaries for their roles, so the director would be granted more creative autonomy is what convinced me this wasn't one to miss. I was right. Went way beyond expectations!",Bad Times at the El Royale

As I see there is a lot of Tarantino fans which coment negatively about the movie... For me this is a one step further, as El Royale leaves a bit of a more serious impression than Tarantino movies...

886,ptheaul,Check in to the El Royale!,8,4 October 2018,"I had the opportunity to see a sneak preview of 'Bad Times at the El Royale' thanks to the Alamo Drafthouse.If you've seen 'Cabin in the Woods' then you have a good idea of what director Drew Goddard brings to the table. He brings that same sense of style and flare to the El Royale. The film looks great and hooks you in from the start. If I had to describe the feel, I'd say it's Tarantino meets Hitchcock. It takes its time introducing and fleshing out the characters while unfolding the plot in a way that's always interesting. The revelations are put together with a ton of craft and it has a great mix of dark comedy. A little long towards the end but the pay off is worth it.Speaking of characters, the cast is fantastic. Jon Hamm brings his 'Mad Men' charm along with a dash of great comedic timing. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best roles since 'True Grit' and he has great chemistry with Cynthia Erivo. Their scenes together are some of the best and this is sure to be a breakout role for her. Same goes for Lewis Pullman who plays the Hotel everything(you'll get the joke when you see it) as he delivers a purposefully awkward but strong character. Chris Hemsworth gives us something that we haven't seen from him before but the less said about that, the better. Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny were a mixed bag for me. They had some great scenes but the characters were my least favorite.Another star in the film is the perfect soundtrack. Not only because of the song choices themselves but also how they are intertwined with the flow and action of the scenes.If you're looking for something fresh and different, this is one to check out as soon as possible. One of my favorites of the year. Its one that is difficult to review without giving away too much, so I'll just wrap this up. I look forward to watching it again.8 out of 10.",Bad Times at the El Royale

I find myself in a world of bad movies now days with Super Hero junk, crummy remakes and bad Horror movies, but ever so rarely do I find a little nugget of good. This movie is a goldmine! This is kinda like if you mixed the movie Indentity with a Quentin movie like The Hateful 8 or Reservoir Dogs. (but no this isn't a Quentin rip off whatsoever, but might seem that way to people that dont know much about film) The setting and look to this movie is great, and the story is amazing. I only had one or two small little changes I would have done, but other then that this movie is close to being flawless in my eyes. I saw a few bad reviews, and that just fueled me with rage.

He is truly menacing. He is what a Negan should've been on the past couple of Walking Dead seasons. The music is great! Cinematography is great! The hotel set is great!

906,thordt,When Quentin has no Identity,2,27 November 2020,"When we watched the trailer, we thought: Wow! Sounds like a great movie. Pretty good cast (we love Jeff Bridges), good music, super nice set and an intriguing story. Turned out: All true except for the story. There is actually NO real story to the movie! It is basically a sequence of random (boring) stories.The overall atmosphere, story and setting reminds a lot of The Hateful Eight, Identity and Once upon a time in Hollywood (hmm, did someone tried to be QT? And did someone maybe failed to do so?). However, those movies turned out to have a overarching narrative and all lose ends will be brought together at some point. For this movie it's not the case though. There are so many lose ends and they will remain. They open up so many side stories that will just stay untold. Starting from the very rare event that four total strangers arrive at the same hotel at the same time, which is apparently not in high demand at the time of the events, and are the only guests. Surprisingly they all have their little secrets and agendas. So you would expect that there is some kind of connection between the characters. But there is simply non. It's pure coincidence. Come on? Really? How unlikely is that?Then there is a mysterious movie of a dead, famous person taped through the mirror of one of the hotel rooms. Apparently it is very delicate and valuable. But we will never know why or who is the person on that tape. In fact, it just doesn't matter. It's just another boring lose end.Then there is a ""Management"" that pulls the strings of the heroin addicted receptionist who is for some reason the only person working in that strange place. He will tell the proposition (it's right on the border of Nevada and California) of the hotel to new guests like a robot, so you would think it has a deeper meaning. But we will never know who is this ""Management"" and what is their agenda nor what's the motivation for the receptionist to work for them. Between California and Nevada? It doesn't matter for the story. It just does not.And these are just some examples. The movie is full of those. It's extremely frustrating if you are guy who appreciates good, logical narratives.The worst part however is, when the wannabe ""Charles Manson"" and his gang appear. Yes, it creates a little action and shooting, but no it doesn't make any sense. Endless talking with no deeper meaning. The guy is not even listening to the hostages. He just wants to kill them for no reason. It really brings nothing to the overall plot, except that the receptionist will be stabbed after he killed the whole gang and the fake Father shrives him. So he can die in peace.One other issue of the movie is that everything is quite predictable and you almost beg them to give you an unexpected twist. But there ain't. It will happen exactly what you expect to happen.I have to admit that my rating is so low, because the expectation and the potential were so high. The setting, the cast, the atmosphere were there to create a masterpiece. But in the end, it's just boring two hours. It was purely frustrating.So save yourself time and money and go for the real deal instead: Quentin Tarantino did it way better!",Bad Times at the El Royale
907,linuslucy,Truly Bad Times...,9,17 October 2018,"Suprisingly, this period piece shows more heart than I expected. By the end of the film, I found myself enjoying the great sense of nostalgia the film portrays, but more importantly I found a vested interest in the outcomes of each of these individuals.

This movie is like a Cohen brothers film ""Hateful Eight"". You can't figure out who is real and what part they play in the story. Keeps you guessing and shocks you along the way. Well written and directed. Great story line. Actors are dead on playing the rolls they have. I enjoyed every moment of the film. Just when you think you know what happens next, you don't.

This is one of them. It had great potential but failed to deliver. And it's not just me.

The characters are incredible, and you get the idea early on that everything and everyone are not how they present. As the plot lines weave in around these characters, you get an incredibly dark, funny, intriguing piece of cinema. Calling this a ""Tarantino wannabe"" movie is unfair; the violence is appropriate and not excessive, the music is essential but it doesn't totally steal the scene. This is much more subtly intelligent than a Tarantino flick. I'm definitely owning a copy of this one... looking forward to enjoying it many times over.

If you love Tarantino's style then this movie is for you. It's set in 1969 it has the nostalgia and feel of the era. The music, acting, and sets are excellent. The story is solid but you should have some knowledge of the era of the sixties to fully comprehend parts of it. The only negative is I would like to have had both John Hamm's and Chris Hemsworth's appearances be a little more lengthy as I thought their performances were both the best of the year from each actor. As usual Jeff Bridges gives an A+ performance and we get a full dose of him throughout the movie. All the performances are strong and there is great chemistry among them all.

943,yulingwen,Not a thriller!,1,13 October 2018,"They call it thriller but it's nothing like a thriller. For me they are trying to put everything in one film: X factor, action, murder mystery and thriller but the problem is that when you are trying to satisfy everyone it is unavoidable you are going to let everyone down. The movie is awkwardly structured in Tarantinoa style with a poor story line. If I pay to watch a thriller I want a thriller not some half X factor, half Tarantino monster. The film industry and audience are going mad. This is rated 7.6 out of 10 - for me, I would give a zero star. What a waste of time and money!",Bad Times at the El Royale
944,atyrus,Wow,10,14 October 2018,This movie shot the hell out of me. Definitely worth watching. Hotel mirrors will never be the same after watching this movie.,Bad Times at the El Royale

946,omarkattouri,Favorite film in 2018 so far,10,15 October 2018,"This film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Cinematography, acting, shots, Soundtrack, and script writing felt natural. I went in and felt i was living the 1960's. I cannot write anymore, because this film made me speechless. I fully recommend watching this, and I would go and watch it with you again.PS Don't watch the trailer if you haven't yet.",Bad Times at the El Royale
947,interquack-47143,Derivative and not borrowing well.,4,18 October 2018,"Clearly inspired by the spirit of the controlled and riveting potential chaos that Quentin Tarantino has exercised with apparent ease, Goddard's work here needed a re-write, by another screenwriter. A capable hand at directing, I don't believe he had enough better scrivener's eyes bending the work. The first hour is all build without building much other than boredom...I nodded off between the time the Agent pulls the cables on the vehicles and then discovers the secret of the rooms. There are no attractive characters at the outset to cleave to and get you invested in, and there isn't enough plot revelation to intrigue you without forcing yourself to pay attention. Riveting it ain't. The real antagonist is not made evident until too deep in the picture to make him well developed and the final farrago is predictable, with only one moment of inspiring character action that was worthy. The singers puppydog expression was annoying but she is capable with the thin character she is given. The cast is uniformly superb really, but for the older sister to the younger cult addled prisoner. This older sister doesn't really come across as dangerous or capable and is a thin representation of what the character could have been. Character motivations were mostly just printed onto them and it is assumed that we will buy it. This lean character development can work if the picture drives forward with focus and intent....this doesn't. A great and seldom used time distortion tool is used to add depth to some short pieces but it is not set up well and not carried through the picture. Its was like almost last minute, as someone thought, "" We should do this to get ourselves out of this explaining jam.""...coff.... I think that Mr. Goddard, please do more pictures cuz you are good, needs to have a believable aid de camp at his side in the writing process, or should leave the writing to those with a more measured hand that are naturals at drama on the page. I find it strange that his story telling sense didn't kick in better. I think no one felt confident enough to approach him...He might be a difficult entity to deal with on set and during production, as he could be fair full of himself as his creation of a piece of music for the incredible score belies. To squeeze a tune of your own inside of a track that features some of the best soul rock ever is a little hubristic.....",Bad Times at the El Royale
948,andersenm-28748,Don't waste your time,1,20 October 2018,Don't waste your time. I didn't like it. It was SO boring. I think it was a waste of time. I won't see it again. And it hasn't been the best movie of the year.,Bad Times at the El Royale

953,rdtrumpet,AGUABLY THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!,10,24 October 2018,"When we saw this film, we expected it to be entertaining--probably--but we didn't expect it to be outstanding (which is clearly is.) I can only think of a handful of other movies that even come close to it in quality. This film is perfect in every way, and is probably the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many during my 60+ years on this planet.Yes, ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" is an action movie, but it's so much more than that. It's also very deep and philosophical, has an excellent ensemble cast of well-developed characters, has outstanding--no, make that amazing--directing, writing, acting, editing, cinematography, and everything else you can think of.People who were around at the end of the 1960s into the early 1970s/end of the Vietnam War period will especially appreciate the film's beautifully accurate portrayal of this time period (including a great collection of popular music from that period.) But anyone would enjoy this film, because its story and its messages are timeless. And, the film is full of so many surprises and twists, and so much fun.There were a couple of scenes in the film that shocked and surprised the entire audience at the theater, which made us all scream out loud, followed by the entire theater audience laughing at our unexpected reactions. This film is destined to become a classic, so do yourself a favor and go see it as soon as possible! It is a lot of fun seeing it in a movie theater. (Of course, I'll need to buy the movie for home viewing also when it becomes available. It is one of those rare classic movies that you can watch over and over again, enjoying it just as much on each repeat viewing.)",Bad Times at the El Royale
954,rasputinturmoil,Mountains in Stockton?! Lazy filmmaking,8,31 October 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed most of this film, but was totally disappointed by Drew Goddard's laziness (I guess I understand his not filming the movie at Lake Tahoe or using the real CalNeva, even though it's closed now), but when Jeff Bridges says they robbed an armored car in Stockton?!! Remember that robbery scene? C'mon Drew - there are no mountains in Stockton, let alone the snow-covered kind. BOOOO! Would have been so easy to say Sonora or Bishop or Lone Pine. What a boneheaded mistake. Maybe the thinking was that no one seeing the movie would have actually ever been to Stockton (?). I don't understand how when you spend so much money and spend so much time making a movie like this, you can't avoid such a glaring error.",Bad Times at the El Royale
955,jackdavenport-60924,Should have stuck with their original idea,5,3 November 2018,"Everything about this movie was set up very well. Great cast of actors, the cinematography was amazing, music was great and the initial setup was interesting and had me wondering what was going to happen.Then, after 20 minutes, the movie goes in a completely different direction which is confusing and unpredictable but not in a good way. The initial setup would have been so much more interesting than how the movie actually panned out, and it makes me wish that they expanded on the beginning instead of changing the story and leaving lots of loose ends and unanswered questions by the end.I would recommend this movie if you're a fan of the nice visual style or performance of the actors. But if you're looking for an interesting mystery story, I would suggest another film.",Bad Times at the El Royale
956,TANYA-zhok,Bad times indeed,2,1 May 2021,Don't waste your time on this. Its truly very bad.There is no logic or plot. Flat characters all around. Just a bunch of nonsense with bad editing.,Bad Times at the El Royale
957,kamsidiekechuku,Amazing,10,19 November 2018,"Refreshing storyline, good acting and a lot of unexpected twists and turns . I loved it",Bad Times at the El Royale
958,lbgeve,"Average movie, no clear purpose",4,26 November 2018,"At the end of the movie there was no clear purpose to the events. The cinematography was near perfect, but nothing unique. The movie's was built on character's individual stories, which I guess everyone is resembling to the Tarantino movie, but in the end nothing came together and you're left with useless backgrounds from each character. Yes, all of their stories tell the audience how they ended up there, but there was no point after that; there was no morale of the story. The movie was eerie/disturbing in a good way and reminds me a little of Bates Motel.",Bad Times at the El Royale
959,EStrong513,"Not bad, not good, but enjoyable. On the edge of being a 9 or 10 star.",7,19 December 2018,"I did enjoy watching this movie but I think there was a lot of missed potential based on the storyline and characters. If you're into strange plots, characters and the general crime/gangster/action/suspense genre, you'll like it, but you may not love it. It's a good movie to pass the time with. Had I seen this in a theater, I would have felt cheated of my money.So to add why I was disappointed: The flashbacks to the characters ""origin"" stories; They could have been longer and better scripted. I would have liked to have seen more about the main players and how they really got where they were as far as people. Seeing more about Bridges character as far as planning and executing the robbery would have been nice, as also the prison fight. The Vietnam flashback could have been longer and played into how that young man ended up on the needle. Also, why not some flashbacks on what was really going on at the El Royale before it turned into a ghost town. Flashbacks of the violence, corruption and origin would have been nice.Still, this is a good move, just not great. It did keep my interest throughout, but left me wanting more.",Bad Times at the El Royale
960,foreignaustrian,A gripping story with excellent pacing,9,22 December 2018,"Bad Times at the El Royale features a stellar cast that embodies the different characters as natural as it gets. Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo are arguably the main characters who both deliver outstanding performances, all while supported by the other, not in any way less brilliant, actors. Most notably Chris Hemsworth, who proves he can do more than wield a hammer as the Norse God of thunder.
The story is tightly intertwined and complemented by well executed pacing, often switching between long, sweeping shots and cutting erratically to the beat of the fitting soundtrack.
The more you dive into each character's story, it becomes apparent that nothing is what it seems and El Royale left me shocked more than once, after being lulled into false safety before.
You will learn to cherish some and empathise with a few of the patrons of the hotel, while learning to hate some others who appear. A masterpiece that ticks all the boxes, keeps you on edge, all supported by highly detailed characters!",Bad Times at the El Royale
961,alpacinouae,Thanks for Fast Forward button,1,25 December 2018,"I was confused because of the high and low rating of this movie so i decided to take the risk and watching this boooooooooooooooooooooring work . With no surprises the low rates are right . DON""T waste your time or u can use fast forward button as i did so u can finish it in 15 m which is more than what it deserves.",Bad Times at the El Royale
