0,TheLittleSongbird,Lame and unfunny,1,3 October 2010,"I know it is all to do with acquired taste, but I well and truly disliked this film, even if it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't hate everything by the Wayans brothers, but they are somewhat hit-and-miss. The first two Scary movies were entertaining if mindless, but there is stuff like this which was literally painful to watch. I don't know where to begin criticising this film.How about the shoddy camera work? To be honest, while I have seen worse looking movies, White Chicks does look tacky. How about the lazy direction? I wouldn't say Keenan Ivory Wayans is an absolutely terrible director, but like his films he is hit and miss, and here he is very lazy with the direction. How about the predictable story? Now I know White Chicks isn't the first film to suffer from a predictable story, even good films have stories that are occasionally predictable, but here there were scenes and situations that I could smell a mile off and I was never surprised.How about the lowbrow and unfunny humour? Once again, not the first film to suffer from this. The Friedberg and Seltzer spoof movies are prime examples, and Freddy Got Fingered and Garbage Pail Kids Movie also had some very unsubtle and I think unfunny humour, but White Chicks is one of those films where I didn't laugh once. I don't mind unsubtle humour, it isn't my thing but I don't mind it, as long as it's funny, but the thing was it never was funny. Every single one of the gags were stale and incredibly trite, and when it comes to using some of the shtick that worked so wonderfully in the brilliant Some Like it Hot it falls well short on the imagination. As for the criticism of racism, that's up for debate, but there are some lines in the script that make you think ""wow they've gone a bit too far haven't they?""How about the characters? Well I disliked them, every single one of them. Also, is it it just me or aren't the characters clichéd and stereotypical. Again, it is not the first film to have stereotyped characters, The Breakfast Club and in some ways From Here to Eternity did too, but those two had great casts that didn't make the stereotyping matter that much. So how about the acting? It wasn't great at all actually, for me it wasn't. Some of the cast are talented but are given little to nothing to do. I was especially disappointed with John Heard, he is great when he has great material, but seeing as it was awful he was stuck. In fact, the only actor who seemed to be trying was Terry Crews, but even his character didn't have that much likability about him.Finally, how about the soundtrack? I love a good soundtrack, but while I have nothing against the style of music used here, it was forgettable and felt somewhat over-used too. Any redeeming qualities? The make-up was pretty good, but that's it. So in conclusion, lame and unfunny, and while I am not going to force you if you like comedy(Clue, My Cousin Vinny, Oscar, Young Frankenstein, Duck Soup and Shot in the Dark are some of my favourites from the genre) I suggest you avoid this film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",White Chicks
1,SnoopyStyle,Annoying and stupid. That's even before the whitefacing.,2,20 April 2014,"Kevin (Shawn Wayans) and Marcus Copeland (Marlon Wayans) are brothers and FBI agents who keep screwing up. To get back to the good graces, they get the job to babysit wealthy socialites Brittany and Tiffany Wilson. There is intel that they are the targets of a kidnapping gang. When the boys cause some scratches on the girls' faces, they refuse to go the big social event. So the guys get white girl makeovers to take over their identities.The guys are annoying even before they get the white girl makeovers. The girls are all stereotypical superficial girls. It's hard to laugh at the white face when nobody sees the ridiculous makeup. And talk about ugly and their voices are annoying as heck. Not to mention that nobody notices the huge makeovers. They could maybe get away with playing two unknown random white girls but how could friends buy into the makeup. This is way too stupid. Some parts of the movie actually show signs of comedic life like when Jennifer Carpenter goes nuclear over her body image. However there is an overall sense of ugliness that permeates this movie.",White Chicks
2,claudio_carvalho,Highly Recommended For Days When You Are Down and Trouble,7,13 May 2007,"After an unsuccessful mission, FBI agents Kevin Copeland (Shawn Wayans) and Marcus Copeland (Marlon Wayans) fall in disgrace in the agency. They decide to swap their bad position with his superior Section Chief Elliott Gordon (Frankie Faison) working undercover in an abduction case, disguised in the two spoiled white daughters of a tycoon, Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, getting in hilarious situations.I like the silly and funny movies that Keenen Ivory Wayans directs. His formula, mixing gross, low level and racist jokes are hilarious and highly recommended for days when you are down and trouble. My soccer time lost the game in the afternoon and I was very upset. While watching ""White Chicks"", I laughed a lot and I really liked this comedy, which will never be nominated to an Oscar or to Cannes. But it is delightful to shutdown the brain and feel amusement and joy with this type of silliness to improve the humor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""As Branquelas"" (""White Chicks"")",White Chicks
3,kosmasp,Un-believable,5,21 July 2009,"First of all, you have to suspend your disbelief. Going into this movie, thinking that it isn't possible for the Wayans Brothers to play ""White Chicks"", won't help you. Story-wise this is all I'm going to reveal, but I still wanted to put the spoiler tag. Then again, there isn't so much story ... as with many comedies, to begin with, it's all about the premise.And this said premise, sees two Dudes dressed as women. Now if this sounds familiar, you might have seen the classic movie ""Some like it hot"". A really great movie, that you shouldn't compare this with. This is just nonsense fun. And it's pretty obvious they're having fun here. If you allow yourself to experience this ridiculous movie, than you will have fun. At least the first time around.",White Chicks
4,lee_eisenberg,"even if the movie's dumb, it's good to see Paris Hilton mocked",6,8 September 2005,"Basically a big excuse to mock the Paris Hilton crowd, ""White Chicks"" is pretty dumb, but never dull. Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI agents Kevin and Marcus Copeland, who pose as a pair of Paris Hilton-like heiresses. Any goofy thing that you can imagine, this movie most likely has it.I guess that some scenes were a little unnecessary, but I overall liked the movie (especially since I have probably the lowest opinion of Paris Hilton of any person on Earth). The Wayans brothers pull no punches in this movie. Even if ""White Chicks"" is a litany of idiocy, it is truly and undeniably da bomb!",White Chicks
5,jboothmillard,White Chicks,4,18 August 2008,"From Razzie nominated Keenen Ivory Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), and with his writing/producer/star brothers (also part of Scary Movie 1 & 2), comes this cross-dressing, inter-racial and almost risky comedy. Basically disgraced African-American FBI agent brothers Kevin and Marcus Copeland (played by real brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans) have one more chance to prove themselves by protecting cruise line heiress and bratty socialite sisters, Brittany (Maitland Ward) and Tiffany Wilson (Anne Dudek) - clones of Paris and Nikki Hilton - from possible kidnap. This becomes a disaster when after getting scratches, and overacting, they refuse to go anywhere, so rather than face being fired, Kevin and Marcus decide to disguise themselves as the two white chicks, and doing this get themselves into hilarious girlie and nearly revealing situations. After the usual film ""things looking bad"" stage, and a lot of gross jokes, they do prove themselves good agents when they thwart the bad guy, Warren Vandergeld (John Heard), and everyone makes up, yawn, it always happens. Also starring Jaime King as Heather Vandergeld, Frankie Faison as Section Chief Elliott Gordon, Scary Movie's Lochlyn Munro as Agent Jake Harper, Busy Philipps as Karen, Everybody Hates Chris's Terry Crews as Latrell Spencer, Brittany Daniel as Megan Vandergeld, Eddie Velez as Agent Vincent Gomez, Jessica Cauffiel as Tori and Rochelle Aytes as Denise Porter. The cross-dressing, toilet and sexual gags are always funny, highlights include the toilet sequence, playing with the dildo, dinner between Marcus (disguised) and Spencer, and the break dancing sequence. I guess I can see certain reasons the critics give the film one out of five stars, but I couldn't help but laugh most of the time. The film also has a surprisingly catchy soundtrack, featuring songs such as Vanessa Carlton's ""A Thousand Miles"", Pink's ""Trouble"", No Doubt's ""It's My Life"", Maroon 5's ""This Love"", Beyoncé feat. Jay-Z - ""Crazy In Love"", Benny Benassi pts. The Biz - ""Satisfaction"" and Black Eyed Pea's ""Let's Get It Started"". It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, and the Wayans brothers were nominated Worst Actress, Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay. Okay!",White Chicks
6,rmax304823,Sometimes Fun.,5,23 June 2016,"I didn't find it hilarious, but it does have its occasional moments.The business of he-men being stuck in a position in which they must pose as girls is amusing in itself, though not at all fresh. In fact -- let me think. I'm trying to think of undeniably masculine men who have worn dresses in movies, mostly for laughs. Without thinking too earnestly or too long, I get Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Burt Lancaster, Arnold Scwarzenegger, Jeff Bridges, Dustin Hoffman, Cary Grant, and Rod Steiger. This example is a little different because the Wayans brothers, FBI men, are not only made up as girls but as white girls. Make up has done an admirable job too.That's as it may be. The problem is that the humor inherent in the situation is drained of energy because it's overdone. The thunderous sound of a man suffering from diarrhea isn't as funny as a discrete squeal. Instead of a nudge with an elbow, you get a kick in the balls. It's gaudy, fast, loud.But, man, the writers have gotten rich white chicks down pat. Something to do with a gathering of the tony people in the Hamptons. The Wayans are assigned as escorts to two of the most outrageously spoiled and narcissistic young blonds imaginable. Now THAT's hilarious because it's pointed satire and it knows its realistic limits.As a whole, the movie is a judgment call. I didn't laugh, but then I'm suffering from a severe case of restless legs syndrome and I have this terrific hangnail on my pinky. Look.",White Chicks
7,sunwarrior13,"Silly,Obvious And Unfunny",1,14 July 2015,"The Wayans brothers - Keenen Ivory Wayans (director,co-screenwriter) together with Shawn and Marlon Wayans (lead stars,co-screenwriter) - work together in a buddy cop comedy that one can only describe as obvious,unfunny and silly.It tells a story of brothers and fellow FBI agents Marcus and Kevin Copeland who disguised themselves as Caucasian female who agree to escort socialite sisters Brittany and Tiffany Wilton from the airport at JFK Airport to their hotel room in the Hamptons as both are being targeted by a serial kidnapper.They did this to renew the confidence of the higher ups after a drug bust they messed up as regular guys.One can only see that it provides nothing else except unfunny jokes,raunchy humor that could be classified as bathroom jokes and a brainless social commentary.It only does nothing except insult the viewer's intelligence and nothing more.",White Chicks
8,zardoz-13,The Wayans Have Not Gone Way Out Enough,6,9 July 2007,"Writing, producing, directing, and starring in the first two ""Scary Movies"" must have taken a lot out of the Wayans Brothers. ""White Chicks"" is only half as hilarious as their blockbuster horror spoofs. Moreover, the Wayans stretch their one-dimensional drag comedy to the breaking point and it snaps. The jokes don't fly as thick and fast as in the ""Scary Movies."" Incredibly, the Wayans keep gross-out humor to a minimum in their amusing combination of ""Big Momma's House"" meets the classic 1959 comedy ""Some Like It Hot"" with Marilyn Monroe. Of course, the main reason to watch ""White Chicks"" is to howl at Shawn and Marlon as they don women's apparel and struggle to pass themselves off as the title heroines. Suspending your disbelief to accept this far-fetched farce in which two African-American dudes dress-up in drag as blondes may require more than some audiences can conjure up. Nevertheless, logic has nothing to do with enjoying this threadbare but entertaining comedy. Along the way, the Wayans ridicule thin girls who insist they are horrendously fat. At the same time, the Wayans show considerable sympathy and compassion for underdog girls. However, somewhere along the way, the Wayans forgot about jokes and devoted more time to plot complications and exposition. Furthermore, ""White Chicks"" isn't so much racial as it is cultural. Unfortunately, after the guys go undercover as gals, they learn nothing from their experience.Cast as accident-prone FBI agents, Shawn and Marlon Wayans get the chance to redeem themselves after a sting-gone-bad against drug dealers if they can crack a kidnapping plot against two high society bimbos Tiffany and Brittany Wilson (Anne Dudek and Maitland Ward) that want nothing to do with our dimwitted duo. The opening sequence establishes how our heroes rely on latex disguises to trap evildoers, but they take their ideas farther than anybody imagines when they try to impersonate the Wilson sisters. Initially, after being assigned to escort the Wilsons to a ritzy weekend in the Hamptons, Marcus Copeland (Marlon Wayans) careens into a ditch, and the gals wind up with scratches on their faces. These blond WASPs refuse to attend a party in the Hamptons, so they can recuperate from their scars. Meanwhile, Marcus and his brother agent Kevin (Shawn Wayans) realize they must do something if they want to keep their badges, so they have latex masks made and pad themselves to resemble the Wilsons. Naturally, they couldn't fool anybody in the costumes they wear, but such is part of the wacky, off-beat humor of ""White Chicks."" Watching the Wayans try to behave like Caucasian cuties is pretty funny. They wear blue contact lens, obvious wigs, and have devil of a time getting into and out of their costumes. In the shallow script penned by Shawn, Marlon, and Keenen Ivory Wayans, a brawny athlete takes a liking to Marcus in his Wilson girl disguise and pursues him with the same devotion that Joe E. Brown chased Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like It Hot."" Nobody else in the movie makes much out of the fact that our heroes look twice as big as the other women, especially the gals who accept them as the Wilsons. Sadly, despite the hilarity of seeing the Wayans impersonate women, ""White Chicks"" doesn't deliver enough comedy to get it over its dull spots.",White Chicks
9,Calicodreamin,Hold my poodle!,7,31 August 2021,"This movie never fails to make me laugh, it's the perfect parody humor. The acting is good from most of the cast and though the storyline is basic, it holds up. There are so many iconic moments, Terry Crews singing A thousand miles, the fitting room scene, and the epic dance off. One of my favs for a go to laugh.",White Chicks
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Whether or not it's racist...,1,1 November 2009,"Someone really needs to sit down with the Wayans', explain how terrible their work is, maybe bring some clips of it to help illustrate that point. Seriously, are they simply surrounded by a mix of yes-men and people too worried they'll be accused of prejudice against African-Americans? Keenen Ivory... stop directing, please. You're not very good at it(unless I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is the exception to the rule... I sincerely doubt that Little Man is, and those are the only two I've yet to watch). Shawn and Waylon... just plain stop. Damon... what the heck happened to the show you had, titled after yourself, man, that had *hilarious* moments. And all of you, do not write again. If the gag isn't doesn't make us laugh the first time, why would it help to repeat it? That happens several times in this. The material consists mainly of offensive stereotypes, and making fun the Hilton sisters(and types like them) and fashion and such, and anyone who'd enjoy this flick are already making those jokes, so why bother? Frankly, nobody their behavior is plenty enough, nobody has to make an effort to mock them. Everybody here is a soulless caricature. The misunderstandings and their solutions all seem like they were rejected from lousy sit-coms. Part of the problem is, while the make-up is well-done, the audience are not fooled, and that makes it tough to accept that everyone in the movie is. If you want to laugh at men in drag for an entire motion picture, go for Some Like it Hot, or at least Mrs. Doubtfire. This merely tries to gross us out and hopes we'll confuse that for humor. The DVD has three featurettes. There is strong language and pretty explicit sexual stuff. At least there is eye candy. I recommend this solely to fans of the brothers. 1/10",White Chicks
11,view_and_review,Wayans Brothers have winning formula,7,15 March 2007,"It's movies like this that make me like the Wayans Brothers. They are inventive, bold, daring, and most of all... they are funny. This movie was incredibly well done, and incredibly funny. The Wayans Brothers aren't afraid to go out on a limb and try something new with comedy, and I think in this instance it paid off. If you look at their track record starting back with one of my favorites, ""I'm Gonna Git you Sucka"", ""Don't be a Menace..."", ""Scary Movie"", ""Scary Movie 2"", and not to mention their star producing regular show, ""In Living Color"", they have proved that they have a successful formula for comedy. ""White Chicks"" hilarious and could only be as funny as it was because of 1.) the chemistry between the two brothers (Marlon & Shawn), and 2.) you had to have black men play white women. It would not have been funny any other way. If it were black men playing black women, or white men playing white women, or even black women playing white women, it just would not have had the same appeal and lure. I say chalk this one up as another Wayans Brothers success.",White Chicks
12,morrison-dylan-fan,"""I'm sexy and I know it.""",8,19 March 2015,"With a poll coming up on IMDbs Classic Film board for the best movies of 2004,I started to take a close look at a pile of DVDs on the shelf,and spotted a Comedy,which despite getting a real kicking in printed reviews,looked like a really fun title,which led to me getting ready to meet 2 very""unique"" chicks.The plot:Failing to arrest a Russian gangster,police officers Kevin and Marcus Copeland are given their last chance to prove that they can complete a case,by being given the role of body guards for socialites the Wilson sisters,who are in town for a major fashion show,who unknown to the Copeland's and the Wilson's,have been threatened with getting kidnapped.Driving them to a hotel,the Copelands end up in a car crash,which leads to the Wilson's being covered in bruises.Fearing that they are about to get the sack,Marcus and Kevin decide to put the Wilson's in a hotel room,and to go undercover in disguise as the Wilson's.Leaving behind their life on the beat,the Copeland's soon discover that surviving in the world of the socialites is tougher than any fight against a street thug.View on the film:Whilst the original target of the screenplay by co-writer/(along with..Shawn Wayans/Marlon Wayans/Andrew McElfresh/Michael Anthony Snowden & Xavier Cook) director Keenen Ivory Wayans (the Hilton family) has led to the title showing clear signs of age,the writers are impressively still able to deliver a scattering attack on socialite society,with everyone being shown to focus more on what the Wilsons are wearing,rather then what they say,or their sudden change of appearance.Along with the satirical bites,the writers also hit the film with a hilarious level of slap- stick,which goes from stunning dance offs to out cat-walking each other.Looking like their disguises have been made by Dr.Frankenstein, Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans each give wonderful performances as the Copelands,thanks to them each bouncing off the others desperate attempts to remain undercover,as two chicks who show that these boots really are made for walking.",White Chicks
13,anaconda-40658,Even White Chicks Will Hate It.,1,13 July 2015,"White Chicks (2004): Dir: Keenan Ivory Wayans / Cast: Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Jaime King, John Heard, Terry Crews: The first problem with this film is that neither Shawn nor Marlon Wayans look convincing as white females. They are black cops undercover out to protect two really dumb blondes from becoming the victims of a kidnapping so they undertake a massive makeup job to resemble the two girls. Sounds funny, but it isn't convincing here. It suggests attitude and race in dealing with women and placing males in their shoes. Some Like It Hot and Tootsie handled this theme much more convincingly. The concept isn't new and its structure is one lewd sexual joke after another that grows thin quickly. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans who made the equally lewd yet funnier Scary Movie but here he transcends none of that talent. Part of the problem is that it seems as if he found the concept of Shawn and Marlon in white drag to be funny on its own. Shawn and Marlon frail when under the makeup. Horrible supporting performances by Jaime King and John Heard. Terry Crews has the embarrassing opportunity to stalk Marlon Wayans for a little touchy feely action. The film is tailored as the umpteenth male in drag comedy that has been done to death, and this rates as about the worst it can get. The two blondes should have been kidnapped off the set. Score: 1 / 10",White Chicks
14,whpratt1,Lots of Laughs,10,20 August 2006,"Really enjoyed viewing this film which starts off with two crazy looking guys in a Bronx, N.Y. stationery store waiting for a shipment of ice-cream, which is believed to be a drug shipment. Shawn Wayans,(Kevin Copeland) and Marlon Wayans,(Marcus Copeland) are the crazy guys and are suppose to be undercover FBI agents. This mission gets all messed up and these two guys get assigned to some very rich white chicks who are going to the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y. Things get messed up again and the guys decided to dress in drag will all the bulges in the right places. There is drama and plenty of laughs and if you want a good entertaining film, this is your best bet.",White Chicks
15,StevePulaski,"An intellectually and thematically vapid film, unfortunately",1,11 November 2015,"I find it difficult to try and align the plot and slapstick humor of Keenen Ivory Wayans' film White Chicks with Laura Mulvey's ideas about gender and the role of women in film largely because I think any social commentary found in this particular film wasn't on the forefront of the minds who made this film. This is a film that is meant to do one thing, and like most Wayans' productions, that is to retaliate against conventions and stereotypes by using said conventions and stereotypes. The Wayans work to make films that exploit the wide-variety of clichés used in modern film, yet their films – such as this, Dance Flick, and the two Haunted House films – all abide by the common tropes of the films they're parodying, so their films feel less like acts of rebellion but more like surrender to filmmaking principles.The film is a brutally unpleasant slog through the ins and outs of buddy-cop clichés and tired racial and sex humor that relies on the idea that African-American males are well-endowed and all white females are privileged and simply stumbled their way into wealth. The film revolves around Kevin and Marcus Copeland (Shawn and Marlon Wayans), two disgraced FBI agents who have just flubbed another serious drug bust. Their deputy (Frankie Faison) gives them one last chance at redeeming themselves by making them protect two young, ditsy billionaires named Brittany and Tiffany Wilson (Maitland Ward and Anne Dudek) from a rumored kidnapping plot.When the Wilson sisters refuse to leave their hotel room after getting minor cuts on their face, both Kevin and Marcus impersonate the two sisters in whiteface, and are plunged into a beauty pageant alongside acquaintances of the sisters. Both Kevin and Marcus can't reveal their true identities to Brittany and Tiffany's competitors, nor can Marcus tell his wife (Faune A. Chambers) exactly what he is doing, so the two lumber around in drag as they try to navigate the ins and outs of this business while trying to save their jobs.White Chicks would be infuriatingly racist, sexist, and stereotypical if it wasn't such a narrow-minded and stupid film, so hellbent on pinpointing every charmless and laughless racial and sexual stereotype out rather than attempting to do anything with it. Where's the commentary on the hyper-sexualization of women in American film? Where do we exactly identify and take note of how, whilst in drag, Kevin and Marcus gawk at other women, but hate being gawked at as women by other men? Where's the commentary on the perception of race, or at least the satirical side of this screenplay? It's like a potential-ridden screenplay was gutted and left for dead because too many uptight suits got their hands on it and robbed it of all creativity, but perhaps that's the creative process of Shawn and Marlon Wayans. How else do you explain how it took six people to write a film predicated off of jokes about stereotypes and bathroom activity? Doing my best to connect White Chicks with Mulvey's ideas of phallocentrism, Mulvey's argument is the idea that women couldn't truly enjoy or connect with Hollywood filmmaking because of the camera lens being (a) objectively male and (b) part of a patriarchal structure. Mulvey views Hollywood films as films that further male ideology and principles by giving males the power in their films (to which Mulvey states the power of the male comes from the penis and the male's possession of a penis).One idea of Mulvey's White Chicks carries throughout its plot is the idea that women exist in films for visual pleasure (what Mulvey calls to-be-looked-at-ness). With that, women are viewed in a scopophiliac sense, which resorts to viewing women as objects rather than individual characters with individualized ideas. Almost every white female character in White Chicks is an object representative of fetishized beauty, with characters lacking any discernible ounce of authenticity. So much of the film occurs in a beauty pageant, or involves women trying to achieve unrealistic states of beauty by way of tight outfits, breast implants, and materialistic possessions, that the objectification of women in the film runs rampant because there is no way to view these female characters other than by way of their measurements and their love for material things.Finally, returning to the idea I alluded to earlier about male gaze – where the camera lens assumes a de facto masculine perspective – White Chicks does abide by that idea as well. Even though most of the characters we meet in the film are females, the two lead characters are males disguised as females, which leads to the idea that even if you can paint the focus in a different light, you cannot escape the idea of male gaze because it's a default in the world of cinema. White Chicks is essentially the male gaze playing dressup, much like its male characters in the film.White Chicks is an unforgivably awful film; the kind where one wouldn't be so stupid as to take a few days off from comedy upon seeing it and witnessing joke-after-joke fall prey to conventionality and trainwreck delivery. The film is as obnoxious as it is unfunny, with characters and stereotypes - particularly the seriously ridiculous and one-note Terry Crews character - mistaken for any kind of significance in narrative or thematic urgency. I guess having Shawn, Marlon, and director/co-writer/co-producer Keenen Ivory Wayans giving some kind of worth to this material would've been too much to ask. We could've seen how racial and sexual prejudice and tendencies are communicated in many varying shades of gray, in a film called ""White Chicks"" nonetheless.",White Chicks
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,Obviously you can't take the movie seriously,7,8 November 2004,"I think that's why it got such low stars on IMDb. Why is everyone so harsh on the film? I actually laughed at most of the movie. Yes, some of it is a little over the top silly. Sometimes you need that though. I don't know. Maybe I was in one of those good moods. And I could've just liked any movie. But I did think that this was very funny. There are some typical moments in a man dressed as a woman comedy. Shawn and Marlyn do make some ugly women. But that is what made this movie so funny. I would recommend it for a silly laugh. Remember, just don't take it seriously. Come on IMDb users, HAVE A LITTLE FUN!

17,MovieAddict2016,Almost painful to sit through.,3,11 October 2005,"White Chicks, the newest intellectually insulting ""gut buster"" from the Wayans Brothers (Shawn and Marlon), is about as funny as a route canal and as entertaining as when Steven Seagal takes a minute or two out of his films to go on boring rants stressing the importance of global peace and political equality.The Wayans were previously responsible for Scary Movie, which was funny not because it was brilliant but rather because it was risqué at the risk of being grotesque, and funny at the risk of being offensive. The sequel was simply grotesque and offensive.White Chicks is worse than Scary Movie 2, because at least that film had the un-PC antics (like Chris Elliot's deformed hand) that were moderately shocking. The PG-13 White Chicks is simply infantile and ridiculous - bringing to mind other films such as The Hot Chick that are similarly rooted in an unbelievable storyline, dulled by banal and unrealistic characters.Take, for example, the role fulfilled by the hapless John Heard. His acting defines the expression, ""Phoning in the performance."" He looks out of exhausted, lost and bewildered. His character is given little to no background introduction - he suddenly appears and disappears just as quickly.Or how about the ""protagonists""? Do we really know who they are? Apart from a pathetic throwaway exploitation of their home life (clichés include: Being a cop who is always late for everything; the wife who is worried about her husband and is upset he never calls her or makes it home on time; the bachelor who's looking for love), the movie pretty much just skips forward right into the plot.I know not all comedies need extensive character backdrops, but even other slapstick buddy films like Dumb and Dumber took the time to introduce their characters and make them distinct. I walked away from White Chicks not really knowing the differences between the two main characters.",White Chicks
18,OllieSuave-007,"Not that bad, pretty funny.",7,13 December 2013,"This movie is actually not that bad, a story starring Shawn and Marlon Wayans as two disgraced FBI agents assigned to go undercover, disguised as blonds, to protect a the Wilson Sisters, hotel heiresses, from a kidnapping plot.This movie is full of crude humor and jokes, but they are not overly done, which makes this a tolerable movie to enjoy. This movie also pokes fun at people of different culture and background, harmless enough to appreciate the humor than rather to be offended about it. I especially liked Terry Crews' character, portraying a non-stereotypical black man who likes teenage-pop music.This movie is probably not meant to be taken seriously, as the plot is and overall story are average at best, but it's really not bad of a fan to enjoy a good laugh from.Grade B-",White Chicks
19,Buddy-51,Some Like it Bad,2,8 October 2005,"Sporting two of the worst make-up jobs in motion picture history, Shawn and Marlon Wayans play incompetent undercover FBI agents who dress up as a couple of blond bimbo socialites to nab a kidnapper. Borrowing virtually all of its plot points - and none of its style - from that gender-bending template, ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""White Chicks"" hits a new low in cross dressing comedies. Not only are the makeup jobs repulsive and thoroughly unconvincing, but the humor rarely rises above the waistline. About half the jokes center around flatulence and the other half around bodily functions in general. Unlike most actors stuck in a turkey of this caliber, the Wayans have no one to blame but themselves (and their older and presumably more experienced brother, Keenan Ivory, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with them).This is about as completely unfunny as any comedy could ever hope to be, but what I really want to know is how a movie that uses transvestism as its theme can still manage to trash gays every chance it gets.",White Chicks
20,cherold,Starts decently but is done in by sloppiness,6,8 June 2005,"I generally like the Wayan Brothers' low-brow gag fests, and for a while White Chicks works pretty well as a hit or miss series of gags. I'd say for the first maybe 40 minutes White Chicks is a fun take-off on Paris Hilton-like rich white girls, with some very funny scenes.But while the Scary Movie movies played their clichéd formula for laughs, White Chicks takes its cop buddy movie framework too seriously. Instead of ridiculing the clichés of these movies, it embraces them, including touching scenes of girl empowerment and buddy bonding. It is as though the Wayans are simply too lazy to deconstruct their material, and they really should have brought in a decent script doctor to bring some originality to the story, since the five or six writers credited were apparently unable to do so.The movie does a good job of turning two black guys into two white chicks (although it makes no real attempt to make this seem in any way sensible) and have some laugh out loud moments, but a movie this trite and unoriginal needs to be a laugh riot from beginning to end to work, and the successful gags keep coming farther and farther apart. Still, if your a fan of the Wayans it might be worth watching for the earlier scenes (excluding the opening scene, which is shockingly dreadful).",White Chicks

22,Robert_duder,Typical teen gross out comedy comes out better than average,6,24 October 2004,"At some point in the last ten years comedy took a severe turn for the worst.Farts, burps, crude sexual humour became an absolute necessity in comedies, whether it be a family comedy or raunchy teen adult comedies they all seem to must have one or several of those things to be humorous. One the father's on this turn in comedy would be the Wayan's brothers with their Scary movie series which will never seem to end and this film...White Chicks.White Chicks is a movie about two less than great cops played by Shawn and Marlon Wayans. They are apparently pros at going undercover in disguises and acting so stupid that no criminal could ever fall for their guise but they do. After their first attempt at undercover goes bust so to speak, they are brought on to protect a pair of young heiresses ala The Hilton Sisters or as they are known ""The Wilson Sisters."" Rather than trying to protect them, the partners leave them in a hotel room and become them head to toe with the best of technology. I must say the outfits are quite impressive although improbable, you can't get much closer to being someone else. Obviously hilarity ensues as two black tough macho men have to become snivelling, stuck up, rich little white girls. That is the redeeming quality to his film is that Marlon and Shawn do a great job acting like the girls. They make it almost believable and hilarious for the audience who knows their true identities. The story moves along at a great pace without getting too stale although very predictable. The comedy at times can be very touchy when it comes to race for those of you who are over sensitive about that sort of thing, and a lot of crude sexual jokes aimed at women that kind of makes it seem like women are being pointed as dumb, slutty, and basically useless. The highlight of the movie is the dance competition between the Vandergelds and the Wilson sisters (Wayans Brothers.) Overall if you are not easily offended by being made fun of then it's worth checking out for a night of non-thought provoking film watching. It's fun despite it's stupidity. That can be funny. 6/10",White Chicks

It's about two screw-up FBI agents who dress up as two white socialites for a weekend because the real girls get a scratch on their face (due to another screw-up) and don't want to be seen in public. So many of the jokes are fish-out-of water type. From pop music to skin tight pants. And there is this NBA player who continually hits on one of them. Those scenes were pretty funny, especially when he finds out she's a guy. All he can say is ""you aren't white.""

Roeper said it was his pick for worst movie of the year and Ebert wrote a funny review of it. The stupid plot is that the Wayans brothers play these secret agents who dress up as these two annoying women to protect them from being kidnapped. Maybe the worst part is the fact that the makeup effects are so hideous. It was just unsettling watching these ugly crossdressers on screen so much. ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" showed that crossdressing with latex masks can be funny.Another thing I hate is how annoying everyone is. There are these three women characters who constantly complain about how fat they are. They do nothing but try on clothes and are bad stereotypes of what men think women are. Oh, and we also get fart jokes. The real women themselves are idiotic and annoying. They're so vain and once again horrible stereotypes. There's this one really distasteful scene where the real women are mistaken for the agents. While not shown on screen obviously, they get their private parts exposed. This is just distasteful and I feel sorry for the people involved in this. They notice that the imposters are taller, yet when they appear within a few minutes of each other, they don't notice that they suddenly grow and shrink. No one would pay $50,000 for a date with a woman as hideous as this. Everything about this film is stupid, annoying, and offensive. *",White Chicks

We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.Nobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much cliché, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.So the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew.

Their superior Section Chief assigned them a last mission as a final test in order to prove what they are capable of and prove that they worth their possessions in the agency. Their mission is very simple, to go undercover and keep the Wilson sisters safe from a kidnapping plot.I liked this movie because it had a simple but funny plot with many hilarious scenes and also some funny stereotypes. The direction which was made by Keenen Ivory Wayans it was very good and there was an evolution in the main characters of the movie, something that I really enjoyed. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that Shawn Wayans who played as Kevin Copeland and Marlon Wayans who played as Marcus Copeland were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Terry Crews who played as Latrell Spencer and he was also very funny.Finally, I have to say that ""White Chicks"" is an above average movie with a simple but interesting and funny plot. I recommend everyone to watch it because I believe that you are going to have a lot of fun and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much.

Two black undercover agents must disguise themselves as two white rich sisters. Sure, there's a crime story involving a drug bust and kidnapping, but me and you both know that we don't care for that. Don't even pretend that you wanted an engrossing story, the premise itself is obscenely stupid on all levels. No no, what you wanted was onscreen idiocy and uncomfortableness from the Wayans brothers as they dress up terribly, shoddily act and look scarily bizarre, as white chicks. It's stupid beyond all measures. So weird that we need to invent an entirely new scale in an attempt to calculate the immeasurable surrealism of White Chicks. White. Chicks. Chicks White. Chicks are white, right? White Chickens! I don't laugh at comedies, you all know that, but this film has me in fits of laughter every time. Possibly the most quotable comedic screenplay of all time, I mean that.

Terry Crews is life, White Chicks is life, but Terry Crews in White Chicks? Double life powerrrr! He's flipping hilarious! I can't even. Jennifer Carpenter was surprisingly great as well.

One of the best things about the film is that they didn't use the same jokes that every other comedy movie based on someone dressing up as someone else and pretending to be them. Also the work that went into making Shawn and Marlon Wayans look so convincing as white chicks must have been massive because they looked brilliant. Frankie Faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes. Terry Crews was excellent as Latrell Spencer and was a good touch to the movie. Of course the stand outs were the Wayan brothers which any one could tell even just from the trailer of the movie. This performance almost stood up to their roles in Scary Movie 1 and 2 which is really really saying something. Lets hope they keep writing movies (with Keenan Ivory Wayans who deserves as much credit, if not more, for the writing) and starring in them as well because God knows they can act and act brilliantly.

The storyline follows two FBI detectives who can't seem to get anything right which leads to them not be awarded the office's big case. They decide their one chance to show the department they aren't the F-ups they appear to be is to solve the case on their own by any means necessary.

The storyline for this picture is atrocious but fun to watch unfold. The comedic content is very uneven, from some laugh out loud hilarious sequences to some poor, awkward, clumsy messes that are painful to watch. Terry Crews steals the show and is consistently hilarious throughout. The cultural jokes were also hilarious and it was definitely fun to see Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) in one of her earlier roles. I will say there are some surprisingly good messengers in this towards the second half of the film and the conclusion is pretty solid. Overall this is far from one of the better Wayans movies but is still a slightly better than average addition to the genre.

Within this category, it stands out by being peculiar to the point of madness.In the movie, two young black males get transformed into two young white females, for reasons best left unexamined. The effects, prosthetics, make-up etc. are impressive. However, ""impressive"" does not mean ""perfect"", and here the two protagonists end up looking not like two normal white women but like.. Like... Well, what exactly ? Two dead-eyed androids ? Two patients afflicted by a variety of cruel diseases ? Two members of a hominid species surviving in the most remote caves of Tibet ?The result, in other words, is disquieting rather than convincing. Yet within the movie's narrative framework all other characters (except those in on the secret) accept the two protagonists as white and female. More, all other characters accept them as pretty young things of the spoiled and fashionable variety ; indeed, some men are so charmed they fall in love / lust with them.Now let me see you suspend that disbelief ! One, two, lift, one, two, LIFT - suspend, suspend !I'm still awarding the movie two stars because I think that its main target is fully worth mocking : ""White chicks"" does a well-deserved hatchet job on the kind of trust fund superb*tch who is not only lazy, shallow and mean but prides herself on these qualities.

That doesn't mean that the movie is THAT good, however, as it suffers from all the terrible clichés that you might expect of a cross-dressing comedy.Namely, the obligatory ""men dress as women then learn to appreciate the other sex"" plot. Also the ""man in drag surprises male aggressor with a few punches"" routine. It's a tired formula that is repeated every time a movie churns out with this theme.That said, the movie is mildly amusing in a cringe-inducing way. Both Wayans brothers give good, solid comedic performances but the film fails to deliver on its promise. There are laugh out loud moments, to be sure, but mostly it keeps you smiling, albeit with a rictus grin at times.There was, though, something inherently freaky and weird about the duo in drag. Forget the make-up and prosthetics, something about their eyes just looks weird and wrong.

No. They poke fun calling it ludicrous or things along the same lines of that.Average movie goers will most likely like this film (well, some will hate them too).

43,Howlin Wolf,"Starts with an idea, but then has nowhere to go except into downright embarrassment...",1,16 December 2005,"... The idea being, of course, for the Wayans brothers to somehow need to disguise themselves as the title suggests. Since, in the real world, this would be a situation that no sensible person would possibly get themselves into; the reasons for such action to be taken are of course highly implausible. That's not what I'm here to complain about though. I knew the idea going in; but I had hoped that they could still make the best use of it with the aid of charming performances and comical situations. I'm still hoping - no incentive exists for any sane person to watch this, at all.There have been accusations of racism thrown around since this film was released. I don't want to get into that; what I will say, however, is that altering one's skin colour for laughs isn't funny these days because it's not sophisticated. It has nothing to do with whether or not it might be offensive; but timing and techniques have moved on in such a way that you have to work harder to get a laugh, now. If you went down to a comedy club, and there was an act there that used either boot polish or chalk to discolour themselves, you'd likely expect more thought to have gone into the routine than such a simplistic process on its own. You'd be looking for some meaning, or else quick-fire gags in addition to it. If there's any rationale behind this plot at all, it's to spoof the 'airhead princess' social type. This species is so annoying, however; that I'd much rather get rid of them altogether than even make fun of them!Like the characters, the humour is shrill and grating; making it all but impossible to identify in any way with the performers, or to even chuckle slightly at the misadventures that are concocted. I'll be honest; I enjoyed the original ""Scary Movie"", but I'm still wholly unconvinced about the ability of the brothers to garner genuine laughs from an idea of solid construction, as opposed to relying on skits. I'm not saying it to incite fans of this movie, or to exaggerate my point - but I can honestly say that this has been one of the only instances in all my time of watching movies where the experience has actually pained me, inside.",White Chicks

46,Beta_Gallinger,"Toilet humour and political incorrectness aren't always bad in comedy, but that doesn't mean this movie isn't",4,14 October 2007,"""White Chicks"", a film done by the Wayans brothers, is an example of the kind of the crude, immature comedies that are common nowadays, but it's not a very good example. I saw a good chunk of this film a couple years ago, and I guess I thought it was so-so. I finally watched the whole thing very recently, and unsurprisingly, it didn't quite do it for me. Some are irked by stupid comedies like this in general, but I think they can be really funny. However, while I can't say I managed to keep a straight face the entire time (I smiled a bit), I did manage to do so for the most part, and it was often too stupid even for me!Kevin and Marcus Copeland are two FBI agents who are on a mission to catch drug dealers. Unfortunately, they do not succeed in this mission, as they end up attacking an innocent ice cream deliverer, instead. After this, the two agents are in disgrace, and are very close to being fired, but soon, they have another assignment. This time, they are to protect Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, two spoiled heiresses, from a kidnapping threat. While driving these two heiresses, they end up in an accident, leaving Brittany and Tiffany with marks on their faces, making them feel that they don't look presentable. The Wilson sisters will not show up at the society weekend with these marks on their faces, so Kevin and Marcus decide to go instead, disguised as the two spoiled heiresses! Will this mission save their careers as FBI agents, or will it ruin them?!This Wayans brothers comedy is filled with toilet humour, a type of humour that some can't stand, but also a popular type. I'm sure you can tell by some of my previous reviews that I don't have a problem with toilet humour in general. However, in some cases, I find that it can be too much, and ""White Chicks"" is an example of that. As you can probably tell by the title, the movie is also very politically incorrect, with some racist and sexist jokes, but the Wayans brothers aren't the only ones currently in the comedy business to do this, and many aren't bothered by these types of jokes, as long as they don't take them seriously. I think I've made it clear that the main problem I have with this movie is that it's simply not very funny. Parts that made me smile include Marcus falling asleep while his wife is talking to him, and Kevin and Marcus responding angrily in their normal voices to guys flirting with them, after they had just put their disguises on for the first time and were not yet used to it. However, there are also several scenes that I thought were embarrassing (or close to it), such as one of the undercover agents in the ladies room, having a very loud bowel movement, while friends of the Wilson sisters are also in the washroom, and the face-stuffing and farting in the restaurant. I understand that the Wayans brothers were behind ""Scary Movie"", a spoof movie which I think is quite bad. I personally didn't find ""White Chicks"" as bad as that, but fairly close, I think. After watching it, I do not intend to ever watch ""Little Man"", another film from the Wayans', which is apparently worse, just like I wouldn't have ever watched the dreadful ""Epic Movie"" (a spoof done by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, two others who were behind ""Scary Movie"") if I saw ""Scary Movie"" first, and after seeing both of those films, I won't be watching any of the SM sequels or ""Date Movie"". ""White Chicks"" is, in part, satire of Paris Hilton, or both of the Hilton sisters. I like this concept, but sadly, the potential that the film may have had wasn't reached.",White Chicks
47,vip_ebriega,No thanks!,2,6 June 2007,"My Take: As bad and offensive as many of today's excuse for comedy. Comedies have always grabbed audiences all over. Nowadays, comedies are amongst the well-sold genres of our time. But, of course, hits on the box-office, doesn't always mean hits to all. I watched this film along with my classmates during a free-time. They all seemed to know it, and like it. I for one, thinks it's bad news, but I manage to give it a chance, by watching it. I didn't finish it, and yet, I don't manage to. The film is brought to us by the Wayans Brothers (behind the hit ""Scary Movie"" films), who seemed to be unafraid that the movie references (or probably insults) themselves. I'm sure it's funny for them to see their comedy a success, but to anyone who would like to see any sense, may just be walking out the theaters almost as fast as a swarm of locusts passing to a full-wheat field.But offensive comedies are not all bad, that is, if in good taste. Take ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" as an example. I gave it 4 stars, for it's planned to be a comedy, and keeps its title well by making us laugh. ""White Chicks"" on the other hand is not all that funny. I mean what is funny about two black guys dressing up as two 'ala Paris Hilton heiresses? Part of the plot? What plot? So overall, I spent watching this movie for what? Nothing but a chill and a cold while staying inside that classroom with our air-conditions turned on to high.No thanks! I'll stick to ""Austin Powers"".Rating: * out of 5.",White Chicks
48,jon.h.ochiai,Funny Object of Satire,8,27 June 2004,"The Wayans Brother's ""White Chicks"" is surprising, not for it being completely funny, but for the fact that it is not at all mean spirited. In fact, it has compassion for the object of its satire. I've read some reviews that are stands for politically correctness to the point of nausea. ""White Chicks"" is a comedy, nothing more, and it makes you laugh, regardless. With the exception of a couple flat spots, ""White Chicks"" is totally funny. It is not perhaps as clever a satire as ""Undercover Brother"", but its target is different. In one sense ""White Chicks"" is not doing anything that has been done before in ""Tootsie"", where the main characters become better men for having to pass themselves off as women. This thematic revisit by Director Keenan Ivory Wayans is worth the trip. Fortunately, in spite of the numerous screenwriters (in addition to stars Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and Keenan Ivory Wayans there are three other collaborators), ""White Chicks"" is more hit than miss. In fact, the funniest scenes are not in the movie trailer, because they could not. Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI Agents, Kevin Copeland and Marcus Copeland. Their careers are in jeopardy, and they have a shot at redemption by protecting the billionaire Wilson sisters, Brittany (Maitland Ward) and Tiffany (Anne Dudek) from a kidnapping threat. The Sisters are a parody of Paris and Nicky Hilton. The Wilson sisters are headed to the Hamptons to compete for the fashion cover of the Hampton Magazine. However, following a poodle induced SUV accident, the Wilson Sisters are left traumatized with superfluous scratches that can't possibly be covered by make-up. Sensing the end of their FBI careers, Kevin and Marcus call upon make-up experts at the Bureau to transform them into Bittany and Tiffany. Now this is a weird experience, because the actual make-up is just close enough to human that it is creepy. However, as Shawn and Marlon begin to inhabit the characters, that experience disappears. At least for me, it worked. They were Britt and Tiff. The visual effect is outrageous. Both Shawn and Marlon Wayans are good-looking, athletic guys who stand about 6'2"". So seeing them in heels as ""White Chicks"" with big hands and broad shoulders is hilarious. So they travel to the Hamptons and encounter their evil rivals, Heather and Megan Vandergeld (Jaime King, and the very hot Brittany Daniel). Kevin and Marcus also reunite with the Wilson Sisters' crew: Lisa (Jennifer Carpenter), Karen (Busy Phillips), and Tori (Jessica Tori). Marcus becomes the object of lust by pro basketball player, Latrell Spencer (very funny Terry Crews). This is where ""White Chicks"" really soars. Lisa, Karen, and Tori could have really been vapid caricatures. Well, they do have vapid existences, but Keenan Ivory Wayans makes you care about their hopes and dreams which are not even close to our own. Now that is an amazing accomplishment. There is a very funny dressing room scene involving the gorgeous Lisa with Kevin (Shawn Wayans), which illustrates that being ""fat"" is in the story of the woman wearing the couture. The need to look beautiful is all consuming. There is a great scene where Marcus (Marlon Wayans) braids Karen corn rows at their slumber party. In the unexpectedly touching scene Marcus coaches Karen to respect herself and not make herself a ""booty call"". The girls bonding with the impostor and amazingly cool Wilson sisters is a nice touch. This compassion well suits the story, because the whole kidnapping plot is the least interesting aspect of the movie. This should not be any surprise. Instead of complex plotting there is the wackiness of the ""old school"" dance showdown with the Vandergeld Sisters or the ""Wilson Sisters"" laying the smack down on unsuspecting dudes. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are a good comedic team, along with brother, Keenan Ivory, they get the importance of light hearted fun which allows them to venture beyond any taste boundaries. Shawn is more the leading man, and straight man. He is very charming and funny. Marlon is out right funny. He also has an innocence and warmth. ""White Chicks"" does not provide any amazing epiphany about cultural or sexual diversity. However, it will make you laugh, and laugh a lot. That too, is a noble intention.",White Chicks

The only way to secure their jobs is pose as two rich and white girls (Maitland Ward, Anne Dudek) and solve a huge crime in the mean time.So the guys have a couple of cracks about the rich white society.

In it, they play two bumbling FBI agents who have to accompany a pair of young society girls to a big bash in the Hamptons. Soon, the two black men find themselves posing as white women, namely the Wilson sisters. This movie does have a few laughs, but most of the time, it just seems like everyone is trying to go out of their way to be outrageous. The best performance comes from the scene-stealing Terry Crews as Latrell Spencer, a hulking basketball player with the hots for white women.

The reasons for the impersonation scam are pretty silly... but its just a setup for some amusing mistaken identity gags and some really funny jokes.. I actually laughed quite a bit in this film and I went into it not expecting very much at all. Busy Phillips, who some might remember as Katey Holmes roommate on the last couple seasons of ""Dawson's Creek"" plays one of the friends they make in the Hamptons and she is really quite good in this, displaying more range than she did on the TV show.

56,CinematicInceptions,Bad Boys meets Miss Congeniality with a handful of Mrs. Doubtfire.,5,19 June 2016,"This got many more eyebrow raises than laughs from me because of some of the style of comedy. It's all very ridiculous, which isn't uncommon to comedies. Pretty much the entire movie is a series of extended situational comedy, all pertaining to the irony of black cops posing as white models. It wasn't the most plausible plot basis; in real life, the guys would never have even gotten into the hotel without being discovered. But in some ways, the plot basis makes it a kind of universal comedy. It can make white jokes and black jokes, and can be sort of a chick flick that appeals both genders. It probably leans more toward a male audience than female, but I think it's sort of intended for both. There's a light theme about how little men really understand women, and vice versa.There is barely even an attempt at a story, but I don't think this will bother most people. Honestly, keeping the plot vague was probably the best thing to do because nobody who enjoyed the sort of comedy featured was probably looking for a story to being with. If somebody had this idea maybe three years later, it would have turned into a series of YouTube videos instead of a movie, because it's just a bunch of comedic scenes strung loosely together. Now, most of the time, movies are intended to tell stories, but in the case of comedies where their purpose is just to entertain, less story can be more. Billy Madison would have been better if they didn't add in plot devices to keep it moving. It didn't need it. And as pathetic as the story for White Chicks is, it would have been worse if it were cohesive.As it was, I wasn't a huge fan of the comedy. This is for me what I think Nacho Libre and Napoleon Dynamite are for most people. The only scene I really enjoyed was Latrell singing A Thousand Miles. Everything else just evoked a bunch of eyebrow raises. However, if you are okay with LCD comedy that doesn't mind being over the top, this is worth trying. As you can probably infer from the title, there are a decent amount of sexual and slightly racist jokes. Fortunately, I don't think any of them will offend anyone too much. I read another review that said it was discriminatory in the ditsy portrayal of white women. This is someone valid, but it's worth noting that the white women characters are all models and are paid to be ditsy and frivolous to an extent. It's not saying that all white women are like that, but it's understandable that the audience might react that way.If you do decide to watch it, don't expect most of the movie to make sense, because that will lessen your enjoyment of it. I definitely recommend watching it with other people. I would never have wanted to finish it on my own, but my brother and sister both really enjoy it, and that made it more fun to watch. If you just want to give it a try, watch the first 20 to 25 minutes before you decide whether to see the rest. Overall Rating: 6.3/10",White Chicks
57,ofumalow,"Not bad, but really worth it for Terry Crews",6,1 August 2018,"This is better than I expected--it looked awful, and turns out to be relatively funny, although the humor varies between absurd/inspired (like the club dance-off) and just-kinda-dumb-and-broad (the slapstick fashion show finale). But the saving grace is Terry Crews, who is pretty far down the cast list but steals the film as a star athlete who has a taste for white meat and doesn't shrink from focusing that attention on our ""heroines""--no matter that they're actually black men in white female drag. He's so good I don't know why no one has built an entire comedy movie around him--I've seen him in lots of supporting roles but no leads. (I haven't seen his TV work, though of course he's done a lot.) It's taken me a long time to see this movie, but the takeaway is that I should have spent that whole time following Terry Crews' career more closely. He's a riot.",White Chicks

59,EthanBJones_03,How do I begin the describe this film?,6,25 June 2017,"'WHITE CHICKS' was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, and stars Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Terry Crews. ​After they get dragged into 'babysitting duty', two FBI agents(Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans) disguise themselves as white girls and try to foil a kidnapping before it happens.White Chicks is the type of film you throw on at a party, while on the verge of passing out, and just leave it on in the background. Not that that is a knock against the film, however. It's a very enjoyable movie that will get some laughs when your sober but will be much better when you're off your head. It's funny but it SHOULDN'T be. It SHOULDN'T work but it kinda does. That is the best way to describe this film.The story is stupid and really poorly written. It was merely a thin thread to link together a series of stupid events. The ending was overly happy and the last shot of this movie before the credits will haunt you for the remainder of your lives.Marlon and Shawn Wayans did good jobs as Marcus and Kevin but shone as the two sisters, Brittany and Tiffany Wilson. When they become the sisters is definitely were the film picks up and is where both actors could do their best. Terry Crews was my favourite part of the movie and played his part excruciatingly well. He WAS Latrell and that is kinda worrying considering the character.No one gives one about how this movie is shot and edited but if you're in the 1% that do, it's not well done. It's messily shot and edited together and just looks odd. It doesn't feel fluid and is just plain messy.On all accounts, this movie should not be funny. It shouldn't. But the committed cast and peculiar director make it work to a certain degree. I do recommend you watch this while intoxicated because you'll probably enjoy it a lot more but you can watch it sober(like I did) and get some entertainment out of it. I'll rate this movie 6 'Chocolate Men' out of 10.",White Chicks
60,christian123,Funny but Crude Comedy,5,14 January 2005,"White Chicks is a funny but crude comedy and goes over the top a lot. Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI agents assigned to investigate the kidnapping of rich debutantes in the Hamptons. In order to fit into this foreign territory, they go undercover as young white coeds, getting involved with a group of high society debutantes that may be able to help them solve the crimes. The premise has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever but the movie doesn't take itself seriously and you can just sit back and enjoy. First problem is that after the transformation they look nothing like The Wilson sisters, but we have to accept that they do, since everyone else does. There are some really funny moments in the film but also just as many groans from the audience. Of course not all of it is funny some is way to racist to be funny and some is toilet humor which is the worst attempt at trying to get laughs. The cast is familiar with comedy and the leads Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans do their best and they are funny most of the time. Marlon Wayans is also the worst actor in the movie especially during the serious scenes. Jessica Calffiel is hilarious as Tori and I hope she finds work in Hollywood since she's really talented and pretty. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns and may spark a laugh here or there but they aren't worth mentioning .Keenen Ivory Wayans wrote and directed White Chicks however Scary Movie 1 and 2 are a lot better. A lot of people complain that this movie is too racist but you shouldn't take everything serious especially a dumb comedy. Rating 6/10 funny movie yet it goes overboard with its 110 running time. This film is worth watching if you liked Scary Movie and other films of that caliber.",White Chicks

The last time we went to the movies I had to turn down requests to see Hitch, Hating Alison Ashley and some Bollywood movie. So it was Tara's turn. On a side note, how bad is it when you have friends over and you all go to the video shop to pick a movie? How impossible is that? Here's a few tips for getting your way.-If there's a movie someone asks you if you want to get, whether you've seen the movie or not, just say I've seen it. If they push, say I saw it yesterday and it's not very good.-On suggestion of a romantic comedy, say I've heard it's OK, it's just i heard there's some really full on sex scenes it. This makes the person uncomfortable and they'll put it back -If the movie being offered looks ordinary, just say i've read some really bad reviews about this one or say a respected mutual friend said it was pathetic.Anyway, Tara ended up choosing White Chicks. As she'd seen it before and I hadn't, I couldn't come up with any good arguments.The movie actually wasn't that bad. If you don't know the story, it's about two young black cops who go undercover dressed up as white girls at a weekend party to catch their would-be kidnappers. You are probably already thinking of the crazy fish-out-of-water experiences they'll have.There were a few rough moments, but overall it was pretty good. The star of the movie was Latrell, a guy who becomes obsessed with one of the white chicks. Nearly every time he was on screen after the halfway mark of the movie I cracked up. If you hire the DVD, make sure you watch the behind the scenes stuff.

One of my favorite scenes is in the dressing room, and another is at a restaurant. I will leave it at that for those who have not seen it. This film left me smiling long after it was over, because it started off strong and carried out the whole way through. That's all it really needed to do.

The Wayan's' brothers uncanny similarity in appearance to Liv Ullman when in white face not withstanding, it was the deep, complexity of the piece that reminded me of the earlier work, not its chilling psychodrama core.
If you recall, in Bergman's piece , a shrink and his wife's relationship was stressed when Ullman descended into mental illness, while in ""Whit Chicks"" it seems more that the Wayan's actually look to be ""mentally ill"". When they put on white face the result is stunning, or perhaps shocking is a more appropriate term. The fact that they almost become Ullman in the process,( if you recall if Liv were any whiter she would be clear), is not lost on audiences of a certain age and breeding. Having experienced , and survived the 70s , we immediately identify a deep character study using anglo Saxon mores as a backdrop, while the pseudo rape cultural collegiate milieu serves brilliantly as a hysterical scaffolding, a psychobabble matrix if you will fitting perfectly in today's ""you too"" scene.
It all coalesces to create a piece no less than stunning, and it will be deemed a classic in due time many agree. Ingmar Bergman, Robert Altman, John Waters step aside, the Wayan's have arrived and created vitally their own new social commentary niche film, the reverse-reverse racist diatribe rant, which double negative makes it actually not racist , at all....",White Chicks
81,iamtherobotman,Double standards.,2,15 June 2021,"When you consider the 1980's film 'Soul Man' has now been banned because of 'Black face' even though the film was essentially a spiritual journey for the Protagonist, where he learned the errors of his ways and 'Little Britain' has been removed from Netflix because of a Black character being portrayed by a White comic. Yet this film is seen as ok. Indeed it is still on Netflix.Now, i don't know of anyone who is offended by this film, but surely it's the principle of the thing. If Black Face is seen as wrong, then surely White Face also has to be seen as wrong.Cancel culture and this woke world in which we live is having an adverse effect on everything. We can no longer laugh at ourselves without someone on the Left getting offended by something or someone. This film still being widely available is all the proof you need that 'cancel culture' only applies one way.",White Chicks

The only Wayan's I do like - is Damon Wayan - because I know his wife and their kids - great family. Anywho, this movie turned out to be rather a little fun and the only part that didn't make sense was at the end at the white party - when everything was coming to a end and the two brothers had to take off their ""masks"" - now - they both had blue eye contacts on - but when they took off their mask - the contacts also came off.

.no they dont look like the wilson sisters exactly but this is noted in the film by other characters who notice they the line "" your lips look like they went from Cameron Diaz to Jayz"" is hilarious. Yes theres lots of toilet humour which first few times round was my favourite. People moaning about racist tones to the film need to list get over yourselves your what's wrong with the world. This is why I love most of the wayan comedies they make fun at all races and other probably dark topics too, sometimes their sex stuff like in scary movie films is ott.but still great films the White chicks is the best their characters are caring funny and loyal.

89,MovieLuvaMatt,Why the low rating?,7,3 July 2004,"There have been much, much worse comedies out there!  I tend to be very picky when it comes to comedies, but this one (against my initial expectations) worked for me.  However, any viewer of this movie must keep in mind that political correctness is the enemy of comedy.  How else do you explain the massive success of ""All in the Family""?  Why are some movies and TV shows praised for being politically incorrect while others are bashed? When the humor is mean-spirited, I understand, but ""White Chicks"" is not one of those cases.  In the days of minstrelsy, whites had a grudge against the black people, and that's what distinguishes minstrels in blackface from the Wayans in whiteface.  Besides, the Wayans are equal opportunity employers when it comes to irreverence.  They crack on Latinos, Asians and even people of their own race.  Have you ever watched that little show called...hmm...""In Living Color""?  The show (featuring a big chunk of the Wayans family) thrived on racial humor, but it proved to be a big success. It also brought in big laughs.  The Wayans (even in the case of the eldest brother, Keenan) aren't exactly masters at humor, and this movie is no ""Annie Hall.""  'Til this day they depend on crude sexual references, bodily functions or both to get laughs.  But you know what?  It often works. 
The film opens with a hilarious gag involving an undercover operation at an inner city bodega.  Shawn and Marlon pose as the Hispanic owners of that bodega.  I repeat, political correctness is the enemy of comedy.  The gag contains every Hispanic stereotype you can think of, but I was cracking up. 
As several other people have pointed out, it's hard to find it credible that anyone would believe that Shawn and Marlon are really white girls.  That is true, but the low credibility factor didn't ruin the film in my opinion. It's meant to be a silly, slapstick farce and not everything in a farce is meant to be realistic.  As I said, we're not watching ""Annie Hall.""  Some films are meant to be realistic and others are meant to stretch the boundaries of reality.  And the movie definitely stretches those boundaries, but it doesn't abandon them.Terry Crews, who I previously saw in ""Friday After Next"" (in a much more thankless role), steals the show as a rich black man who lusts after white women, and ends up lusting after one of the Wilson sisters (who is really Marlon in drag).  Seeing him, a huge muscular black man, singing ""A Thousand Miles"" is worth the full price of admission.  I honestly didn't see that joke coming, and the gag serves as proof that the Wayans aren't talentless hacks.  I mean, he not only ends up singing it, but he sings the whole song! That's the kind of payoff you would only get in a Farrelly Brothers movie! So kudos to the Wayans and the hilarious Terry Crews for that scene. 
Undoubtedly, there is a share of gags that elicit simple groans instead of laughs, but the hits outnumber the misses and that's what counts.  Many of the gags are predictable, but funny nonetheless.  As long as you don't enter the theater with a PC mindframe and expecting biting social commentary, you should enjoy this film.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",White Chicks
90,dgordon-1,The Wayans Do It Again!,9,5 July 2004,"This is a perfect drive-in movie!  I saw it over the weekend, and it is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  I mean, laugh out loud humour.  I've always been a fan of the Wayan brothers, from Keenan in ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"", to Marlon & Shawn's TV show titled the ""Wayan Brothers"" on WB in the '90s.  This movie has a nice flow to it, and you can see some elements of other movies in it.  The battle scene at the club between the rival Hampton girls was like what you would have seen in a movie like ""Breakin 2:Electric Boogaloo"" in the '80s.  One actor who really shines in this movie is Terry Crews.  He plays a football star who only has a taste for white women.  He has some comedic skills that really make this movie come alive!  ""White Chicks"" is by no means a movie to be taken seriously. It's a funny movie that will make you forget your problems for an hour and a half.",White Chicks

I didn't expect too much from this movie and i wasn't judgemental about it. The previous movies had been horror so I wanted to watch something which is not so heavy to watch.This movie gives good laughs from time to time and it has a few scenes where you just can't help laughing. They must have had great time in the set and i could see the good spirit and chemistry between the actors.This movie makes fun of rich people who have everything and it even makes fun of itself. If I had to say something negative about the movie then i'd have to say that its story goes flat towards the end. Somehow the whole movie is predictable, but then again, that's alright because it's just meant to be a crazy comedy.If you want something funny then this is for you.

92,Newsense,"""You mean to tell me that you're not white?""",10,12 March 2009,"I'll admit that when I first saw White Chicks I had mixed feelings about it. At first I thought it was sporadically funny but at second look its pretty funny and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers we knew. For the record not everybody in America is easily offended by movies like White Chicks and Borat. Im pretty sure there are people across the globe that are offended by these movies so to place being overly-sensitive to Americans only is being unreasonable. We're not all uptight even though there are a lot of uptight people among us. I for one can enjoy movies like White Chicks, Borat and Team America because I can see them for what they are: silly comedies made for fun and in hopes of getting us to enjoy them. Two disgraced FBI agents go way undercover in an effort to protect hotel heiresses the Wilson Sisters from a kidnapping plot. These two also go through a lot of hijinks involving keeping up the charade as well as dealing with nosy girlfriends as well as the real heiresses' archenemies.Funny Scene#1: The beginning where Marcus was in the shop trying to pass himself as as Hispanic was pretty funny. Especially when he broke singing Guantanamera.Funny Scene#2: The scene where Marcus is in the car with Latrell and he breaks out into song had me laughing till I was breathless.Funny Scene#3: The date scene with Marcus and Latrell is the funniest part of the movie hands down. Have you ever met a guy so oblivious and desperate that his desperation matches Wanda's desperation off of In Living Color? I mean I had to hold back the laughter just to watch the rest of the scene! Funny Scene#4: The department store scene is not too far behind when you talk about the funniest scenes in the movie. There were some pretty clever and not subtle jabs at the insecurities women have about their weight. Sure it was over-the-top but remember this is a comedy.Funny Scene#5: The dance-off scene in the club was hilarious. Watching those girls shake their flat rear ends then to watch them getting disgraced by White Chicks duo on the dance floor was too funny for words.Funny Scene#6: Kevin gets attacked by a rottweiler. ""He's not my dog, he's family"". Lol! In conclusion If you can handle this type of comedy then go for it if not don't waste your time. To me White Chicks is laugh out loud romp and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers movies. You think I'm kidding? Check out Little Man and Marci X and see if Im wrong then.",White Chicks

I mean, it's the story of 2 undercover FBI agents doing the Mrs Doubtfire routine to become 2 white chicks who might get kidnapped.I mean, really, that is the entire plot - there's not a lot in the way of subplots here - it's what I call a dumb comedy (like Dodgeball) - a smart person doesn't go into the theatre for this type of movie expecting a great script, great plot and a well directed movie.So, if that's what you are looking for, for goodness sake stay away from this film.I really enjoyed this movie - I was having a crummy day, I had a terrible cold and I wanted to take my mind off everything and this movie achieved that. Yes, it's a silly plot line, but it's meant to be - the Wayans brothers dressing up as 2 white chicks was just funny in itself, without needing any plot. And there are some genuine laugh out loud moments too.Go and see this movie if you enjoyed movies like Dodgeball, Old School, and movies in that genre.

If you can't move past that clever little part then you have no sense of humour and wont enjoy the film. In fact a great scene occurs when the cops dressed up as ""white chicks"" appear on the runway with the real Wilson sister and people look confused.Also, the humour is fun and a little silly, but it's lighthearted humour.

98,RichardKleiner,"""There's nothing intelligent around this"",",7,22 October 2010,"Don't get me wrong. The Wayans brothers make crap. Their movies have everything you can find funny but told in a way so offensive it should be against the law.White Chicks is most certainly no masterpiece. It's not high class comedy. It barely counts as an actual piece of cinema. But, considering the other trash the Wayans' have produced, this is most certainly their best movie.On one thing, it's tolerable. You can actually sit through this whole thing without feeling nauseated.The script is average, but it's smart enough (in a way) to know it's in over its head when addressing FBI situations. And, the emotional story does actually click.Some of the gags are really funny. Seriously. I laughed at some parts, smiled on several and didn't twitch in agony in any scene.Naturally, in movies like these, technical aspects such as lighting, cinematography, the score, and even the acting are taken for granted, but it does excel on most of them. Interestingly, in the dramatic scenes, you can tell Marlon is the superior actor compared to his brother. Shawn delivers the lines so unconvincingly flat that it's funny. I don't know if it's because he was on Requiem or not, but Marlon simply is a better actor.The reason the movie is not mind-numbingly offensive may be because it's more geared toward girls, and has more of that ""chick flick"" orientation, weak, but enough for your girlfriend to sit through it. It's similar to the success that 50 First Dates and The Hot Chick has had, appealing to both guys (the main target) and girls.It's a dumb movie. It's unrealistic (which is the funniest part of it). It may be a waste of talent for some of the cast and crew involved. But it's the best film Keenen Wayans has ever directed. And it's not awful.",White Chicks

The film really is harmless there is nothing to offensive or anything to sexual I think many ages could watch this film and laugh.

107,ElmStreetsLastBrat,"Not great, but still funny as hell!",5,26 February 2007,"2004's ""White Chicks"" is not a great film by any means, but it is still really funny. Shawn and Marlon Wayans played the preppy white girls to a tee. I thought that was a funny premise too. Two black guys trying to play two bratty white girls! That just sounds like it would be difficult! But Shawn and Marlon pulled it off. They play two brothers who are FBI agents who are assigned to protect two sisters of a hotel tycoon who are involved in a kidnapping plot. The Wilson sisters are unable to be seen in public because of a cut on their nose and lip after a car accident. So Kevin and Marcus (the Wayans brothers) are forced to go undercover as the sisters. Now they have to act, look, and dress like the sisters. And the laughter ensues. Some of the funniest scenes are when Kevin and Marcus, as the Wilson sisters, are trying on clothes and being hit on by different men. One of the funniest scenes to me was when they're trying to sing ""A Thousand Miles"" by Vanessa Carlton. They've never heard the song and don't know the lyrics so they're just mumbling and saying every other word. That was so funny. And the scenes where they're checking out their friends, forgetting that they're dressed as girls. Love that! The humor can be crude at times in this film but I still think it's hilarious. This is one of the better Wayans brothers films that I've seen. They were perfect for the premise of this film. I can't think of anyone else who could have pulled it off.

And it was definitely not worth watching until, I read the sub heading: ""Protecting The Two Disco Divas"". I then calmed down. And eventually, I watched this movie and, oh my God! It was hilarious and as we know, extremely absurd!! Bit by bit, the film made fun of everyone, blacks, whites,Mexicans, guys and girls living in a generalization- Believing girls are made of sugar, spice and everything nice and boys are made of slugs, snails and puppy dog tails.Overall, as we know the film isn't as bad as we think it is.

The other night and I wasn't going to watch it but after fifteen minutes I was hooked! I'm not sure why some reviews moan that the story or make up isn't believable. Who cares? You have to go with the silliness to enjoy the film and all the gags. Two black police men are under cover and pretend to be young white spoiled white girls, is not easy to pull of but it does work and they are very very funny. The character of Latrell who takes a shine to one of the girls is the star of the movie. He is cheesy and has the worst pick up lines. He is a machine.

In Mozart's ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" two women don't even recognize their own husbands in disguise. Silly plots are as old as comedy itself, and you shouldn't let them spoil the fun: They are an important part of the fun!Anyone who proclaims this is 'one of the worst make-up jobs ever', must be completely blind. The make-up was for me one of the main reasons tot see the movie: I was very curious how it would look, 2 black guys as 2 blonds. And I was not at all disappointed. Of course the result looks a bit strange and it is not very realistic to believe anyone in real life would go for it, but yet the 'girls' look amazing. I think the make-up team did a very fine 'state-of-the-art' job.And about racism: I think making fun of the differences between races (and here also: between cultures) whilst not sparing the own kind, is one of the best ways to fight racism. The same thing for the 'gay' jokes: of course those also excel in banality and stereotyping, like most jokes in the movie, but the tone is friendly and in it's way I even think respectful.

Everything is just funny and dorky. There's nothing too complicated so your brain can take it easy.I loved every scene. The car scenes with the Vanessa Carlton song were brilliant. One of the Daniel twins from Sweet Valley High shows was in the film and she's not bad.

It's just non-stop laughs from beginning to end, and if you're looking for a profound or intelligent movie then why would you watch a movie called ""White Chicks""? I've seen many negative reviews on here branding it ""racist"" or ""misogynistic"" well, maybe it is but it's definitely not offensive because it's so over the top how could you possibly be offended by it? Personally, I don't see the film as ""racist"" or ""misogynistic"" I feel that it's making fun of rich, elitist girls who only care about money and their image i.e. people that deserve to be made fun of. The only bit that I didn't find funny was the toilet humour, but that only lasts a short time and some will find it funny.

As punishment, they are forced to escort a couple of socialites into the Hamptons. However, when the girls discover the agency's plan, they refuse to go. Out of options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose like their sisters, transforming themselves from African-American men into a pair of blondes.The film itself is the basis of comedy, given the time it was released some jokes end up being acidic, which somehow makes me laugh, but I don't like the film, most jokes are without grace, when there is one spark of good humor the screenwriters overextend and eventually lose the fun, and almost the entire film becomes predictable, the reason why this film is so beloved especially by the Brazilian audience is the replay factor, in which the same happened over and over again. Movie and at one point you end up liking it or keeping memory, second factor is the dubbing, I can't laugh with this movie but the dubbed version ends up improving some jokes and I can even laugh at some, like the classic Milk Powder joke, I can laugh about it, all because the dubbing collaborates.I understand that a lot of people think this movie is the best of all comedy movies, as well as The Smart Ones (which by the way is horrible) or Super Hero the movie (pain), but being very honest I don't see much fun, script is weak and often meaningless, shallow characters, generic and predictable jokes, in fact The Whites ends up being the best movie from these screenwriters but it's not by far the best comedy movie.Grade: 4.",White Chicks
131,john-mitchell77,"OK, for its genre",7,7 November 2006,"This movie is your typical brainless comedy. It's the kind of comedy that the Wayans brothers are famous for, and there's a reason for that. It's really quite funny.This movie, as is customary with this type of comedy, even has something to say about relationships, both with friends and with significant others. I'm sure that this was always a part of the story, but it does give you the sense somehow that it might have been a means of fleshing out the script and characters.Sure, it's not cutting edge comedy and the acting isn't great, nor is the story, but it's a Wayans brothers project. It's not going to be a genre-busting offering, but the visual jokes are funny and provide a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, as do some of written jokes, because Shawn and Marlon know where the laughs are, and go all out to shake every last titter out of you. Sometimes it doesn't quite work, but hey, they've definitely tried with this one.So, if you're looking for an intelligent comedy, you won't find it here, but if you want a couple of hours where you can leave your brain in your coat pocket and just laugh, and let's face it, why not, then go for it!",White Chicks

The humor is very unsophisticated and will do little than inspire the occasional smile. The ONLY good thing about this movie was the Latrell character who was perfect for the role and did an excellent job. For the record, I'm not sure who thought this movie was racist or why, it's called satire, get a grip!

136,Christopher-Peznola,"Had its moments, but could have been a 20 minute comedy skit",6,14 May 2006,"The incredibly talented Wayans brothers, have once again delivered a VERY funny, cross culture comedy. While I am guessing nobody goes to a movie called ""White Chicks"" looking for the next ""Gone with the Wind"", but I do think that movie-goers deserve more than this, particularly given the high quality names involved.There is enough funny material in the film to make a 2 part skit on a late night comedy show, but truly not enough for a feature length film. The dialog was very bad, although the overall story had some merit. There was a large cast of writers on this film, but unfortunately it was an incestuous group that had all written other similar Wayans comedies, like Scary Movie and the Wayans shows. the addition of one or two, established writers, would have really boosted the quality of the plot and dialog.A formula works well for medical products, soups, aligning the Hubble telescope, but it tends to produce pretty mediocre films. I wish the Wayans had trusted one outsider on their writing/producing/directing team, the results could have been very different, I think much better.Lots of great, funny scenes, and lines that you can use at parties for months to come. Please see the film and let me know if what I am saying makes sense as you view the film.",White Chicks

The Wayan brothers have a successful line of comedy, due to their natural charm, and somewhat believable acting. I've seen and witnessed this movie a few times, but each time the same jokes are funny. Terry Cruise certainly brings a light atmosphere, and never fails to deliver, the more or less enjoyable surprises. For a man who looks tough enough to break bricks by merely flexing, he's shown in this his equal skill to bring tears from laughter.

Have you guys read what you're writing on here and looked at yourselves? This film ain't real, and criticising the make up the guys were wearing cos you didn't think it was realistic enough is a bit daft, I think. It's only a story, a comedy and in my opinion a great film. No doubt the people who don't like this will also not like I'm Gonna Git You Sucka and Don't Be A Menace To South Central? (two more cool films) Or is it that people are afraid that if they say they like this film some lefty will say they are racist towards black people or some supremacist will say they are racist towards whites? Wow, I know a guy who said Dumb And Dumberer was racist cos the Chinese girl in it was called 'Ching Chong'?! Jeez.I laughed my socks off at this film and I don't care who knows it. It's funny. There's no point repeating the story, but I will repeat this bit which is reflected in a few places on this site - Latrell is the funniest character in this film and every time he appeared I was cracking up! You need to get this film to see his rendition of 'Thousand Miles' Ha ha. It's cool. Forget what people will call you, and watch it alone if you have to! It's only 4 quid on ebay!",White Chicks
141,nickcluxton,It all depends on your taste.,2,16 April 2013,"Despite the rating I gave White Chicks, I don't hate this movie.As many other people have already said, this movie is not, nor is it attempting to be anything close to ground-breaking or thought-provoking. It's just trying to be funny.Now because this movie has only one purpose, there is going to be a split crowd. You'll get people saying that it is either the funniest thing ever or too stupid to sit through. The whole movie is centered around one joke: The joke is that two tough black guys are acting like spoiled white girls. Again, some people love that, and others like me don't. A movie similar to this that I love is one called ""The Stupids"", which is about a family that gets itself caught in the middle of a government conspiracy. It's not a gripping story, the message is non-existent, and the only thing that ""The Stupids"" is trying to do is make people laugh. The joke in that movie was that the family was so stupid that they solved every problem the wrong way, which I think is absolutely hilarious. It's so absurd that it almost generates a forced laughter. With movies that live or die on a funny premise, it all comes down to the viewers reaction to that initial joke. This is the area of film where most guilty pleasures spawn from. Now, I admit that ""The Stupids"" is a bad movie, but I can that over and over because I like the joke that it presents. I don't like the premise of White Chicks, but not because it's a bad premise, it's just not to my taste. If you liked ""Daddy Day Care"", ""Are we there yet"", ""Norbit"", or anything where a black comedian takes advantage of situational humor, you'll probably enjoy the comedy in White Chicks.",White Chicks

Let me just stand up and say that I am white and was not offended by it in the slightest. In fact I found it hilariously funny- not really making fun of me but mostly of women in general and upper class celeb Americans (a subject which never ceases to entertain me!).I didn't think that the plot was weak at all. As in most comedies, the plot is not really that important. Gaining a few cheap laughs is much more important!

Sean and Marlon create such loopy, goofy characters that you just enjoy spending time with them. Race, class, sexuality and materialism are all addressed with a soft touch, but at least they made a stab at these issues - with humor.Some gags are obvious and slow (the dog, for example), but the audience I saw it with in jaded L.A.

Anyone who says this movie was not funny must have no sense of humor at all because everything out this movie was funny. I thought my stomach was about to explode i was laughing.

The reason this movie is so bad, is that it really isn't funny unless you're a ten year old girl. I'm trying to remember any really good laughs I had, but I can't. There just weren't any. What I do remember is cleaning my glasses and rubbing my eyes a lot during this film, which is something I use as an excuse to myself for not having to look at the screen. Some of the scenes were excruciating. I pride myself on being able to watch bad movies to the very end, but I contemplated walking out on this flick several times, and spent the rest of the time wishing I had. Intermission came as a liberation. I never thought I'd say this , but even ""Dodgeball, the movie"" wasn't this bad. At least that film had *some* good laughs.

You almost wonder at times if this was supposed to be a comedy or just a stupid movie. Then, in a few parts, the jokes or scenes were too drawn out. If it was a funny scene, they would kill it by keeping the scene going. In other times, it seemed to be just pointless filler. As films go, what happened here? There were at least 2 scenes edited for the worse from the trailers to the final product. In fact, one scene that was changed, the editing was so horrendous that the quality of the picture looked like someone was using a home movie camera. Then when the scene went back to the original...it went back to normal. Then there were at least two scenes in which the microphone is just hanging in the middle of the screen. Considering the Wayans family has been in this business since at least the late 1980's...you think they would have this down pat.A poor comedy with just as bad bad filming and editing... this rates a whole 2 / 10 from me.",White Chicks

OK, so the premise of 2 black men dressing up and passing for 2 white women is absolutely ridiculous and far-fetched (they kind of look like Michael Meyers from Halloween!). But once you set aside your disbelief, you'll enjoy the whole movie a lot more. I think some people were too unforgiving on this point. I expected something horrible, but to my pleasant surprise, laughed out loud quite a lot. Terry Crews absolutely steals the show as the ivory-chasing muscle man. He is hilarious! Some people also thought this movie was racist, but they need to lighten up. Anyone familiar with WB sitcoms, the Wayans Brothers, Kenan Ivory Wayans' earlier films (like I'm Gonna Git U Sucka) and in Living Color will know about their brand of socially-derived humor which pokes at our society's hangups about racial issues. This movie makes fun of black people a little, white people people a little, but mostly, it makes fun of snobby socialites and class differences. It's quite funny if people'll stop being so uptight.

The few moments when it could have been funny are either played up way too much or rely on the stereotypical nature of caricatures or some moment where it actually becomes offensive in its humor - and I love dark humor.It actually reminds me, at moments, of Freddy Got Fingered which has been stated by some to be nearly an art film it has so little purpose. If you want to watch a movie, watch ANYTHING else... anything. Even the Scary Movies are more entertaining than this, with some decent acting and jokes that at least mostly rely on surrealistic sex, not 'one you go black, you're in a wheelchair' ... *shudder*",White Chicks

160,edensartgallery,Don't overthink it,7,7 August 2019,This movie has become one of my favorite movies for down days. It is truly hysterical and so many different ways but I wouldn't overthink it. If you just sit back relax and watch the movie and laugh and how terrible it is and then laugh at the actual jokes and take it for what it is and you will absolutely love this movie. Don't think about the acting just think about the situation itself and you will laugh. I think the Wayans brothers did an amazing job with the Simplicity of the movie.,White Chicks

I have never laughed so hard in my life. This movie was so funny. The Wayans brothers did a terrific job with the acting, writing and directing. Shawn and Marlon are flawless together. I don't think there is anything that these brothers cannot accomplish together. I loved their movie Scary Movie and I have always enjoyed their humour, but this movie was more than I expected. Plus, it's always nice to see guys understanding a woman, even if it is just in a movie.If you feel like a nice out of the ordinary comedy..then this is the film for you.

First of all, it's not racist. Only racists will think the plot is racist. It isn't. Why would all the Caucasians actors and actresses in this movie take their parts if THEY thought it was racist? This movie makes fun of Caucasians, African Americans, geeks, women, men, dorks, etc. The Wayans brothers look funny as ever with the make-up on; not like the real women they are portraying...but that's partly what makes it funny. Terry Crews is hilarious in all of his scenes. All I can say is that I liked it very much, and I STILL like it!",White Chicks
165,eileen-guthrie555,It's a shame we can't laugh at ourselves anymore. Thanks cancel culture!,8,24 September 2020,"I saw this movie in it's original release and it was funny, and my friends and I laughed out loud. But society has changed a lot in 16 years, and probably not for the better. The times we are living in, that you have the right NEVER to hear any opinion that contradicts your own, and using intimidation and violence if necessary, to protect your ideological bubble. And if someone actually does or says something you don't like, you are entitled to a hug, a safe space, a puppy or all of these above. From cancel culture, the metoo movement, a woke culture, politically correct, virtue signaling to having people be so offended, that they are killing comedians and comedies. We can't laugh at ourselves anymore or the stupid things people do and say could set off a group to burn the comedy store or the laugh factory to the ground. I just can't imagine that a studio would green light a project like this movie now for fear of intimidation from the woke and cancel culture people. Comedy was once about the absurdities of life. White chicks were about that absurdity. You're not supposed to believe that no one noticed they were wearing masks, anymore than then believing very hairy Robin Williams could pull off being a woman, who needed a close shave at 2 o'clock in the afternoon because the comedy was about the absurdities in life. Liberals and progressive have no sense of humor and maybe that's why they are so angry all the time.Despite being lambasted by critics at that time, White Chicks was adored by fans at the time of its release. But how has the movie aged in the 16 years since its initial release? Yes and No. White Chicks was guilty of using ""Whiteface."" In the movie, two African-American FBI agents dress themselves up as white twins in order to stop a major kidnapping threat. While it was funny at the time, it's unlikely that any director would go this direction in the current climate. The one-liners are still funny now as they were back in 2004. It has plenty of ridiculous slapstick moments. Kevin's face going flat against a glass, Marcus literally painting his whole face with food in an attempt to showcase his poor table manners, extremely loud farts... it's all in there in heavy doses. Terry Crews has had plenty of comedy roles in his career, but the most memorable ones came in Everybody Hates Chris and White Chicks. In the latter, the most memorable scenes were those that focused on his character Latrell Spencer and it still holds up well after 16 years. If we can't laugh at ourselves and the stupid things people do and say, then as a culture we are screwed.",White Chicks
166,iwerewolf_werewolf,Not racist,1,1 February 2005,"After watching the adverts I thought this film looked racist and a pile of crap. Which is unfair. this film is not racist. It is, however a pile of crap.I think the people who find this funny must have had a lobotomy. What a waste of money this film is. I am so sick of crappy films like this that have a weak story, and even weaker jokes. I guess I must be asking too much to watch a comedy thats smart and funny. I would also like to point out that the only reason I went to see this was because it was my sisters birthday. Shes 12 and thought it was mindless crud. A lot of Americas 'comedies' don't appeal to me to be honest. they usually involve slapstick to make up for the fact that they are not funny.

Can anyone give me one Wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies? Don't Be A Menace doesn't count, Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost wrote that (the other Norton Trio members acted as Directors).In White Chicks, there's never really any jokes. It's just the Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. There's no setups, no punchlines and no laughs. There is a lot of ""I think I'm gonna play some Time Crisis 3."" At least for me there was (5 times to be exact).Somebody has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented one), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies.

A group of friends and I had won free passes to a preview before it was actually released and we were all uniformly amused. The movie is funny and entertaining. Though it is also silly and often stupid, It is chock full of fun gags and mishaps and great jokes and lines.The Wayans are consistently funny in this film and the characters around them are equally funny, whether they are good guys, bad guys or in between, the whole movie is funny.I was in stitches through majority of the movie. It is certainly not a work of art and the premise has more than been done before, but Black working class guys into White, rich, snobby Hamptons girls...c'mon, it is vintage!!I think people are way too hung up on the whole race issue and take things too literal when it comes to poking fun at whites, blacks, rich, poor or whatever!! Take it at face value. A good, er, uh ""family"" movie with lots of laughs. Even if you are not a great fan of the Wayans, it is worth seeing.",White Chicks

170,artstar04,White Chicks = Bad Flick,4,22 May 2005,"White Chicks = Bad FlickAfter seeing previews for this movie for the first time a few weeks back I had no intention of seeing this movie but did hold some hope that it just might be good. Well, as irony and karma would have it I did see this movie and let me tell you, Sandra Bullock was wrong when she said ""Hope Floats"" because my hopes sunk quicker than Jack on the Titanic.Though Shawn and Marlon Wayans portrayal of Mexican shop owners in the movies first few minutes was rather funny (especially when they tried on their Groucho Marx impersonation) the rest fell fast.In the opening scene they attack the wrong men who are supposed to be drug dealers using Ice Cream as a code name for crack and only get Vanilla ice cream instead of missing the real dealers. This describes their choice in movie plot ""a hit and miss"" which should have become a ""hit and run""And though the comedy of the movie was supposed to come from the brothers dressing as women and barley being passable, with some nose reduction and less facial expressions they could have made it into the women's bathroom unsuspected. Unlike ""Tootsie"" or ""Big Mamma's House"" these men actually could pass as women.A white flag shows vibrantly to those of pure sanity when there is an M.C. Hammer joke in the first few minutes and is only proved to be more apparent when it is repeated in the finale.The script is very unoriginal and seemed rushed and lazy. The idea is borrowed from so many movies including ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Tootsie,"" ""Nuns on the Run"" and is almost pitch perfect to Martin Lawrence's ""Big Momma's House."" With the starting within the first 10 minutes, lagging on for a good hour and the only to be wrapped up within a matter of minutes.Along with many of the movies in which a man dresses as a woman, love hops in for the ride and causes trouble. Marlon Wayans's character Marcus must hide from his lovely and annoying wife that he is playing dress up as an obvious one half of a Hilton Sister spoof. It is during this time that a black football player with a taste for white women gets caught in the tangles of the wo(mans) heart. Shawn Wayans however falls in love with a reporter, which I thought would be hell bent on exposing them because of a sneaking suspicion but does not.The two ""girls"" look like Collagen/ Botox addicts with steroid problems as they over shadow the other girls.My suggestion- if you want to see black men dressed as white women; go to downtown Detroit around the Fox Theater during Twilight hours and you're sure to some.",White Chicks

I decided to take the plunge and put up with what I expected to be a poor excuse for a comedy.Fortunately, I my expectations were way off base.If you want to see social commentary from this movie, then this isn't the film for you. There are some jabs, but that is not the thrust of the film.I should mention that my mother's funeral service was earlier in the day, so I wasn't exactly in a laughing mood. However, there were 2 or 3 spots in the film where I doubled over in laughter. Yeah, it's a dumb premise for a movie, but it works.We watched the unrated version.

Remember its a comedy you laugh at funny things on film, you don't watch a comedy film to write a check list of every thing not politically correct about the movie, its a movie to be enjoyed by the masses not by the political correctness police, get a life people.

I usually go to a movie every couple of weeks, and so far I have seen Mean Girls, Harry Potter 3, Shrek 2, The Day After Tomorrow, Thirteen Going on 30, and of course, White Chicks. I enjoyed most of the movies, but I didn't really like White Chicks that much.Different people are going to have different opinions. For example, Jess loved it. She thought it was the funniest comedy in the world, that even the rude and racial humor was hilarious. Mandi thought it was pretty funny, but she wished that there was a little more (understandable) storyline, and she got a little offended. As for me? I thought it was so-so, okay, whatever, not a movie that I will ever want to see again, not something that I will probably even remember. There were a few cheap laughs, but the humor was, well, not my style. It could have been a lot better...but that's like saying I could have been $5 richer if I hadn't bothered to see the movie in the first place.Overall, you HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE FOR YOURSELF TO DECIDE!

And they especially don't look at all like the two girls they're trying to impersonate. They stand out like a sore thumb. Now I know some people are going to try to argue that it's just a movie. Just enjoy it. Well what's to enjoy. I'm insulted that someone would actually expect me to just accept that these two people are SUPPOSED to be passed off as white girls. All I would say to you is, shame on you. The only thing that's funny about this film is the fact that we are expected to believe that two people could pass themselves off as white chicks with that makeup.

I actually saw more funny scenes in the movie then I did in the previews for the movie which is a good thing. Some of the characters are annoying as hell, but some also are very funny. If you're looking for a great movie, this is not it, but if you're just looking for a few cheap laughs to tickle the funny bone, this will probably suffice. It is probably JUST funny enough to justify a viewing, just be sure that you're in the mood for this kind of movie. I like the Wayans brothers, they seem like pretty nice guys, so I'm inclined to give them a favorable review. There were a lot of things that could have been ""overdone"" in this type of movie, like a lot of animosity between Wayans and the two ""rival"" non-African FBI agents, but they kept it at just the right level, thank god. I actually liked most of the scenes involving the other two FBI guys, so they did a good job writing the parts for those two. The Latrelle Spencer character was also very funny and great.

Women don't have pants being too tight, as they are always trying to be slim, they love shopping and they don't chase a robber all the way because it's either that they don't have any energy or they are wearing high heals.

Did ANYONE in the universe think that those two racist idiots looked even slightly like real humans, rather than poorly made-up mannequins? Why, oh why, did the studio give this movie the go ahead?

I love Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan as much as the next fan, but they have to work on there material... basically, nothing MEMORABLE like I'm USED to. The story has possibilities, but there just aren't enough laughs for me. If you're thinking about checking it out, I wouldn't recommend it over many other Wayans' classics such as ""Scary Movie 1&2"", ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"", ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"", ""Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"", ""Major Payne"", and even ""Senseless"".

I think it's because Shawn and Marlon Wayans have an unrequited loyal fan-base who support two actors that only want to create lazy, cheap comedies. There's hardly any real jokes in this movie. Instead, you get clichéd gender-swap gags that have been done better in older movies. For example, a man-in- drag gets mad and sounds masculine; everyone looks at him confused; man- in-drag then talks in silly feminine voice then the once-confused people laugh it off as just a rare quirk (this happens too many times in this movie and you'll see every one of them coming). There are no likable characters. Instead, everyone seems incompetent, stupid, obnoxious with the only tolerable being those who don't have a lot of lines or screen-time. The only other kind of jokes are overly contrived and unrealistic sequences forcing the Wayans brothers to feel uncomfortable, and worry that their cover will be blown. Who cares if they lose their job at the FBI? They never demonstrate why they deserve it in the first place. None of the gags work because they're poorly written, with no comedic timing, and they happen to characters we don't care about.I'm not asking for this movie to make some powerful statement on the human condition. I don't expect some high-brow, masterpiece of cinema that reaches into my core. The least I expect are likable/relatable/endearing characters, funny situations that happen to said characters, believable situations, interesting developments in a story and I don't want to be annoyed. This movie has none of those things and almost derides you for expecting them (Many of this movie's fans sure deride you for that.)

If we are no longer allowed to do ""Black Face' because it is Politically incorrect, then there should be no 'white face' like the kind done by Eddie Murphy and Wayans. If Amos and Andy are not allowed to be shown, then neither should this silly movie. I personally would prefer to have more freedom for all artists. Keep in mind that Amos and Andy which are now non grata was not a group of white actors doing Black Face but a group of VERY talented blacks doing real comedy without having to sink themselves to the low gross language that the Wayans use.

Yeah, they might have been funny when Eddie Murphey did them in the 80's, or when Richard Pryor did them before that, or when Red Foxx did them before that.I guess the no-talent Wayans brothers thought everyone would think that hip black guys dressing up as lame white women would make for a hillarious combination. It doesn't- and I don't even have to go see the movie to make that statement.

197,maciegolden,The Wayens brothers have done it again!,7,27 October 2004,"Political correctness need not apply.Thats what makes a Wayens Brother movie so funny.If you can easily be offended then go see some sweet predictable love story.But if you want to laugh your ass off for an hour and a half to two hours Then check out the Wayens.Thay got the same thing going for them that the television series""All In The Famley""had going for it.No one's safe including the offending party's.Yes,White Chicks is mindless comedy.But mindless comedy at its best in my opinion.Sit back,relax, pop it in your DVD player and enjoy.I cant wait for their next project!Simple plot Marlon and Shawn Wayens play two F.B.I. agents who after bungling a case are recruited to escort two rich sisters to the Hamptons that might be a target of a kidnapping attempt.After a small car wreak and two small scratches on the sisters faces Thay decide can't be caught dead in the Hamptons where with all the reporters and photographers and Socialite friends.To avoid digging even deeper into a hole with their boss,Marlon and Shawn use their connections at the F.B.I. to dress like the sisters and go in their place.",White Chicks
198,AlexanderJ337,It's beauty is in it's simplicity,10,13 May 2017,"The acting is alright, the story-line is a bit out there, the sets are unimpressive and the costumes are okay at best. And the wonderful thing is, you don't care about any of that. This is not a hard- hitting drama, it's not a revolutionary piece of artistic expression... Except, maybe it is. So many movies go out of their way to have big, amazing sets with costumes that transport you to another world. They include big movie stars with years of acting expertise. They have millions to spend on witty writing and believable plots. And yet somehow, most movies fail to achieve what White Chicks has done with so little. The movie is, in two words, rewatchably hysterical. I have watched this more times than I can remember, and each time it causes me to laugh out loud. It has a kind of enticing silliness that I almost never like in movies. I am a champion of fresh and deep movies that really break the mould and make you think about the more serious things in life, but for some reason, White Chicks is the exception to that rule. I wish I could say what it is that makes this movie so good, but for the life of me, I do not know. All I know is that if you watch this without prejudice and so long as you have a sense of humour, then you will enjoy this movie. It is a piece of simple beauty, a light-hearted film to lift your spirits and widen your smile. Because, like life, it's just about enjoying yourself.",White Chicks

The problem is if someone is going to tell you it's a great flick....chances are you won't like it, because you've got on your thinker or critic's hat on.I went into the movie thinking : ""This is gonna suck!."" And therefore I approached it as just a little light entertainment.Because of the excellent latino interpretation the Wayan brothers did in the beginning, and the Schwarzenegger accent of the icecream delivery guy ..the mood was set..I had a big smile on my face...which remained on my face for the rest of the movie...only to be interrupted by bursts of loud laughter. My wife and I laughed so loud in some parts of the movie...the bed shook..I have to admit we both haven't laughed at a movie so loud for a long ...long time. The humour is definitely on a teenage level, but I refuse to let that get in the way of a good laugh. a Lot of people might find some of the stuff too offensive for their kids to see. But I actually found it good clean humour and would easily let my 7 and 8 year old boys watch it.Fringe : Terry Crew is definitely the man of the match!!!! (So to speak...) His facial expressions alone, are worth seeing the movie for.Conclusion : All in all this could be a fun movie if you are in the right mood. Enjoyment rating 8/10 Plot 0/10",White Chicks
200,rhinestone_sunglasses,Easy White Chocolate...,5,21 June 2005,I would have never seen this movie if it wasn't for younger siblings. It's the kind of movie you don't think you will ever see and I saw it and I laughed again and again.I didn't find it racist because I found the comedy mostly geared toward differences between men and women and the most hilarious aspects of the film come from the Wayan's brothers dressing up as the girls and the tribulations they have.Personally I can understand how anyone over the age of twenty might not find it as funny. It's a comedy mostly geared toward younger people in the way of Night at the Roxbury or even Clueless. My advice would be to see it but don't expect too much...maybe you'll like it.,White Chicks
201,mklasr,Raised the bar on Gender-Bending movies,9,18 September 2006,"I'll start with 2 questions.1. Can anyone who actually saw this movie give me a reason not to like it? 2. Has anyone ever actually met someone like the Terry Crews character? A lot of people wondered if this movie would stack up to ""Tootsie"" when it first came out. I think that it left Hoffman in its dust. Hoffman wasn't trying to look like anyone specific, just a random woman. Sean and Marlon Wayons pulled it off, not only as White Women, but as the Wilton Sisters. Even though the actresses had bare bones resumes prior to this movie and were probably selected primarily because they resembled Sean and Marlon in makeup, the resemblance of the characters sets this movie apart from its predecessors. This had the advantage of allowing Marlon Wayans' confused male pursuer to actually end up with the woman he desired, despite the fact that Marlon Wayans was not a woman, and more importantly to his pursuer, not white.Now, before anyone points out that Martin Lawrence beat them to the punch in ""Big Mama's House,"" I should mention that they added another dimension as well. With having 2 characters go under cover, there was no need for the ""Agent"" who was in on the gag. You know, the agent who happens to have as clients both this man who mysteriously disappeared and this woman who looks exactly like him, and mysteriously appears at precisely the same time. Sean and Marlon Wayans could commiserate with each other over what they had to go through. Also, Marlon Wayans could dress like a woman and go on a date with Terry Crews while Sean Wayans could dress like a man and pretend to BE Terry Crews in order to simultaneously search his apartment and impress a female news reporter. And of course, Terry Crews could overhear Marlon Wayans telling Sean Wayans that they'd meet up at the club later, to which Crews replied, ""Oh no, my brother, you've got to get your OWN!!!"" In addition, Sean Wayans could meet a woman and pursue a relationship while Marlon Wayans was able to repair things with his wife. This would not have been possible had only one of them went undercover.It's a shame that they were unable to cast Brittnay Daniel's real life twin sister Cynthia, even though they worked together in the TV series ""Sweet Valley High,"" in the role of her sister, but that's about the only flaw of the movie. I keep wanting to say that it fell short in some area, but I just can't. It was hilarious. It didn't take itself too seriously. It definitely addressed what women go through. It addressed what the elite have to go through. It was definitely not predictable. Other than botching an assignment and overcompensating by doing some dirty work and the whole message that, ""women just want men to communicate more with them,"" I'd say that they really didn't rely on too many clichés, either. It even addressed some myths about interracial couples by showing how ridiculous they would look were they actually true.",White Chicks

It's not so much ""ha-ha-ha look at the funny black man pretending to be a white girl, it's ""You know what it's not easy being a girl and this is why."" It's a great way to to kill an afternoon. If you think you're going to be disappointed then see a matinée, but I promise you won't be! This is a good little movie, and it's extremely entertaining! The movie starts out (first 15 minutes) a little slow but picks up speed; the rest of the movie more than makes up for a slow start. The jealousy of the wife in the movies is irritating and distracting threw most of the movie, but circles back around and makes her ""tolerable"" but the end as well.

The only people laughing in the cinema were a couple of 11 year old girls sitting nearby. I could sit here and write an essay on why this film is so bad but I don't want to re-live the experience of sitting through it.

208,purplebear17,I could easily relate to this movie,9,10 March 2005,I could easily relate to this movie because it is making fun of the Hilton sisters who I like. The Wilson sisters get in a car accident and they looked ruined. Kevin and Marcus Copeland disguise as them and they hang out with the Wilson sisters friends Karen Tori and Lisa. The best performance in the film is Jaime King as one of the Vangergeld sisters who are the Wilson sisters rivals. My favorite seen is the dance off seen between the Wilson's and the Vangergeld. One problem is that Latrell bidded the most for Marcus disguised as one of the Wilson sisters.This movie has great music and is original. I thought Scary Movie was too crude. I am happy the Wayans Bros. stopped doing the scary movies to do this funny movie.,White Chicks
209,rollinsband2002,Terry Crews steals the show!,7,19 December 2004,"This movie was funnier than I expected, and I have to hand it to the Wayans brothers: who else could pull off such accurately extreme cultural stereotypes? They have as much insight to the 'hood (remember ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central""?) as they do the exclusive Hamptons Polo Club set (yes, girls like the Wilson sisters really exist!)Still, Terry Crews as Latrell Spencer was by far the funniest character, I hope this movie singles him out as a major player...his scenes in the disco and singing in the car alone were worth the price of admission! Although the flatulence and bathroom humor got old and seemed misplaced, it was still an entertaining film, and if you engage suspension of disbelief at times (the Wayans look NOTHING like the Wilsons),you might like it.",White Chicks
210,fleaaaaaa,Piece of sh*t!,1,17 August 2005,"Basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. First of all I'd like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie (1) and the sequel had it's moments. Unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver HALF the laughs. The humour in it is absolutely crude. If you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. When it isn't crude it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. However I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn't have bothered). The story is undeniably thin, it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant. I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film, the laughs don't come quick enough. Some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin storyline, A film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didn't have enough material.",White Chicks

212,99Tfl,Never Again,2,21 November 2018,"The two-stars I've given, along with the title of this review, are probably a heads-up as to what I thought of this movie.
Because they are-'White Chicks' is 1 hour and 49 minutes of my life I can't get back.
The premise-Shawn and Marlon Wayons play 2 incompetent and disgraced FBI agents who are assigned to bodyguard 2 young blonde socialites with more vanity than intellect (probably parodies of Paris Hilton with a little bit of the Olsen twins thrown in). When the twins get small scratches on their faces, they refuse to go to their big society get-together, treating their (very) minor injuries as the coming of the apocalypse. Needing the girls to flush out a kidnapper, the two agents decide to don whiteface and masquerade as the two airheads. 'Hilarity' ensues.
Now, the disguised black Wayan Brothers pretending to be two white Valley Girls with more money than brains and somehow succeeding in fooling people-clearly, the average IQ in this film is a lot lower than in the real world. Not only do they barely resemble the twins, but their disguises fall into Uncanny Valley once in a while.
In addition, I noticed a resemblance to 'Some Like It Hot'-two wacky characters dress up as women, one of whom then adopts another disguise to woo a lady he fancies, while another is chased by a man convinced by the disguise. The difference is that 'Some Like It Hot' has no racist jokes at Latinos and is actually funny (I'm serious-I did not laugh once watching this).
That all said, this film has one-and I mean ONE-saving grace. And that is Terry Crews, in all his muscled, hammy, chasing-white-girls glory.
Conclusion: see this movie for Terry Crews and nothing else. Or just avoid it altogether and miss out on the attempted humour.",White Chicks

The black guy who falls in love with one of the white chicks is just too funny.

I love how the guys who disguised themselves don't even sound like the twins, but people don't notice anyway. The part where one of the guys is lactose intolerant and is in the bathroom is one of the funniest parts there. Some parts were so unrealistic it was funny. The whole concept of 2 guys trying to be women is awesome even though often used. don't have a younger audience watch this though. I suggest this movie for sleepovers. You won't be disappointed. I thought the part with the dance off with the Fen Fen Twins was a bit stupid except for when the 2 guys started to breakdance. Also, I didn't like how the cast the Fen Fen Twins. They looked a bit skinny for the part. Other than that, nothing really got on my nerves about this movie. If you like slightly gross, stupid, humor, see it.

Everything they've put out from ""Don't Be A Menace"" to the ""Scary Movie"" series has been comic genius. Their latest effort ""White Chicks"" has Shawn and Marlon Wayans playing two agents undercover as white heiresses. Now they've gotten a lot of backlash from the white community for their portrayal of white women. But come on we saw this in Soul Man. Where the white man dressed up in blackface and had on a afro wig. But anyway, this film is hilarious. But most of the laughter came from the cat and mouse chase between Terry Crew and Marlon Wayans. Crew's character Latrell thought that Marlon's character was a real woman and throughout the whole 2nd half of the movie he chased after him. It was a sight to see.

The whole premise is already quite silly, and you wonder why the ""white chicks"" could ever be mistaken for the women they're masquerading.

When a film can't justify it's own existence, then you're better of just burning the negative and pretending it never happened. It doesn't generate a single laugh (except out of sheer embarrassment for the actors) and there's zero social commentary because every character is such a poorly written cliché that you can't get past how over-the-top they are.No one seems to be enjoying what they're doing, the editing is atrocious, all attempts at humor rely solely on the lowest possible juvenile sensibilities and the plot conceit is so entirely implausible that this film just defines 'bomb.

I was looking for an easy watch but Jesus! I was handed this movie after a long days work and was disgusted just reading the title. I was informed that it was ""actually hilarious"" so turned my brain off for a couple of hours of ""bubble gum comedy"". Now I understand some people take a while to twig on to a joke, but why the incessant pauses after a really small and lame joke? most of the so called punch lines were strained to say the least, with nothing other than toilet humor and bad taste behind them, sure you may want to giggle, but then move on! The makeup and jokes were so bad, the script was written for 12 year olds and the stereo types were actually ""too much"".....like ""too stereotypical"" and I didn't think that could be done.Utter trash.",White Chicks

This movie made me laugh so much my cheeks and abdominal muscles were hurting. And it was genuine laughter. Sure it was campy and goofy and hardly ""intelligent"" at all but who gives a rat's a$$. It was a perfect movie for an otherwise boring Friday night. My favorite parts were the faces the ""girls"" made, the break dancing scene, the car scene where all the girls were singing Vanessa Carlton, and the lactose intolerance episode.This is the best movie they Wayans Bros have made, and they haven't made many good ones in my opinion.

With a great cast of characters. I definitely do not watch movies for hidden meanings, a significant message, or the artistry.

What followed was 1 1/2 hours of great comedy, some scenes are so hilarious that even after seeing them many times I still laugh again when seeing them.In some way this movie is identical to Soul Plane by being an underdog which is blamed to be racist and full with low level jokes. Perhaps it is, but I still find it very funny.10/10 (Partly because of the IMHO unjustified low total rating this movie has)",White Chicks
240,Andy5,"Oh, it's good because it's bad!",4,10 May 2005,"Right from the start I knew this film would be appalling but therefore hilarious. Rules to conduct a successful drug deal arrest from the Wayan brothers:1. Do the deal in the front of your shop counter. 2. Don't check if you've actually been given drugs before you try to arrest the 'perps'. 3. Don't have back up available. 4. When things go wrong, start shooting hap-hazardly in the direction of the shop window with no thought of hitting passers by.Even though the joke at the start of the film was that the Wayan FBI brothers had got the wrong perp (who were delivering drugs posing as ice cream sellers) the legitimate ice cream sellers didn't think anything of taking payment of thousands of dollars in cash in a suitcase for one ice cream delivery! That's some good ice cream!! And if they were 'going rogue' in this first case, where did the Wayans get that cash from in the first place?This all happens in the first 5 minutes, and it literally doesn't get anymore plausible. I can suspend disbelief to enjoy a concept as much as the next film fan but this stretches things. The two white girls the Wayans are posing as have friends that think nothing of the broad shoulders, big arms and general behaviour of these 'girls'.This is a stupid film with plot holes, tired concepts, lazy jokes and underdeveloped comic set pieces. One for silly girls who want a giggle and some wishy washy 'men don't understand us' philosophy.

However, I will at least comment on principle.This film was doomed from the start. The already-ridiculous story was -- surprisingly -- accented by terrible acting from the Wayans brothers themselves.A film of this nature is directed entirely at pre-teenage girls who can relate to the ditzes on screen. I was embarrassed to appear in the theater that it was playing in.I give the film ONE STAR, on effort. Hopefully, the Wayans know what they're really doing with their career.",White Chicks

This idea was original... although not very realistic... enough to have great potential. But the movie, well.... I tried to sleep just so that I could let my wife enjoy it. If you have seen the American Pie trilogy, then you have already seen a lot of the jokes in this movie. Up to, and including, the dance-off. I went into this movie with low expectations, and ended up giving it too much credit. My personal advice, if you have a choice between this movie and gangrene....I'd go with the infection, and possible dismemberment. But that's just myopinion... I could be wrong.",White Chicks

The people down the row from me were funnier, I almost walked out before Terry came on. The first 35 minutes were very slow and yet did not set up anything of significance. The plot was forgotten and very weak. The makeup was forgettable and not close to reality. The Wayans' should be given awards for being able to verbalize the script ( if there was a script ). From scene to scene the action was just not effective nor creative. The slapstick was really bad and the serious moments were not alive partially because the funny stuff just did not work. Terry Crews was the only bright spot other than 'The End'.",White Chicks

I would love to see this film over and over simply because it was funny, emotional, deep, and had a lot of feminine morals but my favorite part was the dancing which was shown in all the trailers. I would rate this film as the best I have ever seen, and I thought Marlon was beautiful as a woman and it really does make the phrase ""beauty is skin deep"" have a new meaning.

I have a hard time understanding why anyone would watch this expecting a ""believable"" storyline. It's the movies folks -- let go, use your imagination and enjoy!

At least partly, anyway. So who cares if the movie had a successful black guy always running after white chicks? No one can tell me there are none of those. And so what if the two Wilson sisters were a couple of ditsy dumb blonds? Prove to me there are none of those. The movie didn't generalize. It didn't say all blonds are stupid and shallow, or all black men want white women. It actually showed the two lead characters (played by the two Wayanses) actually being better than that. They showed character by not focusing on the superficial.I don't think the movie should be taken too seriously. Of course, jokes are half-meant, but c'mon, it's the Wayanses.

But as a kind of ""Bad Boys"" meets ""Mean Girls"" it succeeded, appealing to both young and old in my family (but mainly to our own ""white chicks"", the ""white boyz"" weren't quite so interested). The acting by various members of the Wayans clan was more than equal to the material, but this probably speaks more about the quality of the material. Plenty of toilet humour here folks, when the basic premise should have been enough to generate better laughs (for me Lenny Henry's reluctant mob assassin in ""True Identity"" is the classic portrayal of a black man impersonating a white man).At the end of the day it is a comedy, we laughed, mission accomplished.",White Chicks

I laughed so hard and yes there is a lot of toilet humor literally. When you see it you'll know what I mean, but with the Talent of Keenan, Marlon and Shaun you have to give it to these brothers.Terry Crews as you can read from the other comments was really good, he was so funny playing a black man who wants to only date white woman. But one of the best parts in the movie is a Canadian born actor named Kevin Blatch who plays the infamous Aubrey Allure. Aubrey Allure is having a big fashion show in the Hamptons and the young hip crowd a who's who are all there to be seen. Aubrey is over to top funny. Great chemistry with actress's like Brittany Daniel and Jamie King.

This doesn't come close. While the premise (change in colour/gender/whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before)the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks. However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you will have guessed by now, they fail completely. I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide. Its appalling. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low. And I like bad movies!

The only reason that i didn't give it a ten is because of the acting from two supporting actors. I think you would be able to determine them yourself. Overall an Awesome movie.

The jokes, while cheap in a sense, were well-played out, and it gives everyone a chance to poke fun at the shallow and materialistic culture of upper-class elitist white women. The main feature making this film the brilliant piece of material that it is, is the sharp contrast between the superficial aspects of the white female class, and the soulful and down-to-earth behaviors of the black males. Anyone who feels this movie stereotypes genders or races is a deluded moron who needs to re-examine how our society works. The only reason that ""blacks can poke fun at white people,"" is because blacks are obviously the only ones adventurous and humor-filled enough to do so. It's not necessarily about being racist, but about one's perspective and eventual satire on another's race. If there were an equal white counterpart to the genius of the Wayans Brothers, then I'm quite sure that a successful parody of the black culture would be at hand. Yes, I am white, and I found this movie to be worthy of not only another movie ticket purchase, but I will be looking for it upon its DVD release as well. Thank you.",White Chicks

The movie plays of the stereo types of both sexes & the economic class.About two police detectives dressing in costume (cross dressing teen age girls) to protect the women they're dressed as. The makeup job is exquisite. The actors, Shawn & Marlon Wayans do an excellent job of mimicking women's mannerisms. Their timing, when they slip-up & expose their male sides, such as their voices, is a crack up.Jennifer carpenter has a great piece in the movie as a psychotic weight paranoid woman with low esteem. The two counterparts ""white detectives"" are a crack-up. They are always quizzing each other on sexual prowess. The one detective manages to get out of responding when his sexual fantasies are questioned. They can't tell the real girls from the imposters & proceed to pick their clothes off & molest their appendages in front of the police chief. Terry Crews who plays a professional athlete does a fun job of showing his secret feminine white-side.All in all I think the movie is better than 2 out of 4 star scale it currently shows. I think the movie might be a little ""busy"" than an average comedy should be. There is a lot to the movie & if you don't know what is going on from the beginning, you won't get the movie & think it is the stupidest movie ever made. I personally like my comedy a little stupid.

A cheesy and corny comedy complete with a senseless plot. It was full house when I went to watch it and everyone was cracking up. I guess you cannot expect the Wayans to produce a five star movie, so give them a break, loosen up and just laugh at the funny parts in the movie. (But it's better to wait for it to come out at Blockbuster.)I cannot believe that the brothers actually dressed up as white women for laughs. There were a lot of bad camera angles and made the film hard to watch. Most of the acting from the supporting class was delivered blankly without much thought. I can see why some people get offended by this movie, but to a certain extent, many of the jokes made were kind of funny. The worst thing in this whole movie is the plot. It made no sense whatsoever and fell apart at the end.You can say this movie was bad and that made it funny. So don't be too critical. Just enjoy it for what it is. Props Latrell for delivering the funniest performance in this whole movie.",White Chicks

People think the movie is trashy, but personally I think this movie is gold. You can't go wrong with this movie. The people who don't like this movie obviously have no sense of humor because I had a laugh attack every five minutes!!!! The movie is fun, but started off a little boring but it quickly shifts to hilarious. I've seen this movie about 5 times and it never gets old, I think you guys can handle it!Prepare to laugh until you die and grab some snacks and a soda and crawl up in bed and watch this movie!

282,TashaW3,Uptight people not being able to just enjoy a silly film,9,28 August 2012,"I think that the biggest issue with this movie and the comments I've read is that this is a comedy where blacks are making fun of white socialites and the whites are feeling insecure since they are used to poking fun at blacks in movies and not the other way around it seems. Please people, don't be hypocrites. There are many movies that are very clearly racist, and I'm not just talking about against blacks either, but when one movie comes out with black people as the lead in such a movie like this there is an uproar. Get a grip, this movie is just silly fun, and if you didn't like it then fair enough, but please don't go on about racism when there really isn't much to say considering how many movies kill off the black guy first.",White Chicks

It has everything you want in it, dancing, shooting, fighting, parties, and two of the funniest black brothers ""waynes bros"" being ""WHITE"" LOL.. great great movie going to see it one more time :) There were a lot of hot girls in the movie which a lot of people will appreciate... Another thing i enjoyed was the ""BATTLE"" between the two groups / enemies, which i thought was cool. Another thing that was fun was the wife who always thought he was cheating.. but i don't want to give to much away, but GO watch it again if u like it.. if not then sooo sad...",White Chicks

Unfortunately, it seems the producers thought that was enough for making the movie interesting. The plot is just so bad...it is just a succession of not so funny gags and some intestinal humor (meaning farts). Come on, they built a character on Paris Hilton and could not come up with at least a hundred very funny jokes !!! Even Paris in real life is funnier than their clones in the movie.Is it possible that people don't get tired of so many movies with rich teenage girls...yuck ! Skip this one.",White Chicks
285,Retroness-1,Serious Takers Need Not Apply.,8,7 December 2005,"White Chicks is not a movie for the masses, it doesn't take anything seriously nor does it take it to a realistic level. What it does is pokes fun of Hilton-esquire mentality, cuz ""thats hot"".Did I laugh during this movie, yes of course, I thought each scene was ridiculous. Any person with common sense and reason knows that in reality this would never happen.What I did take home with me, is a few cheap laughs and some stupid quotes that I say to my friend from time to time. A person who watches this film should go in that this is not the greatest movie of all time and has to take the movie for what it is. . . a parody of a life style that no one will ever believe.Can this really happen, sure probably, why not, but then again probably not.In a realistic setting and a critic review.. this movie is a 4 out of 10. if one is looking for substance, plot, character development, climax and other things that make a movie a movie In my own mind set, this movie is an 8 out of 10 because of pure mindless fun that makes fun of the whole ditsy Hilton-esquire affair. the only thing missing from this movie was probably the infamous tape.",White Chicks

287,mbevier,Overall nothing to be amazed at but it has its moments,6,31 October 2004,"From the previews and my own idea of what the movie might be like, I was very hesitant to spend the time to even give this one a chance. That is, at least, a critical part of this movie. You must at least give it a chance. If you aren't willing to take a leap, then I doubt you will get much out of it...and even then it won't be a huge amount. Quickly from the outlandish premise, the characteristic differences of a rich white woman and black man are laid out heavily. This will form the foundation, one might think obviously, of the movie. Most of the movie for me was watched through a wince of pain as a train wreck unfolded before my eyes. Although, that is simply part of the fun and entertainment here. You know it is ridiculous, and thoughts of, 'Wow, how much worse could it be' seep in and you begin to enjoy it. If you are looking for shallow comedy, yes, you have found it...and there is nothing wrong with that.I found the man playing Latrell to be a solid inspiration of humor. He put what may be the best performance into this movie and even saying that now surprises me. He was hilarious. The Wayans brothers do as well as anyone could hope to in their role, playing to the ridiculous situation well.Another movie in a trend of superfluous comedy. White Chicks has its place here, and is worth seeing. After all, what price can you put on a laugh, even if its only one.",White Chicks
288,dustin87,Good Movie,7,20 December 2004,I seen this movie in theaters when it first came out and ordered it on PPV the other day and I have to say this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I liked it a lot and would recommend it to anyone!I think that the twins do a great job in this movie and that they really have outdone themselves. However this movie could have been a lot more believable... you really cant believe that these 2 could have passed for two white women... I also think that there should have been more A-List actors in this movie such as Mr T... I think he would have played a better part of 'Buffy the white Girl Slayer',White Chicks

Overall, the Wayans are always known for ""spiffs"" or material that will mock anything that is current, in our society. No one should be offended, the movie equally brought the attention of the following lifestyles: the rich and famous (and their spoiled children); career and professional individuals; and middle class people. Reagardless of color or race; there is a lot that we as humans, can look into another culture of lifestyle and compare it to ourselves, in a comical manner. RENT THE MOVIE, prior to commenting on it. P.S. - Many of us watch the Dave Chappell show in record numbers. This movie was a lighter material, but still will register the same amount of laughs, as the Dave Chappel Show.

Maybe if you really look at the movie, you will find out that it makes a joke about everyone, even black people. It's not racist.I believe that those of you that hate this movie so much, never gave it a chance. Even before you saw it, you already had prejudgments. This didn't allow you to sit back and enjoy. So I say...... It's not the movie that's racist, its you.I liked this movie, I laugh every time I watch it. I am not 12 yrs old by the way. I'm 24. I guess that I'm open minded, not racist, and so not uptight like you people seem to be.Who cares if they look horrible as women, who cares if some jokes are played out, who cares. It is a funny movie, it's all that matters. Jesus, give it a break, these are men, they weren't going to look like perfect women.you people are complaining that if this were the other way around and white men were playing black women, that it would bring chaos. OK well let me tell you this, I can't count how many times black and Hispanics are portrayed as criminals and low-lives in white movies.

If you didn't like it, you gotta lay off it by posting rude comments on IMDb. I mean seriously, get a life, it's just a movie. If it were about Klan, or other racial organizations, I would disagree, but this is a comedy not making fun of ANYONE. If you can't, you gotta get out more because comedy movies are out there for many reasons of which I love! For example, when I'm down, I'll watch a comedy because I'm sad. If there wasn't any comedies, what would people do to get a laugh at the comfort of their own home (by themselves).

I can't say there is one part that I found boring, or not quite as good as the rest of it ... I stayed planted to my chair, as did my children for the duration of the running time ... So that says a lot about a movie itself ... As for the humor stakes ... Think of Deuce Bigalow or something similar, and multiply it by 10 ... It's certainly one of the funniest movies, I've seen in a very long time ... The combination of the Wayans brothers went together so well, and they made the perfect acting team ... I hope they do lots more comedies together, on the same scale as this one ... The entire cast of this movie was awesome, and each character, brought their own little bit of comedy into the movie ... I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, and granted it may have been a little cliché, such as cops/good guy/bad guy, but it went so well with the characters, and they really pulled it off ... It was a whole wealth of great entertainment ... from the bonds of a partnership/friendship to some of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen ... I loved every one of them ...

I get tired of watching movies with so much killings and end of the world plot lines....I also think that Keenan Ivory Wayans should have put his other brother Damon in the film....Damon is very funny, and i think he would have made it a lot better.....

Finally, it came onto cable and that is when I viewed it.. I had to. At first I didn't know what to think. It's slightly creepy to see them as two white women. Granted the two ugliest white women, but I digress. I guess that adds to the comedy. As the movie went on I felt it had some really great parts that I found myself laughing out loud at. I knew it wouldn't be the greatest movie I've ever seen.. or even the funniest, but it definitely had it's moments. Latrell Spencer on the dance floor was one of them. I think you have to have an open sense of humor to enjoy it. Not everyone will like it.So all in all.. What do you expect from this movie? Not some type of prestigious award. It doesn't exactly move you, but it does supply it's purpose of having a few laughs.",White Chicks
299,pddixon26,Wonderful movie!,10,4 June 2005,White Chicks was a breath of fresh air. It took you away from all the gore and drama of most of the latest films. This movie gave you a real chance to just sit back and laugh! It didn't matter if the plot was right or if all the actors could in deed act. It was what it was-funny!Marlon and Shawn have proved to be great actors in whatever role the chose to take. Maybe this movie was so funny because it was so unexpected.

The main idea is not to laugh at this people because they are white but because they are stupid. Some blond,rich girls (Hilton sisters would be excellent example!)who only think about shopping,and how to fix themselves by the plastic surgeries are perfect target.And if you think that they faces look unreal you should look at newest video of Christina Aguilera and notice that she has even more make-up than them,and that should be frightening !

It comes close to the humor of Monty Python, not yet the absurd and satire, but that is what makes Monty Python so unique. These guys have their own style which has been (and i'm sure it will keep on being) funny as hell. Well, the first scene is hilarious, they should make a movie about those two old geezers. But what made me utterly gasping for air and producing a backache from laughing is the toilet scene. Man, this is even better than dumb & dumber's farting scene. Off course this level of humor is to be found throughout the entire movie. Non-stop jokes about anything and anyone, they don't centralize any specific group, they just make fun about everyone and everything. Their acting is so good, it makes you wonder how some celebrities are where they are now. And the make-up and prostheses are really well done. This is a must-see movie. Brilliant!!

The best bit had to have been the first part of the film where the agents made a huge mistake and spoiled a chance of arresting some drug associated people. AND that wasn't even that funny! I mean how can I explain a film that bored me so much I fell asleep? The only few reasons I went to see the film were: I had nothing better to do; wanted to see my friends; and the film had a high rating. Well I think people should learn to judge a lil' better! And as I said with my nothing better to do, I seriously think I should've stayed at home - that way I would've been bored WITH somewhere comfortable to fall asleep!

Sure their make-up as the two rich twin white chicks is a little off, but that is excellent work to look ""white"", and act like those white rich chicks, given these two girls attitude and demeanor in the beginning of the film before the Wayans went undercover posing as them. ""Latrel"" was really great (""Schwartzenegro.."")...At any rate, I loved Spaceballs too and many people didn't like that either.

While the movie contains a great deal of bigotry (I wouldn't call it racism, as the meaning of that badly misused word is: the belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.). Whites have made movies that poked fun of blacks, only in a more insidious manner. Take 'Birth of a Nation', 'Gone With The Wind', and 'Ghosts of Mississippi' in which the white secretary kept making wisecracks regarding slain Civil Rights Leader Medgar Evers.Whites tend to cry 'racism' as much as blacks do, yet we are always accused of playing the race card.

312,vwashington-30296,White Chicks: Movie Review,8,1 May 2017,"White Chicks If you want to howl with laughter, you should watch White Chicks. White Chicks is a comedy that was released on June 23, 2004 in the United States. The stars in this movie are Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans,Terry Crews, Faune Chambers, Jaime King, Brittany Daniel, Maitland Ward, Anne Dudek, Busy Philipps,Jessica Cauffiel,Jennifer Carpenter, Rochelle Aytes,John Heard, Lochlyn Munro,Eddie Velez and Frankie R. Faison. The director of the movie is Keenan Wayans.Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus (Marlon Wayans) and Kevin Copeland (Shawn Wayans) agreed to escort and protect two twin hotel heiresses Brittany and Tiffany Wilson to the Hamptons from a kidnapping plot and go undercover. When they soon realized that they are used as bait for a kidnapper, the brothers have no choice but to pose as the sisters to bust the kidnapper. In the beginning, The brothers are disguised as two Mexican-Americans who owned supposedly an ice cream shop to bust some drug dealers. Three men walked into the shop to give them some ice cream they ordered. The brothers think they are the culprits and arrested them. It turns out they caught the wrong men and the real drug dealers shows up and got away which leads their boss forcing them to escort the sisters. In the next scene, Marcus and Kevin are waiting for the sisters to show up so they can escort them. While driving them to the destination, an accident occurred leaving one of the girls with a scratch on her face and the other with a busted lip. The girls complain about their marred faces and how they cannot come with their faces disfigured. Kevin tells them to just cover the scratches with makeup. Marcus worries and Kevin comes up with an idea to dress up like them for their protection so he calls some makeup artists to transform them into White women. Later the brothers who are posing as the sisters arrived at the Hamptons and are approached by the friends of the twins Karen, Lisa and Tori. They discuss about what have happened while they were gone. While chatting and gossiping like girls always do, two girls named Heather and Megan Vandergeld shows up and ends up with them in a yo mamma joke battle. Heather and Megan are enemies of Brittany and Tiffany and they are very rich. Later in the movie they meet again at a nightclub for a dance-off and Brittany (Kevin) and Tiffany (Marcus) won.One aspect of filmmaking I like is the acting. I like how the actors stay in character and how funny they are. For an example, when one of the brothers who are posing as one of the sisters were trying on clothes with the sisters friends tried to make the clothes fit and the clothes ripped I laughed so hard. Also acting is very interesting and fun. However, I find acting very tedious. Acting takes a lot of practice and you have to work hard if you want to debut in a movie. Also I wonder how many people who auditioned for this movie. Another aspect of filmmaking is the setting. The setting is cool and beautiful. I like how they change scenes and how the background is detailed. I've seen tons of movies with unique set designs. All of them are interesting too. In this particular movie, I see where the scenes are filmed in different places like the mall and the Hamptons. The scenery is awesome and beautiful. The director chose a great place to film this movie.My opinion about this movie is that it is hilarious. The actors did wonderful and the plot is excellent. I watched this movie several times and it's still funny. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. The Wayans brothers and the casting crew did a good job. Some people found this comedy racist and unfunny however, I think the movie wasn't racist at all, people just don't understand humor when they see it.",White Chicks

314,killbison-1,White Chicks really has no merit artistically. It's rubbish.,1,30 October 2005,"I'm going to tell you about the problem with this movie - I understand if you like this film but I got this as a free rental (I work in a BB video store). What can I say - I picked this up with no real knowledge of any of the Waylen brothers (however it's spelt) previous endeavours, but I'm none too impressed. Reading a few postings about this film there seems to be a debate surrounding whether this film is racist/sexist - I would say that it isn't really powerful enough of a film to be either. For a film to be influentially racist or sexist it needs to have some sort of ideological backbone - a point - and this film seems to lack any realistic intellectual or even emotional or moral grounding. An argument is, that this is comedy, and we should just accept the outlandish premise purely for the sake of jest alone. Sadly, it doesn't deliver on that front either in my opinion. So what do we see and learn about the imagined reality of the world within White Chicks? We learn that wealthy American girls are stereotypically air headed and image obsessed. Hands up how many people knew this representation already from better films like Clueless? Also, as members of the FBI, these two realistically would have to be professionals. If someone scratches their nose or lip, the FBI would not really batt too much of an eyelid when really concerned with the task of protecting two wealthy girls from a kidnapper, but in this film, these two blunderers take up an elaborate scheme to cover for this. OK, tis a comedy, but as the film progresses the plot structure vanishes - we have to ask the question? Why are they doing this again? Maybe I'm asking too much from this film, but when I saw the promotional matter for this film, I thought it may have something to say about the relationships between race and gender- instead all it does is re-establish what we already know - that it might be an unusual or even a possibly funny experience for a black man to have to hide out as a rich white woman, and that they may not adjust well. A better film would be about somebody doing this and actually trying to be convincing. Alright - I'm getting tired of ranting - but this film actually has more to say about the portrayal of women - when the two ""girls"" grimace at having to engage in feminine activities, is that not saying to the male audience ""God, isn't it great that we aren't like that."" Especially in reference to the display of overt emotion. Rather than the two leads learning about the world they are experiencing, or even trying to understand it, they treat it as an excuse to prove that white girls can't jump. Who is this film made for? It's definitely not women, that's for sure. Ideological analysis aside, the performances are weak, the jokes rubbish and the visuals unconvincing - and the musical score aside from the official pop music soundtrack, is horrifically mickey mouse. I also miss the days of films being written in English - ""I'm not just a booty call."" Ah, I tell you what, watch the film, and see how many shades of puke you can find concealed within. I found approximately twenty-seven. Ta ta.",White Chicks
315,si-boy94,Forget the haters...And beat them.,10,4 April 2006,"I'm not sure it was quite the vote I gave it, but we'll come to that in a moment. I loved this film, the jokes, the gags, the characters. The obvious rip-off of Paris Hilton makes it so great. Not for the faint hearted, I grant you, but really worth watching. Do NOT listen to a certain A**head in the forums who doesn't know what they're talking about. Race jokes are funny when there is no intent, especially if it is your own race saying it about themselves ( I've worded that wrong but, oh well). There are jokes about whites and blacks in here, so someone open minded shouldn't complain.I gave it 10/10 to negate the 1/10 votes that the non-viewing haters have given it. Cast your vote today and beat the haters!",White Chicks
316,nrthrd2000,Favorite comedy,10,22 October 2021,"One of the best comedies I can think of right now, just came on MTV Channel 331, watching it for 3 or 4th time (this time from the beginning) still good! Music is good too. Highly recommended. I don't usually watch comedies.",White Chicks
317,Steve-2448,What a joke,1,17 January 2006,"Without doubt the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The plot (if you can call it that) is totally lacking in originality, the acting is totally lacking in credibility, the comedy is absolutely awful. This film is not racist, it is not clever enough to be so. Even racists who are disgusting are not as stupid as this film. I'm not sure what the Wayans have done in the past but surely they have no future. Part, but not all of the problem is that the Wayans have to big an involvement in the film. It may have been improved if it had been directed by A N Other, but understandably nobody else would have put their reputation on the line for this rubbish. Having read other peoples reviews I understand that I am in the minority (at least in this forum), but I am entitled to my opinion. If you are in any doubt about my judgement, watch it and make your own mind up, but don't say I didn't warn you.",White Chicks
318,quartmason2002,White Chicks,10,8 January 2006,"I saw the movie 10 times and it remains my personal third favorite movie of all time. It's full of laughter and fun. Exactly what we need in movies. To the Wayans, keep up the great work. I love them in Scary Movies. They have certainly done wonders with movies. In these days when we all are trying to get things that are considered offensive out of our movies, gotta ask..how can they get away with it? White Chicks remains very offensive because of one major thing. If it is illegal for whites to go in black face, how is it legal for blacks to go in white face? But I would have to say this, as long as it is a movie like ""White Chicks"" Who cares? Keep up the great work and I'll forever be a major fan of the Wayans.",White Chicks
319,gatxinha,Excellent movie! I was surprised!,9,12 February 2006,"I was expecting the typical kind of movie, like ""police goes undercover, police falls in love during undercover, lover doesn't want police agent, they end up together"". Although I wasn't wrong on this point I was surprised by this movie, because it isn't one of those movies that are so predictable, that may be funny, but end up being boring. I laughed until I couldn't take it no more! I had so much fun I could watch it over and over again. As to the comments about racism, I didn't find any racism on the film. I loved it! What I loved the most are the too main actors. Aside from being really good comedians, they are really handsome & good looking! And the coolest part is that they are really brothers in real life! :D I really recommend this film, if you want to have lots of fun!:)",White Chicks
320,shelloneill-29204,Soooo funny!!,10,20 February 2019,"Look this is the kind of movie where you're not supposed to read into the fine details of things, prosthetics are bad but I think that makes movie even funnier! One of my all time favourites. Great laugh for a lot of the move!",White Chicks
