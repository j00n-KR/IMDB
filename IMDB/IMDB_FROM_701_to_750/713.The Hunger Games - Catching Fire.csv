0,MartinHafer,"If you loved the first one, you'll love this one...",9,6 March 2014,"When I went to see ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", the audience's reaction was very strange. They were angry--angry that the film ended because they really, really wanted more! The film picks up soon after Katniss and Peeta successfully survive the games. Now, they are to be wined and dined and trotted out from one publicity appearance to another. However, the President (Donald Sutherland) is angry and exactly why, Katniss doesn't understand. All she knows is that he insists that she act happier, act like she is in love with Peeta and do NOTHING to make waves...or people she loves will die! What she doesn't know at first is that throughout the world, discontent has broken out since her victory in the games--and folks see her as a person to rally about, as she is a symbol of hope. So what do you do when you have a symbol of hope? You destroy it--and the President orders a NEW game to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the games...and this game will return Katniss and Peeta to the arena to compete against 22 other Hunger Games winners! It sure seems like certain death! By the time I saw this film, a zillion other people already did. So I won't discuss the plot any further nor will I offer than in-depth a review. Suffice to say it's a very high quality film just like the first. So, even with a different director, it carries on perfectly from the last. Excellent acting, action and a wonderful plot make this one worth seeing.By the way, if you are older, you might notice that there is a huge similarity between this film and the original ""Rollerball"". Both present a world where the leaders want to destroy hope--and in both cases, a hero arises who somehow manages to overcome this nihilistic and fatalistic fate. See them both and you'll see what I mean.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
1,TheLittleSongbird,Superior sequel but never really ignited my fire,5,5 February 2017,"As said with the first 'Hunger Games' film (which had its plus points but didn't do much for me), the books are fun, scary, thrilling and moving though because being so rich in detail and characterisation they are difficult to adapt.'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is a bigger and somewhat better sequel, but also could have been much better. It underwhelms as an adaptation still, with the basic details there but in need of more depth (not as badly as with the first film though), but again it's more problematic on its own. Not an awful film (neither is the first) but considering the talent and source material, there was real potential for it to be really good, and it doesn't quite do that.Starting with the good things, most of the acting is fine. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Katniss, and she is brilliantly supported by Donald Sutherland and the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann bringing first-class villainy. The action is more exciting and tense and much less hindered by the hasty pacing and frenetic editing that marred the action in the first 'Hunger Games'.Generally (apart from some dodgy special effects) the production values are slicker and even more ominous, the dystopian feel as nightmarish as ought. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there is more jeopardy and intensity, if happening quite late into the film.However, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is crippled by an overlong and far too stretched running time, and sadly the material is not consistently interesting enough to justify it. The film does take too long to get going with a very draggy and uneventful first hour, before becoming more action-packed and tense halfway through where things really pick up. Then it comes crashing down again with an ending so abrupt that it feels like the film was released incomplete.Once again, the writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time. The relationship between Katniss and Peeta is still marred by anaemic chemistry and Josh Hutcherson failing to inject any charisma or life to his role. The scary intensity on the whole of the story is still lacking, as well as any insight on social commentary or satirical edge, too much of 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' still feels rather tame and undernourished, and despite better production values the direction is sloppy and often feels uncertain in the early parts.In summary, bigger and slightly better but never really ignited my fire. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
2,Leofwine_draca,"A terrible film: overlong, badly acted, with a cheap rip-off storyline",2,11 January 2016,"I didn't think much of the first HUNGER GAMES film but nonetheless I was interested to see how this sequel, CATCHING FIRE, held up. The answer is that it's even worse than the first film, a pointless retread of the first film's storyline that bears more than a passing resemblance to the two Japanese BATTLE ROYALE movies.Once again an ultra slow pacing and ultra lengthy running time combine to make this a near unwatchable slice of boredom. It's incredible that in the whole first hour and a half of the film absolutely nothing happens other than to set the scene and the mood. It becomes instantly apparent that more care was taken with the incessant costume changes and scenery rather than the calibre of the script or the acting, because both are truly mind-numbing.Eventually the action kicks in towards the end of the film, but it's all as uninteresting and CGI augmented as you'd expect; the 12 certificate just isn't right for a film with this subject matter. Jennifer Lawrence remains a bland and wooden presence as the protagonist, and Josh Hutcherson is even worse; at least newcomers like Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin bring a little charisma to their parts. In addition, one of the most unforgivable things about CATCHING FIRE is that it has no ending at all, just a plot development that leads to the next in the series. It's a real cheat.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
3,SnoopyStyle,Good improvement from the first,7,3 December 2013,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are home after winning the Hunger Games. Katniss is sparking some rebellious acts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is desperate to reign in the opposition by co-opting the Katniss-Peeta relationship. Only they have barely spoke in the last 6 months, and she is still with Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Snow forces Katniss and Peeta to fake their relationship, and institute a winners-only 75th Hunger Games as a way to maintain control.I've never read the books. Looking at only the movies, this is a good improvement over the first one. Katniss and Peeta are more developed characters. Their relationship has a lot more color. It is the emotional content where most of the improvement has occurred. The most interesting new character has to be Johanna Mason (Jena Malone). She adds a bit of wild energy to the movie.The production value takes a small step forward. The apocalyptic sets are still looking too sparse. The bigger CGI settings still has an older iteration feel. I like the monkeys, and the birds scenes. It's a good improvement from the last games. Overall, this movie is a good step up. It actually makes me looking forward to the next movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
4,Hitchcoc,OK! You Got Me!,8,3 December 2013,"I was pretty indifferent to the first film. Because I wasn't on board with the younger people who have embraced the books, I felt kind of empty when I saw it. One small criticism is that the characters don't seem to have much say in what happens to them. Because they are viewed so closely, they can't even plot against the evil forces that have brought them to where they are. What I failed to take into account is that this is a three-book series and needs to be viewed as such. While I found the sequel really talky at times, the constant barriers being put forth by the forces in power, absolutely drain us as we hope for the best. The hardest thing for me to deal with is that only a single survivor can be had. This forces alliances and betrayal (much like most reality shows but with much more dire consequences). The saving grace for HG2 is that the characters are so much more interesting. They have become more human with human feelings, despair and love. I must have liked it because every time I saw that emcee with his white teeth flashing, I wanted him dead. The same with Donald Sutherland who reminded me of the James Bond character with the kitten. So, there go my emotions of revenge. Had a group of people not brought me to this film, I would probably have not bothered with it. Now, I will definitely see the next one to see how everything shakes out.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
5,Horst_In_Translation,The first sequel is already one too many,4,21 June 2017,"This is ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", the biggest box office success from the year 2013 (five years old next year) and the second of four films from the Hunger Games franchise. Even if it did not get in at the Oscars for anything, it managed a pretty decent deal of awards attention, including a Golden Globe nomination for the British band Coldplay. The director is Francis Lawrence, a prolific and successful music video director, and he returned for films 3 and 4 as well. The script is by the Oscar-winning writers from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"". But given these names and their successes, the screenplay is quite a disappointment. I must say I have not read the books here or seen Battle Royale that many compare it to, but as a creative achievement the movie comes incredibly short. While running incredibly long as this film almost makes it to the 2.5-hour mark. And in the center of it all is young American actress Jennifer Lawrence, who reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen. I must say I enjoyed the first film a lot, but I still felt that her casting was a gigantic error that kept the franchise from becoming something special. Then again, I do not like Lawrence in anything really I have seen her in and this certainly also includes her Oscar-winning performance. Incredibly overrated actress and the world finally starts beginning to see. She is a poor man's Renée Zellweger at best and Zellweger herself is pretty limited too.Back to this film here, the good thing is that Lawrence does not show one face expression as usual, but maybe 2 or 3, which is still not very much for a 2.5-hour film. But as bad as she may be, the script is even worse. Subtlety is a complete stranger to the writers here and the argument that the world the characters live in lacks subtlety altogether is not a valid explanation. It is fun though how the film tries to be as shocking as possible with one demonstrator being shot in the head early on, but the curtain closes right before we see it, so they can still get these 13-year-olds into theaters. Besides that, there is not much to the characters in here. Talented actors like Harrelson, Tucci, PSH (rip) and Edgerton are pretty much wasted because they would take away too much attention from Miss Lawrence. One third into the film, the writers apparently realized that they had no more material/ideas to elaborate convincingly on the aftermath of the first film anymore, so what do they do? That's right! Let's just have another Hunger Games edition right now. Who cares if this turns into a repetitive uncreative version of the first film then. And that's what it does. Apart from the fact that the rest of the film looked a lot like an episode of Survival Island with some (not so) special sci-fi effects added to it. It's basically nothing here but showing us how courageous, headstrong, yet vulnerable Lawrence's character is while the actress does not have 10% of the talent to make it look credible.Finally, the last shot with Lawrence looking straight into the camera makes obvious that there will be a third film because the ending is on a cliffhanger and Lawrence and Lawrence would return for another installment. This is really disappointing, but what can you expect and can you really blame them with millions of people heading to cinemas despite the abysmal quality at times in this film. There is nothing refreshing or new in here and attention to detail or even love for movies and cinema is something I did not see in here at all. The occasionally entertaining moments of the supporting cast (especially the once again unrecognizable Tucci) just cannot make up for all the lengths and everything that is wrong with this film. I very much recommend you not to watch it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
6,claudio_carvalho,"In the End, the Beginning of the Revolution",7,1 March 2014,"The Machiavellian President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears an uprising and he threatens Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) to force her to create a distraction to the Districts with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson); otherwise he would kill her family and friends. However he plots with Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to summon the winners of The Hunger Games to participate in the Third Quarter Quell that happens every twenty-five years. Each of the twelve Districts would deliver two winners to the game and in the end only one will survive.. Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) advises Katniss and Peeta to form alliances to survive and they team-up with Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Mags (Lynn Cohen) in the beginning of the deadly game and the revolution. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a great sequel of ""The Hunger Games"" (2012). The dangerous saga of Katniss and Peeta has a surprising plot point in the conclusion with the scheme for the uprising disclosed by their mentor Haymitch and by another unexpected character. Unfortunately the first part of the sequel will be only in November 2014. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos Vorazes: Em Chamas"" (""The Hunger Games: On Fire"")",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
7,nogodnomasters,MUST BE A FRAGILE SYSTEM IF IT CAN BE BROUGHT DOWN BY A FEW BERRIES,10,13 May 2018,"As it turns out the Hunger Games was not berry good for the empire as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has inspired hope and rebellion. Instead of just killing her, they have changed the rules ( see Jonathan ""Roller Ball"") and devised a new Hunger Game of past contestants. The game is stacked against her as contestants must battle the elements more than each other.The beginning of the film lacks the crazy action of the second half, but it is theme driven for the true sci-fi fan. Katniss is a hero, but as she says, ""By killing people."" In those 3 simple words. Katniss who suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, conveys the perplexity of war heroes with a moral conscience. The film also touches on the power of celebrity as they ""never get off this train: and the trouble they cause if the don't ""stick to the script."" The culture is set up similar to the Roman Empire where bread and circus' s keep the masses in check and where Romans ""Eat to puke and puke to eat."" Katniss, is a hero because her compassion expresses in all of us the person we want to be. As such it is easy for her to gain allies.The film contains all the elements of an ideal cult classic complete with theme, special effects, drama, top stars, and a touch of light humor.I do not recommend watching this film if you haven't seen the first one (or read the books) as it doesn't recap.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
8,kosmasp,The same but better,7,6 June 2014,"I only have read the first book of the Hunger Games, but seen both movies. The first movie had to be restrained and was compared to a Japanese movie (not without a reason). While this seems a bit like a rehash of the same, it is way better in execution. It's still a bit too long and has some issues, but the comedy bits do work in its favor and there seems to be a switch in pace.Twists aside (which should actually be apparent), most will be looking forward to the conclusion with the third book getting released too. Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) the third book will be getting the split movie treatment. Until then (and lets hope it won't be the same again, because they will get out of options with doing it again ... and again), enjoy this and Jennifer Lawrence in it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
9,gavin6942,Excellent Sequel,7,16 March 2014,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
10,lee_eisenberg,the messenger cannot be allowed to continue,7,4 August 2014,"First, I should note that I had never heard of the ""Hunger Games"" books until the first movie got released. I did eventually see the movie and found it to be a good one (so realistic that it seemed redundant). The sequel continues the story, showing how Panem's rulers feel threatened by Katniss's popularity among the oppressed populations and try to co-opt her. One scene in particular looks exactly like something out of Coliseum games in ancient Rome.""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" turned out to be Philip Seymour Hoffman's last movie released before he died. His portrayal of the dynamic Plutarch Heavensbee shows him to have been one of the greatest actors of his generation. While this movie is not a masterpiece, I still recommend it. I'll be eager to see the next two installments.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
11,jboothmillard,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,9,3 December 2013,"The first film based on the popular three part book series was as I expected a big deal, thankfully it was not cheesy and lame like the Twilight saga, and from the trailer and highly positive reviews I was looking forward a lot to the follow up, from director Francis Lawrence (Constantine, I Am Legend, Water for Elephants). Basically in the dystopian future world of Panem, a year after surviving the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Silver Lining Playbook's Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are required to take the victory tour in the country, starting home in District 12, President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) says that their romance inspired the district rebellions. The President wants Katniss to convince everyone of their actions, the threatened suicide together, was because of love, and that they still love each other very much, but she cannot help but still be haunted by the memories of young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) from District 11 who she tried to protect, and anyone who whistles the signal she called and holds their hands up in the three-finger salute will be punished by death. Mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) says that this ""act"" of love they have is going to have to continue for the rest of their lives, and Katniss is the one who has to announce an engagement at a party, but returning home she also warns close friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth, Chris's brother) that President Snow has threatened to kill their families, he winds up punished by whipping after attacking a Peacekeeper, part of a group in District 12 cracking down. Snow next announces Panem's third Quarter Quell, a special 75th Hunger Games event, it happens every twenty five years and sees previous victors compete again as tributes, Katniss, being the district's only female games survivor is first chosen, and Haymitch is the second, but as predicted Peeta offers himself to take his place, and they are both sent immediately to training without being able to see their loved ones to say goodbye. Katniss is ready on the platform to enter The Hunger Games, she is forced to watch friend Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) beaten before leaving, and entering she allies with District 4 players Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and elderly Mags (Lynn Cohen), and after Peeta is shocked and made unconscious for a moment they realise they are trapped by an invisible forcefield. The next thing they know a strange fog comes in, and they find it is poisonous when hideous puss boils develop on their skin, they run from it but cannot escape it, until Mags sacrifices herself, allowing Finnick to carry and save a revived but weak Peeta, and when the fog disappears they find that the painful sores can be removed with the water of the lake. Following some rest, when sunlight rises they are surrounded by apes, they turn out to be savage and murderous and the group run for their lives again, Peeta is saved again when a drug addict and camouflage expert sacrifices herself, it is when they reach the shore and beach that they meet intelligent District 3 tributes Wiress (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer) and Beetee (Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright), and female tribute Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) from District 7. They find that the centre of the area is shaped like a giant clock, each hour represents the next attack, like the fog and apes, they will face, President Snow watching them realises what they know and spins the clock to stop them working out the correct hours, and in doing this Wiress is killed, the tributes do however remember the tree that continually has lightning strike it, they plan to use the electrical surge on the next strike. Using a wire and electrocution they kill Brutus (Bruno Gunn) and Enobaria (Meta Golding) from District 2 and outside the alliance, the wire snaps and Johanna attacks Katniss, removing from her hand the tracking device they all carry, and unable to find Peeta at the tree Katniss uses the remaining wire, attaches it to her arrow and fires into the above forcefield, the next lightning strike destroys the arena. In the end Katniss wakes up with the unconscious Beetee, and she finds Haymitch, Finnick, and the head gamekeeper Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is rebelling against Snow, Johanna and Peeta have been taken by the Capitol, she is angry that Haymitch did not protect him as promised, Katniss is sedated by Plutarch and wakes up days later with Gale next to her, he tells her that her family is safe, but District 12 has been destroyed. Also starring Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, Willow Shields as Primrose 'Prim' Everdeen and Paula Malcomson as Katniss' Mother. Lawrence again proves herself a capable and fantastic actress being feisty and fascinating, Hutcherson gets his moments trying to convince everyone of their possibly actually real relationship, Sutherland gets a little more time on screen and proves a mean bastard, and many of the supporting cast members such as Banks, Hoffman and Tucci do well also. I was surprised to see the critics giving this five out of five stars, but it absolutely deserves it, it has better special effects, the potential love story develops a bit more, the chase and death sequences are more exciting, the song ""Atlas"" by Coldplay in the end credits is good, and fans of the books and high octane kind of films will not be disappointed, a fantastic futuristic action thriller. Very good!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
12,Tweekums,A gripping second instalment,9,18 February 2015,"After the events of the first Hunger Games film Katniss and Peeta have returned home to District Twelve but as victors they have an obligation to go on a tour; visiting the other districts before heading to the capital. As they travel Katniss notices a feeling of rebellion amongst the people; President Snow has noticed it too and he sees Katniss as the person who gave people the belief that they could stand up to the Capital thanks to her behaviour in the games. He decides that she must die but first he must stop the people loving her to avoid making her a martyr. To this end Plutarch Heavensbee, the man now running the games, proposes a special Hunger Games to celebrate its seventy fifth year this time the competitors will all be previous winners. As Katniss is the only female winner from District 12 she is guaranteed to compete again. Once again Peeta ends up fighting alongside her and once in the game they make allies to defend against the more dangerous competitors but they know alliances can't last and there are other dangers that could kill them just as easily as the other competitors.Having enjoyed the previous film I was wondering how they would build on that story without being repetitive. No time is wasted explaining what went before so one definitely needs to watch the first film before watching this. We are quickly reminded of the hardships of living in the districts and of the brutality of the authority in the capital. Once the game starts the tension inevitably rises and even though one can guess Katniss will survive one can't help fearing for her safety and that of her friends. The ending is also quite different; her method of survival is different and obviously sets things up for the next instalment of the story with a twist that I didn't see coming. Jennifer Lawrence continues to do a fine job as Katniss and while the characters of the other competitors aren't as well developed that doesn't mean they are boring; in fact they have to remain a bit of a mystery if we aren't to know if they can be trusted. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is nicely threatening as Plutarch Heavensbee; even more so that Donald Sutherland's President Snow. Like 'The Empire Strikes Back'; another famous second instalment, this concludes with things not looking good; the Capital is crushing any perceived threat and Katniss has been separated from Peeta fans will certainly be left keen to watch the next film: Mockingjay Pt 1.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
13,BA_Harrison,Takes some swallowing.,4,26 May 2014,"Nasty President Snow (Donald Sutherland) isn't very happy with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), joint winners of the 74th Hunger Games, whose behaviour has promoted rebellion in the districts, so he fiddles the rules to get them back into the arena where he hopes that this time they won't make it out alive.Admittedly, I'm probably one of the few people to watch this film without reading the book first, but I hold the firm belief that any film should stand on its own merits without the need to 'gen up' on the story and characters beforehand. Sadly, unless the viewer is already familiar with the material, I reckon there's a good chance they'll be asking quite a few questions along the way.Nearly two-and-a-half hours should easily be enough time to satisfactorily explain matters, but certain aspects of the plot still left me puzzled (not that I'm advocating an even longer cut of the film to make things clearer—147 minutes was more than enough for me!). Despite help from both my wife and daughter (who HAVE read the books), I was frequently left scratching my head in bewilderment: If Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wanted to keep Katniss alive, why did he risk killing her with poison gas, mutated apes and a rapidly rotating island, all of which almost finish her off? With flash floods and poison gas attacks, wouldn't there be the possibility of every tribute dying at the same time? Why do the tributes bother forming alliances when they will have to kill each other sooner or later? Was Beetee's plan to destroy a mile-high dome by hitting it with a spear connected to a lightning conductor tree by a copper cable? Was it? Really?Just as I was busy trying to figure out the answers to these awkward questions (and others), the bloody film just stopped. Right in the middle of things. While I appreciate that the middle chapter in a trilogy has to end somewhere, they could have picked a better",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
14,Quinoa1984,probably my favorite of all the films,8,30 November 2015,"Francis Lawrence was somehow the best (or just a right) choice for this installment of the Hunger Games series - and it seems like he did a good enough job that the producers gave him the two parter of Mockingjay - and yet it is easy to see from I am Legend. Not a flawless film, but it showed a director who knew how to put someone we care about as an audience almost inherently (Will Smith, Jennifer Lawrence) in harms way of some really f***ed up scenarios. What's different from that film to this one is that the source material isn't changed around to fit something else, it's just kept to what the book was and how strong the story and action set pieces got underway. In other words, it's loaded with superbly staged action, characters that get fleshed out more than before (both heroes and villains and one that may be in-between), and the politics of it is striking. Yes, for a blockbuster like this it can get political.Catching Fire picks up a little while after the first Hunger Games ends when Katniss and Peeta won the game (yep, both of them, one of those last-minute things/twists but it worked). What sets this off well is a scene early one where Katniss is called in to the office of President Snow (Sutherland). It's still one of those scenes you remember well from this series, where it's all about intimidation, where Snow doesn't ask but tells Katniss she must act a certain way with Peeta on camera to ""convince"" the romantic angle, or there will be consequences (the way Sutherland responds to Katniss' ""I'll convince him"" with ""No, convince *me*"" is as sinister as acting can get). So the first part is watching Katniss and Peeta having to still put on a front of things to the world watching the winners, but also seeing how absolutely awful things are for people in the districts. And yet it doesn't seem that far off from something that could be seen in the real world: say, a badly-off urban area, or a militarized city, surrounded in fear and intimidation (except when there's rebellion, in some small and big gestures).All through this first part Lawrence is still acting in ways thats more about responding to people with looks, or downplaying what could be bigger emotions from any other actress. This works since she needs to save the BIG stuff once the story takes the major turn (though not something people will see as unpredictable due to the nature of sequels): there's an ANNIVERSARY hunger games planned, and it involves the past winners in a drawing... so Katniss is back in! It's from here that we get a sort of Hunger Games part TWO in the sense of seeing the games all over again and of course the thought is how they can do what they did in the first film better or different. What's surprising is if there was any thought that Lawrence couldn't direct this to top Gary Ross - it certainly wasn't difficult from a filmmaking stand-point.By this I mean that unlike the first movie, which was really an R-rated action movie edited down to PG-13 in a matter of how the cuts were jagged and unsettling (and not in any effective way), Catching Fire delivers really shocking action beats and moments of brutality, but nothing seems like it is cut or shot in a way that is disorientating or shot in a way that is 'off'. Lawrence gets these actors from one place to the next and yet finds time for people to sit down and have good talk. There's also the trap that could be easily fallen in to in a translation of this material, which is much smarter and sharper than the average YA lit of today but has the potential to slip into s***, but Lawrence and Hutcherson work really well off one another this time, and the additions of actors like Jena Malone and Jeffrey Wright take things up a notch: you believe these people more as people than should almost be conceivable for a genre piece.The other great addition here is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays Plutarch, a new game-maker chief (ok, not the most subtle name, but then how about Peeta or Snow). Like Sutherland he relishes in under-playing things at times, just delivering a look says enough than having to say extra things, but at the same time his presence as this guy who seems TOO smart in some ways, how he talks up things to Snow, makes him the most welcome addition in the film. It's actors like him and the others brought over from the first movie that sets this apart from other movies.There's high velocity thrills and kills, and you get some crazy special effects and even (yes) monsters (I still remember leeches at one point being a major threat in a mud pool or something). But it all comes back to the characters and the stakes in the time-frame for them, and most of all about the IMAGE that's presented. There's satire here, not really buried but on the contrary fully present and out there. In a way its obviousness is part of why it's kind of brilliant (if not like all-time great or anything, it's still got some sappy moments and a cliffhanger that is both devastating and kind of over the top); you know it's right here in society, but it's taken to another level in a way that takes from other science fiction stories in a fresh way.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
15,tavm,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a well worthy follow-up to its predecessor,10,4 December 2013,"Well, it's been more than a year since I saw The Hunger Games and really enjoyed it so when I watched this sequel with my movie theatre-working friend (who had seen it twice before and liked it), I was very glad I did! The stakes are higher this time as Katniss' actions in the previous one and her actions here really put Donald Sutherland's character in a bind he desperately wants to get out of. And Jennifer Lawrence is once again fine as the conflicted heroine who tries to survive against the madness she constantly has to deal with. This is modern epic storytelling at its finest with some of the best casting I've seen for a movie in recent years, that's for sure! So on that note, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is well worth the time!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
16,michaelRokeefe,Katniss Everdeen is caught in a trap.,10,23 December 2013,"What can I say besides CATCHING FIRE is nothing less than an upgrade on a grander scale of the first installment of Suzanne Collin's trilogy. Katniss(Jeniffer Lawrence), the winner and darling of the previous years Hunger Games, has lost favor of Panum's President Snow(Donald Sutherland),as he suspects her to be in the middle of a uprising against his heavy-handed totalitarian rule. Being the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games, Snow can call for a Quarter Quell, calling back past winning tributes from the 12 districts to participate in a ramped up game of televised human hunting. For publicity-sake, Katniss must continue her romance with co-winner Peeta(Josh Hutcherson). Repeat scenery and situations; and many characters, but this time more lavious and over-the-top. This sequel, as expected, comes across as even better than our first trip to the exaggerated world of the ""Hunger Games"".

18,zardoz-13,An Incendiary Sequel of Epic Proportions,10,7 December 2013,"An incendiary sequel of epic proportions, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" surpasses its pugnacious predecessor in a bonfire of startling plot shenanigans, compelling new characters, and spectacularly outlandish heroics. Enthusiasts of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy about archer exemplar Katniss Everdeen in a dystopian science fiction future where fascism has usurped freedom will be the only ones who won't be surprised by the blaze of melodramatic revelations. Nevertheless, judging by their approval, Collins' fan base is largely content with the filmmakers' loyalty to the source material. Presumably, the author's work as an executive producer ensured this heightened sense of fidelity. ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" scenarist Simon Beaufoy and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" scribe Michael Arndt have altered as little as possible in their big-screen adaptation. Meantime, ""Catching Fire"" qualifies as a lavish cinematic treat for the eyes with an enormous $130 million budget that eclipses the first film's meager $78 million budget. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutchinson, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprise their roles with renewed relish, while Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Sam Claflin provide fresh faces for the franchise. ""Catching Fire"" opens shortly after the original ended. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence of ""X-Men: First Class"") and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson of ""Red Dawn"") survived the 74th annual Hunger Games despite a last minute rule change and emerged as the triumphant tributes. Safely back in their Appalachia birthplace of District 12, our heroine finds herself face-to-face in the same room with despotic President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland of ""The Eagle Has Landed"") who is far from pleased with Katniss' poisoned berry bluff. Indeed, Snow is quite glacial about the outcome. Mind you, he compelled head games maker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) to dine on the same berries near the end of the first film. Meantime, Katniss and Peeta embark on a mandatory victory tour of the other eleven Districts with their chaperones, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland"") and the bewigged Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks of ""Man on a Ledge""), at their sides. In District 11, which dispatched 12-year old Rue, Katniss expresses her sorrow at her friend's demise. Katniss' sympathy ignites a riot, and the Peacekeepers, in their white body armor, snatch the spectator who sparked the unrest and kill him execution style with a bullet to the back of his head. Remember, this post-apocalyptic science fiction saga occurs in the remnants of America. Following the catastrophic ""Dark Days"" civil war, America has arisen from the ashes as the tyrannical kingdom of Panem. All power radiates from the Capitol, an ornate metropolis secluded somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. The architecture of this stronghold is reminiscent of the headquarters of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Ancient Rome. Panem serves as the name for this dictatorial regime, and the despots draw on the Latin catchphrase panem et circenses which means 'bread and circuses.' Essentially, Panem has created blood-sport games similar to the Roman gladiatorial bouts that unfold in a surreal arena where opponents battle to the death on an annual basis. A male and female tribute between ages 12 through 18 are selected from each of the twelve Districts to participate in this kill-or-be-killed death match. Unlike a conventional game where the action might lose its urgency, the games maker can conjure up obstacles that don't exist in the real worth to perk up the proceedings. They can either tamper with the weather or summon predatory creatures to keep the action interesting to audiences. Every time a tribute dies, a cannon blast erupts and an image of the deceased tribute illuminates the heavens. In ""Catching Fire,"" things have gotten worse. No matter where Katniss and Peeta travel, they witness widespread discontent, and Snow is seething with rage. He wants to execute Katniss, but new games maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman of ""Doubt"") assures him that Katniss can still serve the state in her capacity as a tribute. Rather than organize another Hunger Games with amateurs, Snow announces a Quarter Quell. Basically, this special version of the Games occurs every 25 years. Quarter Quell tributes are chosen from the victors of previous games. Meaning, these combatants aren't amateurs. They are survivors who killed and know how to kill. In District 12, Katniss is selected again, but former victor Haymitch is chosen over Peeta. Similarly as Katniss did in ""The Hunger Games"" when she substituted herself for her younger sister Primrose, Peeta substitutes himself for Haymitch, and our hero and heroine find themselves confronting considerably stiffer competition.Like its predecessor, ""Catching Fire"" clocks in just short of two-and-a-half-hours, but this sprawling saga never wears out its welcome. The villains ride roughshod over the heroes during a grim first hour that will challenge your patience. Then again, when the new games commence and the considerably ramped up combatants appear, ""Catching Fire"" rages like a four-alarm inferno. The scenes boasting savage Baboons are as memorable as Katniss' ability to shoot arrows. The obstacles that our heroes face are daunting. Unlike most movies of this kind, you need not linger for any extra scenes after the end credits unless you want to know that it was lensed on location in Atlanta, Georgia; Oakland, New Jersey; O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, California.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
19,grantss,"As bad as the first one, if not worse",3,30 September 2014,"As bad as the first Hunger Games movie, if not worse. The first one was also a vastly over-rated movie. Clearly meant for teenagers: trite romance; contrived, hole-filled plot; Disney-style happy ending. (Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie. In its current form it is boring and crap.This one has less syrupy, Disney romance, thankfully, but doesn't really replace it with anything substantial. There are stabs at intrigue and the idea of an anti-government revolution, but none of these really go anywhere. Everything is just padding before, and a set up to, the survival fight. So, it is just the same as the first one, really.If they had worked more on the anti-government stuff and not just made it all about some pointless action scenes at the end, it could have been an interesting movie.As I pointed out with the first movie, if you want a good, gritty, Last Person Standing / Survival of the Fittest-type movie, watch Battle Royale instead. The Hunger Games movies are neither good nor gritty.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"You feel the burn of effort, albeit it could be slightly brighter",8,21 November 2013,"The way the Hunger Games were won displeased President Snow(Sutherland, giving us yet another despicable bad guy), who threatens that the two ""star-crossed lovers"" will have to serve as distraction - to stop the growing rebellion in its tracks. When Gale(Hemsworth, who now gets to take breaks from brood and charm to show what those traits are hiding) hears of the unrest, he is determined to aid it. As more US police - I mean, Peacekeepers(with a redesigned armor that renders them similar to stormtroopers... and I mean Hitlers' as well as The Galactic Empire's) are stationed in the districts and Peeta(Hutcherson, who has time to be more than a somewhat weak, if likable, puppy-dog for our heroine) and Katniss(Lawrence, who drives this ahead with intensity and strength - and shows that when allowed to, she can let her guard down, and there is more to her than prematurely being forced into the role of provider) have to make a fateful decision - will they encourage it? Perhaps even... join it?As a sequel, this does just about everything right. Acknowledging everything in the first(which this outdoes in most ways - the only thing that remains better at is that it didn't omit as many vital details from the source material; frankly, those that go into this without having read the book, or at least a synopsis, will scratch their heads at some pay-offs that were never set up, and the ending half-introduces a key aspect which is literally outright incomprehensible) whilst changing the style slightly, nearly completely eliminating the shaky-cam, not only furthering our returning characters but also developing new and old alike, pulling them out of the purgatory of being relegated to mere archetypes. Right from when you meet Finnick(Claflin, an arrogant ladies' man) and Johanna(Malone, abrasive and snarky, could not give less of a crap), you know who they are as people. Every role is well-cast, and everyone steps up to the challenge of their roles having grown as people and/or been extended.Having to include a lot of details and thematic complexity from the novel(which wasn't confined to a 135 minute running time, not counting end credits), this has numerous little moments that say a ton about what they represent a tiny glimpse into - such as the leading girl's PTSD-like state and various interpersonal relationships, including the much-feared love triangle(that, though expanded, is not focused too much on). While the unfortunate traits of the middle chapter of a trilogy are present, they are easily forgiven. Some cartoonish villainy does detract from an otherwise highly credible depiction of a dictatorship. The world feels real, lived-in over designed, and you are mercilessly placed in it - the arena genuinely capturing the unnatural, lethally crafted and unpredictable quality that it evokes in the written original. Sudden stings of heartbreaking events keep the action-less portions from ever growing stale, and they avoid being cheap tricks by always being followed up on, not being false starts.There is a lot of brutal and disturbing content, and a little blood and violence(pushed far for a PG-13) in this. I recommend this to any fan of satire and survival drama. 8/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
21,view_and_review,Closer to the Book,7,27 August 2014,"One thing I will give Catching Fire credit for is being more akin to the book. Of course, movies will always have limitations books don't have and vice-versa, but this movie did a fairly good job.Although I liked Hunger Games better, both the book and the movie, this movie was a very close second. The conflict in this movie was the same but different. The Capitol and President Snow are still the enemy, the various districts are still oppressed and the Hunger Games make another appearance, but that's where the similarities stop.The ante has been upped by both the Capitol and the districts. In other words, both sides have a lot to lose this time around with the Hunger Games. I like how Suzanne Collins seamlessly and neatly wove in another Hunger Games with Katniss and Peeta being thrust back into them. It is a solid, solid second installment, just not quite as good as the first.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
22,neil-476,A good second episode,8,29 November 2013,"Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark go on tour around The Districts following their victory in the 74th Hunger Games. It is clear that Katniss has become a symbol of hope to the downtrodden everywhere, so President Snow determines to stamp out hope by populating the 75th Hunger Games with previous victors (all of whom believed that winning meant that they were forever out of the running). Things do not go according to plan, for anyone...After thoroughly enjoying the first movie, I read the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Despite being more Old Adult rather than Young Adult, and male rather than female, the post-apocalyptic dystopia trope is one I have enjoyed since I first started reading science fiction in 1960, and I greatly enjoyed the often unpleasant and non-heroic protagonist, a refreshing change. The film preserves much of this albeit some of the edges are, perhaps necessarily, softened. Jennifer Lawrence continues to do an excellent job of portraying this character.The film adapts the book quite well, introducing us to more of the behind the scenes intrigue, showing us more of this world and then dropping us into the preparation phase leading up to the Games themselves, so like the ones we have seen before and yet so different. There is much in this part of the story which is unexpected, particularly in character dynamics and relationships. There is more blood in the action sequences than was the case in the first film.I have two reservations. One, Josh Hutcherson joins Daniel Radcliffe as child actors who have matured into adults where, for heroic roles, their diminutive stature is distracting. And, two, Katniss has changed from being a very able archer to being Legolas or Hawkeye, capable of quickfire reloading with pinpoint accuracy which, sorry, I don't buy. And that element of unrealism taints the need to suspend disbelief elsewhere.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The story didn't go where I wanted it to -- I was hoping all of the previous contestants who are called back to fight again would ban together to go into hiding, and they'd all be really good at it because they know how to survive.

24,ferguson-6,Remember who the Real Enemy is,7,24 November 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's quite clear I am not the target audience for Suzanne Collins' literary trilogy or the corresponding movies that are packing in the teenagers and young adults. Still, I'll admit to enjoying the first movie ... and being even a bit more impressed by this second entry. Having a female heroine that is young, strong, smart, loyal, and emotionally grounded is not just unusual, but also quite a welcome change of pace.Any uproar over missing/adapted elements from the source books can be chalked up to the young readers who haven't yet come to understand that a 2 hour movie cannot possibly relay all the details and imagination held within the written page. In fact, co-screenwriters Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael deBrauyn (aka Michael Arndt of Toy Story 3 fame) do an excellent job of balancing the numerous elements contained within the story: a fascist government, the off-kilter romances, family bonds, and the early stages of a revolution/uprising. This sequel features a new and much better suited director in Francis Lawrence, known for I Am Legend.What really makes this material click on screen is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Her Mockingjay becomes the symbol of hope for the many districts intimidated by the iron fist rule of the President, played by the menacing Donald Sutherland. Ms. Lawrence is an absurdly talented actress and is one of the rare few who can convey a multitude of emotions through facial expressions alone. Despite her prickly personality, the audience connects with her in a most positive manner.In addition to Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Sutherland, returning to the fold are Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (still lacking even an ounce of screen presence), Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (giving a bit more effort this time around), Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Paula Malcomson as Katniss' mother (seen recently as Abby in ""Ray Donovan""), Willow Shields as Prim, Liam Hemsworth as Gale (his most exciting scene is washing his hands), and of course the instant electricity and energy provided by Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Stanley Tucci as Caesar - two of the most colorful characters this side of 1970's era Elton John.New to this chapter are two of the finest actors working today: Philip Seymour Hoffman as game designer Plutarch Heavensbee, and Jeffrey Wright as ""Volts"" from the ""nuts and volts"" duo with Amanda Plummer. Jena Malone tries, but is miscast as Johanna, and Sam Claflin has a couple of worthy moments as Finnick. Two of the best additions are the frightening killer baboons and the Black Swan-style wedding dress. Both make eye-opening entries.There is much to like about this series thus far, but of course, one must accept it for the genre it represents. And fair warning - see the two Hunger Games movies in order ... or don't bother. Regardless of your take on this franchise - may the odds be ever in your favor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Director Francis Lawrence hits hard immediately as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are celebrated celebrities due to their counter that allowed them both to survive the previous Hunger Games. President Snow resents this and decides that to avoid a rebellion by the districts then every past Hunger Games survivor is to compete in the next Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss who is a figure of peace for the districts and the target for death for Snow. She defies the odds with bow in hand. Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta who must play off this forced romance for the public. Liam Hemsworth has more screen time but still unable to rise above being the district 12 boyfriend who is irritated with the whole Katniss / Peeta fiasco. Even getting severely flogged cannot render him beyond cardboard. Sam Claflin steals moments as an ally to Katniss. He starts out as an obnoxious portrait but eventually demonstrates his true colors especially when he loses a loved one during a poison fog. Jeffrey Wright and Jenna Malone play two mysterious gamers whom Katniss will have to decide whether to trust.

28,StevePulaski,The hunger for stronger material lives on,6,23 November 2013,"I'll be the first soul to admit the wait between the first Hunger Games films and its sequel wasn't a particularly grueling one, and I likely could've went another year without even giving much thought to the characters or the setup. The first cinematic installment was plagued by questionably unsteady direction, clearly diluted political and social commentaries, violence with little impact, sterilized emotion, and a female hero who appeared more as an archetype or a character on a pro-women propaganda poster rather than a character with practical motivations and a believable persona to her.I reassured myself that this kind of material could resonate with me heavily after watching Kinji Fukasaku's tremendous Battle Royale, a film that still stirs up controversy and one that finds its way in conversations about its similar contemporary The Hunger Games. But I'm beginning to learn that with film, and life, no expectations equate to no disappointments. Catching Fire is a modest affair, with occasional highpoints exploring the politics of a land's government and its inherently corrupt system, but is too often burdened by hokey instances of humor, eye-rolling dialog and emotional sequences, and dreary survivalist sequences that have the feel of a video game.We are reacquainted with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), last year's winners of the legendary ""Hunger Games"" along with her close-friend and sometimes-boyfriend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). At the beginning, Katniss is scolded by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) for her actions in the games because now, numerous districts are rebelling and civil unrest is prominent within much of the Panem community. Katniss and Peeta now embark on a district-wide tour, giving a speech about their victory and such, while trying to prepare for the next ""Hunger Games"" when everything seems to be in disarray. Katniss seems to be roadblocked by a love triangle with Peeta and Gabe (Liam Hemsworth), a strict government, and the thought that the world of Panem is on the verge of an implosion.The first half of Catching Fire is surprisingly strong with its examination of a narrow-minded government and further exploration into their devious actions. I was kind of shocked as to how much I was intrigued by the setups, as the first one scarcely captivated me. Writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt make the exploration more rooted in politics and social commentary, showing the consequences of Katniss and Peeta winning the last ""Hunger Games"" and the luxuries that come along with it. It would also be cruel to say that the series' new director Francis Lawrence doesn't come in at a critical time for the series as well. The second film is usually where the stakes become higher, the conflicts become deeper, and the characters become more fleshed-out and this challenge is one he handles very well. He also knows how to direct very spacious, complex landscapes such as the open wilderness and a massive Colosseum; something the original film's director Gary Ross struggled with, as much of his camera-work was shaky and unnecessarily unsteady.However, after about an hour of solid insight into the government of Panem, the film follows the relatively bland and tiring method of its predecessor by making its ""Hunger Games"" focus of the film nothing more than a survivalist video game of sorts. When it is discovered how exactly the chaos ensues and when certain forces will be summoned to attack, it reminded me keenly of how my friends and I use to play outside when we were children using our imagination that we were being chased by creatures of all kinds. I bring this up because the method Catching Fire uses to include these asinine features feels like the improvisational tactics my friends and I used as children. Now, it's a tactic I simply don't care for. It feels like run-of-the-mill fantasy filmmaking where things just happen and questioning them means you have far too much time on your hands.I suppose, however, I could deal with the film's frantic inclusion of various forces of nature compared to the onslaught of instances in this film that either don't belong or fall flat in their goal. Consider the scene when former ""Hunger Games"" victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Katniss, and Peeta are all in an elevator and a woman comes in to request her dress be unzipped just so she can stand naked in front of the three to be the apple of Haymitch and Peeta's eye. Or how about the scene when an accident is almost fatal and Peeta and Katniss need to relish their existence once more by holding each other and crying in the wilderness. The scene falls completely flat because, believe it or not, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson don't seem to have the emotional aspect of their acting down. Many of their movements are shockingly cold or just have the inability to provoke sympathy. And let's not forget all of this is captured within the boundaries of a young adult novel.It's a no-brainer that those who love the Suzanne Collins' trilogy and the original film will be among the first in line to see Catching Fire and propel the film to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. This is a fact that cannot be challenged. After two of these films, both of which pretty similar except for the second time around things got off on a better foot for at least a brief time, I truly don't relish the thought of venturing out to see the series' conclusion twice in theaters. There's one more thing I can say positively about the film and that it's infinitely superior to the recently-released parody film of the series The Starving Games and, the more I think about it, the more I'd gladly venture out twice more to watch the series conclude than have to sit through five minutes of that film again.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

There is a whole lot of reasons they sighted but the biggest one is that the first film was not very good at portraying the symbolism of the book. This one more than makes up for that. This film is a long adventure into this saga. Without reading the books, I liken it to an adventure film that is twisted with plots and subplots with suspense at every turn. The cast all seems perfect for their roles. Young Jennifer Lawrence seems perfect for her role as Katniss. The love stories between her and other cast members seems to be very real. This film reveals this young actress as one who should have a very bright future in films.Donald Sutherland is an excellent choice in an impressive cast as the President.

It might spoil the plot for me, but the way Jennifer Lawrence fills the screen in this one, it will be a pure pleasure. This film is definitely that.

Its dystopian milieux strike as a resounding backbone to carry its social onus which is unusual to be seen among its peers. As the second part of the trilogy-turns-quartet (a lame strategy when shifts from the source novel to its cinematic adaption), CATCHING FIRE basically is an amped-up survival battle as its predecessor (with an elaborate overture to dovetail its storyline development), new helmer Francis Lawrence (I AM LEGEND 2007, 8/10; CONSTANTINE 2005, 7/10) barely achieves a middle-of-the-road tactic to fulfill his demanding task.Since I tend to divide movie from its source material, I am a piece of blank paper towards the plot and its characters' ominous destiny, so the great pleasure comes from newcomers (name- checking Sam Claflin and Jena Malone) in the series since it did pique my curiosity to know whether they will survive in the end, both actors are camera-friendly and vividly evoke laughters and empathy. So tracking back to the love triangle, Hemsworth's part is tapering down quickly meanwhile J. Lawrence and Hutcherson manage to breakout from their asymmetrical relationship, although judging from all levels, she looks like a big sister (and caretaker) to him, but which also accomplishes an unorthodox heroine and hero pair against all odds. Tucci and Banks are as excellent as they could be with their flamboyant antics, while veteran Sutherland and Harrelson are unequivocally underemployed as the antagonist and the mentor respectively, plus the new blood Hoffman doesn't seem to exhaust too much effort to accentuate the final twist. So it all strips down to Jennifer Lawrence's emotional curve out and out, save her swaying affections towards two boys, her awakening sense as a token of rebellion trudges through a laboriously-designed victories' tour, which also gives Katniss (passively though) a strong conviction what will become her goal in the chapters to come, the great part of the story has just begun! I watched it on an IMAX screen, and the effect is no more than satisfactory, during the game time, the CGI looks cheaper and faker than usual top-notch Hollywood output, the entire hue is also a shade darker in view of its 2D default, one can barely get the full idea what is happening during the high points. Brightness aside, the definition of the images is another disappointing factor. So maybe one crucial reason (my own conspiracy theory) is that the cinemas' apparatus is not equivalent between here in Shanghai and in USA, where it gained raving reviews, but as far as I am concerning, the technique bloopers are too blatant to overlook, markedly mar the movie for me, but I will keep as loyal as possible for the remaining two successors (both will still be under the tiller of Francis Lawrence), just because Julianne Moore is on board now as a key role, god bless the mockingjay!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
31,KineticSeoul,Still not into this movie franchise,5,6 May 2014,"I didn't like the first one, it just reminded me of a crappy version of ""Battle Royale"" with sci-fi and political stuff thrown in. This one isn't much better, well it's better than the first one but I just wanted it to end. The first half of this movie is about politics and how the tyrant government that is trying to ruin Katniss after she won the first tournament. Mainly because the government feels that she is becoming the symbolism of hope through defiance. I just wanted to get to the tournament, but it actually turns out the mediocre at best build up is better than the actual dull tournament that takes place in the second half. Even if everyone is on teams and they have their own skill sets and stuff. The development of the contenders are worst this time around as well. It does have a bit of emotion and slight elevation of interest near the very end. And I thought the message of how the rich become gluttonous, while the poor suffers and doesn't have much opportunities while the higher class become wasteful is done well in this sci-fi setting. Still not looking forward to the sequel though.5.5/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
32,Hellmant,Very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series!,10,27 November 2013,"'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, based on the book of the same name by Suzanne Collins, about a dystopian future where kids are selected (by a lottery) to compete to the death in a bloody arena, as part of a reality TV show aired for the public to see. Jennifer Lawrence once again stars as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta Mellark, the two survivors of the games in the first film. They've now inspired the beginnings of a rebellion, which scares the powers that be and in retaliation they're once again selected to compete in the 'hunger games', along with other winners from previous years. The film also once again stars Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland. They're joined by newcomers like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright and Jenna Malone. Francis Lawrence (who's previous directing credits include films like 'I AM LEGEND' and 'CONSTANTINE') directed this installment and Simon Beaufoy (who's previous writing credits include movies like 'THE FULL MONTY' and 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and Michael Arndt (who also wrote 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' and co-wrote films like 'TOY STORY 3', 'BRAVE' and 'OBLIVION') wrote the screenplay. I loved the first movie (it was my second favorite film of last year) and found this installment to be nearly as good. It's also my favorite movie of this year!Katniss (Lawrence) has now become a symbol of hope to the masses and is inspiring rebellions around the world. President Snow (Sutherland) is extremely threatened by this and devises a plan, along with the new head gamemaker (Hoffman), to have the contestants for the 75th Annual Hunger Games selected from previous winners, forcing Katniss and Peeta to reenter the games. Things aren't completely as they seem though as the film builds to a shocking conclusion and cliffhanger. This chapter very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series in that way. It's also much darker than the original film and revolves around an evil government retaliating against rebellious forces that caused some damage in the first movie (like 'EMPIRE' as well).Like the first film (and all great science fiction) the movie has a lot of great social commentary with parallels to modern life in the real world. This is one of the areas these films are the strongest at. This one, like the first, also has a lot of great action and spectacular visuals. It wasn't quite as moving as the original movie for me (although it has it's tearful moments) and is a little slower paced (for much of the first half of the film) but the last hour (containing all the scenes in the arena) is action packed and the ending is breathtaking. I thought the romance between Katniss and Peeta, and the love triangle involving Gale (Hemsworth) as well, really worked again and found myself once again really relating to Peeta (as he is the heart of these films). Lawrence is the action hero of the series though and now a full blown movie star. She totally shines in this movie (and has never looked better) and really makes it something worth watching. Like I said I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as the original but it's pretty damn close!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSU_hwOQSWQ",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
33,Robert_duder,The series continues and shines...for the most part,8,6 December 2013,"The first Hunger Games was an amazing beginning to the series. I had read the first book but I still haven't read the second so I don't know how that effects my opinions of the film. One of things I noticed nearly immediately was how much more political this film felt. The pacing is a little slower than the first because we are already introduced to the main characters but the world around them is the focus now and we really get to see more of what is happening in this Capitol controlled dysotopian future and in each district. This goes far beyond the games we discovered in the first film. There are some definitively disturbing scenes early on that really lay the ground work for the revolution that builds the rest of the series. Returning to the games was both exciting and a little old hat all at once. I have to give the film makers credit for actually giving us a whole new experience inside The Hunger Games without making it feel like its re-hashing what we've already seen. There a few things in the film (and perhaps they are lifted right from the book) but some things felt a little too deus ex machinima for me. I could have done without water that miraculously made their boils and heat welts vanish from their skin. The poison fog was one of the best scenes and the way they solved everyone being covered in boils was to wash them away. But that is one scene that does nothing to detract from an incredible political epic that had me riveted by the end. This series has gone from action epic to something with a lot more depth.To say Jennifer Lawrence has exploded into Hollywood is a gross understatement. She is everywhere and for good reason. She is a talented and versatile actress and she completely embodies Katniss Everdeen. Her rise from the slums of District 12, and wanting to protect her sister to a symbol of hope and revolution is captivating and she is so terrific at it. Her range of emotions in this film is really impressive and this would not be the same without her. Josh Hutcherson also returns as Peeta. In my review of the first film I expressed my concern that he wasn't quite up to par compared to Lawrence and this second film emphasizes that. He is good in the role but not great and there are times you will wonder why Katniss fights so hard to protect Peeta because he is dead weight in that arena constantly getting himself into trouble. Still he's part of the series now and he does alright, I just think he's consistently the weak link in the cast. Everyone I wanted to get more screen time in the first film gets exactly that in the second which made me very happy. Woody Harrelson's brilliant portrayal of Haymitch is a little more subdued this time around but definitely gets more development. Liam Hemsworth is still terrific as Gale and his star crossed relationship with Lawrence is outstanding and they have great chemistry. Donald Sutherland is better than ever as President Snow who is now completely Katniss' adversary. Effie Trinket who is absolutely meant to be annoying is even moreso in the sequel played by Elizabeth Banks. I think they are trying to make her relatable but she really is irritating. The new tributes we are introduced to are all very good and add a lot to the story including Jack Quaid, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Lynn Cohen and Jena Malone were some of my favourite performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast and he is a brilliant actor but his character is very back seat in this instalment. I supposed I expected more, I'm not sure why. I look forward to seeing where his character goes. I also have to mention Patrick St. Esprit who's character enters the story at a key moment in a very climactic fashion. However, St. Esprit overacts and actually comes across as campy in the role and its such an inappropriate and unfortunate spot for camp and he sort of drags down the scene. I am sure I am missing a few key players from this enormous cast but these were some of the major key roles I noticed for one reason or another. (I love Stanley Tucci in his role but its very, very brief this time around.) The Hunger Games series is fascinating because I really do believe it transcends just a youth's story about fight for her life. This has a lot of depth to it and it feels like the film makers in the first one and now this sequel are truly trying to make this series mean something. New to the director's chair is Francis Lawrence who has some terrific films with unique flare and style to his credit. I didn't quite see the level of darkness he could have brought to the story having seen his work in Constantine and I Am Legend but he absolutely knows the post-apocalyptic world and the way to really make things effective to the audience. He continues the story from the first but almost makes this one his own and that is impressive. Truly a terrific film and a worthy sequel that doesn't quite live up to the original but I'm not sure the book does either from what I understand. It is still entertaining, important and powerful in a number of ways and well worth your time to see both films in preparation for the third. (Terrific ending...albeit incredibly frustrating.) 8.5/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
34,Lejink,Hungry for more,6,16 August 2014,"As I only watched the original ""Hunger Games"" as part of a child-minding mission for my now 12 year-old niece, it figured that the only way I was going to willingly watch the sequel was when co-opted to ""baby-sit"" for her again. Hey, it's quite a long film so it keeps young Erin occupied for a crucial 2 and a half hours, but whisper it, like before, it's quite an enjoyable film.I don't know if its army of teenage followers completely get the allusions to the perils of totalitarianism, manipulation of media and the corruption of power, but Erin sort of did which has to be a good thing. Like many, I wondered how they could get Catniss and Peeta back into the arena after the conclusion to the last film, but this was skilfully done. Their disillusion with their new-found celebrity and its corruption by the powers that be naturally lead our feisty duo to rebellion and while there is the expected lengthy action inset where they bloodily battle royal with the previous champions, there's a good twist at the end setting up the next chapter which I'm sure won't be long in arriving.Yet again, the young actors in the lead roles acquit themselves very well indeed, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss. Athletic as she is, she is equally well capable of displaying the wide range of emotions her part requires of her. The senior support at her back add gravity and credibility to proceedings, the veteran (if that's the right word) triumvirate of the menacing Donald Sutherland, scheming (late) Philip Seymour-Hoffman and supportive Woody Harrelson all committing to their roles.Who knows, maybe I'll catch the next chapter without the excuse of my niece's presence, although on second thoughts it's better with her even to explain the complexities of the plot, character motivations and of course to anticipate particularly exciting or gory scenes before they occur.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
35,ThomasDrufke,Among the greatest sequels ever made,9,27 March 2014,"(Saw in theaters on opening day, reviewing after re-watching Blu-Ray) Let me preface by saying, I first saw the Hunger Games not knowing any characters and not caring much at all, basically forced into going. After the first movie I became very intrigued about what the sequels could be. I have not read any of the books but I now consider myself a huge fan. I didn't really have high expectations for the second one, but boy was I blown away.This movie is quite simply a masterpiece, and easily in the top ten all time sequels. To me it had the similar impact to The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back had on me.Impression- The trailers definitely had me wondering, and because I didn't read the books I was asking myself why are they being thrown back into the ring? There was a good explanation after all. It was the third quarter quell so on this occasion each of the existing victors are to be re-entered into the Hunger Games to battle for all the marbles. I really think this movie was much more well done than the first. Francis Lawrence did a fantastic job and I'm very pleased he will be back for the 3rd and 4th movie. This movie has one of the greatest tag-lines ever as well. ""Every revolution begins with a spark"". And really once you know what that means, you realize how awesome this book probably was to read. Sitting on the edge of your seat as you find out that Katniss was Plutarch's plan all along, she is the Mockingjay, and she IS THE REVOLUTION. I'm glad I didn't know about Hoffman's character twist, and it came as a surprise to me. There is so much good to this movie that I really only have one complaint....Complaints (minor) - It takes too long to get to the games. 90 minutes into the movie we finally see them in the arena. I would have liked to see much more character interaction in the arena instead of Gail-Katniss time. Besides that I don't think there's anything wrong with this movie.The whole film looks beautiful. I'm really glad they got rid of the shaky camera from the first, and that these games are more colorful and brighter. Come to think of it this may be Jennifer Lawrence's best performance. American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook are great but the emotional depth she brought to Katniss this time around is unparalleled. I cant imagine any other actress being this good as Katniss. This is truly one of the greatest sequels ever made and I don't know how they are going to top it.Overall its fantastic, and not as scary as the first so I can see more families enjoying this one. Not to mention it features one of the most bad-ass cliffhangers in film history. I loved the transformation of Katniss' face from devastated to wanting to kick Snow's ass. Loved it9.8/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
36,g-bodyl,Katniss Catches the World on Fire!,10,6 January 2015,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel to the pleasantly surprising 2012 hit, the Hunger Games. The basic plot is the same, but the stakes are higher. The social commentary is pushed across better this time around under the sure-handed direction of Francis Lawrence, who also made the right decision to forgo the shaky camera routine. The production design remain a highlight of the series and same goes for the costumes and makeup. Effie's wardrobe is weird, but very colorful. The film, especially when we get to the Games, is action-packed and some of those sequences are just breath-taking. Finally, the ending of the movie is a toughie because it has the best cliffhanger in any movie I seen in recent memory.Francis Lawrence, who takes over the director title from Gary Ross, continues the adventure of Katniss. After winning the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to the other districts, where people see them as a sign of hope and rebellion, much to the anger of President Snow. With the new gameskeeper Plutarch, the Capital decides to issue forth another set of Games, this time called the Quarter Quell with involves only previous Games winners. Once again, Katniss must rely on her wit, friends, and her bow in order to stay alive.Unlike many young-adult series, this film has perfect acting. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is pretty good as Peeta, though he may be the weakest link. Donald Sutherland makes a very creepy and evil Snow. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is a fantastic addition to the cast. Woody Harrelson, as usual, does wonders to give the film a few jokes. Elizabeth Banks is quite.....colorful as Effie. Finally, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are two key additions to the cast because they are essential members needed for the Games.Overall, the sequel is bigger and better than the first film. This is one of the best cinematic franchises in recent history, and definitely the best young adult franchise since Harry Potter. It's rare for these kind of films to receive such critical support. It helps that I love these kind of dystopian films and it doesn't hurt when there is excellent acting and a huge production design to speak of. I also love that new Coldplay song, ""Atlas,"" which is sung in the end credits. But that ending really has me itching for the Mockingjay films. The first film was excellent, but Catching Fire is beyond excellent. I rate this film 10/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

39,secondtake,Terrific and over the top good and also more of the same,7,2 December 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)Well, there is so much to be thrilled about here you can't just dis this movie as a rehash of the old stuff. It's epic and bizarre and tragic and inventive. It's funny and sad. It has some great serious and campy acting. And it carries on the plot and tradition of the first movie well. The repeat performance of Jennifer Lawrence is really good. She remains a convincing model and role model, a perfect mixture of humility, compassion, and strength when required.But way down at the bottom of it all, it does rehash old stuff. Yes, it progresses, but I keep remembering my starry surprise at the whole idea when watching the first movie. It was all so crazy and almost possible. It drew from powerful archetypal sources, from Roman gladiator battles to Nazi rallies to Native Americans surviving in the wilderness. And it was new and fresh every time. Not possible here, and I missed that a lot.Such is the problem with sequels. And yet that's part of the appeal of a sequel— a world has been created where the viewer enters already informed and invested (and in love, perhaps). You want to go back. So how do you keep the new installments alive? It was done with the Bourne movies, and Nolan's Batman movies. But it is only partly done here. Too much is familiar, and some is even a bit worn. The romances are merely continuations (the leading woman is a two-timer in a believable and touching way). The secondary characters are mostly familiar (Philip Seymour Hoffman is new but there is Sutherland and Harrelson, both terrific, and Tucci, who is a riot even the second time). The leads are of course the same, but they end up in the most familiar thing of all, the actual battle.And the battle, which is the whole last third of the movie, is the biggest weakness. We know who we want to win of course, and we don't know how they're going to pull off saving more than one hero. But it's a familiar mix of speed and luck and ingenuity. It's pure action adventure stuff, running and shooting and fighting, very well done and exciting, for sure. But it is what it is. I'm talking familiarities.What about the message here? The big theme is an autocratic militaristic government controlling so many lives, and an ordinary population where the people are wonderfully ordinary and sympathetic. The heroine feels she can do nothing to help and wants to leave with her local boyfriend into the wilderness. But she is called to action and she shows the power of not being selfish. A new Hunger Game scenario is set up and a visit to the big city with all the pizazz, and we see a sense of solidarity between Victors from previous games. The message is cooperation rules, and the games shows a little bit of the Avengers aspect, each fighter with their own power.It wasn't enough, somehow, but this is compared to round one. As a movie it was stunning in so many ways it wins anyway.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

As a stand alone story, it is lacking, which is why I am downgrading it to a 6.When the warriors get to the battlefield, it really feels like a variation on the TV show ""Survivor"".

I would guess any barely functioning ninth grader was their max literacy marketing level. Acting was robotic with actors chosen for eye candy appeal. Plot wise The Hunger Games ""starving"" comes from a lack of creative storytelling; just far-fetched improbabilities filling 3/4ths of film then to close with the same old ending we've seen before, i.e. brief, boring scenes of someone quickly (for budgetary reasons) dying. Even then you really don't see much of that person's finale - they just cheaply disappear. Even the lack of an ending/closure is transparent storytelling for profit.

44,ironhorse_iv,Hunger Games is indeed catching fire. It's red hot!,8,25 November 2013,"A lot of critics are now calling this movie, the Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games movie series because of the dark brutality our heroes have to go through. Indeed, this was a pretty dark movie for already dark young adult's novel. The controversial elements seems to die off a little bit, as first off, as the movie has no children killing children theme. Even the murdering is rarely done by the heroes. Instead, the movie focus more on the psychological effects of committing murder, the satire of reality media, conflict between interdependence/independence and fighting against brutality of totalitarianism. This movie is no way, a feel good movie, but it's watchable as the dark themes doesn't make it too depressing. As of a sequel, it was a lot better than the previous film, 2012's Hunger Games as its cut down on the shaky cam. The movie continues the story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the post results of her win of the previous Hunger Games events. That win has cause a spark into rebellion against the oppressive Capitol of Panem as people view her as a lady liberty type figure. Because of this, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) force her and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back into the arena in a special edition of the Hunger Games against all the previous winners of the Hunger Games. I have to say the movie follows the book 'Catching Fire' by Suzanne Collins almost exactly. Despite the film cutting a few things out of the book version such as no Bonny, Twill, and Darius. In my opinion, they weren't needed. One thing, they should had add was Katnis watching her mentor Haymitch's (Woody Harrison) previous victory video. Not only does it give depth to Haymitch's character and why he drinks, but how Haymitch and Katnis are more connect to each other then it seems. Not only that, but it foreshadows the ending because it shows that Haymitch use the arena's force field to his advantage. The whole force field attempt in the end was badly explain. The book does it better as it foreshadows it, with the mockingjay watch and the bread code. The changes, they add, really does make the story better like having the Games be first thing, rather than the long wait for it in the book. I like Effie's (Elizabeth Banks) big goodbye. The change emphasizes Effie's humanity, making her movie self-more sympathetic than Collins's cartoonish character. I like how Peeta can swim in this film version and fight out a bit more as it doesn't seem like he was such a dead weight like the last movie. Still, his character is still a one-dimension love interest like the last movie that stupid actions cause a lot of people's deaths. I love how the film shows Katnis post-traumatic stress disorder through the birds. Show, don't tell, at its best right there. New Director Francis Lawrence smartly adds more into that. Because the book is told from Katniss' perspective, I love how the director presented a more, human, multidimensional side to the villains by adding a granddaughter to Snow and putting more insight into the new gamekeeper Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) during the games events. The big twist in this movie is a bit out there. Without spoiling it, it's a bit odd for the people that secretly support the rebellion, to put Katniss in danger at first, only to later help her. It's like saying I will put you through hell by I'm doing this to save you. The logic doesn't make sense, because what if, she get killed because of you. Then you don't have your poster child for your little rebellion. Why couldn't the rebellion just rescue her before the special Hunger Games? The whole reason of having the special Hunger Games could had be prevented. It's not the film's fault, but the whole bad guy turn into good guy in the end of the movie cliché. I do like the other victors characters like Finnick (Sam Clifton) and Beetee (Jeffery Wright). The highlight for me is Johanna (Jela Malone). Malone nail it for me as the sexy vixen. Plus, how they did they find enough victors to represent all 12 districts if 1, 2, 3, 4 mostly wins? Another thing, I can do without is the CGI monkeys. It was awful. At less, it's better than the CGI dogs from the last movie. The violent is still pretty brutal here, but not as vicious as the last movie as less people are trying to kill Katnis in this movie. The problem with these victors is that they were presented as very good killers, but only a few want to kill her, due to all of them very angry at the Capitol. So it was clear that Katnis wouldn't be in that much danger in the games. The deaths in the film wasn't that emotional as the last movie. It's hard to beat, seeing an innocent kid die. I think the only part I cry in this movie was where Katnis visit District 11, the home of Katniss's deceased friend. That was pretty sad. People that compare this movie to 2008's Twilight, need to stop. This movie is smart. The way the film makes fun of reality television, indeed mirrors reality. We choose to expose ourselves to entertainment such as this movie without thinking for once how it visual metaphor, the inhumanities of our real world. I think as more, people really dig into the movie, the more, they can see that. I would put this movie and the books in the same level of George Orwell. Like smart works like George Orwell's 1984, Hunger Games foreshadowing a illustrating exactly where we are headed again, if things do not change for the better. This movie does a great job.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
45,The-Sarkologist,Not All That Enticing,4,2 February 2017,"Somebody suggested that the best way of becoming a successful author was to write a dystopian novel where a group of teenagers rise up and overthrow the established order. I guess that had something to do with a number of similar series of books taking the young adult market by storm, and this was one of them. I guess that is something that appeals to the teenage mind, being able to stand up against and challenge the adult world – it's something that teenagers, ever since the teenager was invented as a marketing concept, have aspired to. I also guess it is what has been fueling the growing animosity across the generation gap, especially with the baby boomers against the millennials, and with us Gen-Xers caught in the middle.Anyway, Catching Fire continues on from where Hunger Games left off, and I have to admit that like the first movie, this one wasn't all that inspiring. Katnis and peter are living in the Victor's Village in sector 12 and basically have everything that they want provided for them. However, they suddenly discover that as victors they still have jobs to do, and that involves traveling across all of the districts to promote the next Hunger Games. The problem is that Katnis' actions in the previous season has sparked off riots across a number of the districts, riots that Capitol is attempting to contain, through the use of force of course. The other thing is what to do with Katnis, because she has become a symbol for this rebellion, but they can't kill her because that would turn her into a martyr. So, they decide to throw another round of Hunger Games, but this one is a special one because it is the 75th anniversary since the first (of course), so this one has all the previous victors (or at least 24 of them) all sign up again, and as it turned out, each of the sectors, ironically, had two people win two of the last twenty four games.This made me roll my eyes, namely because it turns out that this is basically the first film all over again, except that Katnis and Peter have just gone on to the next level. Okay, they weren't supposed to have special games, which has sort of upset a number of the victors, but they decide to go ahead with it anyway. Then there is this whole thing with Peter – are they in love or aren't they because it comes out that Katnis is basically ignoring him unless they are on camera, and when they are on camera they are all lovey dovey and pretending to be this couple for everybody to admire.The funny thing is that these style of movies do tend to have the younger generation fighting the older generation – the older generation are tyrants and killjoys that are basically ruining it for all the younger people, and if the younger people where in charge then everything would be much better. I guess that is why older people tend to be conservative and younger people tend to be progressive – the older you become the more stuck in your way you tend to become. Actually, it is the younger people that tend to be the full on radical socialists who don't want to work and basically have the state provide everything for them – or simply want to get into politics to get a bit of the pie.Okay, I'm not really sure whether this film is supposed to be political, but I can see the ideas behind it, and I guess it is stories like this that sort of build these ideas in the minds of the teenagers that they should rise up and overthrow the established order. Honestly, I'm a progressive myself, but what we have here are stories making the younger generation believe that they know better than people that have been around for a much longer and have made mistakes that they have learnt from. Mind you, I'm not necessarily suggesting that we stagnate, but the thing is that instead of instilling the young with these ideas that they should go out and overthrow the establishment, rather they should have older heroes that are much more circumspect in challenging the dystopian present. Mind you, that concept probably wouldn't appeal to the young adult market.Oh, and as for the ending, well, once again it was pretty ordinary, and sort of came somewhat abruptly. Actually, they tried to do a cliff hanger, which I felt was really annoying, because it didn't seem to resolve anything, and Katnis' actions at the end actually made no sense whatsoever. Oh, and having all these people turn out to be rebels, and that there was an underground rebellion all along, it was just that they couldn't tell Katnis because, well, she couldn't keep a secret, and was too emotional, really made me roll my eyes. Anyway, it didn't stop me from going ahead and watching the next film in the series.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
46,Reno-Rangan,I just found it better than the first...,8,7 February 2014,"Whatever you say I am not a big fan of this franchise. I did not like much the first installment other than a decent entertainment. So this was another 'let it go' movie from me. But when the time came to see it, I was a little surprised of being better than the first. The second hour was good and before one was a mild slow. The real interest is the, follow-up movies from here on. The end of this part created a curiosity for the next movies of the series. Looks like it would be very interesting with big changes in story than first two.The movie series supposed to be a trilogy, but you know it tasted big commercial success that mean big buck in filmmakers pocket. In 2013 this movie was the highest gross from north America. So like 'Deathly Hollows' and 'Breaking Dawn' this franchise following the same path by breaking the third volume into two. Whatever, I am expecting the third and the fourth movies 'Mockingjay part I and II' would have more exciting than previous movies with many twists and turns.It was so sad to hear about Philip Seymour's sudden tragic demise. His best parts are yet to come in the next movies of the movie series. The franchise told they wrapped most of his portions of the last two volumes and now they decided to make minor changes in his character. That's good to hear, hope he it will be an unforgettable show from the great actor.The end scene before the credits roll the logo of 'Catching Fire' changes into 'Mockingjay'. It was awesome, I just sensed some great is ahead. So like teenagers, it interested me and created curiosity. Looks like I got reason to watch 'Mockingjay' movies.7.5/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
47,briancham1994,Best in the series,7,3 June 2020,"I think this instalment was the best movie in the series. It has the perfect balance of action and storyline. It expands the world with more backstory and characters, and the effects were better so it was more convincing and we felt like we were part of this world. The casting was quite fitting.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
48,tomgillespie2002,Left me wanting a satisfaction that I knew would never come,4,18 August 2015,"While 2012's The Hunger Games, based on the opener of Suzanne Collins' trilogy, was very much a collection of familiar genre tropes and felt like Battle Royale (2000) for the Harry Potter generation, its themes of class suppression by a ruling elite and the grumblings of a working-class revolution felt refreshing for a story primarily aimed at a younger audience, and also extremely relevant to our times when wealth is seemingly celebrated above all else. Following the first instalment is the awkward middle entry, always struggling to bridge the gap between a fresh new world and its inevitable final showdown. Catching Fire struggles where most other middle sections fail - it's essentially a re-hash of the first film, and fails to progress the story enough to warrant its 2 hour 20 minute running time.The movie makes a few key mistakes. Above all, it makes the terrible assumption that you've already read the book, failing to explain various aspects of the story which, although it doesn't confuse the rather straightforward plot, it left certain questions niggling in my brain. If the ultimate goal is to kill everybody you're lumped with and be the lone survivor, then why are teams of 'allies' forged by the game maker? What's really going on in the slums that we only glimpse in scenes of dusty faced onlookers? And are The Hunger Games, an event in which young members of the poor are plucked at random to inevitably die, really the best way to control an increasingly disgruntled majority? These questions aside, Catching Fire is also plain boring.Picking up shortly after the climax of the first film, where the bow-and-arrow-wielding Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) won the Hunger Games with her close friend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) after choosing to die together rather than one surviving, the two champions are left pondering the aftermath. Finding herself a hero to the enslaved working class, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) insists that she play her role and help maintain social order. Following a few incidents of rebellion, Snow decides that Katniss is a threat and turns to new Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) for council. His idea is to throw all the past victors of the Hunger Games into the event together, bending the rules in his favour by introducing a natural disaster or event every hour, including poisonous mist and killer mandrills.Despite Jennifer Lawrence's obvious star quality, Katniss comes across as one-dimensional and charisma-free, failing to justify her 'chosen one' status. Her budding romance with gruff district worker Gale (Liam Hemsworth), to whom she explains that her kiss with Peeta was merely a way to manipulate the audience into aiding her survival (although her feelings may be becoming real), feels like a discarded draft of Twilight. The characters are so robotic that I simply didn't care who lived and who died. Catching Fire ultimately feels like a way of stretching out a story that could have been told in two instalments, where, by the end, I felt like we were no further along than where we were at the start. The ending comes so abruptly that it's obvious the filmmakers are under the illusion that they're leaving us thirsty for more, but while that may be the case for its huge fanbase, it left me staring at the screen waiting for any kind of satisfaction that I knew would never come.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
49,zkonedog,Style Improves & Still True To Book,9,5 March 2017,"The first ""Hunger Games"" movie's popularity to each person ran roughly equal to their enjoyment of the written works. Essentially, how much you liked/disliked the book was exactly how much you liked/disliked the movie. With ""Catching Fire"", however, director Francis Lawrence actually turns in what may very well be a superior product to Suzanne Collins' tome.For a basic plot summary, ""Catching Fire"" sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back from their original Hunger Games experience now living on ""Panem's dime"" while on the promotional tour for the next games. When President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesn't like the symbol that Katniss may be turning into, he rigs the upcoming Quarter Quell (75th edition of the Games) with a special new set of rules unprecedented in the history of the event.While the first ""Hunger Games"" movie was impressive in its own right, I believe that ""Catching Fire"" is superior because it is a bit more ""versatile"". The original movie was very dark in tone and serious throughout. I have read all the books, so I completely realized that the tone is quite serious, but I really appreciated the lighter moments of ""Catching Fire"", those moments when I felt like it was okay to laugh or smile at something that was transpiring.The main cog in making the machine work is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Other great performances from characters like Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) are packed with subtle nuances all their own, but it is truly Lawrence who holds this whole thing together. Her screen presence alone is a force to be reckoned with. Even if her portrayal of Katniss is quite a bit different (at least physical) from how she is portrayed in the books, Lawrence has easily made the character entirely her own.Thus, while the first movie in this series whetted my appetite for more, ""Catching Fire"" satiated the hunger by mixing some brevity and wit into some deadly serious subject matter. It changes the style of the series-so-far while also staying pretty true to the source material.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
50,johnnyboyz,"No, this doesn't quite 'catch fire', but it is a solid piece of dystopian-set action film-making",6,18 September 2018,"How much you like ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" will depend heavily on whether you took to the first film - that is to say, if you did not, then you will curse having to sit through two hours or so here of what is essentially the same content retreated, if not entirely rerun. As far as I can care enough to ascertain, there are two major differences between this entry and its 2012 predecessor: firstly, the fighting arena has changed and now consists of a strange clock-like locality wherein various threats to all are triggered at specific times in order to make the contest a little more interesting; and secondly, the fighters involved are all former champions, so the stakes and intensity are increased.For the totally uninitiated, ""The Hunger Games"" unfolds in a cruel English-speaking autocracy which consists of various districts in what is either the far future or a parallel universe. The society prides itself on a kind of faux-patriotism, or po-faced ideas linked to national identity, which are connected to unparalleled honour to the state and its premier as well as its militaristic history and seemed to come out best (or worst) in various Communist societies throughout history: think Cuba or North Korea. At the peak of its powers, the Soviet Union was probably one of the most patriotic nations on Earth. The eponymous Games are a yearly contest whereby a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected at random from the aforementioned districts to fight until only one remains - is entwined with the essence of the characteristics that are meant to make up the core of the nation's citizens by Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), its President.Having been the one to have survived the slog of going through with this in the first film, the conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives a life in her village not too detached to that of what she would be doing anyway prior to the first film's events, but with this new-found (and thoroughly unwanted) stardom. Living it with her is Peeta, played by Josh Hutcherson, whose importance in Everdeen's life is that they were essentially 'joint' victors in the last edition after having come to resist duelling to the death and therefore disobeying the State's wishes. But whatever - they live because the twist made for great TV. Central to the previous film was the notion of what constitutes entertainment, and what violence does to a society and a person when it is compartmentalised for amusement or pleasure. In 1998's ""Small Soldiers"", a slimy business executive in charge of marketing action figure toys, whose sole purpose was to beat seven-shades out of one another, dodged the accusation that they were imparting the wrong ideas into the minds of the children that would play with them by pointing out that ""...it's not violence, it's action."" In Snow's world, a population's interest in the hunger games resemble the hordes' interest in our own for the latest smash-'em-up blockbuster or war themed video game. When it seems evident Snow can utilise the friendship Peeta and Katniss have for one another to burnish his own status, he realises he can keep a population in check and quell a rebellion - not unlike how reality TV and soap operas make for both quaint distractions and politically charged opportunities to force the average joe into thinking there's something wrong with them if they don't agree with the mainstream.It's not that Peeta doesn't like Katniss - for someone living under the leaden skies of a North American dictatorship in relative poverty, she's not unattractive. He thinks she's ""stubborn"", but ""good with a bow"" - in her own opinion, she ""isn't very good at friends."" Very little of this actually matters by the end, though - the film isn't really a character study, it's an action film attempting allegory which is probably a little too long. Did any of these things change in Katniss by the end? Not really, and we are not granted satisfying closure anyway due to the need to tee up a third entry, which is handles clumsily.Before all that are the special 75h edition of the Hunger Games, which pits all the previous winners from other villages/divisions against one another in a great big battle royal set in an enclosed jungle space housing its own biodiversity; special power up 'drops' and a set of weaponry befitting to the skills of its competitors. The event is, in truth, an opportunity for the establishment to knock-off the troublesome lovebirds, who are doing more to foment unrest than sooth it, and replace them with a new 'couple' who will act as the great metaphor for the stability of the regime. For the film, it allows itself permission to cynically bring together proven battle hardened champions to face off with one another, essentially permitting more action and fighting than if the competitors were newbies with no clue as to what to do.This particular entry is not without merit, but it lacks something special for it to be anything more than what it is - a moderate actioner. Curiously, I did not feel for the characters involved in the same way that I did in the first film, and the actual 'games' themselves feel oddly synthetic, even incidental, where before they felt first like a brooding event and then then became a gruelling catharsis. The film handles the supposed tension between Snow's regime and the rest of the population quite well, without really presenting to us any of the large-scale uprisings that we're supposed to feel are endemic - this is achieved through Sutherland's acting more than anything, but you genuinely sense a political wrestling match is unfolding out there somewhere. When all is said and done, a dislike of the first film will probably lead to a positive hatred of this one. Enjoy the first, and you will gleam plenty from the continuation of the story here.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
51,filipemanuelneto,Even better than the first.,10,3 May 2020,"This film is the second in the adaptation of a literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins. I did not read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film, which was already expected for those who saw the first one due to its open ending.In this film, we continue to follow the story of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the unlikely Hunger Games winners we saw in the first film. They have to live the life of winners, but that life means becoming the target of national scrutiny, thanks to their popularity and the propaganda machine of President Snow, eager to use them to keep people entertained, without thinking about politics. But Katniss, against her will, had become a symbol for those who stand against that totalitarian regime, and Snow decides to organize new games where he can get rid of her in an exemplary way: designed to celebrate the seventy-five years of victory over the rebels, the new games will bring together just the winners from previous editions, knowing in advance that District 12 had only one female winner: Katniss will have to participate.To begin with, its necessary to say that this film was not directed by the same director as the first. But this is something that the public will only notice if they are very attentive, since it matches, in quality and impact, the initial film. Everything is quite clear, especially if the audience has previously seen the first film (a premise to understand any sequels, of course). And if in the first film we see similarities between Panem and Ancient Rome, these similarities will become more visible as the Snow's regime reveals itself openly dictatorial, totalitarian and established on a cult of personality around him.Jennifer Lawrence remained in excellent shape, as she had done in the first film. Her entire performance clearly reveals her mixed feelings and her character's intense and strong character. Josh Hutcherson is much better here than in the first film. He takes the initiative, quickly understands what needs to be done to survive the new challenges. Despite that, I can't take Hutcherson seriously and he always sounds strange to me. Okay, the defect may be mine, I admit, but that's how the actor's performance looks to me. Donald Sutherland never seemed so Machiavellian and somber as in this film, in an admirable performance that can be one of the most striking in the actor's recent career. Stanley Tucci was also amazing in the deeply satirical way in which he brought a sensationalist TV host to life. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson gain even more psychological depth. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Sam Claflin, Lynn Cohen and Jena Malone also do a good job.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, even better than in the first film; excellent sets and costumes and CGI and sound effects even more spectacular than the first ones. The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent and, for those who liked the first one, it will certainly be a must and leave the feeling that it was little. It is worth seeing and will definitely leave your appetite ready for the third film. However, and I repeat what I said in the review of the first film, I do not know how much younger children are prepared to see and, above all, to understand the story told. In addition, prevention remains: it is a film with some violent content and this has to be taken into account by parents and educators.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
52,pennyelenabooks,good enough,4,8 July 2015,"The second movie of the Hunger Games series finds Katniss yet again on the battle field, this time fighting other victores of the games. The film started well enough, with the presence of power and the fear of the revolution being introduced as the main idea, even though the protagonist resist it as long as it takes. And that resistance leads to too many proof that the Capitol is rotten and needs to be brought down. The love triangle between Katniss and the two boys is meaningless, even though it becomes stronger and stronger towards the end. You can easily guess of course what it will happen next, and even the secret role of some of the characters in the film is quite obvious. The second Hunger game battle is like wanting to repeat something that it was very successful and might be revised. However I don't know how much blame can be set on the movie for following the book's story line. The performances were good and the special effects as well as the costumes were excellent. And so I give this movie a 4 out of 10, because the feeling of deja vu was there the whole time.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
53,leonblackwood,Great Sequel! 7/10,7,23 March 2014,"Review: What an epic movie. It carries on from the first one and it ends up in the same place. From the success if the original Hunger Games, the director had a bigger budget for this movie which you can clearly see with the CGI and elaborate scenery. The storyline was put together well and the introduction of the new characters didn't spoil the franchise. It's just a shame that Phillip Seymour Hoffman won't be in the next one. I did find the ending a bit weird, but I think that was a deliberate choice for the director who has another 2 in the pipeline. There loads of intense action and drama throughout the movie which will keep everyone entertained and there are a few twists that keep the movie interesting. I can't wait to see the next one. Enjoyable!Round-Up: The director was lucky to get most of the original cast because it wouldn't have been the same otherwise. Woody Harrelson stuck out from the rest and his unique wit brought a funny side to the movie, even though it is pretty intense. There are a lot of unanswered question a that should be answered in the next movie so I hope that it doesn't take years for it to come out. Anyway, this movie does take some time to warm up, but once it starts going it doesn't disappoint. At nearly 2 and a half hours long, the film doesn't drag or become boring throughout the movie which is a plus on the script writers and directors side. I just caught wait to see were they take this franchise,Budget: $130million Worldwide Gross: $865millionI recommend this movie to people enjoyed the first Hunger Games. 7/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
54,matthewssilverhammer,"Thanks to stronger performances and a more exciting arena, this is a vast improvement in the already successful Hunger Games universe.",8,26 November 2013,"Sequels have come a long way. We used to take it for granted that a sequel would be worse than its original, but with the implementation of the franchise, it's become imperative for studios to make decent sequels. We, the viewing public, should be thankful for this shift, with ""Catching Fire"" being the latest sequel to match, and in ways better, its predecessor. Bigger budget, powerful imagery, strong performances, and marked improvements in excitement and action make this an intense and enjoyable upgrade to the Hunger Games universe. It picks up one year after the last games, with Peeta (Hutcherson), Katniss (Lawrence), and the surrounding world of colorful characters reeling from the effects of the last arena as Panem preps for the 75th Hunger Games. Though it has been a year since the first film and the director changed, the world and tone of Panem is consistent with the first film yet better realized and more filled out. Likewise, the dialogue is much stronger, thanks in part to the great cast of veteran actors who bring stability to the young talented lead actors. Specifically, Sutherland's President Snow is given more screen time, relishing his evil role. Now let's face it: Hunger Games is Harry Potter. It's a wonderful fable with great characters and detailed worlds, led by a reluctant but endearing hero. This isn't a criticism, just an observation, and of the many Potter replicants, this is the best. Will it have the critical and commercial endurance of Potter? I'd say the odds are ever in its favor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Franchise truly catches fire with this excellent adaptation,9,24 November 2013,"Chips falling as they did, the odds of ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" equaling its predecessor were not exactly ever in its favor. Director and adaptor Gary Ross left the burgeoning film franchise, Suzanne Collins' series undoubtedly lost a little luster with its increased exposure and ""Catching Fire"" takes on a much larger scope than the first book as revolution threatens the dystopia of Panem. Well, with Francis Lawrence at the helm (""I Am Legend"") and a screenplay from two Oscar winners in Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael Arndt (""Oblivion,"" ""Toy Story 3""), ""Catching Fire"" makes adapting mega-popular book series look easy. The sequel builds on the tone Ross set for the series while improving upon the action, tension and drama.Beaufoy and Arndt perfectly convey the pressures upon Hunger Games victors Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Their act of defiance masquerading as true love allowed them to survive the Games together, but now they must sell it to the districts of Panem in order to fan down the flames of revolution they've kindled, or risk President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol hurting the ones they love.""Catching Fire,"" like its predecessor but in a whole other way, is a tale of two parts: the first being Katniss and Peeta's ""Victory Tour"" during which it becomes clear the districts' defiance of the Capitol has gone too far to stop now, and the second being the 75th Hunger Games, which has been manipulated this year to snuff out Katniss for good. Although these parts look and feel totally different, the strong narrative binding them together makes the movie impressively cohesive and doing justice to metaphor in the film's title and at the heart of its story.The biggest difference between the two ""Hunger Games"" films is the stylistic approach of directors Lawrence versus Ross. Ross used a lot of hand-held camera-work whereas Lawrence uses a more standard approach and picks his angles. The action scenes of ""Catching Fire"" are therefore a lot crisper, with no shaky-cam to blur the violence down to PG-13. Lawrence opts to leave a lot of the violence to the viewer's imagination and it's much more effective.On the other hand, Lawrence doesn't seem to have quite the same rapport with the other Lawrence, his star. Ross had a way of capturing Katniss' emotion in a real, deeply introspective way. He made Katniss his focal point, boxing out the supporting characters; Lawrence is more inclusive, sacrificing a little of our lens into Katniss to account for the many new characters in ""Catching Fire."" Some of Jennifer Lawrence's facial expressions don't have the same effective intensity as they did during, for example, the slow-building Reaping scene in the first movie. Katniss has lots of moments in which she emotionally snaps, which puts the pressure on Lawrence to sell us on the emotions, but she's a little limited with how effective she can be.Instead, characters such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Effie (Elizabeth Banks), President Snow and newcomers Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) get a little more of a spotlight and make ""Catching Fire"" feel more like an ensemble film. The script also supports them with some good lines and moments. Considering ""Catching Fire"" moves the story in a direction that is bigger than Katniss, it's a smart decision that could pay dividends in the two-part conclusion, ""Mockingjay,"" which underwhelmed as a book.""Catching Fire"" works from start to finish and doesn't waste much screen time in all of its 156 minutes. There's very little action in the first half too, but the trap in which Katniss is ensnared provides the high stakes and the suspense to get the ball rolling. Considering the trailers didn't bother to hide that Katniss returns to the Hunger Games arena once again, it's testament to the work Arndt and Beaufoy have done that the moment when President Snow reveals that information has a heavy and harrowing effect in spite of its inevitability. Adaptations of major book series or multi-film franchises often struggle when the scale of the story grows so large that there's so much more to take account of, but hiring these ace writers and a director with some experience reining in big genre films helped ""Catching Fire"" take a major step forward in a way that can only be compared to the ""Harry Potter"" franchise. If they can make ""Mockingjay"" work despite splitting the tiny and very different book into two parts, that'll be another success entirely.~Steven CThanks for reading!

56,Vartiainen,Excellent sequel and a book adaptation,7,12 January 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire continues the story of the first book/movie with blazing abandon, consistent character development and increasing stages. It's a film worthy of its predecessor, and it very well might be even better.Jennifer Lawrence is the unquestioned star of these movies. Katniss Everdeen is the central focus of the story, and I love it. Her struggles, vulnerabilities, victories and defeats are the driving force behind the plot and how the audience reacts to it. And the best part is that Lawrence completely submerges herself into the role, easily switching tracks whenever needed. Katniss as a character is very closed off, very guarded, which carries the risk that an actress playing her would seem stilted or wooden, but not with Lawrence. You can see the subtle emotions playing across her face at any given time, and the final scene where she stares directly at the camera and you can see dozen emotions running across her face one at a time. Shudders, man, goosebumps even.Not to say the rest of the cast is untalented either. Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutlerland are as great as ever as Haymitch and President Snow, respectively. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was actually better in this one, in my opinion. More bitter, which gave him depth. I'm still not completely sold on Liam Hemsworth as Gale, but he did his job. Too much of an obvious tragic bad boy, I think. And the rest of the actors did equally good jobs, managing to convey a lot of exposition and storytelling with relatively little screen time and with a lot of grace.The special effects and the visuals were very good. Larger budget obviously meant improvement in these areas, and it shows. And thankfully they toned down the shaky cam, which improved the viewing experience so much. It's also a well directed film. The storytelling is smooth and flawless. A complex and multilayered story is laid out in front of us in a way that feels natural and is easy to follow. At no point did I felt that they skipped over anything or that the film lingered too much. It was a well-paced, well-told story with a proper, might I even call it perfect arc. The closest one to perfection I've seen in recent years.If I had to nitpick I'd say that when we get back to the actual Hunger Games, the novelty has worn off. The arena is still exciting and at least it's different enough that it feels somewhat new, but the actual mechanics of young kids and adults fighting against one another are nothing we haven't seen before. It's still good and it's still enjoyable to watch as an action piece, but oh man, what if this arena had been the arena in the first film. That would have been unbelievable. Still, a nitpick at most, so don't turn away from the movie because of that.I liked this film. The ending left me wanting for more and I can't wait for the next one. This is what a sequel should be about. Continuation of the story, more character growth, new characters in moderation, doing what the first film did right, learning from the mistakes of the earlier films. The whole package. If you liked the first Hunger Games, you're going to love this one.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
57,Chris Knipp,"People think this better than the first film, but is it?",6,23 November 2013,"Everyone is so eager to say the second Hunger Games movie (""Cathing Fire "") is even better than the first. Why do they say that? Anyway it's just assumed now viewers know the whole story, or at least saw Part One, so we plunge in this time, with less introduction to this ultra-popular young adults sci-fi tale by Susanne Collins. One may miss Part One's introductory material, its glimpses of the impoverished District 12, which Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the protagonists, come from, and the gloriously absurd foppishness of the Roman Empire-inspired ruling class who prance around when the games, designed apparently both to distract and terrify the oppressed majority, are held. In Part One, instead of following the Hunger Games rule of saving only one survivor of the dog-eat-dog competition, which is like an out-in- the-electronically-generated-force-field-infested-woods version of to-the-death Roman gladiatorial contests, two Tributes (contestants), Katniss and Peeta, get saved by cleverly posing as a romantic couple. Even maniacal dictators have a heart, or it just seems good public policy to celebrate love among the peons. (This new movie has much more hugging and kissing than killing, though it has a brutal whipping only 12 Years a Slave can outmatch, and of course killing does occur; it just doesn't seem to hurt quite as much as Part One's.) The ""Victor,"" i.e., the Hunger Game annual winner -- the lowbrow mindset requires the word be explained -- normally gets to live an absolutely protected life from then on, his or her triumph saving him or her from future competitions. Let's not fail to note that ""him or her"" is primarily ""her,"" because this, like the ""Twilight"" series, is by and for primarily young adult females, and so the story has a strong girl-empowerment angle, for which everybody agrees the steely, glowing Jennifer Lawrence is the ideal central emblem. But trouble is afoot. The year's ongoing public appearances of Katniss and Peeta in various Districts, when they stir things up by jettisoning their prepared spiels, show that a spirit of rebellion is afoot. President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who seems to have nothing much to do but drink tea and watch these displays, is very displeased at these hints of trouble afoot among the lower orders. After all he's basically a fascist dictator -- though, by the way, if you just watch the Triumph of the Will you'll see that real-life Nazis did all this grandiose spectacle stuff way better than the Lionsgate folks. Snow decides to break the rules and bring back last year's double Victors to the annual life-and-death competition again. When they're dead, Snow figures the revolutionary spirit will fade, thought this is a dubious notion, since the people are leading their own revolt, not Katniss and Peeta, however much they may serve as inspiring symbols. Anyway, off we go: Part Two is Part One with a new urgency, because the whole annual Hunger Games scheme of keeping the masses too terrified to revolt now seems to be failing. We have a new director for the film itself (a method used to freshen up the Twilight series too), Francis Lawrence instead of Gary Ross, not that that's part of the story line. We've got some new name actors. A puffy, uneasy-looking Philip Seymour Hoffman, not by any means at his best, is the master of the games (was there one before?). There's a new pair of ""mature"" Tributes (to attract the adult audience? -- played by Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer) supposedly chosen for brain, not brawn. Wright hence wears nerdy glasses and Plummer, who might seem an odd choice, is proclaimed a ""genius"" for a nutty chant that tips off the others to how the island they're competing on is set up. There's also an old lady called Mags, played by an 80-year-old actress (Lynn Cohen), who must be pretty athletic to hold onto Finnick (Sam Claflin) as he races through the woods with her clinging to his back. Woody Harrelson, who continues to be a welcome note, partly because his character Haymitch's over-the-top style hardly seems any stretch at all for him, hasn't done anything interesting in between Parts One and Two - - unless you think Seven Psychopaths and Now You See Me are great movies. But Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the director, I trust) on the other hand returns with greatly increased luster, having become a regular with a David O. Russell at the top of his game, winning the Oscar for her turn in his Silver Linings Playbook and coming up in his promising but as yet unseen American Hustle. Other actors give us more of the same. Stanley Tucci (as the broadly parodic game show master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman) deserves credit for being just as cannily manic and silly this time as last. But despite a lot of focus on Katniss' dazzling game intro wedding gown outfit -- she and Peeta were going to wed -- there doesn't seem to be as much spectacle this time, or as much dwelling on elaborate makeup and gear. There is also the weakness that this time to make Katniss more admirable she fires only in self defense, and one doesn't feel the danger or the terrifying sense of attrition as participants are eliminated. Been there, done that. Spectacular effects -- lightening, explosions, holograms, shifting earth, falling sky -- can't hide the fact that it's all familiar this time, and you can make Katniss and Peeta almost die, but we'd have to be pretty dumb to worry. It's not that ""Catching Fire"" is better than Part One: it's just that more reviewers have drunk the Kool-Aid. That didn't happen to me; quite the reverse. Let's hope somehow the story will reengage me in the followup.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, 146 mins., opened in US theaters 22 Nov. 2013.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
58,BeneCumb,Decent? Yes. Conceptional? No.,6,31 January 2014,"I have not read the books, I was somehow invited to see the 1st installment, which I did not like so much, but there is always hope for the better... Especially when both movies have received so much praise and accolades. But alas, again, similar ambivalent feelings, as the plot is uneven, at times protracted, games themselves start in the 2nd half of the movie, unnecessary explanations alternate with indistinct scenes... The reasons for such an ending is understandable, but I would still prefer a kind of solution, round-up for each and every part.The best thing in the movie are ""older"" actors, starting from Woody Harrelson and ending with Amanda Plummer. The younger ones had not much impression on me, I know dozens of more versatile and distinct actors aged 30 and below, e.g. Paul Dano, Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Emma Watson, Zoe Kazan; the phenomenon of Jennifer Lawrence is still mystery to me, well, I will try to peruse this by watching Winter's Bone as soon as possible :) Well, I do still not comprehend what is the real target audience and how/why the movie has obtained so many viewers and box office. There are much more intriguing movies out there.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

But the president(Donald Sutherland) want to break Katniss, emotional as well has physical.I thought everything that was first done well in the first Hunger Games film, was done much better here. The setting was well done, also the tension was greatly approved upon. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, so was Josh Hutcherson as Petta, I they grew more since the first one, Woody Harrelson steals some scenes he's in, Donald Sutherland is also as the evil president, after seeing this, I'm excited for the next one.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
60,freemantle_uk,The girl is still on fire,9,7 December 2013,"The Girl on Fire is back, the Mockingjay and the symbol of hope against a repressive regime returns in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, a film that fans of the novel will be extremely pleased with.After winning the Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has been suffering nightmares and has been unable to spend time with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), after it was revealed that her love for him was fake. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) demands Katniss that she needs to keep the presence going, in order to stop an uprising happening in many Districts of Panam. Snow threatens to kill her family, if she does not comply. With many of the Districts rioting, seeing Katniss as a symbol and the Capital citizen looking her as a cultural icon, the new Gamesmaster, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) advises Snow to bring in more oppressive measures and for the 75th Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, by using the existing pool of winners to fight to death, forcing Katniss and Peeta back into the arena.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a very loyal adaptation of the novel, only omitting a few elements and adding or expanding scenes. Director Francis Lawrence and writers, Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt have taken over the series and the trio keep what worked from the first adaptation, while dropping things like the shaky cam, in order to improve on the quality of this second entry.Francis Lawrence and the writers greatly realise the expanded world of Panam and showing the political situation in the mostly engaging way possible. We get the wide range of political symbolism of the world, the use of the three finger hand symbol, the mockingjay bird and getting quick graces of the rebellion in the screens of a control room. We get to see what events are like on the ground, with the tour of Districts in a montage and the repression used in District 12 with the enforcement of corporal punishment. On the other side of the coin, the citizens in the Capital copy Katniss' style, including Snow's granddaughter, which leads Katniss into becoming a Che Guevara-like figure, where the citizens do not realise what she stands for.The sequel also retains the themes about politics, particularly the media as both Snow and Katniss' team battle each other in the media world, making power plays, in order to get one over the other. Commentaries about the other indulgent society in The Capital is also in play, compared to the poverty that the other Districts live in. Katniss herself has to go through some changes, as she wants to protect her family, but is forced to become this symbol and every action The Capital takes drives her closer to the role.The Hunger Games: Catching Games has a bigger budget then the previous entry and it shows on the screen, as Francis Lawrence is allowed to craft a grander and more expansive world, than director Gary Ross had previously done. Lawrence gets to visit more of Panam and has big wide shots during the opening parade and seeing more of the skyline of The Capital. There is more CGI and Francis Lawrence greatly realizes the topical arena for the games.Lawrence preserves the same colour schemes that Ross used for The Hunger Games, District 12 and the other district being gray, grim and industrial, compared to The Capital being bright and colourful. Lawrence also maintains the same level of violence and brutality of the first movie and the book, such as the flogging scene and does push the 12A rating in the UK during the Quarter Quell (the UK version is uncut).New actors have joined the existing cast of The Hunger Games and the results are mixed. Hoffman is the competent professional that he usually is and Jeffrey Wright is excellent as the intelligent, inventive Beetee, adding plenty of gravitas. Sam Claflin, who won the convened Finnick Odair, continues to be his bland self, ever since he was in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Patrick St. Esprit does deserves a special mention, for his gusto and overacting as Commander Thread, the new strict head peacekeeper in District 12.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel that improves on the original and should easily pleases fans of the books and the first movie. It is a blockbuster with substance and despite the long running time does not drag at all.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
61,dfranzen70,Intense excitement not for younglings,9,5 December 2013,"The second entry in The Hunger Games series is perhaps even better than the first, with strong, layered characters, intrigue, creativity, and a great buildup to a stunning cliffhanger. For me, it was endless entertainment.Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure that The Hunger Games is really for the younger kids out there. It's grim and violent. After all, it's about kids killing each other for the entertainment of a despot. So, PG-13 rating notwithstanding, you might want to reconsider bringing the kids to this. There are some scenes that could give them nightmares (even more so than Harry Potter).The 75th Hunger Games are upon us, but President Snow (an oily Donald Sutherland) is not pleased that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) were joint winners the previous year when they appeared to choose death over murder. In particular, Snow reviles Katniss, whom he views as a beacon of hope to the mostly impoverished denizens of Pandem's twelve districts.Katniss and Peeta are to embark upon a victory tour, stopping in each district and reading a quick eulogy to the fallen tributes of the previous games. But they must also put on a front that they are both deeply in love with one another, thus distracting people from their wretched lives, as is the intent of the Games. You might guess that this pretension doesn't go over well with Katniss.The victory tour, however, is only the beginning. More games are afoot, and the lives of Katniss and Peeta are no longer the only ones at stake. There's a hint of unease in the air, particularly among the poorer regions of the land. Is Katniss Everdeen a symbol for rebellion? Some characters return, such as Caesar Flickerman, the Games' host (Stanley Tucci), the flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), the cranky drunk Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and the misnamed Snow. Along with new tributes, we meet a new gamesmaster, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who takes over for Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as the Machiavelli/Wizard of Oz.The action is frantic, even more so than in in the first movie, and the obstacles facing Katniss - both emotional and physical - are still more debilitating and oppressive. Even though we - and the players - know that the arena is very much under human control, nothing is predictable.Lawrence, if you can believe it, is better than ever. This time around, we get a little bit more of a look into her psyche, her reserved nature, and her longings. Katniss is as radiant and determined as ever, a fierce and intelligent young woman who is as vulnerable as the rest of us. And that alone makes her an ideal role model for kids, not just girls.A word to the wise - okay, a second word to the wise - in one way this movie reminds me of Back to the Future II. That movie was filmed at the same time as its successor, and although it is a fun movie in itself, it transparently served as a lead-in to Back to the Future III; similarly, this movie will not end as decisively as the first but rather on a dramatic, but satisfying precipice. It is a rare film that can tell a tale fluidly and not just leave the audience wanting more of the same but wanting to know precisely what happens in the seconds after the screen goes black. Catching Fire acts as both a wild ride of joy, despair, love, anger, and revenge and as a catalyst for the third and final installment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
62,stevendbeard,Good Sequel But Leaves You Hanging,8,22 November 2013,"I saw ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", starring Jennifer Lawrence-X- Men: First Class, The Bill Engvall Show-t.v.; Josh Hutcherson-Red Dawn- 2012, RV; Liam Hemsworth-The Expendables 2, The Last Song; Philip Seymour Hoffman-Moneyball, The Big Lebowski and Donald Sutherland- Horrible Bosses, Reign Over Me.This is the second in the series that is based on a book trilogy about young people fighting to the death in an annual series of games. The third book will be made into two movies, a part 1 & part 2. Jennifer and Josh return as the latest champions who won the 74th annual Hunger Games. Just like a Miss America Pageant winner, they are paraded around the country side on a victory tour. Liam is still the true love of Jennifer back home, but she has to act like she is in love with Josh and promote the propaganda for the President, Donald, or face stiff consequences-he threatens to kill her family, friends and even the whole district that she is from, if she does not cooperate. Philip takes the newly vacant job of being the games controller. Donald had the last one killed for his incompetence in letting Jennifer survive the last games. Donald wants Jennifer dead because he fears that the peasants will start a rebellion if they have too much hope in her. It was a pretty good sequel except for the ending; it just stops suddenly, which I know was probably their intention in setting up the next installment. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 26 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
63,tadpole-596-918256,LOST barges in on the TRUMAN SHOW . . .,9,24 November 2013,". . . but most HUNGER GAMES fans won't care, since they are too young to remember LOST very well, and WAY too youthful to have heard of THE TRUMAN SHOW. Which is why the producers of this movie did not hesitate to film it in LOST's Hawaiian setting--complete with the spinning island Orchid Station effect--and also rebuild THE TRUMAN SHOW's dome, which was just ripped off this summer by Stephen King and the UNDER THE DOME people. Scoring few points for originality, then, CATCHING FIRE must rely on Jennifer Lawrence for its warmth, and she proves capable of virtually bringing down your local multiplex screen in flames. This girl survives EVERYTHING with more class than Sylvester Stallone as RAMBO or Clint Eastwood as DIRTY HARRY ever did. If Jennifer, as Catniss Everdeen, doesn't butter your biscuit, you must have a heart of stone (or a bad case of Celiac Syndrome).",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
64,meeza,"I may catch fire for this, but I did not love this one!",7,29 November 2013,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" did not deliver the fiery passion of the original. However, I think devoted fans of the novels probably will catch a lot more from this one than those who did not hit ""The Hunger Games"" books. Nevertheless, I feel that Director Francis Lawrence was no Sir Francis in keeping the movie-going audience vastly entertained with this edition. Maybe my appetite for ""The Hunger Games"" relinquished after seeing more of a forces of nature aspect to this sequel, while the original had more a thirst for survival appetite. Oscar-winning screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt did not scribe up a magnetic screenplay, even though maybe what Simon says was not too Ardntly; OK, I am catching fire with these cheesy puns. Jennifer Lawrence does shine here again as Katniss Everdeen; The J-Law is still in effect and is here to stay. Woody Harrelson also delivered charismatically once again as Haymitch; so cheers to that. Donald Sutherland also demonstrated that his senior years have not affected his thespian brilliance portraying here proficiently the ruthless President Snow; so yea, let it Snow, let it Snow, let it Snow for this trilogy. And there is the masterful Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman. The rest of the acting of the movie was just subpar which includes that ""I rather be eating Pita bread"" than watching Josh Hutcherson's humdrum performance as Hunger Gamer Peeta Mellark; or maybe I am just writing a whole bunch of Mellarky. Anyways, it's worth catching ""Catching Fire"" but you will probably be left tasting for more. *** Average",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
65,drqshadow-reviews,"A Loyal, Honest Interpretation, it Lacks the Book's Unspoken Energy and Vibrance",6,27 January 2014,"Somehow even darker and more brooding than the original, which was no sunshiny walk in the park itself. Following the financial success of the first film, a lot of rough edges and awkward missteps have been ironed out in time for the next act. Most notably improved is the effects work, which had seemed just a bit too much like a video game cutscene. The new arena is convincing and beautiful, the glitz and glamor of The Capitol has been amplified appropriately, and the intricacies of the cast's showy wardrobe (which memorably underwhelmed in the first film) are far better realized. The plot is efficient, if telegraphed and incomplete: its sudden, jolting cliffhanger (which occurs, literally, right in the middle of a sentence) left me flat, even if it is laid out in precisely the same way in the source material. Much of the primary cast spends the duration wrapped up in their own sorrow, quietly brooding over their predicament while the roles of their flashier, more PR-friendly foils have been trimmed down to mere cameos. Such concessions are understandable, as the film does run quite long as it is, but the accompanying shift in tone makes this a very redundant, single-colored ride. An improvement over the first film in many ways, but the first act really drags its feet and there's a puzzling lack of enthusiasm, energy or suspense to it all.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
66,estebangonzalez10,The Hunger Games have been upgraded,9,24 November 2013,"""Remember who the real enemy is.""Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) takes over director duty from Gary Ross in the sequel to The Hunger Games franchise which results in a much darker and better film. I know I gave the original Hunger Games film the same rating as this one, but I think I was a little too generous with the first film. Francis clearly sets the right mood and tone for this franchise by giving us a better picture of the world outside of the games. The districts and the Capitol are better portrayed here and we get a sense of who the real enemy is now. In the first film I felt like the enemies were some of the kids from the first districts, while in this sequel you get more of a sense as to why the Capitol and President Snow are the true enemies. The film takes more time to set up this world and it does so with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The actual Hunger Games don't begin until the second half of the film, but I was OK with the buildup since it was absolutely necessary. Catching Fire gives us glimpses of what we are going to get in the next two films as sparks of a revolution begin to develop, and it also gives us new characters that are certain to play a key role in the upcoming films. These new characters are far better developed than the ones in the first film and the entire film sets things up perfectly for the grand finale. Jennifer Lawrence carries this film and she truly is a girl on fire showing both sides of her persona: her courage and her vulnerability. She balances these elements and the struggles she's going through perfectly and allows the audience to identify with her character. I don't think that two and a half hours have gone by so quickly for me as it did during this movie (I've seen 90 minute films that seemed to be longer than this) because it was just so exciting and engaging. The action during the actual games were also much better developed (no more shaky cams). Catching Fire is probably along with Star Trek Into Darkness the best blockbuster of the year.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrece) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games, have returned home. Katniss has turned into a symbol of hope for the people who are beginning to rebel against the totalitarian government of the Capitol under President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss and Peeta's return home is short lived as they embark on a Victor's Tour around all the districts paying their respects to the falling tributes. Despite Katniss's love for Gale (Liam Hemsworth), she is forced to continue with the farce surrounding the media coverage of her relationship with Peeta. Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) join Katniss and Peeta as advisers during the tour. President Snow recognizes that Katniss has become a symbol of hope for the people outside of the Capitol and therefore has a surprise for the upcoming Quarter Quell (the 75th Annual Hunger Games). He announces that for this special event a male and female tribute winner from every district will have to compete against each other in this tournament of champions. Katniss and Peeta are the chosen tributes from District 12 who will face other tributes in a special arena designed by the new Head Gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Other tributes include Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) who form an alliance with them. President Snow is planning on crushing Panem's new symbol of hope, but Katniss will do what it takes to survive and protect her loved ones.Francis Lawrence does a much better job here at exploring the different themes that the film is trying to get across. Catching Fire is more than a simple survival tale as other themes such as government oppression, heavily marked social classes, and society's obsession with celebrities are all explored very well. The characters are better developed as well. Take Katniss for example, as she's forced to live a double life feeling hypocritical and imprisoned at times as she has to hide her true feelings for Gale. She doesn't feel like a hero and doesn't want to be that symbol of hope that's she become. She has to come to grips with her new identity and the responsibility that has come with it. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a strong performance as she shows these inner struggles she's facing while at the same time proving she can be lethal. The film is also very well adapted by Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael Arndt (Toy Story 3) from Suzanne Collins' novel. The returning supporting actors like Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci are phenomenal once again, while the new characters played by Jenna Malone, Sam Claflin, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Jeffrey Wright have sparked my interest as to what they can bring to this franchise. They were all very well developed and add so much to a first part which in my opinion was dependent entirely on Jennifer Lawrence. She carries this film once again, but has an even more impressive supporting cast to leave us even more hooked with the cliffhanger ending. This film was great and I haven't even mentioned the amazing sets and awesome costume designs that went up a notch from last year's Hunger Games. Catching Fire is an upgrade over the original film and one you should definitely give a chance.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

This features lots of action, romance, and a decent amount of character development, and some new characters, but it does go on a bit long and tends to drag a bit.

69,dwpollar,Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie...,4,26 November 2013,"1st watched 11/22/2013 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Lawrence): Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie doesn't have the bite or allure of the original. The setup and lead-in to the games is very flat and sometimes downright corny. The viewer also doesn't see the purpose behind everything that is happening as clearly as with the original. There is really nothing terribly wrong in the performances with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead as Kat, but the direction doesn't seem to pull in the emotions or necessity for the story. The main characters emotions are very evident – almost too much so – but the other characters are pretty bland as far as their direction towards their purpose. The story starts with Kat being called out of her hunter's life to leave her current boyfriend to go on a victor's tour with her winner & co-partner for her zone – which quickly becomes a tournament to cover up the actual turmoil and possible revolution in the real world. The game provides a little bit of puzzle solving as it is setup like a clock, but not enough to make it very interesting or much fun. There is a hardness to this movie that is actually pretty tough to take in – a world that makes the normal folk kill each other as entertainment for some reason that is not real clear. Overall this is a just a pretty un-satisfactory movie experience for a franchise that promises at least two more movies.hopefully they pick up their game or it will lose it's audience despite the book series popularity.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
70,kluseba,A repetitive transition between the first instalment and the closing chapter in two parts,6,26 November 2013,"Here it is: ""1984"" feature ""Battle Royale"" Part II - the follow-up nobody really needed.On a more serious note, I must though admit that I enjoyed the first movie. It wasn't original but the settings were great, the camera and light work flawless, the costumes and effects stunning and the different characters during the battle competition were somewhat intriguing and had some depth as well.This time, the movie bores us with an overlong introduction. Instead of developing the main characters, we just get exposed to things we had already known or seen before in the first movie. This is basically just a waste of precious time as neither the characters nor the story gets any new elements.The reason why the radical autocracy sets off a special edition of the Hunger Games is completely ridiculous but I'm aware of the fact that this part is based on the books, so the movie makers are not to blame. Let's just say that the stories of the first and the second movie are too similar to make the second part stand out anyhow.It's simply not impressive anymore to see the colourful characters, clothes and make-up because we have been there before. The new characters that are taking part in the new Hunger Games aren't as interesting as in the first part and once some characters finally start to act in suspicious way, the whole movie is already over and any development suddenly aborted. Some characters seemed to be interesting such as the brutal young woman with the strange teeth but they almost have no screening time at all. Once again, I call this a waste of time and potential.Why does this movie still get a passable rating? The acting is of a good average quality. The decorations, effects and settings are similar to the first movie but still on a high quality. Some adrenaline driven scenes during the Hunger Games will get you on the edge of your seats. The open ending is interesting enough to make you want to see more and watch the next two instalments of the series (of course, they needed to make two more movies out of it to make more money just as the last two Harry Potter movies). So, there still are a lot of positive elements and the great images and sounds make it worth to watch it in your local cinema.On the other side, this film is not much more than ""1984"" meets ""Battle Royale"" for the ""Twilight"" generation. I must admit that I'm a big fan of dystopian movies and novels and that's why I'm also enjoying the ""Hunger Games"". If you're not just following a trend, a little bit more mature and honestly enjoying this franchise, you should definitely watch classics such as ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Soylent Green"", ""Rollerball"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Renaissance"" and so on and compare them to the ""Hunger Games"".

I won the full set in a competition where mine was the winning review, thank you Raru South Africa, I do appreciate, I never would have seen it otherwise, the original box cover artwork of THE HUNGER GAMES reminded me too much of images I have seen of computer- animated Lara Croft and I didn't have this on my list of DVDs to obtain, but when my BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER review took first prize, I was real chuffed for the nifty boxset.Once again though, there's nothing really, really special in here. Come on, people, it's an average performance in a movie coming in well below what it should have been. I hasten to add, in all fairness, that those computer-generated mandrills... Ooh jeepers they made excellent excellent adversaries, the only real high point of the movie. Had the entire flick been that kind of edge-of-your-seat stuff...But Jennifer Lawrence is nothing extra-special in this movie. Do not get me wrong, I am not dissing her, no. But worthy of all this acclaim, for this... This? People, you are seeing way more in this than there actually is. Take another look at it. What it does do, is deliver a theme of televised blood sport, and this is what enthralls you lot. There is bound to be more. Of this (the DIVERGENT series aside) with better performances, and you'll see, though I most likely wouldn't, I prefer other kinds of story lines, I wouldn't be salivating over the blood games to follow.Notice that the poster artwork got recognition. Yeah, where are the days of the great poster artwork, like THE GAUNTLET, and the Roger Moore James Bond movies?In closing, I repeat, I do not mean it is a weak movie/weak performance.

74,3xHCCH,"First Was Already Very Good, This One Was Even Better!",9,21 November 2013,"The first movie in the Hunger Games series was very well made. It was generally faithful to the Suzanne Collins book on which it was based. The actors chosen for the cast were all very good in portraying the characters, vividly bringing the book to life. I was really looking forward to this sequel which tackles the second book in the series.This movie had a change in directors. From Gary Ross who did very well in the first film, this sequel is now directed by Francis Lawrence, whom I do not know. But there was certainly nothing to worry about after all. This second installment managed to up the ante, coming up with a film that excellently captured the escalating political turmoil among the Districts in Panem and how Katniss becomes its fiery symbol.The story picks up from the first film, where Katniss and Peeta return to their homes in decrepit District 12. Katniss's unprecedented act of near-suicide during the last Hunger Games had been seen by several citizens as an act of defiance against the government. Alarmed by this development, the threatened President Snow hatches a plan to kill Katniss before she causes more unrest all over his domain.In celebration of the 75th year of the Hunger Games, previous Victors (one male and one female) from each District to fight in another games to the death called the Quarter Quell. Being the only female Victor of District 12, Katniss was an automatic contestant, and the odds were stacked against her favor. To her surprise, she has new allies and they seem to be supporting her. How will the results of this special edition of the Hunger Games affect the revolution already catching fire outside the Capitol walls? Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast as Katniss Everdeen. She is really one awesome actress, burning the big screen with her emotion, making it impossible to resist empathizing with her. Even in that simple scene during the Victors Tour in District 11, home of the fallen Rue, her short heartfelt speech can make you teary-eyed. Her character can be maddening with her seeming indecision between her two consorts, but Jennifer rises above that cheap love triangle cliché. Her graceful action prowess was on full display in that archery exhibition in the training room.The other members of the cast from the last film steps up their performances for this film. Josh Hutcherson improves on his rather cheesy performance in the first film with a stronger performance here as Peeta Mellark, Katniss' games partner. Liam Hemsworth has more screen time as Gale Hawthorne, Katniss' close friend who loves her.Woody Harrelson was perfect as their mentor and former Victor Haymitch Abernathy. Elizabeth Banks succeeded to shine through her outlandish costumes and makeup as tributes escort Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci was over-the-top in a good way, as over-the-top emcee Caesar. Lenny Kravitz has a brief but powerful role as Katniss' stylist Cinna.The new members of the cast also inhabited their roles like well-fit shoes. Donald Sutherland was formidable as President Snow needed to be. Phillip Seymour Hoffman had the requisite sneakiness and sinisterness as new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee.Sam Claflin is not exactly the charismatic District 4 victor Finnick Odair I had in mind when I was reading the books, but he did alright. Jena Malone was better as sassy and rebellious District 7 victor Johanna Mason.The special effects of this film were amazingly conceived and executed. The Victors Chariot Parade was grandiose in its scale. The Games Venue itself and its various booby traps was so harsh with the poison fog, the vicious baboons, the confounding jabberjays, among others.The costumes of Katniss also make amazing statements in the book. I was really looking forward to how these special gowns were to be shown on screen, and I must say, they were worth the expectations. The other technical aspects such as cinematography, editing, production design and sound were all top-notch as well.This film tackles a serious political topics very well, simplified for its young target audience, but not in a way that insults more mature viewers. The Hunger Games is in a class of its own when in comes to excellence among all these young adult series that came or are coming out now -- a clear notch above all the rest.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
75,jfgibson73,Meh,5,25 May 2015,"I read the first couple pages of this book just to see where the author might go after the first story ended. I have never been hooked so quickly and so hard as I was by Catching Fire. It ended up being a page turner for me, and actually renewed my interest in reading. As a film, I thought this was a fairly bland translation. I didn't much like the casting or the look--the way it was filmed, the colors, the costumes, everything. It didn't need to be any better than it was to be successful because the book was so well written, but as a companion, I find the film to be extremely disposable. I watched it once just to see the story in live action, but I won't revisit it. On a side note, I almost never enjoy dystopian fiction--especially sci- fi--but like I said, this book drew me right in.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
76,aharmas,Remember Who is the Real Enemy?,9,23 November 2013,"The middle installment of ""The Hunger Games"" comes with a series of challenges. How do you build upon an intelligent and well made first chapter? Making it more complex? Louder? More special effects? The key is to concentrate on what worked before and add a couple of challenges for both the main characters and the audience, and make Jennifer Lawrence more intense.The film is very satisfying as it continues the battle between our heroine and the president of the futuristic dystopia. She now has won the sympathy of the restless middle and lower classes, and they have begun questioning what is going on at the Capitol. The president knows this and doesn't want to be upstaged either as the center of attention and knowing his power base is slowly deteriorating. He makes it clear to those around him that she needs to be eliminated one way or another, but he also knows this won't be so easy with a person who is about to ignite a revolution if she ""disappears"" from the public eye.In ""Catching Fire"", the 75th anniversary of the games has a different spin. All of the previous winners become candidates for the new edition of the games. This promises a bigger spectacle and a more challenging situation for our heroes. The big question is how does she save herself and those she cares for since the rules only allow for one winner? It becomes a battle of the wits, followed by physical traps designed by the computer programmers behind the TV broadcast. Anything is fair game, and the contestants don't really have the advantage. Soon enough the players are facing all sorts of killing machines, living and artificial, and they keep us entertained for a good hour.Be prepared to deal with the fact that this is just one more step to the conclusion, and you probably have guess who will win this fight. What is interesting to see is how the books are interpreted, and also how Jennifer Lawrence and a very capable supporting cast deal with this exciting adventure.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
77,adamjohns-42575,Vive La Revolution!,9,11 October 2020,"I like this one just as much as the first. For one thing it has Sam Claflin in it with his chest out, for another, it is the film that connects the first to the last (2), which I realise is an obvious statement, but I mean that in the same way that The Empire Strikes Back (1980) connects Star Wars (1977) and Return Of The Jedi (1983). It's important that the things in this film happen for the series to make sense, where some second films in a trilogy (Quadrilogy) don't always add any value or stand alone entirely.I know my nephews moan that Mockingjay Parts 1&2 are boring and I think that's because those films are very political and don't feature the action of the actual Hunger Games in the ring and I think that this film is great to still show the interesting element of the games with all the politics going on in the background too. In this way it bridges the gap from the first, which was mostly about just the games themselves and the final parts which are much more politic. A nice blend and a slow down as it gets a bit more real, teaching the young adult viewers (and readers) to fight for a worthy cause and not to put up with injustice (but that's the next two, I'm digressing as I always do).You're left with a cliffhanger and a who, what, why feeling as well as a thirst to find out what's next. I know what's coming, because I've seen them before, but I'm still looking forward to the concluding two parts of this four part trilogy, because this one has left me desirous of resolution. I want to know that these characters get to safety and resolve the issues that have arisen.
The direction, acting and production, along with a great story to start with, have made them of interest to me and just like the time when I spent the whole weekend watching Friends and convinced myself that they were all my real friends, I care about what happens to these characters.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
78,Amari-Sali,"The Hunger Games continue and while the supporting characters aren't as interesting as in the first film, Jennifer Lawrence maintains her ability to lead.",7,30 November 2013,"First, let me put it out there I have not read the books but have seen the first movie. With that said, perhaps the sole driving force in seeing this movie was truly Jennifer Lawrence. Though I am familiar with Josh Hutcherson due to his roles in Little Manhattan & Bridge to Terabithia, he just never fully clicked with me once he took on more adult roles. As for other recognizable names: Woody Harrelson returns, as does Elizabeth Banks & Lenny Kravitz, and the familiar faces of Phillip S. Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright join the series. However, though there are many recognizable names, only Jennifer Lawrence stands out.Characters & StoryThose unfamiliar with the series, or even the first film, pretty much get caught up within the first half hour or so. Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is a young girl who substitutes for her little sister for the Hunger Games, a yearly fight to the death in which 12 segregated districts are forced to have one male and one female be put up as tribute with only one person having a chance to survive. However, upon Katniss coming into the competition, she causes the 74th Hunger Games to be different than the rest. Rather than it be more entertainment for those who live in the capital, where seemingly all the rich live, she becomes a beacon of hope for the 12 districts, all of which are working class.That is where the movie picks up. Katniss has returned home to district 12, a mining district, and is having post-traumatic stress disorder. Between watching a young girl get killed, partially due to her, and killing people herself, she has visions and flashbacks. Luckily, between Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) they try to bring some sense of normalcy to her, and try to protect her. However, due to the ending of the 1st film, Katniss is now seen as a threat to President Snow (played by Donald Sutherland), as after 75 years of the government squashing the last rebellion, a new one is on the rise, and Katniss seems prime to be the leader. So, due to this, he orchestrates a plan to try to have her killed, but naturally the story doesn't make killing the hero easy.PraiseSomething weird about this movie is that somehow, within the first 20 minutes, it had me crying. Likely it was because they showed Rue, and actually gave her district a face. Rue's district, the Black majority one, you can see the hurt and pain in, something you don't get a lot of as they rush through the other districts, and the first 20 minutes set a somber tone. Which, as President Snow starts threatening people and using his peace keepers, begins to turn your somber feelings into anger to the point where you are itching for Katniss to do something about him. And really, Jennifer Lawrence deserves so much praise, not just because she is showing versatility in her varying roles, but because even when she plays a character who mostly looks lifeless in the face, speaks in monotone and, when lively, speaks with the driest of sarcasm, she still can command your attention.The last thing worth praising perhaps are the costume designs, especially the dresses Lenny Kravitz's character Cinna makes, and the handful of fight scenes. Though they aren't as vicious as the first movie, at least to my memory, they still help liven things up as the story begins to slow down.CriticismWhich leads what must be criticized. Be it because I didn't read the book, or because I'm not a big fan of a lot of the actors in this film, I felt most of the supporting cast members didn't have the type of characters that made you feel invested. The reason I say that is, despite so many people's lives being on the line, the only one I felt something for, Rue, was already dead and no one gained that same sort of attachment. Albeit, to a point the character Mags (played by Lynn Cohen) seemed kind of sweet, but you knew her days were numbered. Thus making it so the character Johanna Mason (played by Jena Malone) probably was the only one who really got your attention and kept it. As for the rest of the participants, be they ally or enemy, they seemed very forgettable.And this becomes a glaring issue once the actual Hunger Games begin, for when there aren't battles happening, you are stuck with Peeta, Katniss and these little known people. It makes it so when danger happens, you don't really care about their lives. Which, I'll admit, sounds heartless, but considering all the interesting combatants in the last movie, it just seemed weird that these are the winners and they can't even compete with the nobodies.Overall: Rent on DVDThis series is entertaining, and being that I spoiled the rest of the films by reading the Wikipedia entries, it seems like a lot of interesting things are on the horizon. As for this film though, it is a transition film to me. It sets up for the big finish and throws a few things here and there to keep your attention, but it doesn't improve on the original in my opinion. That is why I think it is more so a rental. Though box office numbers say otherwise, I just felt like I was always waiting for something big and all I got was just enough to say what I paid for wasn't a complete waste. So, just wait until it comes on DVD, the next movie isn't due for another year and there is no real rush.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

83,jadepietro,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Lacking Heat,6,27 November 2013,"This film is mildly recommended.The second installment of The Hunger Games took a L-O-N-G time to ""catch fire"". The first hour and a half were a mere retread of the first film, setting up the same tired formula of ""them against us"". The theme of oppression continues to run deep in this saga, and I found the film oppressively smug. Seeing the same totalitarian state with its absurd and garish upper class taking advantage of the down-trodden lower class just grew monotonous and downright silly. The plot of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire still centers around the blood sport of the games, although its violence remains toned down for its targeted teenage PG-13 audience. In this sanitized sequel, the government is concerned about a possible rebellion from the working class peons and our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), becoming their spokesperson and savior. With that in mind, the evil leader of Panem, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) decides that Katniss is a problem that needs to be eliminated, along with her pretend boyfriend and former Hunger Games surviving partner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). So a new scheme is hatched to renew the arena killings once again in order to put our spunky gal in harm's way. (In this sequel, no longer is it just teenagers stalking their peers. Now death has no age limit. Why, there's even a granny thrown into the mix. This version of the Hunger Games is an equal opportunity employer.)Although this film has a new director this time around, Francis Lawrence, it's still the same old rehash, even if it's handled competently. The screenplay is serviceable at best, as are the production values. (I did enjoy some of the amusing over-the-top costume designs by Trish Summerville.) The film does have stronger performances than the first chapter did. The actors bring more energy to their one-dimensional roles. Particularly strong are Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and a comic Stanley Tucci. Sutherland is given more screen time and he makes a most vivid impression as the menacing overlord. However, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, and especially Toby Jones add little to the film. New cast members include the aforementioned Hoffman, Jena Malone, and Sam Claflin as the kindly stud. Ho-hum.As the two leads, Hutcherson is overshadowed by Lawrence, which is how it should be to enable those young female moviegoers to relate to the main character. Lawrence is a talented actress and she truly delivers a strong full-bodied performance, making the role more credible than it deserves. Hutcherson's Peeta is as bland as, well, pita.But it is not until the hunger games actually begin that the film becomes interesting and, dare I say, somewhat exciting. (That's the last hour of the film, so come late and you'll enjoy the film even more.) The jungle setting has the right level of creepiness and there is one sequence that is the film's highlight: a very well-edited segment involving a baboon attack that supplies the missing excitement that is sorely needed after the film's leisurely and lengthy beginnings. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a slow burn indeed. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
84,Sherazade,Even better than the first,9,27 May 2014,"right from the opening scene of a disturbed Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) deep in thought as she looks out over a lake during a hunt, you can tell that not only have the makers of this follow-up to 'The Hunger Games' spent more money on its production but you are also in for a more compelling and thought provoking thrill of a ride and that is exactly what was delivered. We meet Katniss as she ponders about an upcoming tour of the districts as she struggles to cope with haunting effects of post traumatic stress disorder and recurring daydreams of those she was forced to kill in order to survive. Halfway through her tour, she breaks down under stress (and pressure from the president) inadvertently causing the death of an innocent with rippling effects that consequentially lead to the rules of the upcoming ' Hunger Games' to be bent in order to punish her and any/all of her sympathizers.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
85,Seraphion,Nice sequel,7,10 July 2014,"The story continues from the first movie. Having won the 74th annual Hunger Games with Peeta Mallark, Katniss Everdeen is seen by the elements of revolutionaries as the symbol of hope for an uprising. But President Snow has anticipated this, and tries to eliminate her through forced natural and inevitable means by plunging her into the 75th Hunger Games.The flick starts with Katniss in the woods, kind of repetitive. President Snow threatens Katniss, warning not to have any thoughts of a revolution. The victors are then tasked to visit the other Districts starting from District 11, home of Rue, Katniss' real and loyal ally in the first movie. Peeta and Katniss are given speech cards, which they emotionally cast aside. Katniss' speech, mentioning she knew Rue, especially encouraged some folks of District 11. The whistling of the four-note mockingjay call, plus the hand gesture, now makes one an instant revolutionary. And in the presence of the Peacekeepers, that person gets apprehended and executed publicly on site. It's a great change considering at the end of the first movie we see many people did that publicly and in the presence of the Peacekeepers, and nothing happened.Back home to District 12, Katniss defends Gale from lashing. Peeta and Haymitch, their 'mentor', step in to calm the Peacekeeper commander down from executing the Capitol's darling victor Katniss. They succeeded, but the scene was televised nation wide, and becomes extra fuel for the revolutionaries to start local riots. Snow then alters the rules of the 75th Hunger Games to force Katniss into it, considering the loop that she is the only female winner from District 12. It's just typical of bad guy kingpins, Snow alters rules on the last minute, right before the 'reaping' of the tributes.Doing the showcase tradition on the eve before the games, Katniss, the 'girl on fire', again does her signature turns, this time making her dresses burns entirely, only to change appearance into a mockingjay dress. The mockingjay dress looks awesome story-wise, but looks ridiculously stupid in reality. Fortunately the angle turns into a head shot when Katniss says ""like a mockingjay"" LOL. Anyway, the dress gets the stylist to be beaten up by Peacekeepers in front of Katniss, just right as the start of the Games.On the games, Katniss and Peeta team up in alliance with Finnick and Mags from District 4. later in the night Mags gives her life on a poison fog so Finnick can carry the injured Peeta. Katniss has seen the fog mover closer in a fast pace but fails to determine in time that it was dangerous. This is odd, a survival expert of a Katniss doesn't seem to ever see a fog in her entire life. no natural fog move that fast, girl LOL :DMoving over on the Games, it looks like things are getting better for Katniss' alliance considering that the surviving tributes out of the alliance are only those two from District 2. Still, Katniss is uneasy at all others besides Peeta.At the midnight prior to the lightning strikes, Johanna knocks Katniss down but she doesn't kill her. Instead she makes a little cut in Katniss' arm while making a distraction so the District 2 tributes wouldn't bother Katniss. Experienced movie-goers should have guessed it right here. Yes Katniss have uneasy feelings on others besides Peeta. Yes Johanna was being a prick with her stunt in the elevator the other day. But why doesn't Johanna kill her right then then and there? She even hushed Katniss from moaning her pain so not to alert the District 2 tributes.Still katniss' uneasiness lingers on after she comes to. Katniss almost kill Finnick while he can't see her. But Finnick say the right words, a quote from Haymitch, proving that Finnick did not obtain the bangle through a foul way.On the lightning strikes, Katniss redirects on of them to the force field dome, destroying the arena, making a hole big enough for a transport plane get in and grab her unconscious body out. She wakes up and finds Finnick Haymitch, and Owen Davian.... no, wait, sorry, it's not MI:3 LOL, the head game maker, who was really secretly a revolutionary too.The main characters are developed well, but not so for the supporting characters. The other tributes are vaguely clear on their roles in the Games, especially when we compare them to the ones in the first flick.The Games itself are also somewhat unable to perform its emphasis of being the third Quarter Quell, considering it is very short-lived, only two days and not as much filled with action as the previous movie.The setting is not so supportive to the Games considering that there is only one open area, the main spot of the cornucopia.But then again this second installment is good in overall. Katniss gets to show action with her bow in the holographic training room. This balance the lack of action before the Games in the first movie.The scene of Katniss and Peeta talking in the lounge on the back of the train is a great use of setting and property, considering the angle of the shot depicting the moving train's movement at the rear.The costumes are overall well designed. Although I think the main Games outfit of tight suits are just ridiculous. Yet the other costumes are great, fitting the scenes. One thing to mention, the Peacekeeper costumes have nice detailing on the armor padding.Despite it's certain shortcomings, this is a good movie to watch, whether you've watch the first movie or not, or whether you've read the books or not. For me, I give the film an 8 out of 10 score.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
86,invisibleunicornninja,The best of the series - but that's not saying much.,5,26 March 2018,"Fun fact - the length of time it takes for The Hunger Games to start in this movie is 82 minutes. The length of ""South Park - Bigger Longer And Uncut"" (including credits) is 81 minutes. If you want to be entertained by this movie, I'd recommend playing both simultaneously and switching over to ""Catching Fire"" when South Park sadly ends. Plot - This movie is very boring for most of it. All of the events up until the Hunger Games start are boring, predictable (even if you haven't read the book), nonsensical, and forgettable. The story even when the Hunger Games actually starts is still pretty stupid but at least there's some entertainment to be had in the hilarious nonsense of stupid characters, continuity errors, bad effects all contributing to the poor execution of this sequel.Characters - Most of these characters act like total morons. None of them are very interesting. Most of the characters do the thing where they withhold information just to create some cheap conflict. I'm not a fan of watching stupid people run around on screen in idiotic situations. Some of the actors seemed to be into their roles, but most of them didn't seem to really care. Sights and Sounds - The sound design is ok, I guess. Most of the effects are very bad. The cinematography is terrible. The previous movie made so much money you'd've thought that they made enough money to buy a tripod. Evidently not as this movie is also extremely reliant on the handheld. The Games - The Hunger Games seem to be very improvisational even thought they're supposed to be a decades-old tradition. Everything is very random but at the same time simplistic. If you really think about any aspect of these movies they really fall apart. The story isn't very compelling or interesting or coherent. its mainly just a load of nonsense designed to entertain the target audience of 12-year-olds who liked the book.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
87,rannynm,The most intense and amazing film of the year.,10,26 November 2013,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the most intense and amazing film of the year. Catching Fire is the sequel to the amazing ""Hunger Games."" This film shows how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are, unfortunately, drawn once again to compete in a special 75th Hunger Games and how they are the reason for the rebellion in all the districts. Katniss has given people in the districts hope from her courage and that is brewing up to be a horrible thing for President Snow.What I love about this amazing film is the amazing wardrobe, hair and makeup. The incredible Trish Summerville, costume designer for the film, captures the vision perfectly in turning the book into a movie. Hair and makeup are bold and extravagant as well. I also like how well the cast works together and how well the film turns out overall. I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series.My favorite character is Katniss. There are lots of intriguing characters in this movie but what makes Katniss different are her incredible traits - her intelligence and her creativity are just a few. Katniss knows she needs to make alliances to stay alive and she quickly learns skills from them all. Jennifer Lawrence plays an amazing Katniss Everdeen. My favorite scene is when Katniss is on Caesar's talk show and reveals the incredible dress by spinning. The dress transforms from a pure white wedding gown to an incredible black fiery mocking jay dress with wings. It is truly stunning.This movie will make you cry and laugh. You'll just love it. I definitely cannot wait for the next one to come out. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars.

No longer are trilogies good enough as stand-alone movies, and Director Francis Lawerence's ""Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a case in point. Like The Hobbit movies, these movies seem more and more like TV episodes. In Catching Fire, there is an awful 1st half, followed by a weak retread of the same mindless reality TV survivor themes. Finish that off with a gaping ending.(spoilers) What are audiences treated to? Try a pack of baboons, electrocution, and acid-fog. Is this the best story-tellers can come up with?

91,brando647,CATCHING FIRE is an Impressive Improvement over the First HUNGER GAMES,9,26 July 2014,"The association of young adult novels with film adaptations is almost as sour as that of video games. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence and there has been a lot of garbage shoveled onto cinema screens hoping to catch the same insane (and unjustifiable) success as those horrible TWILIGHT films. But there is usually an exception to every rule and that exception is THE HUNGER GAMES. I only finally caved and watched the first film when I saw the unusually positive reviews surrounding it. The premise had seemed interesting enough but I figured it'd be nothing more than a painfully lame teenaged love drama. I was wrong and I actually enjoyed it. I wasn't sure it deserved the hype it got, but I still thought it was a surprisingly good movie. As successful as it was, it was an obvious choice for the studios to continue on with the rest of Suzanne Collins book series (which, for the record, I haven't read) and 2013 brought us the second installment: CATCHING FIRE. It begins almost immediately after the events of the first film. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have just won the 74th Hunger Games in a historic event where, for the first time, two victors have been declared. This upset has caused ripples throughout Panem (the dystopian nation setting of the film) and it's shown cracks in the seemingly limitless control of the Capitol. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) warns Katniss to maintain the lie that she and Peeta are madly in love (there's a bit of back story here that I'm can't be bothered to covergo watch the first movie for the whole story on it) so the double win can be attributed to the Capitol's kindness to a pair of lovers as opposed to a ruse that allowed them to alter the rules and survive. The lives of Katniss and everyone she loves is at stake should she fail. Meanwhile, there are rumblings of rebellion throughout the twelve districts, inspired by Katniss and Peeta's success. Katniss has become a symbol of rebellion against the Capitol and, in an effort to squash any shred of hope behind it, Snow declares that the 75th Hungar Games, the Quarter Quell, will consist of surviving tributes from games past.You know how I know CATCHING FIRE (well, the whole saga, really) is any good? Because it takes so much just to explain the basic plot to someone who's unfamiliar, and there's still so much I left out due to spoilers and length constraints. And the fact that, once you watch the movie, it all makes perfect sense. It's not overly complicated for the sake of making it seem complex. It's actually an incredibly good story for a young adult film. The first HUNGER GAMES was good, but nothing mind- blowing. It was a cool premise that delivered on it's novel premise of teens being forced to kill each other for the amusement of the incredibly wealthy while establishing an interesting world with a rich history and bizarre culture that, when you see where our own culture seems to be heading, sort of seems believable despite it's over-the-top nature. CATCHING FIRE takes everything established in the first film and starts building a more engaging story over it. The first movie was all about introducing us to Panem and the Hunger Games. The second movie lights the powder keg that will lead to rebellion with an almost unwilling Katniss at the forefront. Katniss has become a very layered character since we've last seen her. She's survived a traumatic experience and she's still haunted by the fact that she was forced to murder other tributes. She's got a bit of post-traumatic stress, and her problems are just beginning. The end of the Games was just the beginning. Now she's got to go on the victor's tour and keep the illusion that her and Peeta are in love or Snow will essentially murder everyone she loves. That's a lot to process. She's willing to go along because, at the start of the film, she's only interested in saving herself and her loved ones. But she will need to start thinking more globally by the end. The districts have started viewing her as a figure of rebellion and they've started showing their support, and Snow has noticed. CATCHING FIRE isn't so much about the Games (though Katniss is once again dropped into the life-or-death competition) as it is about Katniss evolving into the ""Mockingjay""the symbol of the new rebellion against the Capitol.I hate to make this comparison because the HUNGER GAMES movies aren't on the same footing as the epic STAR WARS films (wellI suppose it is light years better than the prequels) but CATCHING FIRE is the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK to the first film's STAR WARS. It's a more serious, brooding film with more at stake and the foundation laid for some grand finale to come in the final two films. It even ends on a sort of cliff- hanger. The production value is amped up and the tone is more mature, despite the bizarre fashion stylings of the Captiol crowd. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) still looks like a psychedelic Barbie doll but even she has moments of humanity shine through when she sees how the Capitol has essentially condemned Katniss and Peeta to death. CATCHING FIRE feels like an almost completely different film from the first. It's emotional and it's way more engaging. Honestly, while the Games are the main attraction in these films, I was more interested in everything that happened before Katniss was dropped into the arena this time around. I was so impressed and entertained by CATCHING FIRE that I will actually go to the theater for the next installment, MOCKINGJAY.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

And, he hopes Katniss will be defeated and not win giving Hope to the people to overthrow him.So here we go watching Katniss prepare for the new Games. She knows she must go through with it or her family will be murdered. She is grateful that, this time, young children will not be killed as in the last Games. And, gone is the benefit that a previous Hunger Games winner will enjoy a life of ease. Now all previous winners must participate and they don't like it. The first half of this is slow, but we are watching Katniss deal with everything and tension and suspense abound. The thing that struck me were the dialogues as they kept me riveted to my seat. The dialogues were spot on with honesty and subtle anger and humor at times. An example of subtle anger: Katniss tells the President, ""why don't you kill me now?"" Of course Snow would like to, but he needs everything to be legal and so the Quell. Snow still fears Hope among the people and Katniss as the cause of it, and that must be put to rest.We are introduced to the other players, but once the Games begin, we only see bits and pieces of them. What we don't see are the people watching on TV like we saw in the first movie. All in all, this is excellent drama and we have the same fears as Katniss and are wary of everything around us. um, I mean her. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is the one we are most wary about as he is the Games Master and pulls all strings (read obstacles) during the Games. We need to watch him very carefully. One of the most dramatic scenes is when Katniss is introduced to the people again, and she comes out in a wedding dress and what happens next tells President Snow that he is being mocked. Great stuff. The acting by all is excellent but, Jennifer Lawrence must be singled out as she is perfect. And, the questions begin: will Katniss go with Team Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) or Team Gayle (Liam Hemsworth)? Will the Hunger Games finally stop? Will the revolution actually take place? Inquiring minds are at it again.The ending is too abrupt and we don't like it, but we are reminded that other sequels are in play and we will find out more in the next movie and we can't wait.

93,moviexclusive,"Balancing taut emotion with tense action, this middle chapter of the 'Hunger Games' counts among some of the best dystopian fiction",8,20 November 2013,"Despite being based on a young adult novel, Gary Ross' 'The Hunger Games' belonged to one of the rare few which managed to attract a crossover audience from all quadrants, winning the praise of both critics and audiences alike. It did not pander to its core demographic of teenagers; rather, it played as a smart and gripping dystopian thriller set in a futuristic America called Panem which was run as a totalitarian state with one 'Capitol' and 12 districts. It was also a socio-political allegory on propaganda and violence as reality show entertainment, especially since the Games essentially pitted young boys and girls from the districts against each other in a fight to the last one standing.'Catching Fire', the second instalment in Suzanne Collins' hugely popular series, assumes right from the start that its audience is familiar with the context and the events from the first movie. The script by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn opens the same way as Collins' book, and that is by continuing right where its predecessor stopped. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow tribute cum romantic interest in the area Peeta Mellack (Josh Hutcherson) are back in District 12 after successfully winning the sympathies of their televised audience and defeating the rules of the game, but President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is neither amused nor impressed by their sleight-of-hand.Unbeknownst to Katniss, her act of 'love' for Peeta has given people in the districts hope, and with that the courage to rise up against their oppressors. Whereas at first she was fighting for herself and her loved ones, Katniss has since become so much more, a symbol to galvanise the masses - if she had the tenacity to do so. It takes guts and no lack of clarity to vision for a 'Hunger Games' movie to make its audience wait more than an hour before the said competition actually gets along, but by doing so, Beaufoy, deBruyn and director Francis Lawrence sets this second chapter by making it more meaningful - and we dare say heartfelt - than the first movie.More than half the screen time is therefore devoted to a tense and riveting exploration of the allegory behind Collins' books as parable about inequity and class warfare. From the sight of Peacekeepers enforcing harsh and brutal martial-like law on the citizens in the various districts to the indifference of the people in the Capitol, (Francis) Lawrence balances incident and exposition to stir up the indignation of his audience towards the sheer injustice of the totalitarian regime under Snow (which Sutherland, to his credit, portrays with chilling but never over-the-top menace). And yet, even though the scale on which the events unfold has grown much wider, Lawrence never loses the earlier picture's intimate focus on Katniss.Yes, the character beats are still there - and if we may add, stronger than before. As she realises just how things have changed and will change around her, the 17-year-old Katniss has to decide if she will choose to cower under Snow's threat of her family or stand up for something more. That's no easy decision to make, and right from the beginning with a scene where Katniss goes into an anxiety attack recalling a kill she made in the earlier Games, there is never any doubt that she is no more than an ordinary teenager thrust and called upon to be brave beyond belief in these extraordinary circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence is truly excellent here, equal parts vulnerable and steely, and only the hardest of hearts will not be stirred to empathy.Just so because it is the 75th Hunger Games, Snow and his new games planner Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) get to hatch a plan to put Katniss back into a new arena. The third 'Quarter Quell' will draw its contestants from among the pool of victors from the district, and since Katniss is the only female victor from District 12, she is automatically chosen. As she finds herself back at the Capitol, Katniss also finds herself amongst a more idiosyncratic bunch - among them the pretty blond Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and his octogenarian mentor Mags (Lynn Cohen), the straight-talking rebel Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), and a pair of oddball inventor-types nicknamed Nuts and Volts (Amanda Plummer and Jeffrey Wright).Alliances will once again need to be forged in the field in order to survive, but besides the constant suspicion of betrayal, Katniss and Peeta now have to contend with more than just their competitors - the environment is a rigged jungle arena with poison fogs and killer monkeys as 'elements of nature'. It isn't any of the filmmakers' fault if the Games this time round lacks the earlier's knife-edge sense of danger; compared to the first book, Collins' doesn't make the Games count for as much as it did, for the very reason that they are but a means to an end, which serves as probably the worst kept twist ending that lays the groundwork for the third and concluding instalment 'Mockingjay'.Indeed, those expecting a repeat of the earlier movie will likely find themselves disappointed. The straightforward thrills of Ross' film are somewhat more muted this time round; ditto the heady romantic triangle of Katniss, Peeta and Katniss' childhood sweetheart and best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). But in its place is a much meatier piece of sci-fi, built on compelling themes of tyranny, revolt and most of all personal fortitude, anchored in a fascinating lead performance by one of the best young adult actresses in Hollywood today. And all that pre-production trouble that saw Francis Lawrence stepping into Ross' shoes? Well, there's not even a hint of that here, and if anything, it's surer in tone and pacing and devoid of the annoying shaky-cam stylistics Ross employed.True to its title therefore, this middle instalment genuinely catches fire, igniting the stage for what promises to be an epic conclusion.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

95,quincytheodore,A solid sequel and more than a game.,8,29 November 2013,"Crafty direction, good casting and prominent acting on its belt, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an illustrious sequel with solid aspects throughout. Screenplay moves in tight pace, and to its credit, manages to fuse together complex social and political issues with the raw battle royal action sequences. This adds more tension and depth to the macabre rather than simple mindless killing game of its peers, slowly drawing audience to invest more on the characters' and their predicaments. It's a more polished, better structured and choreographed movie than the first, odds are fans and audience in general will favor this second installment.Fire of rebellion has been lit after the last Hunger Games. To ensure it won't spread any further President Snow (Donald Sutherland) makes Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), winners of the last Hunger Games, into glorified celebrities. They are tasked to pacify the crowd with faux romance, however things soon go awry and the hunt for lives begins anew. In almost mocking manner, it portrays contemporary and relatable issue with this other world analog. The overabundance of Capitol and constant oppression of lower districts are shown remarkably. It takes its time to convey the motivation of the characters and in the long run gives more profoundness to the ensuing Hunger Games.Jennifer Lawrence does a good job as the leading protagonist, it's not often a woman has the role of the strong main character without blowing it out of proportion or resorting into promiscuous shots. She looks capable and also captivating yet possesses a restrained charm. The wardrobe does help tremendously in creating her persona, but she plays the role with good forte. .Other more veteran actors, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Woody Harrelson or Donald Sutherland provide solid performances. Each of them plays their role with distinguished air. Younger newcomers provide exuberance and spunk, I personally like Johanna character as with her unbridled profanities. It'd be better to showcase more of the participants of the Games, but considering they need to trim the length into palatable time, it's fairly understandable.Setting for the movie is quite excellent, dyeing most of its vistas with greyish tone, in exception of several more outlandish settings which is sprayed with near excessive colors. It doesn't forget to bring ridiculous make up, hairdo and costumes for the opulence display, perhaps to insinuate more of the social commentary. Wardrobe has seen relatively stranger clothing than most movies, they're just slightly more futuristic but still believable as casual wear. It doesn't use much grandiose effect which is fine since the human aspects are more apparent. Things would be less engaging if it goes into exaggerated futuristic theme.Actions sequences are steadily performed smoother than the first title, there are no crazy stunts to be had nor does it use overwhelming amount of CG. Battle royal theme can be ironically redundant if the movie used unnecessary complex action. Catching Fire cleverly opts for more consistency in choreography and better pacing. Its theme song is quiet catchy, although somewhat repetitive. Overall ambiance of the movie is delivered in solemn hymn, which might not stand out too much on its own but fits pretty well.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire offers superior quality on all its elements; everything works well and even better together. Furthermore, it doesn't try to be anything it is not, only improving from what it already has. Not a lot of sequels, or adventure movie as a whole, can achieve that.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
96,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Significantly stronger than the first film, but still suffers from the same plot holes and contrivances.",6,13 December 2013,"""Katniss!"" the crowd screams, giddy with excitement. In just a short year, Jennifer Lawrence has rocketed beyond the fame of her most iconic character so far. While she has been one of my favourite 'it-girls' in recent years for her likable personality and well-rounded career, it does concern me that the backlash is just around the corner. Will 2014 be less kind to her? Will she fade? Will the hysteria just grow stronger? Fortunately, she does deserve the praise she's getting, even if it does feel quite premature since she could potentially win a second Oscar with American Hustle. I hate to admit that I'm getting a little fatigued with her desperate cries and screeches that were overused in Catching Fire, but perhaps that's the director's fault and not Jennifer Lawrence's. She's certainly gained a star presence that shrouds her in an alluring aura that I hope she'll continue to flaunt with sincerity. There's not enough of that these days.I really disliked the first Hunger Games film. As someone who's never touched one of the books, the film exists in a world where it assumes the book is the audience's bible. Far too much goes unexplained, unjustified and taken for granted. Fortunately, Catching Fire finds its footing, if not entirely recovered from that difficult intro of the first film where all the dramatic exposition in the world won't cover it, this film is simply in much better hands. With Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt behind the wheel of the script, I can trust them to have the material make as much sense as possible and bring the potential out of every character of its crowded ensemble (though I still don't know who Liam Hemsworth is supposed to be). Gone is the infamous shaky-cam and in comes a more confident visual approach. What saves it most is the on-point editing that provides much more comfortable pacing, especially as we're treated to an enjoyably creative montage as Katniss and Peeta tour the districts.While the first film didn't know what to do with its moral stance on death and killing, Catching Fire explores more human depths as Katniss struggles with PTSD. The film is moody with its heavy emotion but it doesn't come from a stake-less teenage angst part of the characters but from a tension in the fragile fabric of their world. It still scratches the surface of its potential since it can only redeem its predecessor a limited amount, but it's an admirable attempt. However, it suffers from typical plot holes and contrivances that the first film struggled with too. I'm sure these ideas are covered in the book, but the film really should've pushed the justification. I'll let go 'why don't they kill each other in training' but why do they make allies if they'll have to kill each other in the end anyway? I just don't buy that trust. Suzanne Collins sure lives in a logic of her own as far as her self-preservation theme plants her. It just gives me a headache. I may not stick for Mockingjay, but Catching Fire is a relatively enjoyable and involving experience.6/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

98,OJT,Surprisingly better and more interesting than the first,8,20 November 2013,"First of all, I haven't read the books, and didn't know what to expect either from the first or the second of the Hunger Games outings. So I base this purely on the cinema experience.I watched this in a full cinema on the world premiere day, and found that the 2,5 hour long film wasn't too long at all. I tend to hate long movies, but this story is told in such an attractive way, that it keeps you seated. A couple of scenes are very effective and scary, others are really deep felt and moving. A film not only for youngsters, but a film which can entertain anyone, with twist and turns. Giving afterthoughts, and maybe also a greater understanding of importance of a free society without Big Brother watching you everywhere.I'm impressed with both the acting and the plot. It's somehow a genius idea this, to arrange some kind of reality show in a future dystopia version of George Orwell's 1984. The actors are living the film, so credits to to director. No surprise. He's done it before. I like how this film nods to a lot of classic movies and stories. Not only 1984, but there's lots, like the Old Testament of the Bible, The Birds, Lord of the Flies a.s.o. As a film buff, I enjoy this.Impressive enough, I found this better than the first, and despite the odd ending before the third, it'll be interesting to see the next in a years time. This unlike The Hobbit, which have thrown me off completely after the boring first dinner movie. Though this being a transport lap before the next, an 8/10 here is impressive. Good film making, and more interesting than most garbage served the younger generations in cinemas. Believe the hype!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
99,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Pointless, horrible and a trashy attempt to draw in cash",1,6 September 2014,"Alright, where to begin... I hate the Hunger Games franchise. The books are boring and disgusting garbage, so one day I watched the film to see if there was any improvement... nope, not a bit. It was just a melodramatic rather ugly-looking girl murdering other kids for an hour. The movie should be titled, ""Two hours of my life I'll never get back"".Now my sister told me to see the sequel, saying it was an amazing action-packed film... it was just as bad as the first, and they did a horrible cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears, how could they use such an amazing song and associate it with this load of crud? If you like the dystopian genre, try Soylent Green, that's a much better movie with a real story and a truly amazing film. I had a nice, big bonfire last week and burned all the DVD's and books of this pathetic franchise I could find, now that's 'catching fire'! It's an extremely overrated series, not very good, and I honestly wouldn't watch it again or read it if you payed me! Don't waste your time with this garbage, it really isn't worth it. Most of the sheep who love this series will look back later in life and say, ""what the heck did I like this series for?"" I mean, sure, you've gotta give the production company credit for drawing in such an audience for poor suckers who think this sci-fi Twilight repeat is some beautiful and romantic masterpiece, but still... and going back and reading the positive reviews, it made me very worried for society. Some reviews call it ""the best film of 2013, the most sad, romantic and heart-pumping movie I've ever seen!"" SERIOUSLY!? The acting was terrible, the soundtrack boring, the plot unoriginal, frankly overall I'd much rather perform self-surgery than have to watch this load of crud ever again!

100,Troy_Campbell,"Mature, intelligent and hugely enjoyable.",8,22 November 2013,"Katniss is back. But despite surviving the 74th Hunger Games and being reunited with her family in the Victor's Village within District 12, all is not well for the strong-willed heroine. Keeping up appearances with fellow survivor Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is a burden, holding on to her true love Gale (Liam Hemsworth) is a struggle, and keeping her family safe from the malevolent President Snow (a sneering Donald Sutherland) is increasingly difficult. Yet that's not the worst of it; Snow has declared the 75th year of the Games (aka the Quarter Quell) as a past-victor event only. So it's round two under the dome for Katniss, Peeta and 22 previous winners, most of who are trained killers.Before The Hunger Games was released two years ago the general feeling was that it was just the next young-adult novel adaptation attempting to cash in on the Twilight phenomenon. How wrong we were. Following on from the magnificent original and determined that their franchise would be built on maturity and intelligence, Lionsgate went all out to get the screenplay right, employing Oscar-winning writers Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine). As a result, Catching Fire refuses to pander to the lowest portion of the target demographic by evading clichés, melodrama and shallow sentiment; instead instilling a sense of real peril and genuine emotion into the proceedings, thus generating a level of gravitas seldom seen in these types of films. Replacing Gary Ross in the director's chair, Francis Lawrence (Constantine) proves himself to be an outstanding choice. Demonstrating restraint in the quieter moments and a flair for gripping action in the louder sections, Lawrence feels completely at ease with this blend of drama and thrills. Understandably, he has now been hired to finish off the series (which will see the third book split into two movies). Although there's no dispute about who is the cherry on top: Jennifer Lawrence. Classy, fierce, passionate and commanding, last year's Lead Actress Oscar winner reinforces how good she really is with another mesmerising performance in a role that is now impossible to imagine with anyone else filling it. With Mockingjay parts 1 and 2 coming out in the next two Novembers, Katniss won't be leaving our memories anytime soon.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
101,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The only great sequel to the original Hunger Games.,9,18 December 2017,"Catching Fire perpetuates itself to be 'The Empire Strikes Back' of the Hunger Games canon, and on that front I can say it definitely succeeds there: the set-pieces are bigger the perils are raised to the next level and the baddies are hell-bent on destroying the last remnants of hope remaining in Panem.The first of three sequels to the original film, Catching Fire is far and wide the most beautifully shot of the franchise thanks to its utilisation of 35mm and IMAX-65mm celluloid cameras that makes the images on-screen wonderfully realised and applies the scope and scale of the action sequences. It makes you feel like the action is something monumental to behold.As far as sequels go, is this the best one ever made?

Having inspired rebellions in the districts, President Snow threatens Katniss to enact a drama that she is in love with Peeta in fear she might continue to inspire more rebellions against the Capitol which cannot be afforded. As Katniss fails to do this, Snow makes use of a special provision available in the 75th version of Hunger Games where the victors will be selected from the existing pool of victors. Snow wants to destroy her character forcing her to kill her friends while the world watches or perish in the game herself. Either way, Snow is slated to win.he Second half of the movie focus on the survival games as enemies becomes allies and allies turn foes ready to kill you the moment you are caught off guard.From the director of I am Legend and Water for Elephants, Francis Lawrence , Catching Fire makes sure your entertained right from the beginning. The story is catchy along with outstanding cinematography and impressive special effects. The first half of the movie is a drag with the build up to the action that is entirely in the second half alone. Dialogues are crisp. Background score lives up to the requirements. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show by balancing emotion with action in her role.

104,brchthethird,A significant improvement over its predecessor,8,14 November 2014,"CATCHING FIRE is a marked improvement over THE HUNGER GAMES, in everything from the script and story, to the visuals and cinematography. The story continues to follow Katniss (and Peeta) as they do a victory tour of Panem. However, things are not as happy as you think might be. Revolution is brewing, and the people in charge want to nip it in the bud. This is solved by having a special Hunger Games for the 75th year. Instead of fresh tributes, they will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. What follows is a fascinating and engaging look at a dystopian society, the battle for survival, etc. This definitely held my interest better than the limpid previous installment. One thing that's immediately noticeable is the change in visual style, and the way they shot the movie. Instead of a lot of hand-held and shaky camera, the shots are better composed, wider and more fluid. This is especially helpful in maintaining a sense of place in the arena. I also liked how they gave more time for character development, even for President Snow. They even manage to give most of the new characters their due on screen as well. Standouts were Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin as Finnick O'Dair(?). The only I really don't care for in these movies is the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. Twilight already did it, and every movie since has had some variation on it. Overall, this movie is much better than the first one though, and the final two installments will be directed by the same person (Francis Lawrence). They do a better job with the technical aspects, handling of the story and thematic elements and a much better job of building the world of Panem.

Some scenes are frighteningly relevant: using celebrity/royal weddings to distract the populace from the real problems in their lives; and a very cheeky take-off on competitive reality shows.The second half is a radical change from the first in a ""Survivor""-like contest in a jungle.

107,PartialMovieViewer,Superbly Hot,10,8 December 2013,"I thought, ""The Hunger Games"", was well done and tastybut this, ""Catching Fire"", sequel is char-broiled and full of flavor. The first movie ushered in a group of contenders through danger-laden challenges, concluding with the losers violently avoiding immortality while the few victors lived out their existences in relative splendor. Katniss and Hawthorne, our heroes, endure and overcome their struggles only to find their rewards of luxury are but a thinly veiled shroud. This shroud is used as a political wedge by a totalitarian government to deflect the woes of a desperate and starving public. In, ""Catching Fire"", the battle continues. At first the presumed omnipotence of an overbearing government appears insurmountable. All challenges to the regime's president are quieted swiftly and permanently. The masses are leaderless and with little hope. I do not want to destroy the story for those who have not seen it yet, but Katniss is the key. She is the phoenix rising – the real hope and not an empty platitude. This entire ""Hunger Games"" Saga is turning out to be a surprisingly good chronicle – and even more surprising – Hollywood is actually producing this? Kudos to them. I am probably reading too much into this, but I do hope they do follow the author's intent at least. I sense she is on the road to leading a rebellion, and removing the tyrannical thumb of government from majority's back and hopefully restoring some form of individual freedom to the populace.

108,khanbaliq2,A tightly paced science-fiction adventure that's a success in every way.,8,17 January 2014,"I was curious when I found out that a different director was going to be hired to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games (2012). I liked what Gary Ross did with the first film though there was certainly a shortage of thrills. When Francis Lawrence was hired to direct Catching Fire in May of 2012 I became skeptical. He directed three films before and they had some problems. Constantine (2005) is stylish and entertaining but slightly misses the mark. I Am Legend (2007) is mildly invigorating but unmemorable. Water For Elephants (2011) is an interesting but formulaic romantic drama. But Lawrence clearly got better because Catching Fire is a sophisticated film that's filled with thrills. Lawrence got to work with a budget of $140 million, which is almost twice the budget of The Hunger Games. It shows because improvements in sets and special-effects are noticeable from the beginning. The districts are shown with detail. The Quarter Quell arena looks fantastic. The procession of the chariots makes you feel as though you're in the Capitol, the futuristic Rome. It's clear that the filmmakers put as much effort in the political intrigue of the story as in the action. The performances from Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman are very good. Sutherland brings a sense of menace to Coriolanus Snow that wasn't really there in the first film. It's like in the great 1985 war drama Come And See because the acting is so good that watching characters interact is a treat. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a more confident performance this time. Her promotional tour for the film was certainly eventful. She talked about her hair, weight issues, kissing, on-set injuries and so on. The videos sure were funny. Josh Hutcherson got better too. Now he's not the bland Peeta Mellark of the first film. He has more to do, and he's becoming a real companion for Katniss Everdeen. It's interesting that Jena Malone got the part of Johanna Mason. She's been in several good films but she hasn't had this level of fame before. Malone definitely makes an impression in the arena. The pair of Malone and Sam Claflin lights up the grim situation of the Quarter Quell. Claflin clearly studied how to use a trident, and he gained weight for the role. He does a good job as Finnick Odair, and he sure does look different from his role in Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). James Newton Howard's music score for Catching Fire offers a good mix of stoic melodies and bold action cues. The entertaining soundtrack features some of pop and rock's biggest names. The singles included are Atlas by Coldplay, Elastic Heart by Sia Furler, and We Remain by Christina Aguilera. But my favorite tracks are Mirror by Ellie Goulding and Shooting Arrows At The Sky by Santigold. With Catching Fire Francis Lawrence managed to appease both the fan base and the viewers unfamiliar with the story. It's a step up from the first film in every way. The costumes are better too, though I didn't like the new Peacekeeper uniforms. In a world after Harry Potter Catching Fire stands out from other schmaltzy young adult films. It's an intelligent blockbuster that's also brutal. That's a real success if you consider its PG-13 rating. I recommend it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
109,ivo-cobra8,A good damn sequel of The Hunger Games franchise!,10,15 December 2015,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is a pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. Francis Lawrence did a great directing job with camera shooting every each corner including an IMAX version making a perfectly shoot of every edge of corners. This film is actually brilliant and perfect. Jennifer is beautiful and Josh is amazing and I can't say anything for Liam he is just outstanding. My favorite film by far. I really enjoyed this movie I love the story. I did laugh when the old man whistle while Katniss was giving speech and got shot by the guards. I love it when they where in the jungle. I totally love this film, this was truly brilliant a masterpiece in my opinion. The thing that bothered me in this movie was the first hour was dragging too long and was boring, in the first movie The Hunger Games we are getting faster, but by this one takes too long and it ends with a cliffhanger for to see Mockingjay Part 1 & 2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever.This film is great, it is as great as the first movie, but I still think the original film is better than this one, because the first movie has an happy ending, this one ends with a cliffhanger. What I love in this movie is sacrifice in the 75 Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back thrown in to 75th Hunger Games and I love the team on the island and all dangerous in this island. I love this movie I love both of the movies, I own them on Blu-ray discs and I love them both so much. So they are both fun to watch and they do have joy in it. The key to the success of ""Catching Fire"" is its steadfast adherence to the novel's central theme: Surviving the Games and leaving the arena are not mutually exclusive. The film takes us back to the dreary District 12, where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have literally and figuratively been set apart from the rest of the community. Their newfound wealth and luxurious homes in the ""Victor's Village"" leave them physically isolated from those who continue to suffer and die under the Capitol's brutal regime; more importantly, their experiences in the Games have left them both with acute post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Catching Fire""'s tone evolves smoothly from barely contained anxiety to foreboding to betrayal and even grim acceptance without the use of exposition -- a difficult feat for a film that is driven by action rather than dialogue. There is really no dead weight among the cast this time. Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the aforementioned director) keeps shining bright as the reluctant Katniss, while Hutcherson imparts a level of depth to his character that was sorely missing in the first movie. Sassy Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), who uses her TV spot to curse at the Capitol audience, is a welcome foil for serious Katniss, and fan favorite Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin is awesome charismatic) wields a trident like nobody's business. Francis Lawrence made a wise decision in emphasizing the camaraderie that takes place in the largely tropical arena: It would have been a more difficult feat to distinguish this film from a watery version of the last had Katniss played the game alone. I am giving this movie a solid 10.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a 2013 American dystopian science fiction adventure film based on Suzanne Collins' dystopian novel, Catching Fire (2009), the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy.

110,Anurag-Shetty,Just as good as the original.,9,12 December 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire continues with the story of Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence), 'The Girl on Fire'. After the events of The Hunger Games, Katniss & Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson) go on a victory tour to the districts of Panem. In the various districts, people look up to Katniss as a symbol of hope. Fearing that a rebellion may be round the corner, President Snow(Donald Sutherland) along with Plutarch Heavensbee(Philip Seymour Hoffman) come up with a plan to get rid of Katniss. They organize The Hunger Games: Quarter Quell, in celebration of the 75th Hunger Games & throw, Katniss, Peeta & a couple of other victors back into the arena. Katniss' worst nightmare comes true as she has to take part in the Games, yet again. Now, it is up to Katniss & Peeta, with a little help from mentor, Haymitch Abernathy(Woody Harrelson), to survive at any cost. This film was as engaging as the original. The Games had many more lethal threats, this time around. This made it a lot more fun & thrilling to watch. The ending of the film felt abrupt & left me somewhat disappointed. Other than this teeny, tiny flaw, the film was flawless from start to finish. Once again, the star of the show is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence carries the film on her shoulders. Josh Hutcherson is brilliant as Peeta Mellark. Liam Hemsworth is great as Gale Hawthorne. Woody Harrelson is spectacular as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is outstanding as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is mind blowing as Plutarch Heavensbee. Elizabeth Banks is hysterical as Effie Trinket. Lenny Kravitz is effective as Cinna. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Caesar Flickerman. Sam Claflin is impressive as Finnick Odair. Jena Malone is good as Johanna Mason. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a must watch. Enjoy the wild ride!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
111,fernandoschiavi,"Catching Fire works better the idea of a darker dystopian future, move the franchise ahead and discuss important tpics of our society",8,6 March 2021,"With the success achieved by the franchise in cinema, it was given carte blanche for this ""Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" to explore the dystopian universe of Panem in a deeper way and to raise the punishments and challenges imposed on heroes at various levels, in a more cinematic experience. heavy and courageous, precisely because of its politicized nature, something very rare among blockbusters aimed at the youth audience. With the change of direction and an almost unhealthy injection of money (Catching Fire it cost twice as much as the first), two of the original's biggest problems have been completely solved: the camera-in-hand steering and the special effects. Francis Lawrence works action without trying to invent and, in this way, is very efficient in clearly identifying the characters and, when necessary, creating the suspense that the tape requires. The director still does well by joining action scenes, which do not hide the violence of the environment, with others of a certain contemplation. There are several moments when we stop to observe the beauty of the place, either in the forest next to the district where everyone struggles to survive, or in games where the goal is to kill the person next to you. On the side of the effects, we no longer see the terrible ""genetically altered dogs"" of the climax of the first film and, in their place, we are introduced to very convincing mandrels (a kind of baboon with a colorful snout that actually exists), in addition to shots of the Capital and Arena that actually work.Contrary to many sequels that seem to get worse, ""Catching Fire"" brings new elements and great developments to the story of Katniss Everdeen. Helped by a book that was certainly designed by Suzanne Collins to have a cinematic structure, and bypassing elements that could take the focus away from the games and psychological conflicts of the characters - like gigantic and empty set pieces or even the tasteless love triangle Katniss-Peeta-Gale (Liam Hemsworth) - we have the great script by Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3) even though he doesn't have the courage to take any chances. Everything in the book is in the movie. The dialogues are there intact, the sequences in the exact order of the novel, the action scenes, the sacrifices, the secrets, the twists and turns: it is like watching the book in motion. Usually, this is a problem, because the production, excited about the success of the first film and the legion of fans, could have easily set foot in their hands, but in Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the biggest consequence of all this loyalty is a film longer than necessary, plague, incidentally, that fell on the first as well. However, this problem does not detract from the narrative's vigor when it actually begins, although that beginning takes too long to happen and a montage a little less concerned with fan reaction could have prevented it.The second film is much more than ""people in an arena trying to kill each other"". While the original was basically an American version of the Japanese Battle Royale, the new one invests heavily in political history and in building a climate for the impending revolution. Here, Katniss deals with the consequences of what she was forced to do by the government in the first feature. These consequences are precisely what move the plot, both for the character and for the nation under a totalitarian state controlled by the lush and powerful Capital. The consequences bring responsibilities - and the theme of the dystopian future, in which each citizen indulges in the daily struggle of survival, gains more epic contours while the government encircles freedom of expression with a firm pulse, dispatching scouts to the streets to control demonstrations and keep if in power.Definitely, the biggest success of the film is to accept the dark tone and know how to work it, considering that some adaptations tend to soften the darker content of a work. Following the format of the first film, the first part (more than the first hour of projection) is dedicated almost exclusively to presenting the new situation and developing the characters of this ""new universe"". Giving space also to present new characters that will be of great importance from that part of the games onwards, showing that The Hunger Games was a child thing. It is also important to highlight how the script treats the protagonist. The events of the first film did not go unnoticed. Katniss from Catching Fire is a traumatized person with everything she has experienced, who finds it difficult to get on with her normal life - which is made worse by the fact that she is forced to go on tour as government propaganda. Even so, the filmmakers were careful not to distort the protagonist: Katniss follows a strong, safe and courageous character, to the point of challenging the president himself. She is that honorable rebel with values that the cinema and the public so much like - no wonder, she is the great force and the main appeal of the entire series.The ""tour"" and the contrast of the situations experienced by the districts and the Capital are overwhelming for everyone. Gradually, even the alienated Effie (Elizabeth Banks) begins to understand how devastating the status quo of that world is - except for the elite who live in the Capital, far from the suffering of the majority, whose trials sustain their luxuries. The fighting only starts with almost an hour and a half of film already elapsed and the characters themselves recognize that worrying about romance in such a situation would be ridiculous - which adds yet another element of tragedy to the situation of young people, who should not carry such a heavy load on your shoulders. In fact, when we meet Katniss and Peeta, both are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome and, through their condition, we come to understand more of Haymitch's suffering (Woody Harrelson). In fact, the very cynical tone with which director Francis Lawrence conducts the narrative is very reminiscent of the mentor's state of mind in the original feature.And anyone who thinks that the Quaternary Massacre is just a repetition of what had already been done is wrong, with the heroes fighting for their lives again. This, in fact, happens. However, the scales involved are bigger (the poisoned smoke, the monkeys and the idea that the arena is a clock that launched the dangers every hour is very good). For the first time, we have the feeling of a broader action unfolding, a real network of intrigues against official leaders. It is precisely at this point that Catching Fire proves to be superior to The Hunger Games. Violence is again present, but in a more subliminal way and inserted in a relevant context. If in the first film we had children and adolescents killing each other indiscriminately, without the necessary reflection for such acts to be perceived and discerned by their main audience - more or less the same age as the characters on the scene - this time there is a conspiracy full of ramifications, with effects and consequences. Everything is part of a plan, even if it is not revealed to the satisfaction. But the important thing is that there is, therefore, something to be told, which finally draws the viewer to the center of the plot. However, ""The Hunger Games - Catching Fire"" fails to splurge on the edition of the games that are part of the film, propagating that the game will be much more brutal because it has only the winners of the past editions, but what we see are very weak characters to have won a past edition of the game.Once again, the cast stands out and makes everything gain depth and credibility. The film wouldn't work if it weren't for the talent and charisma of Jennifer Lawrence, who has a unique responsibility here. It is the suffering of her Katniss that is put to the public at all times and it is her emotional scars that are exposed in ways that border on sadism, until her final resolution, in which a powerful look from the young actress strikes us in a direct way and the change that took place inside Katniss is palpable. The young actress has a rare ability to say a lot with a simple look and conveys, often without words, the internal conflict of a defiant young woman, who needs to be strong, but at the same time suffers from everything she has gone through and still doesn't really understand the grandeur of the setting in which it was inserted.Catching Fire works better the idea of the dystopian future, planting the seeds for the third part. It is nevertheless interesting to see serious themes being addressed in works of this nature - there is, in addition to the obvious plot about the relationship between the government and the people, a clear criticism of the invasion of privacy and the culture of veneration of celebrities so in vogue nowadays. What is seen, therefore, is not a sequence that is limited to walking in circles, but one that prefers to move forward, expanding the concept initially presented. Francis Lawrence deserves to be praised for the sobriety and seriousness with which he conducts the plot, not letting himself be shaken by the visual exaggerations of the capital, in what could have turned into a meaningless carnival show, worthy of the bread and circus show denounced by the franchise. The subtext of the universe created by Suzanne Collins is even more obvious in the film, but unfortunately it must still pass meters above the heads of a large part of the audience, who are there, ironically, just for the spectacle it represents. Despite dealing with abuse of power, rights and duties of the state, personal sacrifices, and the role of the citizen, comments like ""how cool it would be to live in Panem"" can be read, proof of the state of critical thinking skills of a fraction of this generation.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
112,KalKenobi83,An Amazing Second Act!,8,30 November 2014,"Watched The Hunger Games Catching Featuring The Lovely Jennifer Lawrence(Silver Linings Playbook) as Katniss Everdeen , Josh Hutcherson(Journey 2:The Mysterious Island) as Peeta Mellark , Liam Hemsworth(Empire State) as Gale Hathworne, Elizabeth Banks( Pitch Perfect) as Effie Trinket, Woody Harrelson(Now You See Me) as Haymitch Abernathy, Lenny Kravitz(Precious) as Cinna, Stanley Tucci(Captain America:The First Avenger) Caesar Fickerman, Jena Malone(Sucker Punch) as Johanna Mason, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman(Mission : Impossible III ) as Plutarch Heavensbee, Jeffrey Wright(Source Code) as Betee Latier,Willow Shields(Beyond The Blockboard) as Primrose Everdeen, Paula Malcomson(Battlestar Galactica) as Mrs.Everdeen ,Sam Claflin(Snow White and The Huntsman) as Finnick Odair and Donald Sutherland(Pride & Prejudice) as President Coriolanus Snow the Series Main Villain.The character of Katniss suffers From PTSD and Snow Attempts to Use as Her Puppet which sets the Second act of the Story in Motion.Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third.

114,agmoldham,Fairly good middle film,5,24 December 2013,"Being a big fan of teenage girls books, I read the Hunger Games a few years back. I've always found the middle part of a trilogy of books more enjoyable than the middle part of a trilogy of films. When reading books the middle book seems to expand on the themes of the first book and sets things up for the finale. The middle part of a film trilogy always seems to struggle to have a purpose. There are obviously a few middle films which break this rule such as Star Wars ESB, but these are the exception rather than the rule.""Hunger Games: Catching fire"" continues from where the first film finishes. The victors are doing the tour of the districts and we get to see a little glimpse of what these districts are like. The film doesn't explore the relationship between Katniss, Gale and Peeta in the same level of detail as the book. The best part of the film is unsurprisingly Katniss Everdeen played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence is in great form and obviously loving the role. There's little of note from the other actors and even Woody Harrelson doesn't seem to warm to his role.Overall the film is fairly entertaining. Not as good as the first film and hopefully not as good as the final part of the trilogy.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I loved the performance of the actors, truly everyone in the movie did a great job that gave the movie an authentic feel. The movie followed the books to a tee making it even better to watch, the only disappointing thing is when they left out the detail in the first movie about Peta losing his leg. It would have made more sense for his part in the second film if he was struggling with a prosthetic instead of making him a useless person in the film. The second movie , like the books, dives more into the politically messed up world, filled with action, twist and turns, heart and a movie that will leave you itching for the third instalment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

117,ersinkdotcom,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is Engaging Overall, but Slips into Retread Ground",8,21 November 2013,"The much-anticipated follow-up to ""The Hunger Games"" arrives in theaters and many wonder if it lives up to its hype. With a new director taking over for Gary Ross, it's only fair that many have reservations as to whether or not ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" can live up to the high expectations of audiences and critics. I, for one, feel that the movie succeeds in entertaining and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats (if they haven't read the book already, off course).The celebration of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) proves short-lived after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games incites rebellion in the Districts of Panem. The two find themselves drafted into the 75th Annual Games, where they must battle all the past victors. Dubbed the Quarter Quell, it's part of a scheme the President (Donald Sutherland) has hatched to rid the world of the winners of the Games and put an end to the rebellion which could change the very way of life he's helped to establish.Director Frances Lawrence (""I Am Legend,"" ""Constantine"") makes the world of Suzanne Collins' beloved novels his own with ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" Gone is the shaky cam vibe felt in Gary Ross's original film. It's replaced here with steady and sweeping camera work that gives the audience a third-person perspective of all the action and drama.Let me be clear from the get-go. I haven't read ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" so my response to what unfolded on screen comes from that perspective. That being said, I found the first half of the movie to be highly engaging and entertaining. A lot of time is spent developing the story and characters and setting the mood for the film.The second half of the movie takes us into more familiar territory. I don't want to say that it becomes predictable, as new scenarios are introduced and experienced by the characters. However, I couldn't shake this strange feeling of ""been there, done that.""The special effects and CGI for ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" are impressive. The actors blend nicely with the digital backgrounds and creatures. I can't think of a single time that I was mentally pulled out of the film because of shoddy craftsmanship.All the actors do great jobs in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" Surprisingly, the only one that loses some credibility is Jennifer Lawrence in a few of her highly emotional crying scenes. She looks like she's having a little trouble connecting with her character's feelings of sadness and despair at some points. It's amazing how easily Stanley Tucci slips into the role of the overly charismatic and hilarious Caesar Flickerman.""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is rated PG-13. Obviously, we get a lot of violence. A few bad words are uttered as well. There's also a scene where one of the victors of the Hunger Games strips naked in front of an elevator full of people, but nothing graphic is shown.Although it slips into ground already tread in the first film, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" merits the admission price to see it on the big screen. It builds up a captivating story and leaves you wanting more at the end. While it doesn't have the same urgency as the original, it does its very best to prepare the way for something much grander.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
118,Dan1863Sickles,"Breathe It In, Children -- Or Else Just Die, Die, My Darling!",4,29 November 2013,"So disappointing! I was truly blown away by the first HUNGER GAMES movie, mainly because Jennifer Lawrence was utterly sensational as Katniss Everdene, the tough, resilient girl from the wrong side of the tracks.There's something stunningly new and fresh about the way Jennifer Lawrence fills up the screen. She's so classically beautiful, and she really owns that beauty in the relaxed, sensual manner of great female icons like Elizabeth Taylor or Grace Kelly. Yet when the action scenes begin, she's as tough and menacing as Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson, without sacrificing any of her natural feminine allure. And when the story turns serious, and she's the spokesperson for an oppressed people in a starving nation, she has the same kind of moral dignity we used to see in male stars like Charlton Heston or Gregory Peck.Yet with all that, this formulaic sequel can't even approach the impact of the first film. How? How can you make Jennifer Lawrence look bad in a ground-breaking role in a new genre she literally invented? I hate the fact that this movie actually takes Katniss backwards. She's less in control, less courageous, less defiant, less warm-hearted, and less respected than in the first film. It's so horribly obvious that even the characters in the movie joke about it. ""See, this is why we don't let you make the plans,"" says Haymitch, at the very end of the movie, when Katniss is actually asserting herself (for a change.) It's a good joke, but it shows just how badly this franchise has lost its way. Clumsy plot, lousy dialog, stupid special effects and music that just sounds like an endless elevator ride at the mall.Two stars for Jennifer Lawrence and the way she fills up the screen. And two stars for Jena Malone, whose character comes out of nowhere and actually generates a little humor and energy in the endless, seen-it-all-before action sequences. But other than that, my God it was dull and slow.Oh, and one special note about Donald Sutherland. He is a very, very old man. He really should hang it up and retire. Back when he was Jennifer Lawrence's age, he was in a grade-Z thriller called DIE, DIE, MY DARLING, supporting a decrepit and decaying Tallulah Bankhead. He played a mentally challenged boy raised by a crazy old woman, and all he had to do was make moronic facial expressions and moan ""praise ye the Lord!"" while the old woman read the Bible.But that role was positively dignified compared to this.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
119,face-819-933726,"Jennifer Lawrence caught fire a few years ago, and her acting only gets hotter.",9,19 January 2014,"Surprised me this movie did. I had been hearing all this negative stuff about this just being the same movie as the last one, and it is really anything but. This movie really steps things up. The first movie felt fake, and very much like a unreal world that was just too oppressed. Well this one does exactly the same thing, but goes deeper, and does the things that were missing in the last movie. Sure you have most of the same characters, and most of them say lines that are pretty dead on with the first movie, but it is the first movie that makes this one so good. No matter how bad the first one was, and at times it was horrible, the actions of Katniss were all that mattered, and the only good part of the first film. This film grabs you in the heart because Jennifer Lawrence﻿ is so good at bringing Katmiss to us, and as always, acting the heck out of the room. You can not help but feel her pain at the losses she feels from the last battle, and her strong love for both men. I could not imagine this movie working with any lesser actress playing this roll. So yes I Enjoyed this one, and would recommend it to all, or any. There is a lot of violence, and some stuff that young kids will get really freaked out at, but beyond that this can be an anyone film in my book.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
120,griffolyon12,A Superb Sequel,10,22 November 2013,"It still baffles me as to why The Hunger Games is so successful. I love it, but why do so many others? These aren't escapist stories, these aren't entertainment, and yet there is something about these stories that appeals to me in a deep way that I can't quite explain. Perhaps it's because I love the characters and identify with them? Or perhaps it's because I find the thematic ideas of oppression and rebellion so striking? Irregardless to what it is that draws me to the material, I love The Hunger Games, and I absolutely enjoyed the first film in the franchise. The sequel, Catching Fire, does what every good cinematic sequel should do, and goes above and beyond.First and foremost, I must applaud new director, Francis Lawrence, for applying an if it isn't broke, don't fix it mentality to the material. Rather than recreate everything that the first film's director, Gary Ross, did, Lawrence merely expands on all of Ross's ideas and makes them clearer and more concise. There is an obvious continuity that this film has, and it's because of this filmmaking approach. Too many sequels often change the worlds of the films too much, especially when there is a change in directors, and it can be off-putting and alienating if you were a fan of everything the predecessor did right. Lawrence avoids this pratfall and only makes things even more cinematic than before. A large part of the reason the continuity also works is because James Newton Howard was brought back to do the music a second time around, and he utilizes all of his prior thematical material to bring you back into the world. With Howard's score, and Lawrence's direction, it makes the film feel familiar both aurally, and visually, which is simply what makes this film a phenomenal sequel that bests its predecessor.Everything that worked the first go around works once more, due to the careful attention in maintaining continuity, so if you were a fan of the first film, then buckle up and just enjoy the ride. Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss Everdeen. Her performance as Katniss in The Hunger Games was the best performance she ever gave, and I think was more deserving of the Oscar than her role in Silver Linings Playbook, and once more she proves why this is the role of a lifetime for her. She plays Katniss with such a raw, brutal honesty. There is nothing that feels faked about her portrayal, it simply feels like Jennifer, just baring her soul for all to see, and that is the most adventurous and awesome kind of acting there is.Other returning favorites to the cast all grow further in their roles and excel, but I was most pleased to see Donald Sutherland with even more screen time as President Snow. He relishes in this role, and it's clear that he is enjoying himself being the bad guy, but by having an actor of his caliber in his role, it lends a third dimension that would not come had he just been played by a mustache twirling character actor. Then there are the new cast additions. Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair, and most importantly, Jena Malone as Johanna Mason, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee. Malone in particular sets into this role that is so eccentric, so over-the-top, and manages to make Johanna somewhat relatable and real. Simply put, I could not find a weak performance in this film, and that's how I like it.All in all, I loved Catching Fire. The love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, is given even more prominence this go around, and is peppered which much more complexity that the first film. You understand each and every person's feelings better, and their reasonings for why they feel that way. By the time Katniss finally kisses Peeta and you know it wasn't for show, you can't help but be moved by the moment. The sad thing is, while there is a romantic component to these stories, that is all anyone usually talks about.I think in some ways, these movies have created the kind of false pageantry that the Capitol forces on the people of the Districts. Sure, filmmaking is a business, even still, I truly believe that the writers, directors, and producers, for these films, have all understood what Suzanne Collins' novels were about. With that said, I have serious doubts that many, in particular of the teenage crowd, as well as the studio, see these works as anything other than another night on the town, and I think that's sad. It's sad that something so thematically important, and so emotionally rich, has essentially been turned into another cash-cow. It's not because of the books, because the books are phenomenal works of literature, and it's not because of the films, because as I've already said, Catching Fire wisely doesn't ever lose sight of the book's themes and never traipses into blockbuster territory. So why have we turned this into a blockbuster franchise akin to Star Wars or Harry Potter? These aren't simple good versus evil stories, and yet I think that's all most are seeing these as. It's why we're carting the cast off to premieres and mall appearances to turn them into teen heartthrobs. It's why the studio is constantly tracking the box office performance like it's a baseball game. It's why people are not looking at these books and films the right way. These are stories about real emotions, real relationships, and eerily familiar situations. I just wish the target audience would understand this, but it's not a fault against the films, because no matter how other people perceive Catching Fire, I know how I perceive it, and I am blown away once more by The Hunger Games.I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a 10 out of 10!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
121,Laakbaar,It's OK,7,30 November 2013,"This movie is science fiction set in a distant future in which part of North America is divided into 12 zones, with some zones wealthier and more advanced than others. Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.In the last movie, they won the contest. We see that they were given money and nice homes, but Katniss is struggling with her fame and the horror of the games. In this movie, they and other former victors are -- much to their dismay -- called back to do the whole thing over again. It seems that the Capitol district (which runs the rest of the zones in a totalitarian dictatorship) is getting concerned about revolutionary feelings in the poorer worker districts.The current score is too high. The amount of money this movie is bringing in is a phenomenon I don't really understand. I suppose I'm in the wrong demographic. It's an OK movie, but it's annoying at times. It felt artificial, too black and white, and too cloying. Yes, I was occasionally moved, but this involvement came at a price, i.e. the slimy feeling of being manipulated. This movie is not that different really than an extended ""Survivor"" episode.I don't buy into the Hunger Games universe. I don't see it as realistic in any way. The demonization of President Snow bothered me. OK, we get it. He's evil. I enjoyed the off-the-wall characters played (excellently) by Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
122,dfa120374,Thankfully MUCH Better Than The First Installment,7,27 July 2015,"In some ways I was pretty reluctant in seeing this next installment of The Hunger Games film series because -1) the first film bored the ever-loving pants off me (a view I still stand by), so I wasn't sure if I would want to see the next film.2) I was intrigued to see what DID happen next.However, after seeing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire I was actually surprised and I'll hold my hands up and say that it IS actually a very good film. Like I said, the first film was boring and very over-hyped, but this time it went the opposite way.In saying that, though, it didn't start off that way as the first 40 minutes or so of this film was slow and I did actually think it was going to be worse than the first movie. Thankfully, it DID get better from about the hour mark, picking up in both pace & action. The acting wasn't anything special but it was believable and solid with good performances from Lawrence, Hoffman, and especially Harrelson.Some elements of the first film that I didn't like have returned for this installment, the main one being the ridiculous Alice in Wonderland type costumes. Whether it's like that in the books or not I don't know as I've not read them, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking that some of the costumes were completely out of place. Some of the costumes just made it seem that you were watching two different film genres, but this is confined to mainly the first 40 or so minutes so.Now, I'm definitely not a die-hard Hunger Games fan, but even I'll admit that it's getting very tiresome seeing the continual comparisons between this and the Battle Royale films. It was interesting to start with but I honestly wish people would just shut up about the comparisons because quite frankly it's becoming very tiresome & boring seeing it all the time. We all KNOW the films are similar, but enough is enough.Anyway, if, like me, you almost gave up the series after watching the first film, stick with it because this one is MUCH better.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
123,tchitouniaram,not bad...,6,22 October 2020,"Very entertaining, personally for me, the biggest problem this films have is the very annoying and not interesting main actress...If it would be someone with whom I could be sympathetic ,the movie could be a solid 8 stars...",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
124,cinematic_aficionado,A supposedly action fantasy,5,26 November 2013,"The first instalment of this series became a success and a phenomenon largely due to the struggle that was put up by the main character in order to survive as well as conveying the moral that 'it is wrong to kill' even if it is part of the rules.So, given that the ""games"" were so pivotal to this film why the makers of the movie wasted over 80 minutes of the audience's time before we were treated to any action? All this mumbo jumbo background gibberish made this for a largely dull experience. When a film is by definition a fantasy/action all this attempt to slowly build a subplot and explore additional mechanisms is in vain. Not to mention the constant switch from seeing our characters as powerful and able to effect change, were then deemed helpless pawns. So what were they?Lack of imagination and creativity is what lacked in this film. The first instalment was also not entirely to my liking, but it offered plenty of thrills and a fine spectacle.When the long overdue action did arrive, it was just too little too late and any enthusiasm for the upcoming sequels, has largely diminished.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
125,billygoat1071,Getting Things Right,9,22 November 2013,"We are now at the post Twilight/Harry Potter era, and The Hunger Games movies are the only young adult novel adaptations that have the same scale of fame of the two former series. And you know that the YA genre has become even worse nowadays; just pick up a random book, mix them with familiar elements that would please teenager hormones, and good to go. But Catching Fire is obviously different, and these are the reasons why it's much superior compared to those horrible drecks: it has strong ambition, it digs deeper within its themes, and simply tells a story. Thus it finally gets it right by deliberately showed all the interesting parts of the source material.Everyone will most likely come for the action and the romance, but unlike the last film, this one has a wiser focus: sociopolitical satires. It explores how tyrannical the Capitol government is, and how the media amazingly helps covering their corruption. The context alone is of course immediately compelling, it makes a stirring conviction why they really need to go for a revolution. While it centers Katniss who has issues of her own, her compassion towards her family, friends, and the people of Panem has always felt genuine. Those kinds of emotions work remarkably than the love triangle she's stuck into.The film once again benefits having Jennifer Lawrence in the lead. She's just incredibly engaging, that you would definitely root for all throughout. The rest of the cast remains as compelling as they were, same goes to the new ones somewhat. Francis Lawrence now handles the series. The camera may be less shaky, but there's always a sense of art in his direction, especially at the midst of silence. The pacing is effortlessly outstanding, which decently balances the drama and the thrills. The games has become a lot electrifying, it is more practical and have greater effect of danger than just characters trying to kill each other. It's a creative turn that goes full momentous until the end. The production and the effects are solid enough to make the exteriors of their world look intriguing.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has a smarter vision and finally hits the right note. The first movie was entertaining, but it hardly bothers showing the actual point of these stories other than enjoying how the games were played. This sequel filled the blanks around the setting thus tells a far more interesting story. And it sure feels like an utter miracle for an awful year for YA films, then again a great young adult book adaptations have always been rare. Overall, it's easily the best one this year, and that is all what you need to know for a while since it's kind of hard talking about it without giving much away. I can't say it's flawless, but it is generally engrossing.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
126,dilipbts,The hunger games catching fire,9,22 July 2020,"So, for a long time, I avoided The Hunger Games. I had seen and loved Battle Royale, and I felt like The Hunger Games would be a more PG version of that. But I decided to watch the first film, and I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. But this one is even better. I walked out of this film really pleased. It does have similarities to the first film, but I think this one does everything better. It has a lot of really interesting twist and turns to the story to keep me wanting to know what happens. The film ends in a way that really leaves you wanting to see the next film so you can find out how the rest of it plays out. I would say this film can appeal to both men and women, with it's mix of action, drama, and romance, and that works to it's advantage. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will love this one. This is how blockbuster movies should be made. Entertaining, but done in a way that feels like effort has been made.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
127,TheSquiss,"Slightly darker, far more thrilling mid-section of the trilogy",7,6 December 2013,"As a general rule (The Godfather II, The Empire Strikes Back and one or two others), sequels don't match the high expectations set by the original films. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is another rare film that bucks the trend.I'm not saying it's a perfect film or one that will survive time to be hailed in the same breath as the afore mentioned sequels but, having read Suzanne Collins' trilogy, this second outing in the franchise is both more satisfying than the thoroughly enjoyable first film and stamps all over the source novel. Whether you're a reader or viewer, if The Hunger Games excited you, you're going to love the sequel! Set a year after Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) won the 74th Hunger Games, the reluctant couple find themselves on the Victors' Tour, visiting each of the districts and witnessing ever more desperate examples of oppression and abuse at the hands of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Dissatisfied with their half-hearted effort to maintain the front as a loving couple, Snow recruits Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to devise a way to be rid of Katniss without causing a revolution: The Quarter Quell. Consequently, Katniss and Peeta find themselves back in the arena fighting for their lives, but this time their opponents are other former victors and the battle will be particularly vicious.As much as it is possible (and acceptable) to enjoy violence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a very exciting and pleasing experience. Clocking in at well over two hours, it rattles along entertainingly and feels shorter and with far fewer glitches and flaws than its predecessor. There are a few, infrequent examples of clumsiness that could and really should have been avoided (a man executed in one scene is, moments later, carried away with nary a speck of blood on, or issuing from, him) and, naturally, there are elements of the book that have been condensed to fit the running time but despite those issues it remains a thoroughly entertaining film.The introduction of Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones) is a short-lived delight. He is just one victim in a long list of underused characters performed beautifully by accomplished actors (Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci) but most audiences wouldn't sit through a four-hour epic and so there must be casualties. Woody Harrelson is allowed to evolve his Haymitch so that he adds more gravitas than light relief and the relationship with Haymitch and Katniss crackles frostily, remaining a highlight of the series.The 'love' triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) makes its way adequately into The Hunger Games: Catching Fire but, more than anything, sets up the third (and fourth for, alas, revenue dictates yet again that the final installment must be milked fully) installment. For Lawrence, this feels easy work. She knows her character and inhabits her with sufficient scorn and resentment to make us root for her without being so standoffish as to leave us questioning our feelings for her. The first of two autumnal cinema releases for Lawrence (next up is American Hustle), it is certain to further amplify the spotlight on Lawrence, a genuine movie star who is also a very fine actor.Come awards season, Lawrence may be a lucky winner of multiple gold for American Hustle, but as far as the masses are concerned, it will be The Hunger Games: Catching Fire that convinces them that she can open a film. A bona fide star in a dark and hugely entertaining romp. It may be a year away but I'm looking forward to parts three and four. What a pity the same cannot be said of The Hobbit.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
128,RevRonster,I didn't care for the first one but kinda dug this one...,7,24 January 2014,"When the first film came out, I wouldn't say I was pushing over my own mother to get to the theater and see it. I'll be honest, I had no interest in the film but I will give every movie a shot, so when I had the opportunity came to see it(read that as when I get to see it for really cheap or for free), I gave it a chance and wasn't really wowed by it. The story really didn't interest me, the characters weren't really ones I found too captivating and there wasn't much development going on where I could see it being a franchise I would be a fan of—However, I did love the character of Haymitch Abernathy and Woody Harrelson's performance of him. My lack of interest in the film ended up raising the blood pressure of some people I know and even caused a dude to flip out on me and call me a snob. All because when he asked me if I like ""The Hunger Games,"" I shrugged my shoulders and said, ""Not really but Woody Harrelson's character is cool."" When ""Catching Fire"" hit the theaters,family, friends, coworkers, the drug addict that sits outside my apartment and the guy I pay to randomly attack me so I stay on my toes told me that since I wasn't a fan of the first one I would do a complete turn around if I watched ""Catching Fire"" because it was just that good. Add to the fact my girlfriend really likes the books and wanted to see the movie, I gave it a chance and I have to say; They were right.I'm not going to say that I'm now a huge fan of the franchise but I did dig this one more than the previous one. The story was far more interesting to me and the tension and drama that was built upon the first outing easily grabbed me. The new characters that were introduced (like Plutarch Heavensbee, Johanna and Finnick Odair) were very interesting and played by just fantastic actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Malone and Sam Clafin respectively). Finally, the movie ends on a great cliffhanger that just gets the heart pumping for the next adventure.Granted, the film still had its issues for me that kept me from really jumping full bore on the ""Hunger Games"" bandwagon (right now, I would say I'm just holding on to the side and seeing where the road goes). For example, the action still isn't that exciting (but a little more thrilling than the last one), a lot of characters are underdeveloped and just here to raise the body count in the games (and most of the deaths occur off-screen and that is disappointing in and of itself), Josh Hutcherson is still a very underwhelming actor and, because of it, I can't quite figure out if his character is suppose to be a likable one or not (not to mention, he kinda comes off as a tad incompetent) and, I know people are going to hate me for this, but some of Jennifer Lawrence's performance was hard to deal with as she laid on the hammy acting way too thick.However, these issues aside, I still enjoyed myself watching ""Catching Fire."" While I still wasn't completely wowed, I did find a film that was just entertaining to watch that my interest is definitely piqued when it concerns the next film.Hi! My name is Rev.

129,dragokin,predictable,3,18 April 2014,"There is a spoiler warning, although it might not be necessary.Anyhow, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire follows the structure of its prequel. There was an introduction into social and political background of the society we've seen before. An endless action sequence of the Hunger Games follows although we've known from the beginning that the good guys would outsmart the villains. Eventually, we're left lingering until the last installment of the trilogy, which would actually be one movie separated into two parts.But this is still alright. What is not alright is the media frenzy about a message of the movie, as if there were one. Donald Sutherland even gave an interview wishing Hunger Games would stir up a revolution (Guardian, Tuesday 19 November 2013). I'm not sure with which audience this should have resonated, probably angry Twitter users and Facebook renegades. In this sense MTV Jackass had more impact on contemporary youth than effort of all NGOs combined.This movie isn't bad in itself, yet it is nothing more than a repetition of the first movie in the series.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

131,judywalker2,Better than the first and a lot less violent,7,28 November 2013,I went to see the first Hunger Games and though I liked the character of Katniss I was really put off by the excessive violence (especially concerning children) in the movie. I am glad that this continuation of the tale toned some of the violence down and was mostly about grown ups which probably made it more interesting to me. I like the continued political overtones but in this movie I liked Katniss less and felt that everyone else around her seemed more noble than she would ever be. That's kind of bad for a so called heroine. Woody Harrelson was great again and Donald Sutherland always plays evil well. Josh Hutherson excels in the role of Peeta and is as much a focal point of the movie as Katniss. I really don't understand the continued focus of Katniss and Gale's relationship; someone will have to explain that one to me. Though I'm not waiting with baited breath for the next installment I will probably stick with it till the end.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
132,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Catching Zzzzzs,1,23 November 2013,"Before you catch fire this weekend, be sure to rewatch THE HUNGER GAMES, because for the first half of this brooding, inferior sequel, the characters do nothing but wallow in their extremely complicated past With banal, pretentious dialogue even worse than a soap opera, the teen-adored romantic adventure has reached an extremely corny level... Even the preparation for the games, introducing a new crop of teams and contestants, is dull and uninteresting. The overall plot involves a post-apocalyptic world wherein The Capitol rules with an iron fist, and to avoid the threat of revolution there are televised games in which young people fight each other to the death... Making one highly resilient warrior, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a revered folk hero risking everything for love.Well if that sounds both intriguing and exciting, it sure was... But this time around, the cutthroat survival aspect has been replaced by a wannabe JURRASSIC PARK with fanged baboons and other acts of bizarre nature including killer fog, thunderstorms and tidal wavesThis overly computer-generated switch-up, attempting to raise stakes from the original, ultimately leaves the audience – both within the film's game show and inside your local theater – nothing and no one to actually root for.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

134,richieandsam,"A good sequel, just too long.",7,9 February 2014,"THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIREThis is part 2 of the Hunger Games movies, so that automatically usually means that it will not be as good as the first one. It is very rare that a sequel is better then the original...The movie continues on from the original movie... Katniss and Peeta won the last Hunger Games and they are about to go on a tour of the Districts. There is a rebellion against the politicians and the games, so the president decides that Katniss must die as she is the person the rebellion has chosen to be their leader. The next games would be different. The participants are previous champions. Katniss and Peeta are going back in. Will they survive again? The thing I liked about this too is there are some people they can trust but some they can't... It is very good watching this wondering if the people they are talking too are trustworthy. It keeps you guessing.The main thing I felt about this movie was it was too long. It is on for about 2 and a half hours which is not normally a problem, but the first hour of this film really dragged out. My favourite part of these film are the games themselves, but the games do not begin until roughly 75 minutes into the film. The first half of the movie i felt could have been shorter.The film is very good. I enjoyed it a lot and I liked the new idea of the battle ground. It is set in a different place this time and I loved the twists that presented themselves throughout the movie. It seems they are not just trying to survive against the other contestants... they have other problems to deal with too.The casting was again very good. As far as I could tell, everyone from the original movie returned for the sequel with a few new faces. Jennifer Lawrence﻿ played Katniss. Jennifer was very good in this movie again. SHe is a very talented actress and I can see her in a lot of movies in the future. Josh Hutcherson﻿ played Peeta. I thought that Josh did a great job too. I really feel sorry for his character. He clearly loves Katniss a lot and will do anything to protect her, but she does not seem to have the same feelings, but she will protect him from anything. It is a weird relationship. haha Other cast members that did a fantastic job were Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman.It will be very interesting what they do with Philip's character as he still had one more scene to shoot for the next movie. I hope they don't replace him or make a mistake with the character.The violence was again very good in this film. Some scenes were harsh but still very well done. This is a dark movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Remember who the real enemy is.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
135,Al_The_Strange,Catching Fire review,8,10 December 2013,"I never felt that the first Hunger Games movie was all that bad, but it's certainly not without its flaws. Chief among them were the issues that the threat was not present enough, and the pathos of the characters were not sufficiently developed. These were just a few of the nuances that seems to have translated better in writing than on-screen.Fortunately, Catching Fire is not just a mere follow-up on the first film; it's an opportunity to rectify the first film's shortcomings and present a much more sublime adaptation of the second novel in the series. The film starts a little slow, taking the necessary time to cover some important ground with the background and characters, before the plot rockets ahead. I've always felt that the scenes in District 11 would be a pretty hard-hitting scene, and the film did not disappoint. From then on, the suspense builds systematically through a series of actions and reactions, based largely in the characters' predicaments. When the actual Quarter Quell starts, it is a pretty fast and intense match that not only involves a lot of bloodshed, but also some crazy environmental hazards and one ambitious endgame. It all culminates in a captivating series of twists and revelations that will inevitably lead into the full-blown revolution that will come in the Mockingjay films (and the film did a fine job of psyching me up for it). Once it got going, the film moved pretty fast, smooth, and with a perfect level of nuance and detail to fully emphasize the significance of the story and the pathos of the characters.And that's what's really awesome about the film: the storytelling, which is probably as perfect of an adaptation to the book as it can get. It's not just a paint-by-the-numbers replication of the book's scenes; it seems as though the filmmakers took a deeper look at the source material to bring out the characters better (including all the minor characters, who seem to shine much more in this film), and craft a plot that makes better sense. A few minor details are cut out, but are not really missed; the film crams in so much from the book without feeling crowded, and it is pretty much exactly what I pictured it would be from reading the text. So overall, it is a fine story told really well.Another great thing that's fixed is the camera work: all the crappy shaky-cam shots are gone, and the photography remains solid, steady, and good overall. Editing is equally decent. Acting is decent: Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen. All the other players felt pretty iffy before, but in this film, everybody feels much more natural and much more important than before; they all pull their weight for good effect. Writing is good. This production has some great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects (yes, even the SFX have improved), all of which match up with the first film well, but without appearing gaudy or anything. Music is pretty good too.The Hunger Games films have finally caught on fire with this sequel. Following the book in both plot and spirit, the film is a successful adaptation. It's more competent, more hard-hitting, more consistently engaging, and it even had moments that I felt were brilliant or beautiful. Fans of the book should enjoy this tremendously, while casual audiences might be able to connect with it better than the first film. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
136,estreet-eva,Better than the first outing,6,13 November 2014,"Anyone else get the sense Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson are kind of slogging through this one? It may be just be and actorly attempt to emote fatigued resignation at once again being brought into the game to kill tributes but the two leads do give off done- with-this-can't-believe-I-signed-on-to-3-sequels-vibe. By contrast Josh Hutcherson shows eagerness given he has the same career prospects as the kid who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter series. The recently (and tragically) departed Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland appear only to give the proceedings prestige - their unremarkable parts could have been played by unknowns just as effectively. Having said that, seeing these folk join Lenny Kravitz in the same movie is still a treat. While the story they act in makes no mathematical sense. The Capitol needs 24 former victors minus the 2 (Katniss & Peeta) who won last year leaving 22 spots taken from the field of 74 previous winners. However, we know from this installment the youngest winner ever was 14 meaning the youngest winner otherwise must have been 15. Assuming a life expectancy of 75 years we can deduct 15 years old from 74 previous winners and assume only 59 remain alive. Choosing 22 of these at random leaves a resulting set of participants aged a minimum of 17 (15 year old winner minimum + at least 2 years ago) to a maximum of 73 (15 year old winner + up to 58 contests ago). The effects of the random draw (assuming no one would volunteer as tribute having managed to survive it once) would result in a contestant pool spanning most of that range. The movie does show one old woman contestant who has no lines and suffers the indignity of riding another contestant (there really are no good parts of older actresses). Putting the math aside the ""moves-counter moves"" focus of the script as opposed to dwelling so much on the action adventure does make for more intriguing proceedings compared to the first film adaptation of the Suzanne Collins book. The jarring ending makes this the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy+1 but it does set up the forthcoming film nicely. In short, improved sophistication of story overcomes a decline in acting to produce an entertaining outing.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

139,diac228,"Just like the stakes, the quality of Hunger Games increases ten-fold",8,25 November 2013,"Now this is how you do an adaptation.Catching Fire is a dazzling display of kinetic sci-fi energy that feels more polished, more complete, and more wholesome than the predecessor—which wasn't a bad movie but was marred by limited resources. Francis Lawrence and company wasted no time in fleshing out the issues of the original as they paced this story better, gave it better production value, and learned how to raise the emotional stakes without getting too ridiculous.What makes Hunger Games a success in bookstores is the heavy emphasis on the emotional aspects of the conflicts and also the realistic fiction that allows for us readers and viewers to connect with the characters. Catching Fire manages to re-create the experience perfectly by remaining accurate while never overloading the movie with special effects or pointless action.Our leading lady is also a major player as to why Hunger Games has been resonating with audiences so well. Jennifer Lawrence is once again remarkable as the tough and fiery heroine that is slowly but surely building a cult following within the districts in the movie. The supporting cast also each performed well, especially Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson---but this movie is supported and carried by Lawrence. She deserves all her Oscar credibility.Lionsgate is nowhere near as a big a film company as the major studios like Disney and Warner Brothers. So their all-hands-on-deck routine towards this movie was expected. Their budget escalated, which results in a prettier and more visually stimulating experience. But then there's the other Lawrence that helped propel the franchise to new heights. With the better director, we got to see better action sequences and a better display on the mayhem that is occurring throughout the 140 minutes.But just like all blockbusters with multiple sequels planned down the road, the movie's ending makes the rest of Catching Fire seem like it was just a massive build-up to an exciting climax. With another book at the helm, we surely should have expected it, but it still feels like an incomplete ending.Hey, maybe that's just evidence that the ride was truly enjoyable---it left us wanting more.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
140,p-jonsson,I feel this one is better than the first one,6,14 September 2014,"I still do not agree with the 9 and 10 star ratings but I feel this movie is slightly better than the first one. This is primarily because Jennifer Lawrence's character is more mature and she seems more comfortable in the role. She is no longer an immature, naive and lost child. At least not most of the time.The entire setup is still as ludicrous as before. It is a silly and depressing background scenario and it is definitely not my cup of tea. The people running around in ridiculous hair-do, makeup and showing a severe lack of intelligence is not making things better.The enjoyment of this movie comes when the games finally start. These parts are definitely better than in the first movie. The various dangers are well done, the effects good and there is an interesting overall theme to the arena and the dangers instead of randomly throwing new menaces at players that seemed to be the strategy in the first movie.To me the enjoyment of this movie is in the games themselves. This is probably because I just do not like the rest of the plot. The depressing scenario. The nonsensical and/or oppressive behavior, backstabbing etc. etc.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
141,room102,Hunger Games - The Remake!,5,22 January 2014,"Catching Fire is basically a remake of the first movie, which doesn't offer even one single new idea, just the easiest excuse to send the winning couple back to the games and repeat everything that happened in the first movie.At 2.5 hours (including 11 min of end credits!!!), the movie is way too long and pointless. Half the movie is wasted on boring ""background story"", which adds nothing to the plot and serves as a mean to present the movie as something more than it is - people trying to kill each other. The second half is better, but again - offers nothing new.Good production design, good CGI.4.5/10 Skip the first half of the movie, then put your brains in neutralWait, they split the third movie into two movies, making the trilogy into a quadrilogy? My god, they are just as shameless as they are geniuses!!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
142,in1984,The Empire Strikes Back,8,21 January 2014,"8 of 10. A more realistic, less simplistic version of an empire striking back, including the storm trooper names (""peacekeeper""), even if the uniforms are clearly plagiarized from Star Wars. Then again, we are dealing with Earth in the future, so you'd expect some copying from famous films of the past given the nature of the work and watch TV society.It's also a rare case of a sequel being better than the original. That's not to say it's perfect or the acting is good. The film essentially picks up immediately after the first, and as the result of the first is subject to a lot less cutting. Jennifer Lawrence looks less like someone from a well fed suburb and more like she's in a society of hunger than the first, but remains a poor selection for the lead of this film series. The film also started out by exploring some of the other districts, but cuts this off too short before it returns to another version of the games, which could have easily shortened a fog chase scene. Fortunately, we get more insight into the games along with a great performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.The characters and overall plot development are much better developed in this film than the first, which relied heavily on a good story idea but had cliché problems.There seems to be a promotion tour here for a 2000 Japanese film called Battle Royale. If it was a 1970s sci-fi B-movie, it would be a masterpiece. Compared to either Hunger Games film, it's like having to watch teen-TV melodrama with subtitles.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The cgi doesnt destroy immersion like the ugly dogs did in the first movie. And the actual hunger games arena Is better.

145,scottshak_111,Packs in pizazz with a punch of emotional drama,8,16 December 2013,"Humble beginnings always lead to something epic. Given the story carried an abrupt ending all along, the presentation was done pretty well. Let us not forget that there was limited story in the director's baggage. The flick runs by presentation, pizazz, beautiful screenplay and a lot of emotional drama. Jennifer Lawrence's gusto, as usual, was unmatched. The trilogy is a beauty bonanza 4 her! She wears her glam well.I haven't read Suzanne Collins but I can tell this part was impeccably projected and probably might have succeeded in justifying her creativity!! If you are willing to connect dots, willing to climb a ladder that leads you to a perfect ending to a trilogy, you have to pass through this part unwavered, just like you'd do it for any other franchise. Stay put!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
146,HelenMary,"a great sequel, powerful but not as character led as the first",7,28 December 2013,"This is the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy; a dystopic world where the difference between the rich and the poor is absolute and what society there is, is largely based on fantasy (in the capital) and hard graft and scratching a living in the rest of the country. The idea behind the story is fabulous, extremely clever and rather original but in the films I find the eccentric dress of the ""society"" people really overly flamboyant. I know it's a symptom of the greater problem but it's not adequately explained and doesn't make sense to me. The costumes are a riot though!There are shadows of the Reich in the way that punishment is metered out for those considered insubordinate, and certain sections of society are considered not in favour, and the way that revolution is quashed is insidious and frightening; the scheming of the higher powers behind the scenes. The rallying behind the tributes Catniss and Peeta is moving and uplifting and whilst that is emotive, the characters of the tributes (other than Catness and Peeta) aren't really as in depth as in the first film. I'd not read this one first, whereas had for the original film so perhaps that made a difference. It was however highly emotional and gripping for the most part. I found my attention waining, and there being too much contrivance in the dome this time, less suspense with the challenges they face, and some plot contrivance was predictable. There was some unpredictability in the film, however, just when I was thinking I was frustrated with the length of one bit, there was a curve ball and the film was over! It's an impressive film, like the first, with huge spectacle and drama, fast-paced action, but rather disjointed in terms of pacing to begin with. I found that a little annoying, as scenes are short and choppy and clearly heavily edited as they are trying to pack a lot of narrative into film introduction. It means that you don't have time to emotionally invest. Most of the acting is good, with a few hammy performances but as in the last film Jennifer Lawrence stands out by a long way and steels every scene. Her emotional range is excellent, and I imagine that some of the scenes must have been quite draining. I didn't feel so connected to characters in this film, and as such I feel this one slightly less successful than the first. I wasn't so invested and there was a certain safe predictability.Overall a great entertaining film, well worth the watch if you enjoyed the first. It doesn't really stand alone, so you'd need background, but I would recommend it. It's a good sequel in that it doesn't disappoint after the first, and has a point to it, and is quite a visually enjoyable film but wasn't as gripping as The Hunger Games.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
147,eagandersongil,Matendo o que estava bom,7,6 September 2021,"""Various Games: In Flames"" is a competent sequel but much less charismatic than its predecessor, shifting the focus to something more political, the transaction is good, the script is less linear but with continuity problems.The continuation of the franchise had more than 50 million in budget than its predecessor, although we don't feel this visually expressive improvement, the cache can have food a lot of the money, as we have a less authorial film that perpetuates what worked in the first one though it lacks a greater depth of the characters.""Ravenous Games: On Fire"" hasn't aged as well as the first one, we feel a repetition of ideas, we have a climax that should have been built before, but the characters are still great and the performances at a good level such as costumes, makeup and soundtrack, in addition to photography, which improves significantly.

148,kgprophet,Suffers as Setup to next film in Trilogy,6,5 December 2013,"Having not read any of the books, and seeing a trend here (Ender's GAME), or a trailer shown before this film (Divergent), they all reflect what the latest generation is reading therefore finding as the preferred escapism. Here it is the blend of teenage rebellion and teenage emotional struggles with relationships. As important as this is in understanding what drives a character, I once again thought it unnecessary to drag the film over two hours. No question it was the second act where we seem to be building up to the next big event, only for Katniss for some reason popping up back home to get some more quality time with her loved ones. This second act obviously wanted to be longer, as subplot after subplot accumulated, especially around Philip Seymour Hoffman's character (a fresh baddie). Yet the expected resolution of these subplots are either skipped over or lightly touched upon. The third act thankfully found a lot of fresh dynamics to the actual game. This prevents a been-there-done-that sequel pitfall. For the most part, I felt this film was no better or worse than the first film, which I reluctantly liked.Hand it to the able creative and technical crew, with perhaps only a handful of CGI shots that looked iffy. Jennifer Lawrence does her best looking frightened most of the time, thankfully the brutality that was just hinted in the first film is hinted just a little more for PG-13. The biggest problem is the story, suffering from the middling 2nd part of a trilogy. The story isn't allowed to get too far in the resolution of the anticipated confrontation. So that forces many characters to remain in a holding pattern as the wheels spin for an extra half hour beyond the normal running time. As for the sequel bait, the same complaint can be made for many other recent last second revelations. It is a table turning moment that would have made the film we've just watched far more interesting. It reminds me of the long dragged out process over three films for Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader. It took two long films for him to just lose his hand! I think others in the audience had the same letdown as I did about the ending hinting at more interesting fireworks to come.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
149,TheHoodOfSwords,Better then the first!,8,14 August 2019,"I didn't like this quite as much as the second and first time I liked it but that's seemingly becoming quite normal the more rewatches I have. Still, this one is my favourite out of the bunch and I think it excels in a lot of areas. The tension in the first half is so ominous. You get the feeling it's bubbling just below the surface and at the centre of it, you have Katniss who is forced into a role she doesn't want to fulfil. The dialogue in this movie is much better than the first. There is still a decent amount of the clunky awkwardness but I think it works a lot better in this film given the circumstances. The first movie it felt like Katniss was just a quirky badass girl. In this movie you get the sense, it's more of her trying to distance herself from Peeta and the games. Not to mention the fact that they're still both teenagers who were put through a brutal ordeal and now they have to put on an act and act like they're in love. I didn't mind the love triangle in this film. I think it's more in there to reaffirm the fact that Katniss is still young and to show the dystopian society they live in. Katniss has never done stuff like go on dates or have romantic evenings. Gale has been her friend for a long time so it makes sense for her to have an attraction to him. However, she has gone through such an ordeal with Peeta and when they have to act day after day like they're madly in love it makes sense why she might be conflicted on where her emotions lie.The action in this film is killer. While the first half is much more about the different classes and districts the second half doesn't disappoint at all in terms of spectacle and CGI. The traps in this film feel more fleshed out and unique than the first. The new characters added bring a new depth to the game as they're given ample time in the first half for you to grow attached to them. They don't overshadow the film but they don't feel like random characters either. My personal favourite of the new lineup is Johanna. This movie also deals with the image of pride and self-worth. Members of the capitol don't care about the other districts at all because it doesn't affect them. Katniss (I believe, Might be Peeta.) Remarks that while people are starving in District 12 people in the capitol have invented drinks to make you throw up so you can eat more food again. It shows a complete dissociation from the poorer districts.While not as good as the first couple times I have watched it I still loved it a lot this time. 8.5/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
150,jackasstrange,A film for intelligent and open minded people.,8,4 December 2013,"Hunger Games is clearly one of the best films of the year, and without a doubt it's an excellent film. I must say that it's finally a breath of fresh air in this fast food generation of people that only bothers to go to theaters to see things exploding and an insane use of CGI on every single shot. Not saying that HG: Catching Fire has nothing of this; of course it has, but i am only saying that it bothers in also pledging the viewer with a good and intelligent story. Though nothing in it is subtle or anything, but still a great mental satisfaction to watch it.I must say that it is the only serious and compromised blockbuster done since The Dark Knight. Of course, is not that hard either to make a story with more content than 'The avengers' or 'Thor 2', but again , is a great breath of fresh air and it definitely has an above average storytelling for nowadays established standards.I simply loved the references to the Roman Empire on it, such as the fact that the rich people threw up to can taste all the types of food in the party, while the poor people were starving fighting for a piece of bread. I also liked how a new and entirely fictional world can offers such a strong allegory to OUR real solid world. The allegory presented in this film shows the human history since day one, until perhaps nowadays, or even until a near future. In fact, we can see and remind through this film that nothing really changed in the political aspects, because since the days where Rome was a great and powerful Empire, there was tyranny, internal treason and people were always unhappy and poor, though they also were the vast majority. And yeah, sadly this still happening. Again, politically nothing changed. Maybe the thing that really changed was the standards of tyranny and unhappiness, but's all. This sad fate probably won't change in a 'technological' future either. So, as you can see, HG:Catching Fire puts altogether the medieval times, the present times and a probably futuristic time, doing a great reflection about our civilization. The film also criticizes the strong media manipulation, who is blatantly true nowadays. So, a improbably hero, or better, heroin(to emphasize even more the idea of revolution) rises to put an end in all the tyranny and to give the power to the people. Fantastic.Talking about the cast, Jennifer Lawrence is the one who is definitely on fire. She is such a talented actress, and is doing one of the best runs ever made by such a young actress. As you see, the combination of good looking skills plus real talent and the right choices of films is turning her in a superstar of cinema and obviously she has a great effect on the box offices of a film, something that really few actresses could do. Woody Harrelson is once again priceless. He definitely adds his crazy acting style to the film, even expanding it's horizons. He definitely steals the scene, even if Jennifer Lawrence or the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman are in the same scene as him. The best actor in the film, in my opinion.The only couple of things that bothered me were the dialogs, which sometimes were dull, and some cheesy moments in the first sequences of the film. I also don't understood why the protagonist cried so much, but maybe she was just hyper sensitive or whatever. Still, it did hold me back when i was going to give it a perfect 10/10. Anyways, the rest is absolutely top notch.All in all, an excellent film. Those who have a brain will appreciate this piece of art. 9.0/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
151,kermitkid,"Higher stakes, better plot",8,30 March 2020,"It's much darker than the first film, and the games are more exciting. Some people said the beginning was boring, but that's how the first one was too. I'd rather they have good plot development rather then just rushing to get to the action. It's the character development and dialogue that fuels plot. They chose an actor for Finnick who looked just like his description in the book. And yes, people in the Capitol like to dress crazy in this as well. Even though there was little to no humor in the book, the film managed to have some very funny lines.

152,jb_campo,Katniss is cool,7,24 August 2014,"I've never read any of these books, but have now seen both Hunger Games films. Catching Fire was pretty good. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine acting job as Katniss. As does evil Donald Sutherland as the President. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Gamemaker. Woody Harrelson turns in his quirky Haymus (sp) role. The films basic premise is that the victors from previous HG competitions now have to fight against each other because of some special 75th anniversary. That premise was kind of silly, bu whatever. As Peeta and Katniss get paraded around, revolution foments in all districts.I guess we will finally find out what happens in part 3, the Mockingjay, which is apparently going to be released as a Part 1 and Part 2, a la Harry Potter 7. They must milk out ever penny possible. That's about it. Not a lot more to say. I enjoyed this story, the acting, the colors, the fight scenes...all good stuff.

153,akash_sebastian,"At a Higher Level, in Terms of Production Scale as well as the Exploration of the Themes.",8,16 December 2014,"The second part of The Hunger Games series is at a higher level, in terms of production scale as well as the exploration of the themes. It can no longer be called an average interpretation of 'Battle Royale'; character-development-wise as well as politically, this story gives more depth to the entire premise of the 13 slave districts of The Capitol. It is the start of the rebellion.The acting by everyone involved is as good as the first one, especially our Mockingjay, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) who is the flame of the series, and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta shows interesting shades in this part rather than the injured lovestruck puppy of a character he had in the first part The new list of actors added are interesting, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amanda Plummer, Jeffrey Tambor and Jena Malone.The event of Hunger Games in this sequel has much more fierce players since it involves winners of past Hunger Games events, so the competition is quite thrilling to watch. But amidst the games, there's something else happening as well (one should watch the movie to find that out) which makes this event more than just the games. Even the arena is more fascinating this time.Francis Lawrence ('Constantine', 'I Am Legend') takes the baton from the first part's director, Gary Ross, and steers the series in the right direction. His vision works well for the theme.The ending is thrilling, shocking and inspiring at the same moment. It ends with an intriguing twist, and creates substantial interest for the upcoming parts.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

It was boring from the beginning which made me feel uninterested throughout the whole movie. I also thought that the plot wasn't that great either, especially when they are in the games and there's not much fighting which didn't make sense. The ending felt rushed and didn't make sense, like how the games was the plan for a rebellion; how did they know Katniss was gonna survive, let alone cause the power cut which will lead to a rebellion?",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
155,williampsamuel,An exceptional teen thriller that improves on its predecessor,9,7 December 2014,"After watching the first movie I wanted to read the books. Now I know I have to read them, because I cannot wait until 2015 to find out if President Snow dies. For he is the one who forces Katniss and Peeta to live a lie, pretending to all that they are madly in love with each other and grateful to their benevolent government for the lavish rewards it's given them. He is the one who turns their life into an endless reality show/ propaganda tour, with their loved ones at risk if their act isn't convincing enough. He is the one who declares martial law throughout the districts, unleashing Panam's psychotic 'peacekeepers' to carry out a wave of burning, floggings, and executions. And when Katniss can no longer keep up the act, he is the one who puts her, Peeta, and twenty two other past victors back in the arena to show the people that even the strongest can be crushed.The previous games were a tragic struggle between frightened children, many of who had never been in a fight. This time it's different. Every fighter in this competition is a hardened veteran who has killed their way through a previous round of the games. They're smarter, stronger, and far deadlier than the opponents that Katniss and Peeta faced last time. And it shows. The competitors employ more sophisticated strategies, make longer lasting alliances, and fight like the warriors they are. The battles this time are far more fluid and tightly staged, the fighters' movements and attacks driven as much by skill as brute instinct. The confrontation with the baboons showed a particularly impressive level of precision, athleticism, and teamwork.But although the tributes may be good at this, that doesn't mean any of them want to be doing it. Every one of them is mad as hell at Snow for putting them in these games. They were told that as victors they would live a life of luxury and never have to enter the arena again, yet here they are again, fighting for their lives with the odds very much not in their favor. They're prepared to kill as many of each other as they have to, but every man and woman in these games knows who the real enemy is. In the 'pre-games interviews' every one of them make it perfectly clear that they know this is bull, with results bordering on hilarious. The crazy ax girl probably said it best, if least eloquently.The acting is also worth commending. Jennifer Lawrence continues to shine as Katniss. Determined, hard as nails, and yet emotionally vulnerable, she makes an excellent action heroine in the tradition of Sigourney Weaver and delivers a much more nuanced performance than many other actresses her age. Jena Malone is suitably vicious, quirky, and oddly attractive as the crazy ax chick, while Woody Harrelson continues to deliver an entertaining combination of wisdom, wit, and cynicism as Katniss's mentor. And although he has relatively little time on screen, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant and extremely menacing as the devious head gamekeeper.Between the story, action, and acting, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a hell of a movie. It's exciting, engaging, sometimes humorous, often heartbreaking, and frequently thought provoking. It draws unflattering parallels to our celebrity obsessed, media saturated culture, and it will make you angry in the best way possible. And if you haven't read the book there are major surprises in store. Catching Fire is everything a good thriller should be, and well worth watching.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

157,geminiredblue,Second Time's A Charm!!!,9,3 December 2013,"Rarely does a sequel surpass the original film, but CATCHING FIRE does just that! The story: Having survived THE HUNGER GAMES, Katniss and Peeta find it difficult to adjust to their new found glory. On the one hand, they are disgusted that they are viewed as heroes, since they had to kill in order to make it. And on the other hand, they are frustrated to learn that their on screen romance has to continue for as long as they both live. Worse yet, President Snow is still greatly enraged that they deliberately flaunted his rules. People within the districts are starting to rebel and they look to Katniss, in particular, as a leader of hope. So in a devious maneuver, Snow forces both Katniss and Peeta back into next year's HUNGER GAMES. Building upon what the original HUNGER GAMES started, everything is strengthened. The directing and editing has been tightened. From a visual standpoint, everything looks gorgeous and impressive. The human story manages to go even deeper, touching upon issues such as hope under fire and freedom under oppression. Acting wise, we get the same strong performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as well as veterans Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Naturally, the main focus of the story is the death match itself. And in this sequel, the viewer won't be disappointed by a bevy of new and inventive traps and threats.

While still lacking in depth compared to the book the story feels less compressed but the focus is on the main core characters and some side characters get neglected or eliminated. While I was reading the book I thought that some scenes might come of as very cliché in the film and they do, while in the book you get the characters thoughts which makes it all seems less shallow. Altogether I liked it but I just failed to connect with it: it does seems like a good screen translation of the book but still it feels like it's just not epic, not a classic. I never had a 'wow' moment or never felt blown away. I don't completely get the success of the series as there is nothing really special about it...",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
160,herbqedi,Satisfactory Sequel - a bridge from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay,7,30 November 2013,"I truly think that the original, The Hunger Games, as a film, irrespective of what one thinks of its fidelity to the book, is a modern classic. I thought it realized its dystopic future world beautifully and tragically with impeccable and well-conceived costume design, set design, acting, and script. It was fully contained within itself even though they knew when filming it that it was the first book of a trilogy and were already planning to do a sequel. I consider the first one to be at a minimum, a top 500 all-time movie. I just saw Catching Fire. I enjoyed it for what it was - about a 7 on a scale of 10. It is NOT a stand-alone movie but a good installment of a superior serial. It rather mirrors the 2nd episode of other sci- fi/fantasy trilogies such as the original Star Wars (now 4,, 5, and 6) - very much in the dark vein of The Empire Strikes Back. Also comparable to the middle Rings movie and to a lesser extent, Back to the Future II. The acting in Catching Fire is still terrific. The new parts of the set design all underscore the darkness of President Snow's reactionary reaction to what happened in the first movie. Not that much new in costume design, but still fine. But it seems much more repetitive and the Games themselves much less suspenseful than the original tableau. Like most serials, the first 20% is spent bringing the viewers who missed or forgot what happened the first time back up to date. In short, if you were expecting Catching Fire to be another modern classic in the league of The Hunger Games, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting installment II of a serial - a bridge to take you from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay, than you have a perfectly fine version of that.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
161,Chalice_Of_Evil,Catching bunnies and turkeys...,7,20 November 2013,"Is where we begin, after a haunting opening image of Katniss Everdeen overlooking water. Then, like in THG, Gale joins her. Even this opening is more interesting than the first film, and things only get better - a word which, if you could only choose one, would best describe this film in relation to the last. Having not read the books, I can only judge these films as movie-going experiences and not as adaptations, but this was definitely a much improved film from the last. Yes, it's longer (not by much), but what makes it work is that it never *feels* like it's taking too long, unlike THG. Even the beginning half proves more interesting, in comparison to the beginning of the last film. The stakes have well and truly been upped, as now it's the survivors of the previous games pitted against each other. Everything just feels more ruthless. Despite a lot of deaths happening offscreen, this film feels much more cutthroat. One scene involving escape from gas-poison fog which causes nasty blisters is particularly heart-pounding. Jennifer Lawrence, the winner of a completely deserved Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, continues to prove herself the best person for the job of bringing heroine Katniss Everdeen to life. She is the heart of the film and without her, it'd all fall apart. She gives this film her all, going through a wide range of emotions and really grounding the movie. Her dynamics with all the different characters are unique and she conveys so much with even the slightest of expressions. Those naysayers who doubted her in the beginning won't be going hungry, as they should be eating their words by now. She gives everything's she's got, the emotions she experiences on screen aren't just gut-wrenching for her, but for us too, watching her have to go through them. So much weighs on her shoulders, but she endures. Helping with that is Peeta. Her relationship with him is a complicated one, and Josh Hutcherson is up to the task of getting across just how difficult it is for his character. You can't help but feel for him. Meanwhile, Gale gets a few more scenes than just looking on, appearing sad as he watches Katniss & Peeta play up their fake (or is it?) love for each other for the cameras. There's a whipping scene that's quite brutal - as is a lot of the film. Seeing Haymitch, Effie and Cinna return is welcome, and not unlike seeing old friends again. Although she's still made up to look like a drag queen, Elizabeth Banks continues to provide a little humour in these otherwise bleak films, but this time also gets to have some actual emotional scenes - which she does with great nuance and they actually pack quite the punch. Haymitch, although still as alcoholic as ever (as the sound of many an empty bottle is heard whenever Katniss goes to see him), is much more than a drunkard mentor. He's quite complex and, like with Cinna, his scenes with Katniss are always enjoyable to watch. Speaking of, Lenny Kravitz's character provides not only some nice small moments with Lawrence, but also gives us some truly amazing outfits for her to wear that aren't just pretty, but provide statements/have meaning in the film. It's horrible to see what happens to him just before Katniss goes up in that tube, and she has mere moments to deal with it before being thrust into unknown territory. The 'game' between Katniss & Snow is also taken up more than a few notches. Donald Sutherland plays a truly loathsome character...which I guess means he's doing his job well. The horrible things he does in Katniss' name make him someone you really want to see her put an arrow through the eye of. Her sister, Prim, gets some more focus as well, which proves important.We also get some new characters this time around. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee is far more interesting/complex than Seneca Crane (who he replaces) ever was. Sam Claflin's Finnick and Jena Malone's Johanna are two new intriguing additions. While Finnick starts off seeming like just another surfer boy who likes to walk around shirtless, he winds up being much more than that. While Johanna is a bit annoying to begin with, stripping in an elevator for seemingly no reason (though that scene is totally worth it just for Lawrence's expression alone), and while she is a bit shriek-y at times, she proves quite the ally. Jeffrey Wright's Beetee is also a welcome addition. Everyone else? Eh. Some are okay, others ridiculous (pointed teeth and hissing do not a menacing adversary make), most forgettable or annoying. What a difference a new director has made. Francis Lawrence has thankfully ditched the shaky cam that plagued the first film and things aren't needlessly queasy this time around. Everything looks much more impressive on screen, from dresses Katniss wears to the special effects and scenery. Also improved is the passing. While things may start out ""slow"", they never feel plodding. I was actually transfixed by the goings on before we ever got to the action. The score helps. Everything's a vast improvement over the last film. Even the ending, while still a bit strange and rather abrupt, is far superior to the last film's (which really should've ended on Katniss & Peeta, I felt, rather than Snow walking away). This time, the ending has so much meaning behind it. Several characters' fates are left up in the air, but what it really all comes down to is the final expression on Katniss' face. She goes through so many emotions in the space of mere seconds. The final moments really show off Jennifer Lawrence's skill as an actress, and you can't help but think ""There's our girl"". She is indeed on fire. As is the Mockingjay symbol at the end, which promises even better things to come.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
162,Bruce722,Great movie,9,23 November 2013,"Now this is what a book-to-film adaptation is supposed to be like. Catching Fire might be the best interpreted example I've ever seen. The director, Francis Lawrence, seemed to really understand that books, unlike the previous director, Gary Ross, who seemed to miss some key symbolism. Lawrence cuts certain elements from the books, as well as some scenes and characters entirely, but he doesn't miss almost any key sequences that give meaning to the story. The only thing I wish he would've made more like the book was Katniss Everdeen's interaction with Plutarch Heavensbee. In the book, there was a tiny bit of foreshadowing that I would've liked to see in the film. But that's it. That's the only thing in the entire book that was left out that should've potentially been included. That just amazes me how on point they were here. The increased budget also showed. The effects were better, as was the acting. Obviously Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress but the rest of the cast also did remarkably well (Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Jena Malone, Lenny Kravitz, etc.). Bottom line, regardless of whether or not you read the books, this movie stands alone as an outstanding viewing experience. I can't wait to see how they portray the third book.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
163,FairlyAnonymous,"Poorly written, poorly executed, no character motivation, no reasoning, and no logic",4,7 February 2015,"After hearing this movie was better than ""The Hunger Games"" I was mildly excited. I liked the original Hunger Games, even though I didn't think it was a masterpiece, I still thought it was entertaining and mildly interesting. So I sat down and watched the movie and...My goodness... rarely have I been so mad at a film.Imagine a movie where none of the character's have true motivation, the enemy has no motivation, all of the scenes are random and pointless, characters are never fleshed out, the color palette is boring and dull, and everything is absurdly made... This... is Catching Fire.The movie Catching Fire starts off a little while after the first movie where Katniss is attempting to have an emotional scene with her lover from District 12... this is one of the first main issues with the movie: All of the emotional scenes are either poorly acted or poorly directed. The movie is so bleak and emotionless that the actors try to act bleak and emotionless when there are emotional scenes, and it loses the general impact that it should. Not to rip on Jennifer Lawrence (she has had some good parts in other films) but her character is so insanely one-dimensional and forced that it is almost unbearable to watch. This could the director's fault or it could be her fault, but either way it is really bad. The character ""Katniss"" never seems to actually feel or... how to say it... ""think"". Everything she does is spontaneous and forced. Here is an example: Katniss needs to be mad so we will make her randomly run off dramatically. Katniss needs to be showing an attitude so we will have her drink out of a bottle of alcohol. Katniss needs to care for Peeta so we will make her randomly make out with him. Katniss needs to have one-liners so we will make every SINGLE WORD SHE SAYS A ONE-LINER!!! Starting to see a pattern? Katniss isn't a character in this film... she isn't even a human being... she is a plot-device just to have certain events happen. If the movie needs a sad scene then it will make up a reason for her to be sad. If the movie needs her to cry for no apparent reason it will find a bull-crap reason to make her cry. This becomes super frustrating because it makes her impossible to relate to. Who is Katniss? What is her personality? The answer is: Nothing. Her personality literally changes between scenes. In one scene she is Katniss and in the next scene she is drama-girl.That is just one issue. The next big issue is the villains... and my goodness does this section fail hard. The bad guys in this series are just... too evil. There is nothing wrong with villains you love to hate, but this kind of becomes similar to the finale of Breaking Bad where the villains are simply too cruel and too unforgiving to really... understand. For example, someone raises their hand during a speech, gun him down immediately. Another example is where a military leader who is in charge of District 12 comes in and kills the old leader of District 12 for... no reason. It doesn't make any sense. The movie is trying to say ""Look, he is cruel and unforgiving"" but why on earth would he kill his own military equal? Just because the bad guys are BAD doesn't mean that they are illogical. A system where everyone kills each other on a whim wouldn't hold up for more than a couple of years and this has been supposedly going on for 75 YEARS!!! And again, the villains in the movie have no motivation. Why are they evil? Because they are. Why do they kill? Just because. Why did they start a military campaign on District 12? Just to show that they are evil. The villains in this film repeatedly say ""We want to give the people hope, so that they don't need a reason to rebel"" however, throughout the entire film you see them destroying their hope. As mentioned before, the bad ""Peacekeepers"" go into District 12, start torching houses, and start destroying all pictures of loved ones...WHY? THAT IS LITERALLY THE ONE WAY TO MAKE PEOPLE MAD! For bad guys who claim to want to ""Control the people by giving them a little bit of hope"" they are doing a bad job by crushing all of their hope... and then outright killing those people for no reason.This is only the beginning for why this movie is so bad. Other annoying things are the fact that characters we have seen maybe for five seconds in the previous film are supposedly important now and have their own emotional scenes. This makes it awkward because there is an emotional scene with a character who we don't even know who it is. The movie is just a jumbled mess. It feels like someone read the book and said: Let's throw in random scenes from the book without any clear reason... we will just throw in random points from the book and hopefully the audience will understand.All in all, this is a poorly directed film and is really boring/obnoxious to watch.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
164,Tcarts76,A great movie but there are flaws,8,30 January 2014,"Important note:I didn't read the books!I gave the first movie a 9 out of 10 and definitely looked forward to this one. All in all I am very satisfied and liked this movie but there are a few flaws that made rate this one 1 spot lower. I'll try to explain without giving a spoiler, but my small issues will probably only be understood after watching. I do recommend watching.The acting was solid,the story solid, and it was entertaining. What I subtracted points for is that there is a practical issue when it comes to being able to include/represent all districts. Hopefully this isn't a spoiler, but there is only 1 winner in each evolution of the Hunger Games with the exception being Peta and Catness. 1 winner, not one female and one male winner. Since that last movie stated that ""some"" Districts have volunteers every year and are a virtual shoe in to win. It makes it puzzling to even have a queue.My second demotion was that I think that the main event was some what mailed in compared to the first film just utilized to bring the movie to the most important part, the end.Those aren't huge issues and most people won't catch it or even care.This was a pretty good movie, so watch it!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
165,Avwillfan89,A vast improvement from the first one,8,3 December 2013,"This film relies mostly on the action and constant threat of death, which was what the book Catching Fire really was about. The Capitol is an amazing combination of terrible violent dictatorship in a dystopian world and the sadistic need to see people tortured and killed, and Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Laurence) poses a threat to the dictators and a beacon of hope to its oppressed citizens, a symbol of freedom, a MockingJay.In the first film, the intensity started only when games began. In this one, it starts almost immediately and does not stop. Double the intensity and distress in the film makes it not only a great adaptation of the novel, but an excellent sic-fi action flick.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
166,foxtografo,One of the biggest waste of time I ever had in front of a screen,3,3 August 2014,"This is not a movie, it's a part of a movie, and not even a good part. It's the boring part of a movie that's split in many parts (three is it? I'm not informed, sorry). So, if you're not planning to watch all the series, don't ever bother watching this, because as a stand alone movie doesn't do anything interesting, anything fun or entertaining, anything new or anything at all but boring. To start the action the director takes one and half hours repeating the same lines and concepts and conversations over and over again. Things that we already know from the first movie, as how's the society, what they expect from them, how people lives, etc (which was nothing new or original in the first movie, less it is now)... this could be done in half hour or less. Then we get to the action, which develops in the same (or similar) environment than the first movie, with really poor ideas, and wasting all of the characters they presented before, as we don't see what happens to most of them. So, this whole movie could have been half hour in the beginning of the next movie, and not a waste of two and half to see nothing. Terrible. There's nothing happening, barely the set up for something that's going to happen next, but just because time goes by, not because something actually happens here. Acting is good, but characters were doing nothing interesting at any point. This was a completely pointless movie. A mere intermission where nothing happens. I don't see what's the point. Old characters didn't evolve, added new boring uninteresting and useless characters, repeated landscapes, environments and situations... all was more of the same and less than before. You can definitely skip this one and go for the next, I think I won't even risk it to get bored like this again, will see.Good acting, non-existent story, bad writing, fair photography. Completely unnecessary, a waste of time and money.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
167,tr91,Better than the first Hunger Games film,9,21 November 2014,"Let me first start of by saying that I have never read The Hunger Games books so my review is based solely on how the films pan out. This film takes places directly after the events of the 1st film where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have just won the 74th Hunger Games and are now being targeted by the Capitol.I felt everything about this film was superior to its predecessor. The acting is stronger, the character development is stronger, the action is much more fast paced and also more realistic and just in general it doesn't seem as cheesy. Don't get me wrong the 1st film was good for laying the foundations but Catching Fire took the series to a different level.I'm now really looking forward to Mockingjay part 1 which hits cinemas this month and I'm also considering picking the books up as I really like the whole setting and the characters.8.5/10 and it becomes a new entry in my Top 10 Films of 2013!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The premise is astoundingly dumb, far worse than the original and a non existent plot you can see coming a mile away.The acting is wooden, the emotions fake and the direction dull.I would say this is for kids if not for the whole murder aspect but you would have to be a child to like it. It comes off so hammy and unreal. I think I was about to fall asleep about ten times.Please don't make a third one.This is what we can expect from a generation of writers who have no sense of real drama, the Harry Potter and Twilight crowd who flock to this garbage like a moth to a flame and come out raving about it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
170,achyutaghosh,solid sequel,8,7 December 2013,"The Hunger Games- Catching Fire is a worthy sequel to its fine predecessor. A quick flashback on the premise- in a dystopian future, Panem and its decadent elite rules over 12 impoverished and rebellious districts. Panem conducts an annual event- the Hunger Games to enforce their domination. The games are gladiatorial fights to the death and a test of survival between selected representatives from all the districts, and there must be only one winner. Catching fire Picks up right where the first one ended, when Katniss and Peeta were crowned joint victors on choosing to end their own life rather than take each others. ""Remember who the real enemy is""In this edition, they are now unwilling pawns for Panem, who want to use them to bring peace among the districts. When things start getting out of control, and the victors become a symbol of the revolution, a new Hunger Games where only ex victors would fight, is constituted. This time round the going gets a lot tougher as it is not innocent children, but vicious killers and shrewd survivors in the fray. Unlikely alliances need to be made, and bonds are tested to the utmost. The movie is not a slam-bam affair, it gets going slowly, and there is plenty of emotion, drama, and action. The budgets have doubled over the last movie, and it shows in the excellent quality visual effects. And of course there is Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss with grace, vulnerability, inspiration and steel. In an environment thriving on animal instinct, she brings in a sense of humanity. At the same time, she is also a kid and she learns the hard way that defiance begets repercussions.Catching Fire suffers from the unfortunate case of being the second in a trilogy. Like the Matrix Reloaded or The Empire Strikes Back, it builds up to a point but then ends rather abruptly- as a result, a lot of questions, but no answers. Even then, it is a great lead up, with the bigger picture emerging- the focus of the series shifting away from Katniss, her family and love life, to the revolution, while at the same time probes deeper into the series themes of love, honor, loyalty and freedom.People who have watched 2012's Hunger Games will enjoy this thoroughly. Even though Catching Fire is highly recommended, new viewers will do well to see the prequel or reading the book before going for this. The odds are in its favor, after all- 8/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
171,jace_the_film_guy,High Quality Source Material,9,14 September 2021,"Driven by a compelling premise and high-quality source material, The Hunger Games transports the viewer into a world with tributes, districts, and victors. Punctuated by a simple, yet refined score, the story was presented logically and with emotion, which created investment. You understand each of the character's fears and feel the same level of distain toward the Capitol and the ignorance of the citizens who live there.Though the acting from the supporting cast is a bit lackluster at times, Jennifer Lawrence delivered a beautiful leading performance and Woody Harrelson was perfectly cast as her begrudged mentor. From start to finish, the tension is high as Katniss navigates friendships with an expiration date and the sickening reality of the games. There are small details missing which could have elevated this film even higher, however, The Hunger Games is still a powerful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' acclaimed novel and a beautiful beginning to the story of Katniss Everdeen.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
172,jace_the_film_guy,Quite Possibly the Best of the Franchise,9,14 September 2021,"The second installment in The Hunger Games franchise is quite possibly the best. The performances are more believable, the set/costume design is superb, and the cinematography is breathtaking. Not only is the film presented in a way that beautiful to watch, but there is real emotional depth, especially with Katniss and Peeta. While their relationship is superficial in the first film, Katniss and Peeta's bond is strengthened and much more convincing as they must traverse life together after winning the games.I wish that there was more time spent developing the motivations of the side characters, however, the film did the best that they could under a 2 ½ hour runtime. Knowing that the franchise was going to split the next film into two installments, I personally think that this could have been the film to split more effectively. Still, Catching Fire did a great job of establishing the same spirit of the 400-page novel.By travelling on the Victory Tour and starting the 75th games, we are introduced to new characters that instantly catch your attention. The casting team put together a powerful group of actors, especially the new additions. Though this was their first introduction to the franchise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Plutarch), Sam Claflin (Finnick) and Jeffrey Wright (Beetee) had instant identity and immediately demanded the investment of the audience.I strongly believe that this is the best installment in the Hunger Games franchise and is easily the best film of 2013. More than just staying alive on a TV show, Catching Fire brought a deeper purpose to the Hunger Games. With the tagline of ""Remember Who the Real Enemy Is"" there is a clear direction and future for the characters we are dying to stay alive.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
173,krycek19,Is Lady Gaga the costumedesigner on this crap?,1,15 November 2015,"I really really hate these movies. Sure this is a little better than the original. But still way too long. Nothing happens at all until 90 minutes into the movie. Why can't they ever make these movies shorter? Like an hour 45 minutes at the most.I don't know what I hate more the ridiculous customes and makeup on all the rich a-holes in the capitol or the watered down violece to make it PG13. I've heard that the books are pretty violent.Or how it's possible for the rich b*st*rds to keep everyone poor and under control?? And why is America divided into districts?? This is in some post apocalyptic future that looks like Russia 30 years ago. Where it's always winter, except in the capitol. These things are never explained in the movies. Possibly in the books that I will never read anyway. So I don't know if there was a nuclear war. And I don't really care.What I do know is that these movies would have been much more interesting if they had been R rated.If they had spend less money on crappy CGI and gay looking Lady Gaga customes and makeup and more money on action and real violence. And if they had made them 30-45 minutes shorter. Then these movies might have been interesting.Jennifer Lawrence is not even that hot. Nice body but ugly face and the general acting except from Woody Harrelson is a joke.Avoid these sh*tt* movies.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
174,Mike-DD,It's Not Battle Royale Because It's Not Supposed To Be,7,16 March 2014,"An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
175,Spartan_1_1_7,Now this is how you do a sequel.,8,22 January 2014,"Now this is how to do a sequel. It is better than the previous part in every way. Better story, better pacing, better acting, better action and way better Hunger games itself. I was very underwhelmed by the game in the first one, it actually bored me somewhat. The game in this one on the other hand was intense and enjoyable. Story picks up from where it left off from the previous part. I loved the whole revolution vibe and its starting. There were more politics this time around and made the movie more interesting. Side characters in the movie were better, lots of new ones. Elizabeth Banks this time had a little more role and I really liked her, great acting by her in all that weird dressup. I still can't get behind the fact that rich high society folks in this series wear such GAY and weird and lame clothes. CGI was decent, an improvement from the previous part. The whole Hunger game, about 40-45 mins of it was shot in IMAX and it was beautiful to look at in HD quality. Gotta say, IMAX scenes always stand out in HD print. Same was the case with The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and TRON Legacy. Action scenes were enjoyably and tense sometimes. The pacing was MUCH better.I can't wait to see where the story goes, really wanna see the revolution and stuff. Overall a great sequel.8/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

177,caseynicholson,"An Expansion of ""The Hunger Games"" Story",7,12 December 2014,"It goes without saying that a sequel builds on the storyline of its direct predecessor. This is of course true for ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", but the way in which this happens is an expansion of the original story, rather than simply a telling of a new ""Hunger Games"" episode.Here's what I mean. Some sequels attempt to take the basic model of the original film and to essentially replicate the story in a way that the film becomes a copy of the first film (""The Hangover"" films come to mind). Other films play out more like a television series, in which the sequel builds into an ongoing drama. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the latter.If you're familiar with ""The Matrix"" trilogy of films, you'll know what I mean here. Like ""The Matrix"" films, ""The Hunger Games"" sequel advances the plot of the original film in a way that is expansive. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark's story takes on new life, all the while introducing new characters, a new edition of the annual Hunger Games bloodsport event, and ultimately a cliff hanger ending that is sure to leave you hungry for the next chapter.That said, the big question surrounding this film is whether its expansive nature works. To allude once again to ""The Matrix"" trilogy, we know that expansive sequels that veer in a different direction from the original don't always fair well. Whether or not ""Catching Fire"" suffers from the same drawbacks as ""The Matrix"" sequels is a matter of opinion. The first time I saw the film (during its original theatrical release run), I wasn't sold on it as being quite as good as the original. I'd still stand by that assessment, but upon a second viewing I must say that the movie has grown on me.I will note that ""Catching Fire"" is a film that deserves a close viewing--it's not a film that one wants to watch with divided attention, unless you've seen it several times and know the story by heart. If you're not in that camp, you'll find that the expansive nature of the film demands attention, otherwise it might be easy to get lost.But while the film is an expansion on the original, and while it certainly introduces new elements to the plot of the overall series, the good news is that it does this in a good way. While the original still stands out as a wonderful standalone film, ""Catching Fire"" is a well made, well produced sequel that is immersive if given a chance.That said, I'd give this film 7/10 stars. The movie is a bit weaker than the original, but it nonetheless delivers a powerful movie experience with a plot that engages the viewer and makes one care about the characters as their story advances into a new chapter in the ""Mocking Jay"" movies.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
178,snperera,My favorite hunger games film!,9,6 February 2017,"This is such an intense and emotional ride and you better get on. The reason this is my favorite is because I believe Katniss has developed so much in this movie as a character. Spoiler Warning: She ends up having to go to the hunger games again. And when she does she shows that she will not let the Capital defeat her, no matter how many times she gets knocked down. I love the relationship between her and Peeta. He was always my favorite and he develops as a character as well.

I had seen and loved Battle Royale, and I felt like The Hunger Games would be a more PG version of that. But I decided to watch the first film, and I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. But this one is even better. I walked out of this film really pleased. It does have similarities to the first film, but I think this one does everything better. It has a lot of really interesting twist and turns to the story to keep me wanting to know what happens. The film ends in a way that really leaves you wanting to see the next film so you can find out how the rest of it plays out. I would say this film can appeal to both men and women, with it's mix of action, drama, and romance, and that works to it's advantage. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will love this one.

It's full of characters befitting a teenage fantasy novel and indeed there's not much guessing needed as to the target audience.The concept of a SciFi world in which kids are forced to fight each other to the death is a terrifying one and needs to treated either as a gruesome horror or a satire with tongue firmly in cheek.

181,cadillac20,A Surprisingly Good Movie That Surpasses It's Predecessor In Every Way,8,22 November 2013,"I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan of the books, but I did enjoy Hunger Games, despite it's tweenie appeal. I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. Maybe it's the Battle Royale and Lord of the Flies fan in me. I did enjoy the first movie. It was a very well done adaptation. However, having read the entire trilogy, I feared that adapting the rest of the material would result in something similar to the books: terrible follow ups. As someone who takes the content of these books and the things that themes and stories they are trying to tell just a bit more seriously than the target age group might, I groaned and moaned throughout the novels, especially the last one. However, the film has done something I didn't think it could do: not suck.That's right, the movie does not suck. In fact, it's actually quite good. So good that it out does The Hunger Games in nearly every way, something that is quite the opposite of the novel. Where the original movie, while good, also came off feeling like it was feeding that tweenie audience it was aimed at, something about Catching Fire feels far more serious and far more mature. The film picks up right where we left off. Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, while the rest of the districts are showing signs of civil unrest due to Katniss defiance of The Capitol, that oppressive government regime that forces districts to send their children to die. To send a message to the districts that the capitol is still evil, they devise a new Hunger Games, this time forcing past victors back into the arena. Because what is a Hunger Games movie without the Hunger Games.The first film, at times, felt like it was doing too much to introduce us into this world. Everything felt like some kind of obvious plot detail. While I enjoyed the film, I often felt disconnected to it and the issues it tried to present. There was so much focus on details of the world and the games, that the presentation of the world seemed to take a back seat. Lawrence was the major saving grace, though even she wasn't perfect. All of this has changed. With the games essentially taking a secondary part in the film, there is a stronger emotional connection. It helps that all the actors involved are not only a bigger part of the film but seem to be more comfortable and are much more convincing in their roles. Where the characters of Effie and Haymitch and even Gale seemed purpose driven, with little more than a role to fill, here they feel more fleshed out. They have a greater impact and there is more of an emotional connection, from Haymitch's clear frustration between his contempt for the Capitol and his attempts to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, to Effie's attempt to keep everyone as a team and sure signs that she is struggling with the facts of Katniss and Peeta once again thrown into turmoil.The performances are the primary strength here. They do deliver on the emotion that is necessary to drive this story and don't feel like they are catering just to tweens, with the poorly written love triangle of the novel and the more trivial elements that are apart of the kind of writing that comes with novels aimed at tweens. Catching Fire feels like a serious movie with a serious story to tell. At it's heart is Jennifer Lawrence, who seems like a completely different person here. Since the original movie, as an actor, Lawrence has had several projects and has even won an Oscar. And so, it is no surprise that she feels like she is at an entirely different level. She seems more natural as Katniss and her acting is far more convincing. She comes off as someone who is not only conflicted, but scared. Even so, she remains strong and determined. Much like the first movie, as Katniss, she proves to be among the best of role models for young folk. But beyond the performances, everything just feels elevated. The story has a better focus on the growing revolution that is clearly starting. The themes are more apparent and focused on. Everything feels less obvious and more natural. Gone are introductions to this world and it's elements, replaced by a futuristic vision carried purely by it's story and characters. Even the games are better, with more exciting action, better effects, and better character interaction, helped by a cast of new characters as fellow tributes. I do seem to be gushing about the film, and it's not one I had expected to like nearly as much as I did, but I have to admit it: this was a very pleasant surprise. My fear now is that the next films won't live up to this sequel. But, I will give them more of the benefit of the doubt, considering how much this film blew me away as far as surpassing expectations. As I said in my review for the first film, fans will love this, and non-fans may also find themselves won over.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in the lead role, showing a great range of emotions and intensity, it was one of the best performances by a lead that I have seen in a long time. But this movie is full of great acting, with all the parts being played to a high level, and it goes along with a suspenseful and exciting plot, which draws you into the movie with ease and skill. I know I sound like I'm gushing, but it's just that kind of a movie, where you leave the theater excited and with an afterglow of having seen a first rate piece of film making.

185,FilmMuscle,"""The Best Tween Movie"" Is Not Really Saying Much",5,20 December 2013,"I'll preface the review for Catching Fire by firstly saying that I absolutely disliked the first entry (""hate"" might be too strong of a word to use in this case). At the end of the day, this series is a light version of similar, but much more brutal, stories (Battle Royale, for example), which is why it's just a YA adaptation and nothing more. Catching Fire promised a darker and more unforgiving tone, and it succeeded in some respect. Whereas the first film felt like a cheesy film for innocent teenagers (especially once we arrive at the tedious hunger games), this one finally builds some intrigue and substance by introducing the whole political realm behind this world, focusing on the corruption and the manipulation of its people therein. In fact, there are incredibly resonant and strong themes that could be find throughout the film. For instance, the act of constantly providing coverage on a very popular celebrity- the people eat it up- and in the meantime, the Capitol is able to get away with the evil that's practiced behind the doors. The entire concept draws quite noticeable parallels to our contemporary world as the 99% concentrate on Jennifer Lawrence's new look or her recent interviews at the last red carpet, completely forgetting their lowly stature in current society. See, it takes all the attention off of the government's wrongdoings. So, hopefully, its core demographic (teenagers living within conservative families) actually take note of these analogies and find something more in this ""tween flick"" other than the usual fare you'll discover in the standard young adult novels. Anyways, a considerable portion of the film actually centers on this fascinating premise until we leave all the meaningful material (the filmmakers, at that point, recalling that this is a Hollywood movie and there needs to be action for the sake of entertaining the teens) by straying into the predictable, boring, and excessively prolonged section that is the hunger games. The hunger games should be the whole point of the movie, right? Unfortunately, it's an atrocious point nonetheless. Again, this motion picture is another YA (young adult) adaptation that is heavily toned and dumbed down for the pure teens and kids who're seeing this as the darkest and most brutal film they've ever witnessed. The entire hunger games sequence is utterly predictable (which was one of the greatest issues I had with its predecessor). No one of real significance meets death; they all conveniently survive the dangers of these games. I'll even go out on a limb and say no major character is going to die by the end of the series. Apparently, the audience would be traumatized if their favorites didn't manage to escape the island, which really makes the games fairly superfluous. Look, with such a dour concept, I really need to be seeing an abundance of blood, death, and hopelessness (you're all probably gasping by now). Otherwise, it's sheer pointlessness and doesn't deliver on what it clearly promises. As if that wasn't a transparent indicator of a YA feature, we thankfully get another forced (teenagers eat this up, which I frankly find laughable) love triangle. Can we, for once, have a female protagonist that's serious and determined to solve the conflict without involving herself in some unneeded romance with generic pretty boys? If females really don't take issue with this element, that is probably why there aren't a lot of particularly memorable females in cinema when compared to the amount of male badasses. Seriously, if every female character is a total slut, I'm not going to look up to them, and I certainly won't like them. (The feminist movement will be on me anytime soon now.) Do even the female badasses really- really- have to deal with this teenage angst bullsh*t? When we're looking at the performances, I found Phillip Seymour Hoffman a definite highlight as he frequently is. I might be in the minority here, but Jennifer Lawrence is just trying too hard at this point. She tries to fill her performances with overly dramatic scenes (incessantly crying, screaming for five minutes, etc.). Perhaps, it's the actor's own willingness to expose herself so often- through every interview and red carpet appearance- that I just don't find her that convincing when she enables her ""I'm an Oscar-winning actress"" mode. A lot of the other characters are terribly bland, but I enjoyed Woody Harrelson's and Elizabeth Bank's performances on the other hand. Furthermore, and somewhat most importantly, the movie is just too long, especially once it hits the hunger games, which seem to drag on forever. All in all, the only interesting aspect of this film was emphasized in its first hour (even then, there's an artificial love triangle subplot tossed in there) and probably the only intelligent content you'll find in any YA adaptation. Yes, the narrative is beautifully shot- I'll give it that- eliminating the distracting shaky-cam action from the first one, but that only marginally improves the film's quality when you're required to deal with a principally uninteresting storyline. If you're a fanboy of the books, you'll probably end up enjoying the film as you did the first one (I suspect that's why these two movies have been getting such unusually high praise). If you're not, you'll likely end up uttering the phrase ""Battle Royale with cheese"" at least once.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
186,tinovalkki,Way better than Hunger Games,8,24 November 2013,"Catching Fire works much better as a movie, than Hunger Games did. http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/the-hunger-games-catching-fire-2013/Hunger Games focused on more teenage romance such like Twilight movies. Catching Fire trusts more social criticism and action. There could be more social criticism but even like this movie brings enough out subsurface smoulder rebellion. Katniss grows in her role better as a face of a mutiny. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss does manage her role way better than Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Donald Sutherland endorse as President Snow. Action scenes are clever and excited. Violence has kept quite mild to ensure low age limit for the movie, but even like this they are brutal enough. Movie timing works perfectly and length of two and half hour do not feel too long. End scene could be better built, because now it feels a little too rapid and terse. On the other hand we already know that there will be third movie so that can somehow vindicate cliffhanger in this movie. Third movie will be divided to two parts, so we will let see does in feels same kind of capitalize on like Twilight did.

I almost quit watching the movie but decided to endure.The best part of the movie is the later part where they fight.

188,julian-mumford,"If the final two films are as good as this, bring them on",9,2 December 2013,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is enjoying her freedom back in district 12. As much as one can enjoy living in a dystopian totalitarian state, faking your love for someone, whilst your real affection lies elsewhere.Before you can shout ""teen love triangle"" alert, the film and the books on which they are sympathetically based, are intelligent and redolent with deeper meanings and subtexts.Notwithstanding these heady ambitions, both books and films can be voraciously read and watched with ease, allowing adults both young and older, to consume the material on whatever level they choose.Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have challenged the Capitol and won. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) cannot allow this embodiment of resistance to stand. Unless their undying love during the victory tour through the districts, is sufficient to continue to distract the huddled masses.If not, an example must be made. The hope keeping the masses content must now be extinguished. What Everdeen as the Mockingjay represents, cannot be allowed to flourish, lest others believe resistance is possible.Forced to continue their PR blitz just as the populace are seeking a resistance figurehead, this will only further seal their fate in the eyes of president Snow.""Peacekeepers"" move in to conduct a brutal repression of the populace, with heavy and hardly coincidental Nazi undertones. The game makers then under the guidance of new games-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) hatch a brilliant plan. This will not only satisfy the bored idle residents of the Capitol, demonstrate to districts that hope has been snuffed out and make an example of the girl on fire.It will be no surprise to the audience that the games arena features in the story again but for those who have not read the books expecting a retread of the first film, will get more than they bargained for.The film ends on a perfect set up for the final instalments, stopping at just the point you would expect, leaving audiences wanting more.This film is darker, grittier and deals with even more disturbing themes than before, the film does not hold back, yet manages to portray the harsh realities just off screen.Stanley Tucci reprises his role as the odious sleaze-ball ""Caeser Flickerman"", dripping with insincerity and filling the screen with dental work sufficient to power the city by itself. Donald Sutherland, enjoying every moment, making each quiet scene count as he realises his omnipotent power still remains insufficient, to quash the uprisings threatening the status quo.Liam Hemsworth as ""Gale"", the real love interest, gets to be all square jawed, wooden and patient. Woody Harrelson as the haunted ex games winner ""Haymitch"", does drunk very well but also gets a few meaningful scenes this time out. Elizabeth Banks continues to bring the Quality Street bedecked bubble head ""Effie Trinket"", just this side of believable. Lenny Kravitz again belies his rock-star background, with another quiet performance, as dress designer ""Cinna"". Phillips Seymour Hoffman is curiously subdued and clearly skipped both wardrobe and the hairdressing trailer.Hutcherson as Peeta is a definite acting upgrade from before and acquits himself reasonably well but will always struggle as indeed does everyone, against the acting juggernaut that is Oscar winning, Jennifer Lawrence. She runs, fights, shoots arrows, looks gorgeous, is a tom boy one minute, love interest the next and and yet manages to find suitable expressions to fit all of these perfectly. The closing scenes, in particular shows the easy range she possesses, conveying three distinct emotions with nothing more than her face and eyes in a quiet but portentous sequence.Again the violence is handled sensitively, with pitch perfect tone and remains much less exploitative than the average CSI woman in peril storyline. Director Francis Lawrence (no relation) with his cinematographer Jo Willems, desaturates the scenes in the districts, heightening the colour in the capitol to emphasise the differences between them. The film is in good hands and all being well, will be directed by the same team for the closing films shot back to back.One could write volumes on what the books mean, what messages they send and the warnings from history and for the future they signpost. However, one can enjoy the films for what they are, a rollicking good story, with action aplenty and with fine acting talent on board. Only slowed down for the occasional ""lovey dovey"" stuff, which will pay dividends later in the story.The Hunger Games : Catching fire is well named, this where the franchise will transcend normal box office returns and sets up for the final book, split into two films. Expect massive returns, with the odds most definitely in the studios favour.Incidentally, the Latin ""Panem et circenses"" translates to ""Bread and circuses"" to describe entertainment used to distract public attention from more important matters. With the government providing ample food and entertainment, the citizens would give up their political rights.Summary A well made exciting thriller which is about so much more than youngsters attempting to murder each other to entertain the bored masses. If the final two films are as good as this, bring them on.Highly recommended, go watch it http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

While Ross' directing was good in the first one and gave a more realistic feel, I prefer the new director, Francis Lawrence. Everything looks better and it feels like a much bigger thing and there are also some very good shots. The visuals are stunning and the arena part is very well done and will keep you at the edge of your seat. Some people will complain that the first half is slow, but it's really important in building up the second half. You get to know all the consequences left by the previous one and look deeper in Capitol and rebellion. The second half is when things start to really move. Rebellion becomes bigger and bigger, we meet some new characters and then it becomes non-stop action. Then there's the twist ending that will totally leave you hanging and you will really want to know what happens next.

190,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The high-octane second installment in the Hunger Games film quadrilogy,8,20 April 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the much-awaited sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, The Hunger Games, which was based on the second novel in Collins' acclaimed The Hunger Games trilogy—a young adult science fiction series set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic districts of Panem under the ruthless control of a totalitarian state called the Capitol. With several actors reprising their roles from the previous film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has an ensemble star cast that includes the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Woody Harrelson.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is set on a much grander scale in comparison to its prequel. The plot picks up from where it was left in the first movie with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes chosen from District 12, being declared as the joint winners of the 74th Hunger Games under dramatic circumstances. The shocking turn of events which saw the emergence of not one but two winners for the first time in the games' history seems to have infuriated President Coriolanus Snow who is adamant on teaching Katniss and her kin a painful lesson. What ensues is a whirlwind adventure of epic proportions that will shake the very foundations of the residents of Panem and the dictatorial regime that governs it.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire gives great attention to the technical detail. But, what makes it stand out is the meticulous manner in which it seems to tackle the emotional aspects which often seems to be lacking in such films. The credit for this must go to the director for eliciting worthy performances from almost all his actors and the screenwriters for adding a great level of maturity to the plot by the virtue of a multilayered narrative while keeping intact the thriller and mystery elements of the novel.Speaking of movie's technical elements, it's imperative to talk about Alan Edward Bell's taut editing and Jo Willems' breathtaking cinematography. While Sutherland, Tucci, Hoffman, Harrelson and Wright are brilliant in their respective roles, it is Jennifer Lawrence who is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. It's an absolute delight to see her go from strength to strength, completely unfazed by her recently acquired super-stardom, continuing to deliver one strong performance after another with such aplomb that one usually associates with great thespians.Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire offers entertainment galore. It may not be great cinema but it's definitely much superior to the run-of- the-mill Hollywood productions that are all style and no substance. Catching Fire is a high octane extravaganza that also offers some food for thought for those who are willing to look beyond the obvious. Catching Fire serves as a powerful social commentary in that it highlights how the strong tend to oppress the weak when in absolute control of things. We have a real entertainment feast at our disposal and it's only prudent to savor it to the fullest. 8/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

192,jburtroald95,"Plays more to the emotions than to the mind, but what it does, it does well",8,11 December 2013,"Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games was both a thrilling and moving survival story and, more importantly, a profound and deeply disturbing comment on the pervasive nature of political corruption and tyranny and the tragic futility of overzealous public revolution. The point of the both the novel and Gary Ross' impressive film adaptation was that mass uprisings achieve very little, but small, subtle, individual pieces of defiance can achieve a great deal. The political explorations were neatly contained within a depiction of the 74th Hunger Games of the film's title, and the open-ended conclusion was pleasingly thought provoking and self-sufficient.By extending the story into a series of novels, the other two of which I had no desire to read, Collins allowed the astute observations of the first instalment to be overtaken by a radical, impassioned, crowd- pleasing thrust into sudden revolutionary fervour. This is all very rousing and genuinely involving in Francis Lawrence's film adaptation of the sequel Catching Fire, and, from what I hear, the novel successfully taps into the same rebellious zeal, but passively participating in a war between demonic bureaucrats and spunky, underdog insurgents from the lower classes is much less sophisticated and distinctive entertainment than watching a young victim of a dystopian regime balance prudent obedience and caution with stealthy personal defiance. Still, the merciless despotism of the Capitol and the opposing bravery of the insurgents are very convincingly portrayed. Watching this familiar story play out, we fully believe that no one is safe from being beaten, tortured or killed by the oppressive government, with the exception of Katniss, who is the obligatory 'chosen one' in this particular tale of good versus evil. As in the first film, the dangers inside the Hunger Games arena, which here include monstrous, carnivorous monkeys and a terrifying poisonous fog, are palpably menacing. The stakes are convincingly high and the violence of this film is much less sanitised than most Hollywood blockbusters.Also, despite the radicalised political agenda, the story thankfully retains its focus on fully-fledged individual characters, rather than restricting the characters to a narrative toolbox of simplistic archetypes. Peeta, the sweet, selfless gentle giant, is as endearingly heroic and his portrayal by Josh Hutcherson as poignant as in the first film. Jennifer Lawrence also continues doing what she does best, and what won her an Oscar lost year: exuding engagingly vulnerable angst and cynicism as a calloused victim of circumstance who plays hard to get with the audience's sympathy. Her new struggles as a simple archer, big sister, surrogate mother and small-time rebel who has come to be seen as the figurehead and leader of a revolution are indeed very compelling. I certainly found myself sharing her every thought and feeling in her every scene, which is exactly what you want in a protagonist. Liam Hemsworth is once again effortlessly charming as Gale, who, on the other hand, hankers to be at the forefront of the imminent rebellion. The larger and much more active role that Gale is now starting to play gives us the chance to see a little more than mere charisma from Hemsworth as an actor. We also see much more of the coolly despicable and alarmingly observant President Snow as he begins to step out of the bureaucratic shadows and confront Katniss, and the political threat she poses, more openly and mercilessly and we get to see more of 78-year-old Donald Sutherland's effortlessly evil characterisation. It is also very satisfying to see that Effie Trinket, the aristocratic caricature that actor Elizabeth Banks and costume designer Judianna Makovsky entertainingly overplayed and overdressed in the first film, is given quite a few well-handled serious emotional moments this time around, and that Primrose (fine young actress Willow Shield) is showing signs of inheriting her sister's backbone and stealth.This multitude of individual characters and interwoven subplots has now became the greatest asset and primary way of distinguishing between other epic tales of good and evil that ultimately converge at the same narrative and thematic point. When the destination is a given from the moment we have our sneering, sly old villain – Snow – and our feisty young chosen one – although Katniss is at least more interesting than an everywoman – the route taken to that irresistible beacon and the detours along the way is what sets these stories apart from one another and what gives us a reason to travel to the same place so many times. The visual execution of this familiar story is also very commendable and entertaining. Once again, the flamboyant, loud colours and shapes with which the centre of the Capitol is painted brilliantly convey the suffocatingly immense wealth and power of our villains and streets and inhabitants of the impoverished District 12 appear convincingly grim and grisly, but not to the point where our heroes are no longer photogenic. The action scenes inside the arena are very well executed, being very impressively staged, designed and shot this time with omniscient clarity rather than in the chaotic, subjective style of the first film. However, from a narrative point of view, Catching Fire is far more subjective than its predecessor was. We are no longer invited to step back and holistically examine our own society and its history through objective futuristic allegory, but instead we are pulled in intimately close to these particular personal and political conflicts at a level of proximity that snuffs out objectivity as it preys on our emotional impulsivity. Collins and Lawrence certainly succeed in making us emotionally invested and closely involved in the story, quickly and easily getting us to cheer and feel deeply for our heroes and to fear and despise the totalitarian antagonists. This kind of engagement with an audience might not be nearly as intellectual as the devices used earlier in the series, but the emotional subjectivity that has now taken over the series is undeniably just as entertaining and valid in its own way.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

As in the first one, the quality of this saga is in the group of specific symbols and atmospheres that are those of a well defined universe. But this good elements are not at the service of a well done narrative development, that goes without an anxious feeling that instead should be in a dystopian world like this. Characters reactions are not guided by serious fears or sorrows and all the protagonists results static: the interesting dystopian place described is not impregnated by a terrible feeling that instead we have to expect. In this second movie, moreover, the love plot is more presented but, for the same reasons now expressed, it sounds artificial and moralistic, without a real deraglement of the feelings in a horrible situation like the Hunger Games one. Terribly overrated, as the first one.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
194,gerry_barnaby,brilliantly written storyline,8,26 November 2013,"I watched the first film of this which was OK but I wasn't to impressed with it normal when a sequel came out the sequel is normal bad but I was surprisingly surprised that this sequel was better, the storyline was better written it had a bit more interesting things going on.There is a lot of smoke & mirrors going on in this film that you find yourself glued to what is going on which to some people mite be predictable where other wont figure out what's going on, but the special effect specially with the island & jungle there is more than just a group to attend with it like they up the game in this sequel making it harder to survive.I love the way they put a bit of humour but as well as the defiance scene's to stick it to the man was funny even I laughed at which work pretty well for the story of the film, The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect.The beautiful Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace made her for a believable character as Katniss I just cant see anyone else as the strong heroine for this role. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life hence the drinking heavy, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was.Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow you kind of feel you just want to get a hold of the guy & punch in the face for having no respect for human life. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true, Everyone brought something great to the film but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie high standard with her performance is outstanding & believable. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome & done just right so that it didn't go overboard to look ridiculous & to Hollywood it was just right.You will get a lot of people with mix reviews about this film, but it a film you should experience for your self as it dose surprise you as being a good film, all these it the next twilight film is not of the sort completely different storyline altogether & a completely different genre altogether.Now I didn't think I would like this film at first when I watch the first film, but I decided to watch this sequel since I've seen the first one I will say this one is better than the first film.It a film I recommend you watch just for the experience of seeing a great film that well written from the books, I cant wait to see the 3rd film, as this film has that gladiator feel to it which make this film a good film to watch.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
195,ccamp89,"Better than the first, but there's still room for improvement.",7,26 November 2013,"Catching Fire makes a number of improvements over its lackluster predecessor and is a much better film for it. After a very strong first half though, it takes a bit of a dive and by the end I was left a little underwhelmed.Before I get to that though- the positives. One of my biggest problems with the first film was that it took a weighty, horrific, and tragic concept and turned it into a film that felt too light and easily digestible. It could be the fault of the source material (I haven't read any of the novels), but it felt like so much thematic potential was wasted on flimsy, poorly choreographed action sequences and a hackneyed love plot. After a promising half-hour, the film quickly devolved into a standard action/thriller affair that barely scratched the surface of the intriguing concept. Catching Fire definitely rectifies this for the most part. It feels appropriately weighty and more solemn that the first film with public executions and other atrocities of the Capitol put on clear display. It also delves more into the psychology of fear and how it can be used to oppress which is a welcomed bit of depth.The excellent cast helps to sell all of these heavier moments. The acting in the film is uniformly excellent, and once again Stanley Tucci steals every scene that he's in. The award for most improved character unequivocally goes to Katniss though. In the first film I felt that she came off as overly stoic and enigmatic. I realize that these traits are supposed to be elements of her character, but on screen it didn't translate well and she seemed emotionally flat and distant. Katniss in Catching Fire is a much more dynamic character with clear moments of desperation, helplessness, strength, and resolve. Thanks to the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence and the improved script, she feels like a much more fully realized character with the power and charisma to properly carry the film. Like its predecessor though, Catching Fire is still a very front-loaded film. Essentially every great scene in the movie is over by the time it reaches the halfway point. One scene in particular I found to be particularly well done was the scene where Katniss and Peta are broadcast to the Capitol for the first time outside of their houses in Victors' Village. The scene jumps back and forth between the bright, glittery stage of the Capitol where the broadcast is being played and the barren, dark, and dreary village. It creates a poignant visual metaphor that very successfully conveys the superficiality of the games that comes across it a subtle and tasteful way. I sensed a bit of social commentary in this scene as well concerning our own entertainment in the real world and how superficial and plastic it so often is. The weighty, intriguing scenes like this though slowly but surely gave way to a final act that once again left me wanting more. The hunger games themselves were definitely better in this film than they were in the last. The participants felt a little more fleshed-out and had their own distinct personalities rather than the one-dimension villainous participants we were treated to in the first film. The action sequences were also choreographed and filmed much more coherently. Still though, I felt the portion of the movie that takes place in the hunger games once again disrupted the flow of the film and deadened the narrative tension that had been building up until that point. Once the games start, there is almost no attention paid to any of the characters other than those inside the dome. All of the thematically interesting, morally thought-provoking scenes are left behind for uninspired action sequences which just drag on and on. We basically just watch Katniss and friends run away from poison fog, rabid apes, tidal waves and other dangerous things over and over. It's a jarring transition from all of the political intrigue and dramatic, weighty character interactions that came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb. Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but there's still undoubtedly room for improvement. It once again fails to fully impress with the actual hunger games portion of the film but there's also a lot of powerfully acted and poignant moments as well before it enters that final slog. These are the moments that give me hope that the series will be able to truly deliver on its interesting premise in future films.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
196,JackCerf,Disappointing,6,12 May 2014,"I don't think this would work well as a stand alone movie for someone who hasn't read the books. It isn't the performers' fault; they give it their all, or a little bit more. There are some fundamental script problems.First,the PG-13 rating. Haymitch is a very sober drunk, and we don't see Katniss get hammered with him when the QQ is announced. No avoxes. Peeta has two good legs. Cray isn't an exploiter of young girls.Second, not enough hunger. Katniss is extremely conscious of food. The party scene works as well as it does in the book because , despite herself, she really enjoys the delicacies she's eating. That makes her revulsion over the vomit producing drink even stronger, because it stops her from being seduced by the Capitol's luxuries. In the movie it has to be spelled out.Third, the books have texture because of the way Katniss interacts with minor characters: her prep team, Cray, Darius, Madge, Hazelle, Greasy Sae, even Prim's cat that she can't stand. As in Casablanca, the bit players provide color and background that make the major characters stand out. That's missing in the script, which is why we never get a sense of the community Katniss comes from that has made her who she it. The destruction of the Hob doesn't matter because we never see it in operation, and we don't miss District 12 because we barely get to know it from a few establishing shots of industrial squalor.So we get a workmanlike portrayal of the major plot points, while the reader provides depth that isn't on the screen.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
197,Macleanie,This is the start of the rebellion.,9,18 June 2019,"Novel to big screen masterpiece. Captures the emotion and desperation of the story beautifully with some brilliant performances from the cast of the not so up to scratch predecessor. I have read the books, they are fantastic, however the first instalment was a poor film. The second totally caught me off guard, I left amazed. I gasps several times during the movie, it really is an emotional roller coster. I do have one criticism, due to the peak of emotions in the storyline it was difficult to fit it all into a 2 and half hour film. Which often meant key moments in the book were slightly rushed but its understandable. Thoroughly enjoyed it, definitely the best book. It forgets the cheesy pansyness of the first film and digs into the fascination and breathtakingly depressing plot. This is the start of the rebellion.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
198,justbob1982,Hunger Games grows up,7,16 March 2014,"Version I saw: UK cinema screening (2D)Actors: 7/10 Plot/script: 7/10 Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10It's not in the least bit original, but that is not the point. Ever since I saw the first Hunger Games film a couple of years ago, the sources from which it drew inspiration were pretty obvious. Suzanne Collins claims never to have heard of Battle Royale when she wrote the books, but the premise is so similar that it is hard to credit, and there are strong echoes of Rollerball and The Running Man.The excellence of the films, though, is in the delivery. It is there in the acting, exemplified by the storied Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Katniss is genuinely one of the best feminist role models around today, a complex three-dimensional character often favourably compared to Twilight's Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Lawrence has also developed in the last couple of years into a highly respected actress from whom one can expect a strong, serious performance every time.Like Lawrence, all the characters and actors involved with the Hunger Games have developed from adolescence to full-on adulthood, with an increase in maturity and consideration. The plot is all about this tension, between the well-considered, dispassionate choice and the emotive decision dictated by the heart.Add in the well thought out production design, evoking a largely low-tech future that is easy to understand so that the more complex science-fiction concepts can pass without difficulty.Intelligent, well thought out design that develops the story between films, and solid professionalism in delivery, make The Hunger Games what it is. I only hope they are not derailed by the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
199,s_campanale,The Capitol Strikes Back! - The revolution will be televised but no one bothered asking Katniss if she wanted to take part!,8,21 November 2013,"""The Hunger Games"" books by Suzanne Collins have become one of the most popular YAL phenomenon's of recent years, eschewing the mythical fantasy elements of most of the others and in Katniss Everdeen providing a pleasing counterweight to impassive, self-absorbed Bella Swan, even if the story they tell is hardly original (""The Grapes of Wrath"" + ""Battle Royale"" + ""Spartacus"" + ""Gladiator""+ ""Rollerball"" divided by Reality TV and Celeb culture) The first movie was well made and exciting, but could not escape from the limitations of its simple and well-trodden narrative, especially since the visceral violence, moral ambiguity and teenage slaughter that gave the horrific concept its power were virtually airbrushed out, making the feared gladiatorial trial into a glorified paintball game fought between fit good looking teens divided into absolute assholes and decent noble saintly types. Fortunately the second instalment expands both the story and the characters out as other ""part 2s"" like ""the Empire Strikes Back"" ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Godfather II"" did. Set a year after the last movie, it starts with Katniss and Peeta still playing their star crossed lovers part to an adoring televised audience, having become media darlings and an unwitting symbol of revolution and discontent to the masses in the fictional Roman Empire USA of Pan-Am. Wily President Snow at first tries to use her popularity to stave off revolt, something she acquiesces to since she realises the dreadful consequences of another all-out war, but once their whistle stop publicity tour only manages to make things worse, including bringing her own District 12 under brutal martial law, the situation becomes untenable. Shady new game maker Plutarch Heavensbee, a man with his own secret agenda, advises the desperate Snow to hold a special ""quarter quell"" edition where only previous victors from each district will compete, in the hope of making Katniss out to be a murderer and so kill her popularity around Pan-Am. With events spiralling out of control for the scared and traumatised Katniss, she and Peeta end up back in the games alongside a host of former champions, most of whom are not best pleased and openly incite sedition. As full scale war looms without, within the new games area, Katniss and Peeta make allies with other enforced former champs Finnick, Johanna, Mags, Beetee and Wiress to form a team against the rest and against the myriad dangers sent against them by Plutarch, including acid mist, killer baboons, lightning, tidal waves and rivers of blood. As this happens Katniss finds herself increasingly torn between her affections for hunky paramour Gale while at the same time finding her respect and feelings for Peeta secretly swelling within to the point where she is willing to put his life before her own.Naturally the film finishes on a cliff hanger of the ""tune in next week"" variety, but the fans who've read the books will be in no suspense. The direction from journeyman Francis Lawrence is good, and the script by Beaufoy and Arndt is effective and manages to create a sense of increasing emergency and tension as not only Katniss' world, but the entire system begins to fall apart as a result of her simple desire to live. The costumes, CGI cityscapes and sets are more impressive this time around (the safer bet having paid off) and the Hunger Games arena is a replica of Hawaii (shot in actual Hawaii though) which makes for a visually more interesting setting than No1's generic forest.The characterisation and the skilled actors bringing them to life are particularly impressive. Lawrence continues to grow as an actress, and oddly makes Katniss more vulnerable and human this time around, a scared, traumatised victim of other people's power play rather than just the ballsy archery chick of the first instalment. Josh Hutcherson still plays Peeta as a noble soul, but there is also vulnerability in him, hidden beneath, while his romantic rival Gale becomes the rifle wielding resistance leader courtesy of Liam Hemsworth but still has very limited screen and plot time. Woody Harrelson makes his alcoholic former champion and mentor Haymitch into a more rounded character, one who has seized the Katniss phenomenon and sees the chance to use it to finally do something good. Ditto Elizabeth Banks as oddly costumed hostess Effie, changing her horizon line of loyalty from the Capitol to her own personal team and so edging from quasi villain to quasi heroine. Stanley Tucci still excels as that personification of game show host false bonhomie and glitz Caesar Flickerman, with Marie-Antionette wig wearing Toby Jones still around as sidekick. Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings his usual cold, sinister cerebral quality to ambiguous game maker Plutarch, someone who may be a good guy but is still someone you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. Veteran master and legend Donald Sutherland (thank goodness these films exist to introduce him to a new generation) expands the character of President Snow, making him less villain and more just the guy at the top trying to keep everything from blowing up, increasingly frustrated as he realises bloody war is coming regardless. Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone and Lynn Cohen make for good former champs and allies, making this more a team event that all against all.A solid middle chapter, and the last to feature the 'games' concept (already well played out by Episode 1 and feeling quite deja-vu here) it stands as a great improvement on the already solid first part and hopefully a good indication of the civil war drama to come in episodes 2 and 3.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
200,AbhiMathews,"The Good, The Bad..,",5,17 August 2014,"Watching this film, I was polarized. There were moments I really enjoyed and scenes I wished were rather not kept. As the second instalment in the 4-part series, Catching Fire will pique your interest in the very beginning (literally). As the movie continues, however, dullness from the acting and rather weak plot elements really begin to tear the movie down.The awkwardness and sheer lack of emotion from some of the characters in select scenes may have been for ""theatrical effect,"" but it really withdrew from the film. Discussions were shallow and common ploys like that seen in the first instalment left me unimpressed with the first few scenes. As the movie progressed, though, the story began to pick up and whether it's the twists or the games itself, things certainly were entertaining. My main critique is for the below-average initial forty minutes of Catching Fire. Apart from the very first scene, the rather weak storyline and acting was uninteresting to say the least until the Quarter Quell begins.Without spoiling too much, watch till the end. As more plot unfolds, the true games begin. Hopefully the sequel picks up where this one ended.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Perfectly cast, builds on the world set up in the first Hunger Games and even builds on the book material so, so, so well!
Interesting twists and turns. Great suspension and emotion - I think it's worthy to note that even though I have read all the books and knew what was going to happen, I was sitting on the proverbial edge of my seat with the tension, suspense, and the mystery. And the emotion is excellent - I felt like crying at several strongly emotional scenes and I had a strong urge to jump up and cheer at certain important moments which I will not spoil.
A very, very excellent movie that I strongly recommend.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
202,YJLcool,"a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller",9,24 November 2013,"Despite from a young adult novel similar to Twilight, Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or Percy Jackson, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire proved to be a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller that's well surpassed the first film, and dare I say, even better than any of the recent young adult novel-to-film adaptations out there. The film spends the first half of the film to explore and develop its thought-provoking themes: totalitarianism (more specifically fascism, extreme far right of the political spectrum), inequality and class warfare, oppression,the abuse of social media and political manipulation eventual uprising and revolution, hope, courage and sacrifice, the psychological consequences of taking human lives. These are the thematic elements that make this film stand out among others. Moreover, the film further addresses the personal feelings of the hunger games victors in the aftermath of the games in the first film...how they feel as a result of killing others. The film also takes time to further develop the love triangle relationship between Katniss, Gale and Peeta...Although Katniss' feelings with Gale (childhood sweetheart) remains unchanged, it is noticeable that Katniss really cared about Peeta and starting to fall in love with him as the film progresses. The entire film comes across as far more complex, heartfelt than its predecessor.At the young age of 23, Jennifer Lawrence managed to pull out such a great performance to carry the film and letting the audience feel emotionally engaged throughout the film. Although the scope of the film is getting bigger, the film never ceases to focus on Katniss' feelings, about how she deals with the situation. The set (jungle arena) and costume designs were amazing this time around as they get a bigger budget (Jennifer looks good in the 'wedding' dress)However, the film does have its flaws. most of the thrills of the tournament are left out in order to develop the story. We don't get to really know the contestants in detail (other than they're the previous champions of the games), they're just there to be eventually killed by others due to the tight-writing of the tournament. It is not further explained in the film either on why some participants willing to sacrifice their lives in order to save others whom they barely know (possibly for the greater good as they now become a symbol of hope for the districts?).Furthermore, the shaky-cam filming for some of the action scenes hurts the film as well.As mentioned in the title, this film is truly 'catching fire', exceeds expectations and further promises an epic conclusion near the end of the film. Now, I'm really excited and looking forward to see how Mockingjay is going to be adapted into two films (Part 1 & 2) to provide a satisfying conclusion to the series.Highly recommended.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
203,sohansurag,Packing the right amount of drama and action,7,24 December 2013,"While the market's saturated with Vampire romances (hiding its shades of abstinence, cheesy romance and what not), The Hunger Games took a leap forward introducing a bloody albeit sensible saga for the teens. Much more serious in its presentation, Suzanne Collins has written a trilogy both teens and adults can enjoy and the movies based on it are just as good. As evident from the first Hunger Games, Catching Fire is no different and it doesn't disappoint the least. I know I am late, I watched this movie like 2 weeks back and then I was caught in a Smaug- sized void.Helmed by Francis Lawrence of Constantine and I Am Legend fame, Catching Fire continues where the original left off, we are introduced to a very disturbed and vulnerable Katniss Everdeen having hallucinations post her first Hunger Games. And just when you thought everything would be fine and well for her, it gets worse when 75th Hunger Games starts, also known as Quarter Quell. The first act of the movie was lush with characters new and old, setting things in motion leading to its finale in Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2. It did have a slow pace but it was captivating enough to make you feel that Panam and its politics were real. It does a very good job of showing the totalitarian capital and the undemocratic ways its politics goes.Of course it all gets unarguably thrilling when the Hunger Games starts and it does get the adrenaline pumping. Our hapless heroes and their formidable foes are put head to head against all kinda new threats and it does make you wonder ""May the odds be ever in your favor, Seriously?"" Katniss and Peeta's bond goes stronger throughout the Games and it all ends in a cliffhanger and a rather intriguing one at that. It keeps you wanting more.Jennifer Lawrence, indisputably, comes off as a winner here. She might not grab another Oscar for role but the way this girl acts is just jaw- droppingly convincing and yes, she was indeed a sight for sore eyes. Elizabeth Banks was annoying but i suppose she was written that way. Woody Harrelson, without surprise, steals every scene he was in whereas Donald Sutherland on the other hand felt nefarious beyond limits. Instead of Wes Bentley's Seneca Crane, Philip Seymour Hoffman shares the screen as the new Gamemaker and showing off some good performance as well.IMHO, Catching Fire got way too dark and I sometimes questioned myself if the fiction was intended for teens. I was not too happy with the weird love triangle tension between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. It remains to see how Mockingjay would end up, its safe to say in Francis' hands its off to a good start.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

As other reviewers have said, this sequel improves upon its predecessor in pretty much every single way. The cast has a more balanced chemistry, so that Lawrence does not have to carry as much of the film herself. But she is terrific again from start to finish.The overall plot narrative comes across great. The visual design, editing and cinematography are really well-tailored to suit the story. It feels like all of the pieces came together here in just the right way, from the director to the cast to the crew. While the first film was solid but clearly an adaption of a book, Catching Fire is a fully-realized film. It is fluent, inspiring, emotional, exciting and so many other things. I highly recommend it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
205,aaronjbong,"A Film Bursting with Energy and Beautiful Storytelling, Unstoppable Fire",9,23 November 2013,"""Catching Fire"" is the highly awaited sequel to the immensely box-office-smasher ""The Hunger Games"". Based on the middle book of Suzanne Collins's best-selling trilogy, it focuses on the complications Katniss faces after her actions in the previous film, and the rising of a rebellion against the cruel Capitol. Katniss won the 74th Hunger Games, alongside Peeta Mellark. This means that she broke the rules as a single Hunger Game can only have one victor. by threatening the Capitol, they both won the game, although this meant breaking the rules. The Capitol felt mocked. What worried the Capitol was that this instilled a spark of hope within the citizens of Panem, and a rebellion itself might be imminent. So, in an attempt to reaffirm their authoritarian power, the 75th Hunger Games is born, and its tributes (participants) are to be chosen from the existing pool of victors. Since District 12 has only had one female victor, Katniss heads back to the arena. Characters from the previous film are back. Our heroine Katniss Everdeen is back! She's even bolder this time around and her hatred against the Capitol is very conspicuous. Peeta Mellark is also back and let's not forget his famous rival Gale Hawthorne. Amazing side characters like Haymitch Abernathy, Cinna, and Effie Trinkett return too. Oh, and don't forget the lovable Primrose Everdeen too. New movie, new characters. There's a new Gamemaker. Seneca Crane, the man with the fabulous beard, is replaced by Plutarch Heavensbee. He's more aggressive and his affiliation is mysterious. And the tributes! Just when you thought the District 1 and 2 tributes are terrifying in the first film, the new tributes are even more dangerous, having all been victors. Gloss, Cashmere, Brutus, Enobaria are the new Careers here. Other tributes include the brilliant Beetee and Wiress from District 3, the heart-melting Finnick Odair from District 4, the aged but humble Mags from District 4, and the violent & brave Johanna Mason from District 7. ""Catching Fire"" amps up the stakes considerably compared to the previous film. While in the first film, only the other tributes pose the threats to the characters. But here, not only to the tributes become even tougher, they've also got the Capitol against them. The fate of the Panem is now in uncertain hands. Trust is scarce. What they say and their true feelings must carefully considered. New director, new style. For those who despised the infamous ""shaky cam"" from the previous film, well don't worry. There are no shaky takes and you can enjoy the beautiful sets and thrills without a headache. The scenes are now smooth and some of the thrilling sequences are perfectly shot, literally perfectly. Watching it in IMAX glorifies this aspect. The sets are amazing. The Capitol is amazing, futuristic, and just awesome. Beside the beautiful Capitol, there's also other districts too that are shown in the film, most notably District 11. Performances were outstanding. Jennifer Lawrence is without a doubt the star. THE STAR. She has incredible talent and powerful skills. Her performance is incredibly captivating and we are always with Katniss. However, that's not to say that the other members were bad. They were also great, but do not measure to Lawrence's ability. Josh Hutcherson was great as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth was stellar as Gale Hawthorne. Sam Claflin was charismatic as the handsome Finnick Odair and Jena Malone was vicious in portraying Johanna Mason. Donald Sutherland was imposing as the feared President Snow and Stanley Tucci was of course charming as the exuberant host Caesar Flickerman. With excellent storytelling capabilities and an interesting continuation, ""Catching Fire"" is one hell of a ride, with exhilarating action sequences and powerful performances, especially Jennifer Lawrence as the lead heroine. This film surpasses the original film in almost all aspects. Its story is more interesting, its themes are more mature, the stakes are higher. Wonderful job! Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""Catching Fire"" is a perfect continuation of ""The Hunger Games"", with fluid pace, excellent storytelling, an interesting premise, and flawless performances, most notably Jennifer Lawrence.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I watched the movie at an IMax (where even the worst movie looks OK) but there was nothing visually spectacular. Character development phase is not that bad but there was no character that I could like (including Katniss. Actually especially Katniss). There was nothing special about the performance of Jennifer Lawrence to say the least. She really needs to work on acting and expressions. She was really boring. The other characters don't even have an impact. When it comes to the story, it is somewhat not so believable.

207,stephenlovelette,This is what a 'Great Sequel' looks like,10,24 June 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a great sequel.It's incredibly rare that a second installment can be considered 'good,' let alone 'great.'A great sequel contributes a furthering and expansion of the narrative, evolving on the previous film's themes and ideas, while maintaining suspense, thrills and compelling character interactions throughout.I catch a lot of flack for finding The Hunger Games underwhelming.The chariot promenade through the poorly animated stadium is painfully striking in contrast to the rest of the film, and ironically the scene in which she sets fire to her dress knocks down the whole movie a couple pegs.Overall, I enjoy THG the First, but Catching Fire is a significantly better film.The first suffers primarily from poor CGI. Catching Fire never once does.This deserves the full five stars. I should have given it 4.5 since it's PG-13, but I stand by my 5. The stakes are high and this is solid, thoughtful filmmaking. It's as good as a PG-13 movie can be.Obviously it's helpful that the author, Suzanne Collins, wrote the awesome character names and brilliant plot ahead of time. But it's translated to the screen in a masterful fashion.Catching Fire is easily worth your time. If you haven't seen it, stop reading, I might spoil something below.This sequel's also the perfect example of what a stellar cast looks like.Admittedly, Elizabeth Banks has been one of my favorite actresses since Zach and Miri Make a Porno (one of the most underrated comedies of all time.) And in the first Hunger Games I thought nothing of her character, Effie Trinket. Frankly I found her irritating.Who'd have thought she'd make such a huge turnaround? She totally catches me by surprise midway through, and gets the tears flowing. Betty Banks plays such intriguing roles and is hands down one of the best actresses working today.J-Law (as Katniss Everdeen) can do no wrong.Even her little sister, Primrose Everdeen (played by Willow Shields) is a strong small character.And The Tooch! Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman is, if anything, even more perfect than he was in the first film.This is just a well-made movie on all quarters.People complain about Lenny Kravitz as Cinna (Katniss's wardrobe designer) but I can't see why. I think he delivers just fine.Complaints arise when Woody Harrelson's role as Haymitch Abernathy comes up in conversation. But why? Woody Harrelson's a great actor who, as this character, doesn't irk me in the slightest! He even gets the emotional juices flowing when he makes a turn and you can tell he's grown fond of Katniss.How about Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee? It's a sheer delight to watch the character developmental of the 'game maker.' What a great character!Another one of my favorite players is the fetching Jena Malone as Johanna Mason. You love to hate her from the beginning, and the scene where she strips in the elevator is fantastic. The subtle misdirecting of the audience is executed with precision.In much the same way, Sam Claflin is excellent as Finnick.If you insist on squeezing a criticism from me, I'll give you my strongest half-hearted slight on the plot. Don't get all up in arms, but I think Katniss's treatment of her love interests is not ideal. She's our hero, years are passing, and she's stringing two men along who've only been loyal and honest with her.But she's a complex hero with tough decisions to make so disregard that last point.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel that delivers more than its fair share of compelling narrative.I can't wait for installment number three.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
208,cleary-joshua,I haven't been so glad I was wrong in predicting a movie in a long time...,9,28 May 2014,"The biggest question when making a sequel to a 'high-concept' film is ""where can this go next?"". The whole film is made with an idea or event in the forefront, not necessarily the characters. Therefore the sequel can go one of two ways: focus more on the characters this time, or have a related but bigger event (""Jaws 2"" - more sharks!). Where ""Catching Fire"" succeeds most is finding a good balance between these two. The character relationships are expanded on well, and we get the title event without it being a rehash of the first film. I have to confess now that I never expected to like the first one, since young adult novel adaptations seem to be so difficult to make work without cliché or melodrama. I haven't been so glad I was wrong in a long time.The world of ""The Hunger Games"" has changed drastically since the first film, and Katniss Everdeen is both a symbol of hope for the oppressed people, and a part of their downfall, as it only makes the state fight back stronger. She and Peeta have to continue the charade of a relationship in order to maintain this hope, and it is here that the two lead actors, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, show their greatest strengths. There is great chemistry between them, and you can easily feel this anger and pain. Helping them along the way is Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, who continues to make an interesting and often amusing alcoholic.The intricate style of the first film is retained and built upon here, and the film excellently portrays visual contrasts between District 12 and the Capital - it's very much a matter of 'how the other half live'. And the film wouldn't really be the same without the title event, the actual 'Hunger Games', which manage to be even more impressive than those in the first film. At the charge of this, having replaced Seneca from the first film, is Plutarch Heavensbee, played masterfully by the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann. The concept behind the games this time is so smart, and it's constantly thrilling.The film's greatest successes come in two things: you never feel the two hour runtime, because it's really a movie of two parts and links the two seamlessly; and it's arguably a better movie than the first one, something which is so difficult to pull off. 'The Hunger Games' laid all the groundwork, characters and drama. 'Catching Fire' expands on this, making it relatable but still a movie with a different feeling. The cliffhanger is infuriating, but it just means that I can't wait for the final two parts. The biggest question now is where the films go next. I haven't read the last book, so I'm not sure whether we get another Hunger Games, or with the impending revolution, the tone will be very different. I suppose time will answer that.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I mean, come on, are these people saying this is one of the best films ever made? Get real people!I made the mistake of seeing this turkey the day after I saw 'Blue is the Warmest color'. A big mistake. One is full of emotion, the other is full of cheese and sentimentality. One is so real you feel you are there, the other is full of CGI ripped off from the first movie. One has some of the most tender and beautiful acting I've seen in ages, the other is full of cheesy one liners including 'I hope I get to love like that one day'.Hunger Games: Catching Fire is absolutely shocking. Not even Jennifer Lawrence can save it.I loved the first one which felt fresh, ambitious and different. This just felt like scenes left over from the first movie. I also cant emphasis how cheesy this film is, what's with the Hollywood weepy music? I've heard people have cried during this film, all I would say is, get a life. The forced emotion is laughable. Oh, it's also a total snoozebuster, I dozed off twice during the first 20 minutes.By the time it got to the end I (I've not read the books) I was hoping the whole island would explode killing everyone in the process. I felt nothing for any of the 2dimensional characters.8.4? I'm still laughing at that!

211,jaguiar313,"Bleak, dull and disappointing sequel.",5,22 November 2013,"I have to start out by saying that I have never read the Hunger Games books and therefor am taking the movies for what they are. That being said, I enjoyed the first film, it was no classic but, it was entertaining and Jennifer Lawrence gave a strong performance as usual. But, sadly the second film based on this trilogy of popular books is a moody and bleak disappointment. Catching Fire picks up with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) about to embark on their victory tour to be paraded like show ponies through the districts. But, Katniss' act of defiance that provoked the unprecedented two winners in the 74th Hunger Games has sown the seeds of dissent throughout the 12 districts and is seen by The Capitol as a symbol of rebellion. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) himself visits Katniss to warn her to play nice on the tour or her family and friends will suffer the consequences. Meanwhile Katniss is suffering from the horrible guilt of having to kill and watch others she bonded with die and no matter where she goes, she finds herself being looked up to as a symbol of hope against the totalitarian government and her own contempt for The Capitol grows each day. Snow's new game-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a solution to their woes... to make the 75th Hunger Game a battle between selected former winners of the games from each district and to make sure Miss Everdeen is not amongst the winners this time. Now, as the wind of rebellion is starting across the districts, Katniss and Peeta must fight once more and this time against proved killers. Will the shell shocked Katniss survive once again or will the country's hope for freedom be crushed with the death of their symbol of defiance. Catching Fire is this time directed by Francis Lawrence who gave us the moody and bleak fantasy flicks Constantine and I Am Legend and brings that same dark and grim atmosphere to this middle chapter of the book based trilogy and to be honest little else. Fire is a rather dull and by the numbers sequel with a very sedate and bleak look to go along with it's oppressive atmosphere. I realize this is a story of a land governed by a cruel and iron fisted government who are planning to basically execute the peoples' first glimmer of hope so, I didn't expect rainbows and unicorns but, when a movie like this' best scene involves a dress, then you know there's not much going for it. Even with Katniss being inserted into another combat, the 75th Hunger Game provides very little action and literally no suspense as it focuses on Katniss and group of allies commiserating in the jungle arena with very little threat save some poison gas and some foul tempered primates. Their actual foes rarely put in an appearance, save when their pictures are displayed above in the sky to signal their demise... most of which prompted this reviewer to ask ""who the hell was that?"" And that's also a problem, we only get to know the participants that are crucial to the plot and the rest are just fodder to try to give the game some urgency and body count... and it doesn't really work because, we never really care about these people and some we have never even met. To be honest save for a few moments, such as the before mentioned dress scene, I was pretty bored with what was going on. Katniss never seems to be in control like in the first film and spends most of the film pouting or having combat flashbacks and we never get endeared to or behind her like in the first flick. Here she seems to stew in her unhappiness and let others around her do all the work till literally the last few moments of the film. And it's not until the very last scene do we finally see the fire back in the eyes of the girl on fire... then we are left with an open ending leading into the third flick. Sorry, but for someone who hasn't read the books, this was completely unsatisfying. The cast all perform their roles just fine with Harrelson once again standing out and giving a strong turn as Abernathy... he has become one of the best actors out there... Sutherland is appropriately slimy and singer Lenny Kravitz also impresses as Cinna. As for leading lady Lawrence, she is good and gives the part a lot of emotional depth but, since most of those emotions require her to pout, cry or have a screaming out-burst, it's just hard to warm up to Katniss this time. And as for her co-star, like in the first flick , Hutcherson recites his lines with does eyes making his every scene appear like he's posing for a velvet painting. And does Katniss really love him or the hunky Gale (Liam Hemsworth, Thor's brother) because, I am confused at this point and not sure I care. So, in conclusion, this second Hunger Games failed to get my interest or emotional involvement in the story because, it was just too dark and bleak and gave us a lead character who, instead of being a symbol of hope, looked like she was ready to climb under a blanket on the couch and pout with a gallon of ice cream and a bottle of scotch. And after watching this moody second installment you might want to too! At least the sets and FX were top notch and Harrelson and a few others elevated their performances above the dark cloud that hovers over this flick. Very disappointing.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
212,aldri-feb,Safe sequel from the franchise,8,23 November 2013,"Undeniably 'Catching Fire' has more complex story than the previous movie. It isn't only about the game but also about rebellion from community who against the Capitol. Half an hour of the movie is about Katniss and Peeta doing Victor's Tour to districts and continued with conflict amongst them. Just don't expect too much that battle in the arena would be so fun like in 'The Hunger Games', the game is a little bit strange this time but it's revealed at the end of the movie. The most vital of 'Catching Fire' is existence of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss although the entire casts also can't be underestimated. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show with her talent and takes her role seriously as icon of this movie. She makes Katniss' character more alive and could be becoming one of the best female hero ever created. Overall 'Catching Fire' is a solid entry of the franchise, it also has heartfelt moment. Perhaps it's not as fun as 'The Hunger Games' but the film succeed making audiences curious of what would happen at the next chapter.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
213,keithlovesmovies,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Review,8,22 November 2015,"After arriving safely home from their unprecedented victory in the 74th Annual Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) discover that they must do a quick turnaround and begin a Victors Tour. As she and Peeta travel throughout the districts, Katniss senses a rebellion is stirring. However, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) proves that he is still very much in control when word comes of a cruel change in the rules for the upcoming 75th Hunger Games.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in the second film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.So this is the next one. Katniss and Peeta are now champions of the 74th Hunger Games and now they get to flaunt this around in a tour across all the other Districts. President Snow (Sutherland), however, is sensing a rebellion developing amongst the districts so he tasks them to try to ease the unrest or risk the death of each of their families. Once they fail, Snow devises a plan to put each of them back in the following year's version of the Hunger Games by altering eligibility rules by making former champions of each District the only ones who can compete (this is how they keep Katniss and Peeta involved, I guess). The familiar cast of supporting characters are back for this one, President Snow, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss' mother (Paula Malcomson), Katniss' sister (Willow Shields), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). They are all joined by two new additions, Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). I though the returning cast, as in the first film, were good here and the new additions were good as well, especially Claflin who had some good lines and some real scene presence. The stars, Lawrence and Hutcherson, were better here than the previous film because of more experience with the roles. I appreciated the fact that we got to spend more time with Katniss and Peeta during their own lives as the idea behind the whole ""Hunger Games"" thing just seemed and still seems silly to me. There was still a Hunger Games here but it was secondary to the District civil unrest storyline. The first film had some of this but this was expanded much more here. I was always much more interested in this storyline than the other. I also liked the suspenseful aspects revolving around this as found myself pleasantly entertained. Of course not all of my suspicions were answered (especially by the ending) but I didn't mind because there are two more films left. The actual Hunger Games themselves were better than the previous film because it was more exciting as there was more action, more special effects in the this one's landscape and the monsters which they had to face, and there was more camaraderie amongst the participants. Overall, this is definitely an improvement over the previous film as it started to stray away from its original story and heads towards what is hopefully a satisfying conclusion.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
214,charliep14,A very ambitious movie & quite enjoyable,7,24 November 2015,"They tried to fit in a lot in this movie. As such, the main issue with Hunger Games: Catching Fire is its length. Your mileage may vary but it does feel long at times.Not that it's boring at all: what it does it does quite well : set up the rebellion, introduce us to new key characters and another round of fighting!Without spoiling: though this second edition of the Games is less exciting than the first one (mostly because we've been through this recently), it is a key episode and kicks off the 'true' hunger games story very aptly.One can understand why they decided to split the third tome into two movies when watching the second movie: it does a lot but it is still quite successful.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
215,wlee08,Sadly Does Not Meet Expectations,5,24 November 2013,"The Hunger Games borrows a little from the myth of the Minotaur, a little from the short story The Lottery, a little from the Truman Show, a little from Schwartznegger's Running Man, a little from Lord of the Flies. The plot originated in the movie Battle Royale (you might say ripped-off) and the future-Gothic costuming is reminiscent of Dune. It's a wonderful Freudian mix if you can relate to it on an emotional level. Unfortunately you can't. The reason is because the kids play along. Instead of being vulgar and defiant for the camera, they enter the twisted battle on horse-drawn carriages, proud of their beautiful custom-made clothing, their designer taking a bow for the masses. Up against insurmountable odds -asked to do despicable things to both strangers and loved ones - you would expect them to be mooning the camera every chance they get - (which is 24/7) but that might make it a PG movie. So instead they deliver a few touching speeches and jump into the arena. Some of the effects are good, and there is some decent suspense, but these elements are spaced out among the slower moving backdrop.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
216,zactac,A worthy middle chapter in a surprisingly mature teen franchise.,10,22 November 2013,"It is has been over a year now since the first ""The Hunger Games"" took the box office (and audiences) by storm. Now after much anticipation, well marketed hype, and a year of below par sequels (mostly); ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is finally here. So is the verdict. And the verdict is very glowing indeed.""Catching Fire"" is all about the consequences of Katniss' victory in the last Hunger Games. She tricked the Capitol and President Snow wants revenge. So while she tries to appease President Snow she must also deal with the fact that she is the reluctant symbol of a rebellion beginning to emerge in the Districts. Things get even worse for her as she must decide how she will keep her loved ones safe as the next Hunger Games come closer, and these Games will have a twist that will change things forever.The sequel does a fantastic job of diving deeper into the thought-provoking ideas of the books. We find deeper themes concerning totalitarian government, the one percent versus the ninety-nine percent, violence in our media, and beginnings of war. It is based off of a young adult novel but it is much smarter than your average teen story.All of this is mainly due to the wonderful new direction the film was taken into by Francis Lawrence (new director). While I did enjoy the controversial shaky-camera of ""The Hunger Games"" I will admit there is something refreshing to get a clear look at the action this time around. However, Lawrence was smart because he kept the dark tone set by Gary Ross in the original and he even expanded upon it. Usually there is fear of a change in directors so suddenly can lead to jarring tonal shifts with films in a series. However, Lawrence did an excellent job of making the film his own while building off of the world we had seen in the first movie.While Lawrence did add something new and exciting to the series, the fact is ""Catching Fire"" would fail if it was not for the fantastic actress that was placed in the lead. At this point it is cliché to say that Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic but it is very true. From the very first shot of the film she has you trapped in her gaze. Her down-to-earth persona makes Katniss very relatable. Also, Jennifer made the smart move to show the thing in Katniss that makes her relatable to almost everybody, the desire to protect her family and loved ones. They could not have found a better actress to portray the endearment, strength, love, and vulnerability that is Katniss Everdeen.Of course the rest of the cast do fantastic jobs as well. Josh Hutcherson portrays Peeta's broken heart with finesse as well as the strength (and even pain) he has gained from being in the Hunger Games before. Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time around and he does a great job with it. We know Gale loves Katniss (but also confused on how to deal with this situation) and this time that is explored more in depth which is a nice focus. Then of course there is Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravits, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, and new cast members; Jena Malone, Sam Claflin, and Philip Seymour Hoffman who all do fantastic jobs. It is hard to find such a reliable cast in a brand new movie series.One final note concerns the love story in the film. While the love story is not the primary focus of the series I am happy to see it get more time to expand in this movie. The chemistry between Lawrence/Hutcherson and Lawrence/Hemsworth is clearly much more distinguishable in this movie. We see a teenage girl who is in the middle of a revolution while dealing with normal teenage girl problems in her home. And I am happy that the filmmakers were careful in their portrayal of the love story and did not make it feel forced or cheesy. The chemistry and the story itself did all the work.All-in-all, this is a very fine addition to what is probably one of the smartest franchises to come out in a long time. With fantastic performances, great direction and writing, intense action sequences, and a deeper sense of the thought-provoking themes from the novel; ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" soars above and beyond expectations to set the stage for the two-part final act to come.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
217,slicedbread117,The Hunger Games: The Series On Fire,9,16 December 2013,"When a beloved franchise is adapted from a book into a movie, many expectations follow. The first Hunger Games film was able to follow in the footsteps of its preceding book-to-film heavy hitters like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings by establishing a strong set of characters and a compelling setting. In short, the sequel takes what the first movie did and knocks it out of the park.Now to clarify, I have not read The Hunger Games books. I cannot give my opinion on how true to the book the film is and I will be treating this review as any other movie and not giving opinions on the books.I'll start with what sets this movie apart from any other film, as the first did. The story and setting. The movie again sets itself in the world of the autocratic Capitol and the 12 Districts of Panem, and while the 12 Districts were focused on more in the first film, Catching Fire puts a stronger focus on the Capitol by fleshing out more of its political conflicts. On the verge of the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have become targets of the Capitol, resulting in the Quarter Quell, the ability to change the Hunger Games every 25 years. This year, the former victors will be recast into the Games yet again. This makes for an interesting premise, and an emotional one at that. The script is spot on in delivering true emotion and intensity while diving deeper into the movie's thought-provoking themes that are gripping to say the least. The screenplay is smart and the directing by Francis Lawrence is outstanding. The plot, setting and script are all at enormous heights in this film.When you look over the superb cast, the one name that just sticks in your head is Jennifer Lawrence, and rightfully so. As Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence has created a pop culture phenom by displaying her many acting talents. The movie thrives greatest when Lawrence is the center of attention, and the performance of her and her fellow cast members deserves the utmost respect for what an incredible cast should be. Along with Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta), Liam Hemsworth (Gale), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Sam Claflin (Finnick) and Donald Sutherland (President Snow) among many others give the film a powerful supporting cast that many films simply don't have. A few characters, such as Prim, Cinna and Katniss' mother don't get quite enough screen time, but their lesser roles don't hurt the film. Nearly each character is developed close to perfection and the chemistry between this cast has grown to exciting levels. I praise this cast's ability to evoke so much emotion into their respective roles, it's what truly gives the movie life.The Hunger Games themselves are again thrilling to watch. A new arena sets the stage for new threats, an interesting concept and extremely tense moments. Smarts are used just as much pure fighting, and it's here that evokes levels of excitement that reaches past over-dubbed action scenes. The blend of different styles of action is enticing, always keeping you ready for the next obstacle that the arena delivers. The film's ending may have some viewers confused, especially for those who haven't read the books, but if you do some research you'll learn that this story is far from over. So, does Catching Fire live up to the expectations of the first film? It does with authority. A superb script that includes improvement to several areas, a unique and delightful setting, phenomenal acting from a cast of characters that stay with you for a long time, and smart and exhilarating action sequences all combine to make Catching Fire one of the best movies of 2013.9.5/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
218,med77_99,"Very good sequel, Lawrence is amazing",9,22 February 2014,"Why are there so many people hating this movie ? when i first heard of the Hunger Games and the hype surrounding it, i was not at all excited or interest in it. However, being an avid movie fan, i had to watch the first one, and found it pretty good with good action and decent story, not to mention the excellent acting.Still, i did not become a fan of the series, and so when this second movie came out, i did not rush to watching it, until i watched the Blu ray, and i was just attached to the TV from start to finish, it was full of intrigue and visually stunning. the Character of Katnis played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence was interesting to follow as she developed from being the scared girl who follow rules to stronger girl.people here seems to miss the point of the movie, yes it might feel incomplete because it seems to be one part of the next upcoming movies and that is why people seem to rate it poorly. the point of the movie is actually focused on Katnis the character, as she develops and grow in so many ways.people seem to see it as a repetition of the first, but there were plenty of differences, this one was sharper and deeper, sorry to say some have failed to see that. this might come as a surprise to some, but i found this one to better than the first movie ! the Games were fun and though did seem rushed, again for the purpose of the bigger picture, however, decent action scenes, and an atmospheric game arena the resembles the tropic jungles.and everyone seems to rate the acting highly, which is exactly the case, each actor playing their roles perfectly, most seem comfortable to return back to their roles from the first film and seem to have grown into it.Visually it is also stunning to look at. OK so it is not a masterpiece, and this coming from a person who is not even a fan of the movies, but it is an excellent movie not to be missed. i thought the 2 hours and 26 minutes rushed by quickly.just like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, this film is only part of a whole and cannot be rated accurately without seeing the whole series, it does manage to set up for the next one, and now im excited to see the next. Will i become a fan of the series ? i might as im not far out from that.check it out",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
219,donuthaters12,An Improvement Over It's Predecessor,8,25 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the sequel to the popular book adaptation and films in the middle have the tendency to become known as the weaker one of a trilogy or saga but this film piles on to the catalog of films that proves that sequels can still hold up or at least become better than their predecessor. I thought that the first of the Hunger Games film series was good with slight issues bringing down, but it's sequel definitely improved upon that by expanding the problem affecting the world of Panem in a much bigger scale.Catching Fire has different writers for its screenplay which Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt. The first film had Gary Ross, Billy Ray and Suzanne Collins involved with the screenplay. I can definitely say that Beaufoy and Arndt does a much better job here as they seem to have really understood what made the novels unique from the others that it's being compared to. The writers have taken into heart the weight and fear of the rebellion as a result from the actions of the first film. I have read the novel so I am aware of the events that take fold in this film but the film never seemed to bore me as the subject of the rebellion fascinated me and also i enjoy the aspect of the first hour of the film the after effects of Katniss in an emotional, psychological, and physical level. My main gripe with the film's script is The Quarter Quell. It just didn't feel as exciting or thrilling as the first film. This is probably due to the execution of how it was done, making it feel like something from the Harry Potter series. The inclusion of Arndt and Beaufoy was a great one as their previous films had us really invested in the story and characters and proves that sometimes the most intimate and calm moments can get an emotional response from us just as much as the visceral and chaotic moments. The film does progress similar to the first film but I cannot regard it as a negative due to the novel also going towards this direction.Gary Ross stepped down as director for this film and Francis Lawrence took over. When I first heard about this news, I was sad to hear Ross not directing this feature and being replaced by Lawrence. Lawrence's previous films have not really appealed that much to me, though I have not seen Water For Elephants, but he has shown to be a very capable director here. Lawrence's direction here is much more patient, establishing the anarchist tone and terror in the first half of the film. This is where he shines because he indulges in this concept and starts to show what makes this film different and unique in comparison to the previous film. Along with the script, Lawrence starts to show his weakness with the story of the Quarter Quell. The Quarter Quell fails to outdo the previous film's intensity, lacking in execution.The director of photography for this film is Jo Willems, and this was the first time I was exposed to his style. Willems and Lawrence have decided to take a more careful and precise approach to its photography. This is an improvement as it allows us to be less distracted and allows to feel closer to the characters, and also it does appeal greatly with the story driving the first half of the film. This style also shows more of the actors' ability in particular scenes. By removing the shaky effect, the film becomes more of a smooth painting and allowing us to take in the beauty. Willems photography here is much more colorful and it pops more in particular scenes. District 12 doesn't look as depressing as it does before, but the image is still able to remain faithful to Tom Stern's depressing take on the world of The Hunger Games.James Newton Howard is the composer of the film and it's predecessor. Howard is a hard worker, just looking at the list of films he has done in recent years proves that he is a versatile composer. The score for Catching Fire continuous the style of the first film but in this film it takes a little more melodramatic style which is a bit of a let down. I still haven't fully embraced the main theme of the series but it has grown on me since I have first seen The Hunger Games.The main cast from the previous film have come back for this film. I am not sure whether the stable style of photography have shown much more of the actor's abilities or that the actors themselves have improved. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson was fantastic and at no point, except for maybe for one scene near the end, did it feel overly-dramatic. Liam Hemsworth was used a little more here but it still isn't enough for me to really care for the character, I barely sympathised for his pain and suffering but rather just saw it as a plot driver. The three actors that I thought were great to watch in the previous film includes Banks, Tucci and Harrelson. These actors were able to bring their dramatic moments and also being used as comedic relief to lighten the tone. Malone was fantastic here and I hope to see her in more films. Hoffman and Sutherland play well together but both will truly shine in the next two films.Catching Fire is definitely an improvement over the previous film but it still has it's flaws that prevent it from being an excellent film. The Hunger Games film series have definitely proved to be among the great mainstream book series adaptations in recent years. I am looking forward to what Francis Lawrence will do for the next film of the series and hoping to improve upon the flaws in this film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
220,imdb-45,As bad as many of the real reviews say,1,7 March 2014,"I'm not a Harry Potter fan and haven't read the books. But I will admit that they did a great job of polishing those films, making the dialogue reasonably natural and the characters show chemistry and depth.The entire Hunger Games films are almost devoid of real emotion. It's almost as though there is BAD and GOOD. Katniss is GOOD. The others in the Games are mostly BAD. None of them seem to be concerned about the impending death that virtually all will face, just acting bad. The dialog seems stilted and what you'd expect from a child's book.Thinking about the logic of the plot and the uprising (whatever that is supposed to mean and we never get a feeling that the poor districts have mounted any sort of problem that the ridiculously wealthy can't handle.The acting is intentionally over the top to show the badness. Stanley Tucci does a fine job, as always, but it's so over the top to be completely absurd. Even The Running Man did a much better job than this.A friend who read the books said that all the characters were written this paper thin. It's as if you must check all brains at the door and do not think about whether anything really makes sense if you give it more than 2 minutes of thought. The Games themselves don't seem to exist except to create a spectacle for the reader or viewer. This is like pitifully bad science fiction that is geared towards 5-7 year old audiences who mostly don't understand things too deeply. This film is a colossal waste of time unless you are a fan of this silly series. If you're renting, make sure you can accomplish something else at the same time so you don't feel like it's a total loss.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Drab and depressing, I found all four Hunger Games movies missing almost all elements to make it memorable, enjoyable, fun, exciting, clever or 'epic' in any way.
The concept from the get go made very little sense, the fictional world was not very well designed, and the rules of the universe weak and flimsy. 
I liked some of the cast and have been fans of several for years, but each character was hollow with very little true motivation, and the arks of their characters rarely moved beyond their first introduction.
I actually lowered my stars scores after binge watching the series, because it seemed like a waste of time and the only thing it clearly indicated is, on my own personal scale '2 stars' means- ""an ordinary movie that I don't want to and could not be easily convinced to ever watch again..."".
Which I have now given all four films.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
223,jrtone-49357,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,8,13 July 2020,This is a very influential film to me personally. I still remember seeing the ending for the first time and watching this story open into something much larger. I find the film to be stunning from a production point of view too; the effects and lighting were marvellously done and the aspect ratio change to mark the act changes around halfway through was very impactful.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
224,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,10,25 November 2013,"Sequels have a hard time even equaling the success of their predecessor, but The Hunger Games: Catching Fire does give the first movie in this series a real run for supremacy. Why? The story just keeps building upon itself, with many twists and turns that keep the viewer kept off guard the way through. If you have read the books, you know what is going to happen, but bringing the book to life is what amazes me.Suzanne Collins wrote an amazing book, that was turned into a first rate script by screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt. The cast brings to life the characters that Suzanne Collins created for her dystopian world. Donald Sutherland plays President Snow very well in both movies, in many ways he is the perfect villain. Jennifer Lawrence does a wonderful job bring to life Katniss Everdeen, and has run the gamut of emotions in both movies; in every sense she is the perfect heroine.Because this movie has only been in the theaters for approximately 3 days at the time of this writing I won't describe in detail big amounts of scenes. I would like to encourage you to watch the movie as soon as possible. I will give my rating now though of 10 stars out of 10; really just to get it out of the way.I will tell you three things I liked about the film.First, I liked the emotional roller coaster that each character had to travel over the course of this film. Each character, from Katniss, Peeta Malark (Josh Hutcherson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), Snow, Johanna and Finnick (Sam Claflin). Taken as a whole the roller coaster of emotions makes sense, and they are a big part of the movie. Every scene invokes a different emotion and sometimes more than one at the same time.Second, I will describe one scene because it has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. After all the tributes are introduced in the parade, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch are making their way to the District 12 apartments, Johanna Mason from District 7, joins them in the elevator. Johanna is disgusted by the dress her stylist makes her wear and begins disrobing in front of the others. She asks Peeta to unzip her dress and then peels it off, leaving her naked. Katniss is visibly disturbed by this. Haymitch and Peeta give admiring glances. Don't worry, nothing is shown. It is a PG-13 movie after all. It's just the idea of Johanna Mason (Jenna Malone) disrobing is... exciting.The third thing I liked was the graphics. The graphics in Catching Fire play a big part in the film and were excellently done. Since the graphics play a big part in this film I won't describe them, however, I will say that without them the whole series would probably be very boring.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
225,jpachar82,The Rebellion Begins,10,22 November 2013,"The aim, the stare, the fire, the start of the destruction of Panem is growing dimmer and weaker by the minute, by the hour – all because one girl, one simple but head-strong girl – who thought she was saving herself along with the boy next door, but all she did was defied the very existence of survival, defied the very existence living. We are now on the verge of the strongest revolts against the Capitol. We are about to embark the end of the beginning. The Hunger Games were just games but the Quarter Quell outdid every aspect of the way we saw the original games. But we are about see the awakening unfold between a ruthless dictator in President Snow and a girl, ""the girl on fire"", but this war goes beyond them – it goes all the way back to surviving freedom. The cast was on the A – game – Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law) in one word – INCREDIBLE!!!! Josh Hutcherson – insanely incredible. Liam Hemsworth – freaking awesome. The rest of the cast and crew, you guys were really awesome, but the props has to go to my favorite 2 actors – the antagonist Donald Sutherland, you are the epitome of evil – you are an incredible actor; and Phillip Seymour Hoffman – kudos goes to you, you brought the position of game maker to a whole new level. Suzanne Collins – you are an incredible author, you gave us something to believe in and for that we thank you for allowing us to dive into your world. Thank you.

226,Info-340-323067,"I like this film very much, but one character almost ruins the plot",9,29 April 2020,"I am not a fan way out there sci-fi stories with fictionalised cars and planes etc...I like to keep my films close to reality. However despite this I like this film very much. The lead actress carries the whole film and indeed the whole series of films, she is excellent. The story-line is fictional, however the main theory about a big elite power group is now emerging, so the basic lline of the film is well worth consideration for future generations. One of my main gripes is the character of Gale Hawthorne. The actor who plays him cannot act to save his life, his character is completely anachronistic and his character development is absolutely ludicrous, from poor, simple coalface miner to some kind of crack top elite forces leader of troops is so unreal and utterly unbelieveable. The character is so out of place it is as though someone else wrote his script and dropped his character in from afar. Despite Gale's character being idiotic and the acting much the same I rte this film 9/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
227,thomas-w15,10 times better than the first!!,10,28 February 2014,"Starring- Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and Stanley Tucci, with Donald SutherlandWest: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 9/10- Many people were skeptical about Lionsgate's decision to bring Francis Lawrence as the new director to the widely anticipated sequel. In my opinion, they made a perfect choice. His style gave the film a whole new light that only made the movie better.The movie itself was made tremendously. They were able to show the Victory Tour in a very nice view that is how many people envisioned it when they read the book. The design for each District could not have been better even though we only saw a few seconds of each district. The arena was made incredibly. The design of the cornucopia and the water and forest surrounding it was amazing. The design of introducing each lethal part of the forest was done fabulously. All in all, the movie, in my opinion could not have been better. It is amazing to see how all of the young actors grew with their acting over such a short time. Liam Hemsworth's was given much more screen time in the new movie and he used every minute to his advantage. He really showed who Gale is in the Hunger Games. Liam Hemsworth's performance added very much to this movie. Josh Hutcherson is the perfect Peeta. Although his performance did not improve a whole lot from the first movie to the second, no one could have done a better job. Now we come to Jennifer Lawrence. She delivered an amazing performance that is worth praise. Her performance multiplied by ten from the first to second movie. Her ability to bring out how Katniss really is in the books should be worthy of an Oscar nomination. Now, the question that was on everyone's minds since they saw The Hunger Games was ""Who is going to play Finnick?"" Sam Claflin answered the bell like a boss. He showed the perfect balance of playing the pretty boy of the Capitol while still have a very real human side to him. The sugar cube scene was very entertaining as it was Finnink's famous scene. He shows much promise for the next two movies. As usual the veterans of the cast: Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks, Stanly Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and even Lenny Kravitz all delivered a solid performance that fits each character very well. Was Catching Fire better than the first movie? Without a doubt yes, in every way. This movie is great for any occasion for all people.For more of my reviews go to my website at westandbeys.com",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
228,fawn_jane,Contrived and Boring,4,22 December 2013,"Maybe I just didn't get ""it"" but I had a terrible time watching this movie in the theatres. Every step of the way, I wasn't feeling what was going on. No one's motivations made a lot of sense. The movie just plods along, feeling fake and contrived the whole way.About Jennifer Lawrence: I don't get why she was chosen to star in these movies. Sorry, she's just not leading-actress material. She has these cold dead eyes, when she gets emotional it's not convincing at all.Everyone is weirdly passive about their horribly oppressive situation full of crushing poverty, slavery, and starvation. As much as I try to suspend disbelief, the whole Hunger Games universe doesn't make sense at a gut level.And what's with the weird emphasis on dresses and whether they are on fire? People in the movie act like the fate of the world depends on whether Katniss's dresses are pretty enough. The ooh-ing and aahhh-ing over fiery dresses is so cheesy, reminds me of Twilight with its sparkly vampires. There's this emphasis on superficial crap like giving speeches and going on TV that makes it seem like the writer has some strange warped girlish views on the way the world works. As if the fate of the revolution would depend on gossip about stuff like celebrity weddings and pregnancies. What the heck?When the movie started getting more action-oriented at first I hoped it would be more interesting, but even the action sequences were a drag. It just felt like they were filling time as they kept throwing all these contrived traps at the contestants.Then the movie just ends all of a sudden. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in the theaters for a while. I do not recommend it at all.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
229,longcooljolie,A rare sequel that surpasses the original,9,22 November 2013,"Catching Fire will take its place alongside other legendary movie sequels that outdid their original (The Empire Strikes Back, Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, The Godfather Part 2 and others).The author of the series, Suzanne Collins, has said that she came up with the idea for the trilogy while channel surfing. She said she saw a reality show where contestants get voted off along side real footage of Middle Eastern violence and she said ""Why not combine the two?"" Much of the original was spent setting the scene and context for the reaping and for a future America divided into 12 districts. ""Catching Fire"" immediately jumps into Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Melaark's world as they try to come to some sort of normalcy post victory. As such, it's a movie that's highly recommended but only if you have seen the first movie or have at least read the book.All of the memorable characters return from the first movie though this time they've been pumped up several megawatts on the ""over the top"" scale. Caesar and Effie in particular set new heights for wardrobe outrageousness.And of course, the wicked President Snow returns, so wonderfully realized by Donald Sutherland. This time he's angered by Katniss and Peeta and desperate to stifle the hope and rebellion of all the citizens of Panem. To that end he proposes a twist on the Quarter Quell for the Hunger Games, that all the tributes will come from a pool of previous victors.The Quarter Quell brings up the main instance where ""Catching Fire"" outshines the original. In the first movie, many of the tributes were ordinary youngsters tossed into the killing arena. Most of them were painted in broad, one-dimensional strokes. ""Catching Fire"" introduces the exciting characters Finnick (portrayed stunningly by Sam Claflin) and Johanna (Jena Malone), among others.Novel adaptation purists will appreciate that very little was altered or sensationalized from the translation of book to cinema. And ""Catching Fire"" manages to end in an exciting way that ties up loose ends but at the same time stokes the fires for the resolution (Mockingjay).",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
230,MrSelfPaid,Makes for an average movie if you haven't read the book.,7,20 January 2014,"As 'scorpeeo' so rightly puts it, you have to read the book in order to appreciate the movie. That being said, I didn't care one bit if any character lived or die mainly because I didn't read the book. The main problem with the movie is that the director did not take enough time to create characters the we could care for. The movie does not live up to the hype of the first one, and being a movie of blockbuster status, it should appeal to all audiences and not just the fans who read all the books.I hope the decision to split the final book into two films will help us understand fully about the revolution and the role Katniss plays in it, and increase our interest in the main characters.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

These events lead Panem's leader President Snow to gather the victors from previous games to be drawn and entered into a whole new arena where they must fight till the death a second time. Catching Fire is a chilling thrill ride with more twists and suspense as the movie introduces new characters, a rising rebellion, and a whole new plan to take down Panem and their twisted games.

Great plot, storyline, and characters. Good drama and romance.Compared to Catching Fire book: I feel that both of these are the best in their series and that both of them are equal in how amazing and entertaining they are.Compared to the first Hunger Games movie: I think that the first movie worked with less money and didn't have as amazing action and effects, making it not as intense. The start wasn't as slow in this movie than the first one, and there was a good deal of excitement before the games. The plot and storyline are pretty equal as they are quite similar. I like the new characters a lot like Finnick and Plutarch. The drama and romance is pretty equal, but this movie makes the characters go through physiological things which the first movie didn't.Overall Catching Fire is an amazing movie that is super entertaining, and I definitely recommend it!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
234,haosstoposto,Not as good as the first one,8,3 December 2013,"I liked the first installment of the movie better but this one is a very solid movie. I have not read the book so I can't make a comparison but in this part we see the consequences of the actions our protagonist made in the first movie. Katniss suffers from nightmares because she was forced to take a life in the arena and she must travel all around to spread a word about greatness of Panem. And of course, she must maintain an illusion that she loves her partner Peeta. Those are tough times but it's going to get worse for our heroes. President of Panem wants them dead but before that, he would like to see their images broken. To that end he has a new gamemaster, who advises him to conduct more extreme (read more violent) measures to quell the beginning of unrest and rebellion in the 12 districts. This plan seemed, at least to me, pretty counterproductive and there is a twist at the end of the movie which I will not elaborate in detail, but which can be deducted from these actions. The setting is very different from part one, where our heroes were outcasts in the Hunger games but this time, since all the former victors of the games are again drafted to fight to the death, this makes them in some aspect allies or at least sufferers in the same situation. Katniss and Peeta now have friends among the tributes but since they are brought to the arena to die, they also have enemies. Interesting thing for me was the fact that the tributes had the opportunity to criticize their situation on TV. I thought that president Snow tries to have everything under control and this seemed a little naive to me. And there is another plot hole which I must mention. At the end of the movie Katniss escapes from the arena after she destroys a dome above her and the rebels seemed to have waited exactly that but how she knew what to do is never explained. Maybe there is some hint in the book. All in all I like Katniss and Peeta and I am looking forward to the conclusion of their struggle against Panem and president Snow.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
235,eddie052010,Better than the first... but still very problematic.,6,20 November 2014,"Expectations is something that everyone succumbs to when doing a lot of things, especially when viewing a piece of art for the first time, in particular movies, as due to the film's marketing, cast, director and (in some cases) potential production mishaps, everybody has expectations when seeing a film for the first time, whether it be good or bad. However, it is always important to keep an open mind when watching and not let your expectations dictate your overall judgement of the film. This is what I did when seeing this film. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first, feeling it was badly plotted, poorly written, was obvious in its social commentary and had a main character who I didn't care for. That said, I kept an open mind while watching and overall, while it is better than the first, that isn't saying very much, considering that not only are many of the first film's problems still present, some of them have gotten worse.The first problem is that the film is that is less a sequel but more of a remake of its predecessor, which was already technically a remake of films like The Running Man and Battle Royale. This is highlighted with the amount of plot points that are recycled from the first film. Both films start in Katniss' District of District 12. Both films have an incident which gets the heroes involved with the Hunger Games. Both films have a similarly paced and underwhelming Hunger Games. Both films involve a sequence with obviously fake fire effects. The fact that both films are as similar as they are demonstrates how the lazy the writing is, as it seems that they thought that repeating material would be easier than to create new material.Another example of lazy writing is the obvious social commentary. Like the first film, we are spoon-fed social commentary, but this time it is about the media and celebrity culture, rather than the rich and poor. It discusses how the media (symbolised by the Capitol) form celebrities (symbolised by Katniss and Peeta) personalities and controls their every move, even forcing them to marry, in order to satisfy the public. In a better and more subtle film, this may have been a subtle and interesting commentary on Rupert Murdoch-media and how corrupt it is, but instead due to how painfully obvious it is, it becomes quite boring after a while.I wouldn't mind this lack of subtly if the film was good in other areas. Unfortunately, the film also lacks in characterization, acting and tension. While most of the acting is top-notch, the leads are (like in the first film) lacking with Jennifer Lawrence, despite being slightly better in this film, still sounds more like a bored, whiny and lazy teenager than a tortured, distressed and rebellious young woman and Josh Hutcherson is about as wooden as a tree trunk. It doesn't help that Donald Sutherland is a weak bad guy. Don't get me wrong, he's a brilliant actor, but he isn't an intimidating presence. In scenes when he is threatening Katniss that he'll destroy her District if she doesn't obey the Capitol, he comes off less as an evil dictator, and more of a grandfather who is telling off his granddaughter for behaving badly. In the hands of someone like Tobin Bell or Brian Cox, the role could have been salvaged, but instead Sutherland phones in his performance.The characters are also poorly drawn. Sure there are hints at development, but the film never has the courage to run with them. For example, Katniss has bad dreams about the previous Hunger Games and the violence that happened, but this only happens once. Another example is an attempt to create more chemistry between Katniss and Peeta, but this only happens in 2 or 3 scenes, whose credibility is reduced with corny lines about what Katniss' favourite colour is.It also doesn't help that by the time the Hunger Games begins, they're a major disappointment as the characters fight no humans, but rather baboons, poisonous gases, a rotating island at high speed and crows. Yay. It isn't helped by how easily these enemies are evaded. How are the baboons evaded? They point spears at them, which scares them. How do they fight off the effects of poisonous gases? They roll around in water. How do they stop falling off the quickly rotating island? They just hold onto it. How do they fight off the crows? They don't, as they eventually fly away. There is no tension because of this, and with not threat, bad writing and poor social commentary, what are we left with?Some redeeming features, luckily. The ending for example contains a really good, unexpected twist that makes the rest of the film seem worthwhile (and shows potential for the rest of the franchise, despite the ending feeling a bit abrupt) and many of the other actors are great and the production values (special effects & set design) are improved from the first (albeit the fire effects), showing the signs of a bigger budget. However, when the style of the movie, great performances from the supporting cast rather than the main stars & one twist at the end of the movie are the best parts of this film, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the series. Overall, while the film is better than the first, that doesn't say much. Sure, the ending and production values are great and the supporting cast are fantastic, but the film also has many of the first film's problems (i.e. poor characterization, lack of subtly and bland leads just to name a few) and many of the those problems have gotten worse. Hopefully, Mockingjay parts 1 & 2 will fix this, but for now, this is a huge disappointment that has been over-hyped by critics and audiences alike. Similar to director Francis Lawrence's other films (Constantine, I Am Legend) I guess.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
236,terrellrobinson71,"Katniss Everdeen, Girl on Fire, returns with a bang in Francis Lawrence's pulse-pounding adaptation of Suzanne Collins' 2nd book in ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy",10,23 November 2013,"As we know last year, ""The Hunger Games"" became a surprising hit, introducing us to Katniss Everdeen, a female character who is strong, vulnerable and brave. And it made a movie star out of Jennifer Lawrence, who was the perfect choice to play Katniss. But some people (and fans) weren't pleased with the first film, mainly they thought it wasn't as strong as the book and that the shaky-cam wasn't suitable for this material. I thought that director Gary Ross did such a great job with the film, and luckily, I was very excited for the second installment. In the rare tradition of sequels that are better than the first film, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" joins in. This is a film that is more complex, more mature, more thrilling and more emotional than ""The Hunger Games"" and it's a magnificent adaptation of Suzanne Collins' 2nd book in the trilogy (soon to be four films) that will leave audiences breathless. In ""Catching Fire"", Katniss (Recent Oscar-Winner Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have survived last year's Hunger Games and are scarred from that experience, but President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) is not pleased. When he visits Katniss in her home at District 12, he gives her an ultimatum: Convince the dystopian world of Panem that the (acting for the cameras) love between them is real during their Victory Tour or war will be coming. After their victory tour, in which most of the people in Panem are forming a rebellion against the Capitol, Katniss just wants to stay in District 12, hunting with her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who have feelings for her, and to keep her mother and sister Prim (Willow Shields) safe. Snow wants to get rid of Katniss now that she's the voice of the revolution, but Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has a better idea: Put her and Peeta back in the arena for the 3rd Quarter Quell (75th Hunger Games) with previous victors who are ""all experienced killers"". Some of those victors includes wise Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and nutty Wiress (Amanda Plummer) from District 3, fierce Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) from District 7 and handsome, but arrogant Finnick Odair (a charming star-making turn by Sam Claflin from ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") from District 4. As they make their way to the arena that are filled with excellent surprises (wonderfully shot in Hawaii with IMAX cameras), Katniss and Peeta wonder do they have to survive again in order to trust someone or are they just another piece in their games. This is a great opportunity to have a new director in Francis Lawrence (director of the fun ""Water for Elephants"" and ""I Am Legend"") who has a more relaxed approach than Gary Ross and he and Oscar-winning screenwriters Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael DeBruyn a.k.a Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine"") manages to be faithful to the book but understands the themes of fear, hope, life, love and survival and combines them together so that it could resonate with any one who can relate to it. He even gives the cast also including returning regulars Woody Harrelson as Katniss and Peeta's mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, the PR agent of the Capitol, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, host of Capitol TV and Lenny Kravitz as Katniss' stylist, Cinna, astonishing performances. Mr. Lawrence (not related to Jennifer), who will also direct the last two films based on the third book ""Mockingjay"", also gets some help from the returning regulars: exhilarating music composed by James Newton Howard and marvelous production design by Philip Messina and new additions: vivid costumes by Trish Summerville and beautifully photographed by Jo Willems. It's rare to have an amazing actress who can capture a leading character that is memorable and unforgettable, but also can carry us all the way throughout this series. And Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant at capturing Katniss, this time as a tortured soul who will do anything to survive. It's a wonderful blockbuster that is intense and intriguing, but also has a lot of heart and soul. You definitely wouldn't want to miss a pulse-pounding moment of it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
237,TheConnoisseurReviews,Best Bockbuster of the Year,9,22 November 2013,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" picks up exactly where the last film left off, continuing the sparks of rebellion. This film takes everything that was great about the first film and makes it significantly better. The characters are more defined, the special effects are better, the score is more bombastic, writing is stronger, and the overall feel is grander. The themes of hope that lurks in the series are exemplified even further as the stakes are higher and the amount of freedom is slowly withering away.Directing is really the main highlight of this film. The new director, Francis Lawrence, keeps the overall feel of the series, but brings greater control and precise attention to detail to the on screen action and drama. The action is easier to see and choreographed really well. Interesting shots are used to cover up the grotesque level of violence, but they are no less impactful than actually seeing it. The use of a much steadier camera really makes taking in everything easier. The level of emotion is effectively presented on screen and the use of music excels everything to a more heart touching level. Even though the film is more emotional, it still manages to have some moments of humor spread throughout. The script is tight and really develops these characters that we've grown to love. While the social commentary on reality television is on the lacking side, the themes of hope, freedom, trust, and unity are far more assessed.While many of the older characters return, there are many new ones introduced. First things first, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is still one of my favorite characters of all time and I love her here as much as I did before. However, she doesn't grow as a character as much this time around. She's more struggling with her inner demons as she tries to find herself at the helms of this new revolution that is around the corner. Peeta on the other hand, grows a lot. He's more confident and less dependent on Katniss. He can hold his own and even takes the initiative a few times. Effie even goes through some character growth as we see her love for her tributes. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch is still the wise cracking drunk, but has become more generous and caring. While our returning characters are great, the newer additions are just as awesome. The two standouts for me are Finnick and Johanna. Finnick is not only a great looking guy, but has a heart of gold. He seems vain with ulterior motives, but he proves himself to be caring and protective. Johanna is a total bad girl. She's really in your face, a bit psychotic, and a powerful warrior. However, she can even manage to be funny. All the characters are great including the additions of the new ones. They all get good screen time and development and we can really care for them, unlike the first film where the side characters took a seat to the more interesting Katniss.Overall ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a great follow up to ""The Hunger Games."" Everything is better from directing to writing to the use of music. It really expands on the universe and sets itself up for the next two films. The stakes are higher and there are a lot more to care about. I give it 4.5/5, a great sequel that builds up on the original to deliver a really great cinematic experience.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
238,pinkled5,Much better than the original,7,30 November 2013,"The original Hunger Games left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. It lacked depth and substance. I almost skipped Catching Fire because of it but I'm glad I didn't.Catching Fire has several things going for it that the original didn't.1) A Great Bad Guy: Although Donald Sutherland was in the original his character was more of a token villain and the focus was on the rival contestants. In Catching Fire, we have a great bad guy that the audience can love to hate. There's real conflict and tension between Katniss and the President and this serves as a great foundation on which to base the film.2) Excellent Conflict: The root of any drama is conflict and this has a lot of it. I loved the conversation between Katniss and the President in the early part of the film that sets the stage for the rest of the movie. Two opposing forces who hate each other but must tolerate the others' existence while secretly plotting ways to either eliminate or mitigate the threat the other poses. A cunning game of cat and mouse ensues as they engage in a battle of wits.3) Interesting Characters: The relationship between Katniss and Peeta is complicated and interesting to watch as it develops on screen. Haymitch, the most interesting character from the original, continues to be entertaining. There are a lot of undeveloped characters in this film that I would have liked to have known more about (for example, Nuts and Bolts) but I am satisfied with the level of character development in this film.4) Emotional Appeal: Although the actual hunger games portion of the movie is devoid of emotion, much like its predecessor, the rest of the film manages to engage your feelings. Katniss & Peeta's visit to the other districts to pay respect to the fallen tributes was interesting. Katniss' insistence on Peeta's protection and survival was believable. Her emotional breakdown in the end was quite stirring.

239,Sisiutil,A rarity: A sequel that surpasses its predecessor,9,15 December 2013,"I can probably count on one hand the number of times this has happened. The precedent that this reminds me of, however, is Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. We get more character development, more complexity, and as a result, a richer fictional world. All the while, the film ratchets up the tension, building to a big ending with a twist reveal and the inevitable mid-trilogy cliffhanger. There are great performances from everyone, but especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland, whose few incredibly tense scenes together are a highlight. (I also loved the scenes of President Snow at home, where we are shown that his harshness is borne out of fear and the sense that his entire world is slipping away because of the actions of this lone young woman.) Assuming that the creative team can keep this going, the final chapter should be terrific.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

241,saschakrieger,Between hope and fear,8,5 December 2013,"The Hunger Games, the first installment of a series of film adaptations of Suzanne Collins' novel trilogy, was one of the surprises of the film year 2012. The Gary Ross directed film combined blockbuster appeal with sharp and uncompromising social analysis painting a clear picture of the mechanisms of totalitarianism, combined with sharp media criticism. In the story of the young girl participating in a cynical game in which children and teenagers slaughter each other until only one survives, the film envisioned a dystopia that combined insights into totalitarian systems with popular forms of media entertainment such as reality TV and casting shows that served to show how closely the perverted lust of seeing people exposed and the collective cruelty of a suppressive state are aligned. The majority, that concept on which democratic society is built, here appeared in all the dark side it also possesses. It is the individual, the thinking, feeling and conscientious human who is the only source of hope, the individual who in turn can be the root of a new, hopefully better majority.The series' second installment, entitled Catching Fire picks up where part one ended. In an act of defiance, the film's hero, Katniss tricked the system into allowing herself as well as her friend Peeta to win the games together, Torn between feelings of guilt about having killed, the pressure of society and the demands of a rising rebellious spirit, Katniss must continue to find her way while she still has not finished growing up. Catching Fire, directed by Francis Lawrence, remains close to the visual style and story-telling technique of its predecessor. The focus remains on Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Close-ups of her, moving from face to hands to fragments of her body, representing a more and more fragmented soul, still provide the key visual technique of the film. Lawrence is an actress who can condense complex inner struggles, difficult decision making processes and battles between hope and fear, defiance and desperation into a single look, into minimal changes of expression, into tiny movements, the clenching of a fist, a sudden rigidity in her body. The film makes ample use of this as it focuses on the inner fight of the protagonist.For Catching Fire moves its perspective much more inside the individual than the first part did. The mechanisms that allow a totalitarian system to work and also the deformations it causes are concentrated in the individual self. This is true for the first part in which Katniss tries to come to terms with who she is expected to be and the choices she has to conform to the demands of one side or the other. But it remains true later on when again she is sent into the arena to fight for her life, a fight that ends in a much different twist as the revolution finally begins. Here Catching Fire is as adept at fulfilling all demands on action-packed entertainment while never losing its focus. As close as the camera remains on her and her comrades, as close remains the perspective on the specific human cost of totalitarianism.The biting media satire is as sharp as in the first film, the contrasts between a decadent ruling class and the suppressed majority are depicted even more sharply and relentlessly. While the amount of killing scenes is reduced, there is no softening of the uncompromising starkness with which human suffering is being presented. The film's only weakness might be that the price of focusing on the protagonists is that the characterization of the characters further to the fringe is somewhat sketchier. This however is compensated by an even more stellar cast including memorable performances by Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer and the scarily indecipherable Philip Seymour Hoffman as the new head game maker. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves to be a rare talent, Woody Harrelson as her mentor impresses once more and Josh Hutcherson really come into his own as the dignified, honest and relentlessly fighting Peeta, Katniss' reasonable counterpart.More than its predecessor, Catching Fire is conceived as part of a series. It reduces the explanation of what happened before to a minimum and ends with a true cliffhanger. This, however, does not take anything away from the film's quality. Catching Fire marries blockbuster spectacle with intelligent soul searching, biting satire with psychological drama, entertainment with a serious message. As the first installment, it proves that giving an audience what they want and getting them to think and reflect are not mutually exclusive. The third book will be split into two films, again directed by Lawrence. It is to be hoped that they will share all that made the first two films such compelling and outstanding film making.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
242,CinemaCocoa,"Fixes a lot of faults, but still lacking in proper bite.",6,13 April 2017,"This sequel makes up for a lot of its predecessor's glaring faults, yet somehow continues to paint its theme in the same unbelievable and contrived fashion. Having survived the Hunger Games, a gladiatorial arena fashioned by a tyrannical society called The Capitol, heroes Katniss and Peeta must deal with their limelight fame from those they despise, and the relationship they pretended to have to escape death. The Capitol's president however doesn't approve how every survivor can give the repressed people hope, and creates a new Hunger Games where only seasoned survivors compete to the death.I didn't like 2012's Hunger Games. I went into this sequel with trepidation, but I have to admit the first hour or so got me very interested! We have the Capitol actually flexing its muscles and giving our heroes and lower classes a hard time, they are actually competent villains for once. There are real consequences to the aftermath of the first Games, troopers raid towns, people are executed, even our heroine is shaken and brittle from the experience! The idea of Katniss and Peeta being thrown into a last- man-standing death match (for real this time) with seasoned veterans who hate them, all commanded by newcomer (and slimier than ever) Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I was pretty excited!But then the Hunger Games event began and everything fell apart. Our combatants are unique, but about two thirds of them die off screen, and the real problem of fighting to the last man is dropped immediately. The Capitol again have no teeth, no guts and their Hunger Games as a concept continues to be completely redundant. I'm sorry, but I still don't understand. The Capitol are still incompetent villains at the end of the day, and it infuriates me! I like the idea that they are weak due to their overconfidence and complacency, but it has never been shown that the Hunger Games even works as a deterrent, it only seems to be a massive invitation for uprising and war. It makes no sense!There's also a twist at the end, I cannot say what it is, but it only compounds this complete inability by The Capitol, and actually undermines most of the threat that you initially felt earlier. I cannot comprehend watching this again it would be even less convincing.(it also still irritates me that most of the actual killing in the Hunger Games happens off screen, although it is true this film has a little more brutality)This film does have a very good beginning, I like The Capitol's citizens, I like the heavy subtext of television control and celebrity worship that dominates the first hour. Jennifer Lawrence is still great as Katniss, the action is actually directed better here (less shaky- cam and rapid cuts) and for two hours and thirty, it didn't feel long. But god does it still wound me with its lackluster execution and its unbelievably not-threatening tyrants, and it all fell apart at the end.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The book was too similar to the first, but the film seems to set itself apart very well.The cinematography and direction is a big step up from the nauseating first film. The action is there from the beginning, as well as the acting and music. It all leads up to a spectacular finale.Even if you haven't seen the first movie, this is a great action film from beginning to end. To top it off, Lawrence and Hutcherson's chemistry is A+.

244,andy-933-696608,Make him pay for it.,8,24 December 2013,"In the first Hunger Games film, it was quite shocking to see children indulging in blood shed and violence as part of their upbringing. Even to a lesser standard, as it serves the means of entertainment media, this latest chapter in Suzanne Collins's book trilogy has managed to burn a beautiful candle on both ends, with a complex and intricate story on one end, and a diverse and energetic atmosphere of performances from its cast, primary its lead star. Jennifer Lawrence with her naturalistic acting manages to further humanize Katniss Everdeen through this darker segment of The Hunger Games trilogy, as she encounters more loss and discovers more revelations within her struggle to defy the totalitarian regime of The Capitol and its ever growing vulnerability to the very rebellion that is rising.Following her victory over The Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta (Hutcherson) return to their district, only to be welcomed by the supposedly honorable greeting of Big Brother Snow (Sutherland). Katniss's conversation with the president is brief but intimidating as she is given no choice but to become The Capitol's main figure head in promoting their regime and discouraging the hope she so blatantly encouraged in her defiance. Refusal although an option, is endowed with drastic consequences, regardless of the intentions. As the meeting ends, a mindful montage of slaughter begins as Katniss and Peeta extend their sympathies to each district, only to see bloodshed and suppression at every corner. Eventually, the hope that Katniss inspired, reaches her district as it is picked and torn apart by brutal law enforcement, and treatment inhumane enough to reawaken the literary influence of George Orwell's ""1984."" In the sense of the modern age, The Hunger Games Trilogy, though made within the confines of an epic, it certainly carries with it the essence of Orwell's masterpiece. Every trace of resistance is squashed, regardless of it being an innocent child or a decrypt senior that gets a bullet to the back of the head. Fear and media indulgence are what dominate, as the twelve districts receive nothing but a false image of Katniss and Peeta, all thanks to the work of mysterious and calmly collected game maker (Hoffman). Not long after the biased pleasantries, there comes the announcement of yet another Hunger Games, with a twist boot as victors from previous completions are hauled back into the very slaughter house that gave them riches and fame. Most of this comes from the cynical mouth of Joanna Mason (Malone), a previous victor whose scorn for Katniss comes from her own devout hatred of The Capitol and the blood shed they crave, disguised as a fashion show.The previous installment of The Hunger Games was merely a demonstration of the carnage children could inflict on one another as they killed each other at the sound of a canon. This year's Hunger Games were played more mutually, and although taking on a darker and hopeless tone, there was a slight dimmer of hope as Katniss acquired more allies for the growing rebellion to come in the upcoming sequels, The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay, which will be divided into two parts. As the story progresses, new characters are introduced and given more dimension as they bond and suffer the same pain as Katniss, losing those closest to them, giving them greater reason to fight and risk everything to defeat The Capitol. Sadly, such an idea is merely planted in this film's conclusion as it leaves with the final note of a cliff hanger, which has both its ups and down's. In the screening of this film, there was a lot of moaning and complaints as people screamed ""That's not how you end a movie"", which goes to show the ignorance of movie audiences. On a better note there was also praise in understanding the significance of the ending, thus generating greater excitement for the sequels to follow.Upon seeing the first ""Hunger Games"" film, there was a lot of admiration, but also some doubt regarding the rather dreadful pattern of the sequel syndrome many films follow after commercial success. But thanks to the excellent direction by Francis Lawrence and the powerful performances of its cast, particularly Jennifer Lawrence, a wave of relief passes over this viewer, along with many others as the excitement for The Hunger Games sequels is more confident and capable of meeting such expectations. What was more striking in this particular segment was the struggle that followed Katniss's victory as her inspiration of hope triggered a chaotic jolt of fiery resistance that will cease to burn out. As this fire continues to burn through the plot of the film, the reality becomes more grim and desolate as Katniss's desire to distance herself from such heroics becomes more and more impossible in the waking misery that The Capitol inflicts on the twelve districts. The first film spoke for itself on a deep and personal level as the sight of children killing each other, rather joyfully was implemented as though it was a modern day tradition. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire took more drastic and effective turns in the story as the protagonist Katniss has developed from a warrior into a symbol. Now with the conclusion leaving at an uncertain future, the sequels will certainly give Lawrence's Everdeen the chance to become more than just a rebel, but a hero beyond simply here identity.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
245,Dfschohr-532-549658,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,9,4 December 2013,"Having never read the series of books, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, I went into the first film with an open mind, and my expectations were met. Not the biggest fan, but definitely enjoyable. Now with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the budget is nearly doubled, the cast is well rounded, and the costume and set design is award worthy. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson)have both miraculously survived The Hunger Games, by both vowing to kill themselves with the poisonous berries. In doing this, Katniss has sparked a rebellion throughout the districts, and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is now in need of help from the over-seer of games, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour-Hoffman), who has multiple tricks up his sleeve for the special edition of the 75th Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely sensational. Such a true, honest, brilliantly layered performance. Lawrence has become one of Hollywood's hit girls, and quite frankly, she deserves every ounce of it, she's fantastic. I've never been the biggest Josh Hutcherson fan, but I must say he does a fine job in the sequel. Woody Harrelson is always a treat to watch. Harrelson and Lawrence have great on-screen chemistry, few elements of father/daughter, few elements of brother/sister, equaling up to a terrific mentor/protégé relationship. You can never go wrong when hiring Phillip Seymour-Hoffman onto your cast, and he steals every scene. Seymour-Hoffman is my personal favorite actor of all time, I've always looked up to him since I was child. The film is layered with fantastic supporting roles from Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Jenna Malone. Francis Lawrence has taken this story and elevated it to another level. The film looks incredibly beautiful, and with its budget it should. Catching Fire is by far Francis Lawrence's best film. Constantine is still a damn fun and awesome film, but Lawrence's edition to The Hunger Games series immerses you into this wonderful, oddly unique world. Catching Fire is one hell of a fun time at the movies. Every teen girl and fan of the books are sure to be obsessing over the film for years to come. The costume and set design is sure to garnish up Oscar nominations, if not the wins. The film runs slightly to long for me, but it's not by much, maybe some tighter edits, the film could have been perfect.

246,videodrome1234,Much better,8,22 May 2014,"In the past years the YA book adaptations have been steaming piles of guano to put it nicely. At first I didn't really see Suzanne Collins' Battle Royale copy as any different despite the fact that it had better than average casting, but after watching the film I had to concede that despite its mistakes The Hunger Games is worthy of becoming a franchise. And Catching Fire just proved this. Really. Gary Ross did a good job of laying the foundation in the first part, the low budget was obvious, then came Lions Gate and pulled a rabbit out of the hat by increasing the budget and getting Francis Lawrence to direct (who is known for Constantine and I am Legend) who could actually do something with the money, as his proved himself with larger budgets. Not to mention their decision to change the script writer to someone more experienced, all this made this sequel one of the best out there. So the story: After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return home to District 12. President Snow visits Katniss and explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince everyone her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol. Of course the tour doesn't work out that way and the rebellions get larger in scale. The capitol is finding it harder to fix and they can't even kill Katniss without making her a martyr. Along comes the 75th Hunger Games where the old winners are thrust back into the arena. So the find themselves right back where they started from but this time around it's about a whole lot more than just surviving. Catching Fire is better than the first part and that's due to it being exciting almost from the first minute to the last. They achieved this great direction, script writing and actors that is almost unheard of in films like this. Which other YA book adaptation had Philip Seymour Hoffman doing an awesome job? Which other one has an Oscar winner as the star (Jennifer Lawrence). Which other one dares to show ever dark part of a dictatorships every dark corner, the oppression, the violence, the fear mongering, the executions? Ding, ding, ding: The right answer is none of them. Okay so it's not gory but it does show cruelty and is even epic in a lot of scenes. It's a lot darker than the first part not to mention what goes on in the arena isn't fun and games for a second. If all this wasn't enough then we get to see more under the surface of the twisted political system. I was even happy that they didn't take the love theme too far. So there are two things I think are wrong with the film. 1. the end. If you haven't read the book the non ending is a little strange, I don't think you can finish a film like that. 2. I still miss a little blood, rawness for it to be a really genius series. Maybe in the third film. All in all the Hunger Games takes moves forward and not just a step but a leap. You can tell professionals made it. Lions Gate didn't make the same mistakes as Summit did with Twilight. They didn't just want to continue the same way, they wanted to move forward and they did, but its not perfect, sometimes the atmosphere wanes and I still feel like Battle Royale was better, but it was done well, so I give it an 8/10. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

However after reading dozens of other reviews on this website I am feeling overly generous (but won't go back on my original feeling). The plot and dialogue are atrocious. The acting is OK but nothing worthy of any columns inches by critics. The first movie (I gave it a 7) concept was not developed at all. This was totally stale in every aspect. There was no thrill, no climax, no characters I associated with, nada, nothing, rien.Congrats to the marketing machine that 'told us' this was great.

248,two-rivers,Racing through the novel at top speed,7,23 November 2013,"This film being released only two days ago, I haven't been able to read any reviews yet, so these first thoughts about my vision of it can be considered as absolutely virginal, so to speak First of all, ""Catching Fire"" being a literary adaptation, the audience should be divided into two groups, the ""virginal ones"" who haven't even touched the novel and the so-called experienced readers. I count myself to the latter group, having read the book two years ago and even re-read the summaries of each chapter that I had written at that time as a sort of preparation for the movie session. It goes without saying that I also read the first part of the trilogy (twice) and seen the first movie (four times).Profiting from all this expertise I was able to find my way through the new film easily. I got involved, or even ""caught fire"", right from the beginning, when, in a hunting episode, an appalling visualization of one of Katniss's nightmares was set on screen: when targeting a prey, she suddenly sees a tribute victim that she had killed in the past Games instead of the animal and gets a nervous breakdown.As the traumatizing process of the protagonist was a big concern of the novel, this can be considered a good start of the movie. But later on the film does not really dwell on that, because there simply is not enough time. I can recall only one scene, when, being on the train, Katniss wakes up in the middle of a dream and shouts for help and is then comforted by Peeta, who crawls into her bed.Then there is a quick cut, and we move on to the next scene. Almost all important elements of the novel are at least mentioned, but not given the due time to be fully developed. As an example, let's just take Katniss's ""torn-between-two-lovers-conflict"", which is sufficiently explored in the novel by the means of introspection but which for the ""virginal"" group of movie spectators must feel like pretty much unexplainable.The same happens to the characters. They are mostly present in the movie, though maybe at a low scale. Important new protagonists like Finnick and Johanna Mason are introduced in short key scenes which correspond exactly to the words of the novel. You get a good impression of Johanna's rebellious character when you see her undress in the elevator. But then there is not much room for further development, and minor characters like Wiress or Mags do not even get that kind of exposition and sadly do not leave a great deal of mental imprint in the end.The problem is that the movie has hardly got more than two hours at its disposal in order to tell the whole story. It should have run at a slower pace, allowing itself to create more atmosphere. The first part of the trilogy, directed by Gary Ross in 2011, was better at this, for instance when it depicted the mood of decadence that was reigning in the Capitol in a way that even the Suzanne Collins novel was unable to perform.Fortunately, the ""Mockingbird"" dish will be served in two mouthfuls. I can only hope that this decision was not motivated by economical reasons but by the intention to pay true cinematographic respect to an epic masterpiece.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
249,BrentHankins,Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen.,9,22 November 2013,"The Hunger Games, based on the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins, crushed box office records when it opened in March 2012. With a rabid fanbase, a massive marketing campaign, and an Oscar winner in the leading role, expectations are soaring for the next installment, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which hits theaters today amid a whirlwind of publicity.When we last left Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), she had overcome insurmountable odds and made history by surviving The 74th Annual Hunger Games alongside her friend and ally Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). After seeing the duo willing to sacrifice themselves rather than leave the arena without each other, the citizens of Panem have been captivated by their love story – unfortunately, it isn't real, and since the Games have ended, the two are barely even on speaking terms.As Katniss tries to reconcile her feelings for Gale (Liam Hemsworth) with the act she put on to keep Peeta alive, she also finds herself haunted by memories of the nightmarish things she experienced in the arena. Her situation is complicated even further by a visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who is well aware of the truth and determined to remind Katniss that defying the will of the Capital cannot go unpunished.To say anything else about the plot would put us into spoiler territory, so I'll say this: Catching Fire improves upon The Hunger Games in nearly every conceivable way. The action scenes are bigger and more frequent, the pacing is tighter, and with relatable themes of social inequality and civil unrest woven throughout the narrative, there's an emotional weight to nearly everything that transpires on screen.With an Academy Award for Best Actress now under her belt, it's no surprise that Lawrence brings her A-game to this film, and her portrayal of Katniss will only allow for her star to shine even brighter. The rest of the returning cast members are also on point here, with Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci stealing plenty of scenes out from under their younger costars.Fans of the source material would likely crucify me if I didn't mention the newcomers as well. Sam Claflin and Jena Malone are exceptionally well-cast as Finnick Odair and Joanna Mason, respectively, and Jeffrey Wright plays a small but crucial role. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderfully sinister as new Gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee, and his first encounter with Katniss will send a shiver down every viewer's spine.As the second of four planned films, Catching Fire doesn't offer much in the way of conflict resolution. Everything that happens here is a buildup to the much bigger tale that will be told in the two-part finale, Mockingjay, and thus the closing minutes feel like a bit of a letdown. But this minor complaint aside, director Francis Lawrence has delivered a thrilling follow-up to an already excellent first installment, and fans can breathe easily knowing that he'll be returning to finish the job.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
250,eatfirst,"Solid and well-performed, but suffering from repetition and middle-film difficulties.",6,30 December 2013,"Picking up some months after the events of the first movie; Catching Fire finds our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, back in her home district and re-kindling, perhaps, her nascent romance with Gale (who was somewhat pushed to the sidelines of the first instalment) while struggling to walk a fine line of conformity and performance in her new, dangerously high-profile existence.Incoming helmer Francis Lawrence, with relatively little big-budget movie experience, directs with a steady hand, keeping the look and tone consistent with the first movie. The opening act here is particularly strong, laced with political manoeuvring, surreptitiously tightening the screws and gently deepening even some of the more seemingly garish characters (the delirious Effie Trinket is particularly well-served this time round). This slow-burning first-half also allows Jennifer Lawrence, once again, to remind us all why she is one of the finest upcoming young actors of her generation, delivering duct-troubling eulogies from even the most threadbare material.Things do however take a minor turn for the ho-hum once the new games get underway. Co-champion Peeta gets less to do this time and mostly just follows in Katniss's footsteps, which is a shame after his stronger showing the first time around and further undermines the love-triangle backdrop theoretically still being toyed with. More problematic though is the amount of repetition and familiarity, with many of the same beats being played as we experienced in the previous competition. For a near two-and-a-half hour movie, Catching Fire rather struggles to do what it says on the tin, taking rather too long to find its way out of the pitfalls of having to play out another set of games with a more-or-less matching dramatic arc to the first. Until, when finally the first really startling new development hits.... the credits role.Reputation has it that the third and final book (being adapted, a-la Harry Potter, into two upcoming movies) is the weakest of the three, and so, while this central episode is a mostly solid outing that doesn't significantly squander the good work done by the first, it is nonetheless something of a concern then that it does have a touch of a holding pattern about it, teasing us that all the real fireworks are being held back till next year.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

But in all seriousness one of the things that makes Catching Fire so good is the emotional gravitas it has, despite being a sci-fi futuristic dystopia future with really bizarre senses of style, Hunger Games has emotional weight which is really good to see in a blockbuster such as this.Jennifer Lawrence proves she deserves the Oscar she won, even when dealing with dialogue that isn't always up to scratch, she makes it work. Her supporting cast are equally good, Donald Sutherland in particular is just brilliant.The only reasons I have marked the film down are simple; occasionally bad dialogue, a slightly sluggish middle section and the fact the direction feels a bit less interesting than the first film.

In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--While watching Catching Fire it became clear very quickly that this would be as delicate a watch as I had planned for. Having been familiar with critics praise towards it and word of mouth on the flip side throwing warning my way, it was obvious that this movie was going to do something interesting at the least by it's end.Reality is, for any seasoned movie goer, its not the ending that will be the interesting part, it's the decisions the film makes, mostly regarding switching gears about half way through and getting comfortable with the repeat game. The whole first half of the film is a breathe of fresh air and sets up this interesting after victory world for both Katniss and Peeta. However, just around a little less than half way through it forfeit's originality in favor of bringing back successful elements from the first film and basically trying to 1up and/or remix them.This was where the film drags on the most, but at the same time, a Hunger Games film dragging is still better than the greater many blockbuster movies out there. And it's only fair to say that it's still a lot of fun, but most of the thrill present in the first film will see many drawing comparisons between the ones presented here, and those from before, rather than being awe struck or captivated by them.Now admittedly so, I am not the biggest fan of the first, but then again I'm not a particularly big fan of most blockbuster movies, so liking The Hunger Games alone shows my support for the franchise, however, as enjoyable as it may be it must be considered a let down to true fans of the series more than not, and I will most likely be seeing the last film more out of necessity now rather than anticipation. My advice to anyone who wants to see this movie is to basically expect a part 1.5, as it is just that. Be prepared to see some re-hashing, more of a remix actually, as the full potential of this movie is squandered away on a plethora of filler in place of entertaining plot development. Actually, it can almost entirely be considered filler, but again, it's not a boring filler, just not a fully realized one. I do recommend this movie, but mostly just to fans and/or people who need to satisfy their blockbuster cravings with a good blockbuster.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Again: we see the romance tension because Catness must pretend to love her survival partner. Again: we must form alliances to survive the octagon. Again: crazy costumes. Again: training sequences. There just isn't anything particularly special past a one time viewing. The best aspect of the film is the end, when the story reveals itself to have a much grander scale and importance. So in a lot of ways this is a movie to setup the next movie. I think this is mostly for fans of the book/movie series.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
256,SugarandIce,Catching Fire is an exceptional sequel.,9,9 December 2013,"The original Hunger Games was very good, if only a bit forgettable. In retrospect, it appears to have been more of foundation to write this film upon. Kudos to the director, for the noticeable rise in quality. It improves upon the original in every way. The world itself, from its politics to its districts, is more fleshed out. The after effects of the first Hunger Game are really explored well here. PTSD and blackmail are powerful themes it uses well. Rue's death is actually more heartbreaking in this film. Consider the fact she died in the previous movie and you can see how shocking this is. The director really understood emotion and how to portray it. There are some truly moving scenes, and some equally horrific ones. The jabberjay scene especially comes to mind. In conclusion, this movie is chokingly dark.The characters really shine this time around having been properly fleshed out and given memorable personalities. The new characters are welcome additions as well. Props to Jennifer Lawrence for acting the hell out of Katniss, and props to everyone really. I left the theater feeling extremely moved. I was by no means an enthusiastic fan, not reading the books and only mildly enjoying the first movie. But Hunger Games, you've earned yourself a fan.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

We are about to embark the end of the beginning. The Hunger Games were just games but the Quarter Quell outdid every aspect of the way we saw the original games.

258,tiffanyyongwt,"If there is any movies which are better than the books themselves, it will definitely be The Hunger Games.",9,25 December 2013,"If there is any movies which are better than the books themselves, it will definitely be The Hunger Games. This apply not only to the second film: Catching Fire but also the first film. I caught the first film in the cinemas back in 2012 and fell in love with it. I started researching on the film and went for the books. I was surprised to find the movie better than the books!For The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I realised there are two different opinions after watching the film. For those who did not read the books, most found it a little draggy, and there were too little of (Hunger Games) Quarter Quell as compared to the first film. However, those who had read the book will find it amazing (Well, at least I did) as the director managed to catch the best parts and put it into the film.Oscar winner Jennifer is the main reason why I loved the film so much. She was able to make the character Katniss her, so much that I kinda dislike the weak character of Katniss in the book. Yet in the film, it seemed so appropriate and understandable. She isn't the ""typical Hollywood icon"" and wasn't afraid to let the media know that she likes food.Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci aka the host for Hunger Games) brings smile with his dazzling signature smile. I love how any conversation with him becomes positive and full of hope. I also realised that the turning points in the film always take place with him. Like how Peeta said he liked Katniss in the first film, how Katniss transformed into a black Mocking Jay in the second film, the most amazing things happened at his show.I don't know if it is a good thing or not, but one teeny weeny problem with the film, is perhaps how it was easy to forget all the other tributes besides Katniss, Peeta or maybe Finnick. Despite their distinctive characteristics, it was an headache trying to recall who's out and who's in. I like to compare it with JK Rowling's Harry Potter, where although the movies weren't as good as the books, every character can easily be remembered, even when they are minor roles.

259,sunshinebeachcinema,What do they call The Hunger Games in Paris? Battle Royale with cheese!,8,23 December 2013,"The best dystopian fiction holds a mirror up to our own society, extrapolating current trends to extreme endpoints. Here, in a grim future America, the gaudy citizens of the Capital lead lives of leisure amid the glittering spires of their neo-classical metropolis while the Appalachian miners of District 12 carve a meagre living straight out of the Great Depression. Every year, they are forced to participate in their oppressors' sadistic version reality TV (with brilliantly over the top X-factor style commentary): the titular Hunger Games, an annual gladiatorial combat between children, in which the sole survivor emerges as victor.The face of the revolution is the teenage Katniss (Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence) whose strong performance drives a film which is otherwise far from subtle. Yet there's no doubt that this film is thoroughly exciting and engaging. For a start, the young actors here are miles better than the cast of the cheesy '80s slasher flicks I've been watching lately.The visuals are fantastic and the cast is rounded out with both old and new blood, including Wood Harrelson as Katniss' grizzled mentor, and Patrick Seymour Hoffman as the smooth talking new games master. Donald Sutherland returns as the villainous President Snow, his soft spoken exterior belying the brutal stranglehold he maintains on the populace.One year after Katniss and her fellow 'tribute' Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) won the last Hunger Games, the president decrees that this year's competitors will be drawn from the existing pool of victors (who believed they had earned their freedom); as if to deny that the games are anything more than a ritual execution.So Katniss and Peeta must head back into the arena for a second round, facing twenty five years worth of combatants who've murdered their way out once already. While more time is devoted to the Games social impact and the brewing rebellion, there is a feeling that Catching Fire treads familiar ground. Much of the thematic material held true for the first film, and this instalment is little more than a continuation of the narrative. The biggest difference is that the battle is between veterans and not children.Gary Ross hands the directorial reigns to Francis Lawrence, whose back catalogue, including Constantine (2005) and I am Legend (2007) suggests a darker sequel, though Lawrence inherits much of the design and atmosphere directly from his predecessor. This is ultimately delivered, yet we are treated to the inevitably unsatisfying cliff hanger as the narrative heads towards its presumably epic conclusion in next year's Mockingjay.The weakest part of the story is the attempted love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale which started in the last film. It pales in comparison to the wider struggle of the story and is perhaps wisely downplayed. Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who somehow has third billing) is a childhood friend of Katniss, but feels like a redundant character, appearing in very few scenes to give the TV a jealous glance whenever he sees Peeta, who has infinitely more screen time, but says and does less than he did in the last film.The new police uniforms, a departure from the more standard half-visors seen in the first film, are a little too much like Star Wars storm troopers crossed with The Stig, and look downright bizarre when worn without a helmet. This undermines some of the intensity of the new police chief of District 12, who is otherwise brutal and intimidating.As far as run time is concerned, so many of these epic fantasy novel adaptations are a little on the long side. At 146 minutes, Catching Fire is only quarter of an hour shorter than the somewhat bloated The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, the other film I saw this week. How much of a problem this becomes depends on your investment in the source material. I've not read any of the novels, so as a casual viewer, this felt a lot longer than The Hobbit, but I can imagine a lot of people feeling the opposite. That's fine, but it can alienate those on the periphery of the fan base.Alternatively, while I felt that some of the Harry Potter films had the potential to flash past in a series of semi-confusing vignettes for anyone unfamiliar with the books, I never felt lost in the narrative of this film, or the one that preceded it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

261,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,"Not perfect, but worth the ticket price",7,27 November 2013,"When we last left the Districts of Panem (?), Katniss Everdeen (??) and Peeta Mellark (???) defied all odds by winning the 74th Hunger Games, which also started the rumblings of a revolution. Now, President Snow (ok that's not terrible) decides the best way to put the people back in their places is to force previous winners (including Katniss) to participate once again in the ""Quarter Quell"" (sure...), a special Hunger Games celebrating the 75th anniversary. With mentor and former victor Haymitch Abernathy (WHO???) behind them, can they survive the new game put together by new gamerunner Plutarch Heavensbee? (OH COME ON...)...Seriously, what kind of random-generating name machine did Suzanne Collins use when she wrote these characters??Crazy names aside, this movie packs a serious punch. Jennifer Lawrence once again owns the role, and the rest of the cast does a solid job. (A side note: I would pay TRIPLE the price to see a version of Hunger Games where Woody Harrelson MURDERS EVERYONE in some exotic location. Can we get a movie about the Hunger Games that his character won? BOX OFFICE GOLD right there...screw Peeta, that panzy.) Visuals are beautiful (especially those costumes), but 3D is unnecessary. The story moves along at a steady pace, and you get some really great character development along with some beautifully done, emotional scenes. (Katniss' speech in the 11th district was intense.)One thing that bugs me: this movie clocks in at 2 1/2 hours. Of that time, we get roughly 15 minutes of action. There was SOOO MUCH BUILD-UP towards the actual Games, and all the development and plot lines were great, but man...couldn't we have seen at least a little more of the action? What about the non-team-Katniss participants? I want to see EVERYTHING. I PAID TO SEE 23 PEOPLE GET OFF'ED, DON'T SHORT-CHANGE ME.

262,evancyl,Exciting and well-crafted adapation,8,4 December 2013,"The movie was truly excellent - it managed to capture the essence of the book without lessening any of its thrills. While quite a few parts had to be eliminated, the story still flowed well with some minor changes in detail. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed Katniss' emotions very well, from fear of what President Snow could do if she didn't convince the world of her love, to being torn between Peeta and Gale. I liked the director's touch of President Snow having a granddaughter brimming with admiration for Katniss. Her naivete and embracing of the status quo contrasted with the uprisings happening all over the districts. And it was great seeing some of the scenes that I pictured in my head come to life e.g. the costumes with dancing lights at the opening ceremony, Katniss' wedding dress that burnt away and transformed her into a mockingjay, the clock-like arena and deadly traps in each sector.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
263,LivBrumei,Hunger Games - Either hate it or love it,8,1 March 2014,"For what I've been hearing on the Hunger Games story you either going to love all the movies or you going to hate them. Yet I feel like I'm part of some middle class who doesn't go by any of the previous choices. The first of Hunger Games movie didn't dazzled me. I felt like it made no sense. The society they we're showing just did made sense for me. I get the poor class and the abuse of power and using the poor to fulfill the richest wants but the connection between a super advanced society with great technology supporting killing games just for fun caused me a certain ""itch"" that made me not to buy it. Now, with Hunger Games - Catching Fire and the revolution ahead it started making better sense. At least now people don't seem all to be puppets of the master show and I bought it. If you liked the first movie you are going to love this one because it's more intense (Kudos on Jennifer Lawrence, in my opinion she's becoming one of the finest artists of our generation) and we are finally presented with the going against the all uncomfortable situation of games made to kill people. Yet, it still bother's me a bit. I realize that it happened in our history several situation like this and nowadays we are still puppets in the hands of powerful people. Yet I like to believe that isn't in such exaggerated ways and we have more power to ""fight"" against it. On the other hand if you hated the first one probably isn't going to be this one making you change your mind. The story line hasn't change and Hunger Games it's still Hunger Games. Personally I fell like the characters behaviors and feelings are more better exploit and that brings them close to us. The movie still manages to pull some surprises (not extremely surprising but reasonable) and it ends up being a good way of entertaining in the drama/adventurous area. I certainly recommend it, a movie can always teach something. Worst case scenario is for you not to see the next one.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
264,motezart,An exciting 2.5 hours,7,7 December 2013,"The fact that the Hunger Games stories are not crushed by their own weight is mystifying, and an achievement. It seems crazy that a film whose ideology is as savagely brutal as the fictional Games would become such a hit. Despite all its violent connotations and tyrannical regimes, the film comes off as the year's pinnacle of entertainment. Maybe the allure lies in ourselves? We project ourselves on screen. We are Katniss fighting back against the oppressors. The film's core audience is essentially the same demographic that would be sacrificed if such games were ever to become a reality, so maybe everyone is really just preparing for the future? When the Games start, we'll know what to expect.According to IMDb, Post-apocalyptic thrillers are not particularly big money makers; The Hunger Games franchise being the only series that nearly approaches real commercial heavy weights. The first two Hunger Games installments together hold the top grossing spots in the genre, but even then, they don't come near grossing anything like the top 50 overall films. Avatar and Titanic are the top two. Both have over two billion worldwide gross. Still, Hunger Games has a hard-core devoted fan base that rivals even Twilight.At the Los Angeles premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, young fans camped out for three days just to be front and center on the red carpet, catching glimpses of the film's stars.The best scenes of the film visually were the ones shot in the districts. The New Yorker review describes these scenes like ""Eastern-bloc depressiondrained of vitality,"" but Katniss is exactly the opposite. As a hero she is so strong that alleviates the vitality drainage. Once we leave the districts, the filmmakers deflect the intensity of the subject matter using Katniss as a distraction. Katniss keeps the film from being engulfed into an R-rated abyss. I love R-rated abysses, but they don't draw fans like Jennifer Lawrence's strong performances in these PG-13 flicks.There were some weaknesses. The coincidence that Katniss and Peeta would be drawn back into the turmoil was too much, an obvious excuse just to get Katniss back in the ring. How is that we didn't hear of these conflicts in the past film? Surely Katniss and Peeta would have the known the traditions of the world they live in.Also, why are all the people in the capital dressed so outlandishly? How do they assemble for all public events in perfect symmetry? Why is the President's only concern with the games? Doesn't he have other duties?What the story lacks in depth, and it certainly does lack, it makes up for in action-packed, well- shot scenes. Despite an appearance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the game maker, the curves thrown at the participants in this rendition of the Games weren't as exciting as the first film. The most annoying thing in the film was Peeta Malark. He is a weakling and not an interesting character. On the battlefield he hardly contributes. He seems to function only as a male counterpart to Katniss in the political spectrum as Katniss ends up fighting battles for two in the forest.Overall The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was worth the price of admission, and at 2 hours 26 minutes, it flies by quick.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Accurate choosing of stronger supporting cast, good control of cinematography, tantalizing costume designs, amazing scores, continuing the feeling from the previous installment and enhanced performance from Jennifer Lawrence has easily immersed audiences into her shoes - to provoke a resolution against the insane game and the merciless President Snow. Catching Fire, overall is a more-driven emotional fantasy over its predecessor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
266,newguy85,Better than the original,9,3 December 2013,"In the tradition of blockbuster trilo-quadrilogies Catching Fire is better than the original.Having read the books about a year before the first movie, I can't attest to how close the movie was to the book, but after what I saw on screen, I don't care. The plot flowed and intensity scaled effortlessly; nothing felt rushed, nothing felt left out.Jennifer Lawrence is a rare talent and still fully commits to the role of Katniss even though she's struck gold already with Silver Linings and probably Hustle as well. She's matured the character from the save-my- skin scrapper of the original to the nuanced survivor in Catching Fire. I do know Kat has a lot of inner-dialogue in the novel, and the script is commendable in the fact that there is zero voice-over. They lean heavily on Lawrence's ability and she delivers impeccably. The rest of the cast was better-than-average, and it was a delight seeing the characters come alive. Joanna and Finnick were played with the perfect blend of charm and ferocity, and Beetle is a character that could have easily been overdone, but wasn't. I also appreciate that the love-triangle is anti-Twilight in the sense that there is a real love between the characters, but they don't spend the trilogy pining over one-another. The characters are mature and act like there is more on the line than who's with who. I watched the first movie before heading to the theaters, and the director was a huge upgrade, Hunger Games' shaky camera was a distraction; also the costume and set design showed a high level of originality and felt like the Panem from the novel.I can't wait for Part 1 and 2 of Mockingjay to come out, I only wish they would've taken a page from Peter Jackson's book, and filmed the entire series at once. 9/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

There is a huge lack of sens, of coherence, so we never, even for a second, feel that it has some credibility, that it could be possible. It seem that the story was improvised by a chicken without head. Art and creativity has nothing to do with random foolishness, or insanity.

I had my doubts about Woody Harrelson being cast as Haymitch, but now I can't see anyone but him playing the role. Jena Malone, although given brief screen time, was awesome. The cinematography was better in this than in the first. This wouldn't quite make it as a stand alone movie--it does not explain how or why the games started and how Katniss and Peeta came to be in their position, but who cares? It's a sequel. The first book as good; the first movie was good. The second book was good (my wife says it was better); the second movie was better.

The whole idea of the entire human race being okay with watching people and kids kill each other, come on - Yet everyone loves Katniss, our favorite polyandrist. Part of the problem is I couldn't ever find myself rooting for her, I don't know if it's Lawrence or the character; but I didn't find either likable, I found myself rooting more for Peeta and Finnick. Going into it, the majority of the movie feels pointless and when the games actually do start, it's something we've already seen, a reverse slasher - except you know who wins. To its credit, it does get better towards the end and I thought this one was better than the first.

270,tuhin94,More evocative than the first; if only there was a 9.5 option....,10,23 March 2014,"Catching Fire was simply better than the original from 2012. There was so much more emotion provided from the actors; they seemed to really be familiar with every aspect of their characters. Hats off especially to Jennifer Lawrence who always enthralls me with her acting. I also found that I felt a deeper connection with the movie; something that made me realize there was more passion put into this movie. And the omniscient screenplay that allowed us to get a glimpse into the actions of Plutarch (among others) that we did not get to see from Collins was a nice addition. All this being said, I go back to the point I had made about The Hunger Games. If the movie is going to be true to the book, then it should be completely true. Important characters should not be excluded; there should not be alterations to events and reasons for certain events; descriptions of major things like clothing should remain true to what the author sketched out. Obviously, these are minor things that only mean I give this movie a 9.5. But, since that choice is unavailable, I very gladly dish out a 10 over a 9. A marvelous job with the CGI and action sequences. They were never overdone and highlighted the important events. Even though a greater portion of the run time was doled out for the action than allocated in the book, it did not seem like important facets from before the Games were left out. In the book, the pre-Games chapters served to dig deeper into the world of Panem and help set up the remainder of the books. The time allotted to this in the movie was sufficient. In summary, a brilliant job by the whole crew bringing this wonderful trilogy to life. I am thoroughly anticipating both parts of the conclusion.

273,maue-19674,"""The Games are just Games Miss Everdeen - did you want War""? President Snow",9,26 April 2020,"Katniss and Peeta have survived the 74th Hunger Games but their method of doing so has angered the powers in the Capitol - especially President Snow. Both Katniss and Peeta had 'pretended' to fall in love in the arena but Snow - and others - are not so easily deceived. While they are preparing to go on the 'Victors Tour' of the Districts, Katniss is shocked to find Snow waiting for her at her home - they both agree not to lie to one another - and Snow points out that her 'defiant' acts in the arena have had consequences. Katniss protests that she 'never wanted any of this"" but Snow brutally lays out the real situation - ""The Games are just Games, Miss Everdeen, did you want War?"" Katniss agrees to try and convince the Districts that both she and Peeta are very much 'in love' and play the 'Victor' Tour as Snow wants it. However, while on the Tour Katniss witnesses her own 'Mockingjay' symbol - now being used by the rebels in the Districts. When there is a disturbance in District 11 she and Peeta are shocked to see people executed for showing the 'three upraised fingers' of the rebels. By the time the Tour reaches the Capitol, Snow has decided that she is now a liability and should be eliminated. His new Game Maker - Plutarch Heavensbee - convinces Snow that there is a way to do this without suspicion. The 75th Hunger Games - a 'Quarter Quell' will select the Tributes from the previous Victors - thus ensuring that most will be eliminated. Katniss 'volunteers' but Peeta does also to save Haymitch after it is HIS name that is pulled out. Once at the Capitol it is clear that the other 'Victors' are as bitter and angry as Katniss & Peeta, especially Johanna Mason, and it is also clear that something else is afoot. As Katniss and Peeta go into the arena for a second time, nothing is what it seems.
Unbeknown to Katniss and Peeta, most of the Victors are playing a different 'game'. She and Peeta have allied themselves to Beetee and wiress, people who won through brains and not physical strength. Beetee hatches a plan to electrocute the remaining hostiles by harnessing the lightning strikes from a tall tree. Katniss and Johanna make for the beach but before they get far Johanna knocks Katniss out and removes her 'tracker'. As Finnick runs calling her name, Katniss thinks only of Peeta and returns to the tree but finds Beetee unconscious and Finnick approaching - she levels her bow - the watching President Snow urges her to let it fly. However, Finnick says to Katniss 'Remember who the real enemy is' and, in slight confusion she lowers the bow from Finnick but attaches the cable and - when the Lightning strikes again - launches her arrow high up to the dome covering the arena. The enormous power shorts out all the cameras and screens as the dome begins to fall apart above their heads. A hovercraft picks up a barely conscious Katniss as parts of the dome still collapse past her. She later wakes to find Haymitch, Finnick and Plutarch all announcing that she has been rescued as she is the symbol of the Rebellion. She is aghast to find that Peeta and Johanna have been captured back in the arena. Later, there is more heartbreak as Gale tells her that District 12 has been utterly destroyed and that they are on their way to District 13 to continue the fight....
'Catching Fire' is one of the very best Sequels and it does this because it changes very little from the first film. Gary Ross hands the reins to new director Francis Lawrence, who knows better than to tamper with the design, and look (and Cast!) of the Film. Again, we as the audience, get to look at the Games as we did the first BUT this time we are NOT enjoying any of it. The 'Victor's are angry and mostly rebellious, the interviews that Caesar Flickerman tries to glitz up fail completely until we are again facing the Arena. Katniss has been truly an 'innocent' through all of the events but she is now suspecting that her influence beyond the Games may be higher than she thought. This second film as darker than the original, the sequence where Katniss hears the voice of her Sister, Prim, screaming in flocks of birds, leaves her shocked and traumatised. We feel through the second half of the film that things are heading out of control - and so they are.
Again, Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss superbly - confused, dazed, angry betrayed - it takes a lot to do this but Lawrence always makes her character feel real. This is no superhero, just a girl trying to survive and understand. The other cast members do well - the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffmann in his last role plays Plutarch, Sutherland oozes menace as Snow and both Sam Claflin and Jena Malone imbue their 'victors' with believable angst and pathos.
What 'Catching Fire' does is pull the rug from under the audience - this will be the LAST time we will see a 'Hunger Games' arena - as I said in my review of the first film - the Games are not the point - it is Rebellion and War that are now apparent. Both the books - and the Films - show what sometimes must be done to keep basic values - freedom from oppression, the freedom to speak and even think. All through the Film there are sacrifices made by people, just to ensure that there is hope - Cinna in the Capitol and many of the victors, to get Katniss out.
'Catching Fire' leaves behind the 'Games', arena's, the glitz and the glamour, the fashion - it's all gone - because now the Rebellion has started and war has come to Panem again.
The series will continue with 'Mockingjay - Part 1' - a dark and gloomy Film that I think was justified in being apart from the finale. Yes, there will be no more innocent Katniss as she will realise what has been done - and what now needs to happen. She will have to become the 'Mockingjay' for real - and more sacrifices will have to be made.
I appreciate 'Catching Fire' more with each viewing. I watched this with my Teenage Daughter recently and she was truly stunned with what happened. ""Oh God, what happens now?"" she asked. ""War"" I said.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

275,cubsckc,Descent Depiction of the Second Novel,8,23 November 2013,"The movie overall was pretty entertaining, but to me missed the ""wow"" factor. I must admit, I have read the books but I am not considered a hard core fan of the lore. I think they did a descent job of trying to adapt a lot of detail in one book. I feel however, they went through the game too fast. The original game was much more complex and entertaining. It was probably due to not straining time that they skipped some of those parts. Unlike the first movie, this is really about the depiction of the Hunger Games universe with the showing of the districts and how the government works. The actual game that is depicted towards the end of the movie is simply the result in every sense of the word to the events of the first half of the movie. Pretty good movie... ending actually did give a surprise. I think its because it happened faster than i thought it would. I wish Thad from Blue Mountain State had a cooler part though.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
276,Nuridemirkubuz,The new characters are interesting.,7,29 November 2019,I watched the whole series in a row. This movie was the transition. Transition from action movie to war movie. The new characters are interesting. I like the whole series.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
277,ted-peterson,Katniss or Kantmiss. This sequel is a copy.,4,4 December 2013,"Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. First, there is another movie in the wings and given the boffo box office of this meager effort will make millions more. Let's see, how can we take a formula, alter it slightly and still keep the same thing? Make a sequel to ""The Hunger Games"" and call it ""Catching Fire."" We have a subplot involving the revolution that we thought was set off in the first movie. Obviously it wasn't but with Katniss' providing the impetus, rebellious elements are at work in this movie. One is reminded of the ""Matrix.""In normal human existence, those that benefit give enough to those who don't so there will not be a revolution. Here, nothing is given back but propaganda. Kind of reminds me of the current American administration but that's not for this post. It's all so formulaic and predictable. The whole goal is to get the ""Whole World"" to hate Katniss Let the floggings begin while showing Katniss in a wedding dress. Starve the people while showing Katniss at an elaborate dinner. This ""let them eat cake"" motive just doesn't work. Potboilers are not new. Sinclair Lewis wrote ""Kingsblood Royal"" and it was a potboiler par excellence. But a potboiler inside a potboiler just gilds the Lily. Why? Here's my opinion inside of an opinion: There is simply not enough material to make three good movies but we want to stretch the franchise. So let's stretch the first concept from a pretty well done movie and see how much we can make without much effort. That what the producers must have been thinking. And make a fortune they did while elevating JenLaw into international stardom. We know that our heroine will not be killed so this movie just drags through ""The Perils of Pauline"" but with supporting actors who do a good job of self sacrifice. We find out later in the film that they are all in on the joke but who cares. Supposedly nobody dies and they are all hiding in District 13 (Oh, those triskaidekaphobes.) as opposed to ""District 9"" which may have been more entertaining. The acting is good and outside of the plastic ""elite"" roles, characters evolve to a degree. Actually, the characters do not develop in a sense but do coalesce due to extreme hardship. Supposedly they will all have to kill to survive but it sort of works if you don't pay too much attention. Katniss as Xena warrior princess kind of works but Xena in a transforming wedding dress? Is she Xena or Kantmiss? The fake ""marriage"" theme just doesn't work if Snow and company are trying to kill her off. Now she's also the victim of a pregnancy which must be immaculate because there is no sex in this movie. But it is all a lie to get support for her plight from the populace that isn't so downtrodden that they can actually send help to someone else. What? Now instead of individual protagonists, we have couples and these couples are past winners of the Hunger Games. I thought when you won the first time, you were set for life and your district was favored? What happened to that plot line? When did the couples start winning the stupid games? Supposedly there's only been seven gavels with one winner each so where do we get 24? Fierce couples they are too. These are some really bad ass pairs who drop like paper tigers and operate like unintelligent zombies. At least the first crew were all thinking people and the games worked out in a way. But here, they face much stiffer competition from the environment that they ever do from any other person. The Mandrills are real, imagined? The mocking birds are real/unreal? When is a bite a bite and imagination can kill you if this were a ""Fringe"" episode where people were attacked by imaginary steel butterflies. Here the fog causes boils and the water cures but you can't drink it. You have to tap a tree. Just any tree? Supposedly, this whole mess is watched by the ""Whole World"" and one wonders what statement is being made. If the winners are really a distraction, why would anyone not let the cat out of the bag so to speak? The winners obviously know that the whole thing is BS and they all seem to be pretty independent minded. During the introduction one of the winners Jena Mallone, I think, chastises the process and complains that she was promised an easy life but she's back in these stupid games. She challenges Snow during the games too. Now, that's pluck. Why not kill her? She's obviously telling state secrets and while no Snowden, her crime would be equally reprehensible to the elites. There are no surprises. Don't we go to movies like this to be surprised at some point? Aren't we more satisfied when our plot-following senses are jarred out of sync and we are surprised and happy with plot twists? The only twisting thing here is the wire that Katniss shoots into the dome with arrows that fly higher than the sky.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
278,bucekcrk,Amazing Emotions,9,25 September 2021,"In this second Hunger Games film, I think all aspects of survival battle royale are really felt.Compared to the previous film, which feels a little less portion of the Hunger Games.If you calculate the duration of playing time from the first and second scenes of the Hunger games, they are almost the same, but there are many factors that distinguish them. For example, the deepening of the characters from several other players and the story that was built in earnest to make the film and this battle feel more alive.The twists that were presented also didn't play around, and I was made even more curious about what would happen in the next movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
279,isabelle-frater,The odds are never in your favor,10,13 December 2013,"This is the second instalment in The Hunger Games trilogy. I went to see the movie with a higher level of excitement than I did the previous one, as can be seen from the tone of my review. Partly, it's due to the fact that I've read the books in the time between. I was bothered by the style of writing in the books, which I talked about in detail in the review of the first book. However, the story itself and Katniss' character captured my imagination, and I managed to get passed the style for the most part. The second book was my favourite. It had the most imaginative story line out of the three, and the greatest shocker at the end.Now onto the movie. My greatest problem with the previous movie was the shaky cam, and the weird close-ups. Luckily, we got a new director for this instalment, and he didn't suffer from this ""artistic"" compulsion. According to the credits of the next two (yes, Mockingjay looks to be a two-parter, yay) movies, he will stay on. That is great news to me, because I really loved the movie. This year had been full of disappointments. Man of Steel I couldn't even review, I was so saddened by it. City of Bones was watchable, but didn't rock my world. The Colony had a great trailer, I just wish the movie had been even remotely like that. I was almost afraid Catching Fire would follow along the same vein. I'm so glad it didn't! It was probably one of the best movie adaptations that I've seen, and it's probably going to make my top ten all time movie favourites list. It was that good. No more shaky cam! The images were clean and grand. The settings just like I imagined. The clothes and the make-up were wonderful. Visually, it couldn't have been better. The story compared to the book followed it well. Of course, there were some differences, but the book covers a lot of things, and I thought it had the important things. It has been a while since I read the book, but I didn't have a sense of anything major being left out. Maybe there was something about District 13 in there, but I'm not sure, it may have been in the next book. I went to see it with a guy who hasn't read the books, so I used him to test the coherency and how well the story could be understood without that background. According to him and my test questions, the major points went over well. One little bit that was different, is that not everything was through Katniss' eyes. This gave us an interesting glimpse into some of President Snow's actions. I was glad to see those. Tissue warning should have been at the start of the film, because I had tears in my eyes at several points. Just one word, not to spoil anything. Rue.Now for the characters and the actors. Jennifer Lawrence carried the story on her back. She was truly brilliant here. Her face showed Katniss' emotions perfectly. The part got somewhat harder here, I think. As I wrote in my book reviews, after the events in the first instalment, Katniss clearly suffers from PTSD. It was apparent often on her face how she could barely keep it together, and how she lost it sometimes. I could feel Jennifer being Katniss. She did show her comical side in THE elevator scene, which I won't spoil. Her face there though, priceless. I think we all needed that little laugh in the grimness of the story. Josh Hutcherson seemed to have come into his role of Peeta. In the previous movie I wasn't completely convinced, but he won me over. The rest of the cast had matured into their roles as well. I guess that's the benefit of playing in a series. Though next to Jennifer, they all felt as minor characters. I confess, I had mostly just eyes for her. I'll check out the other people when I rewatch the movie.I have to write a little side note here. I was watching the movie in English, with Hungarian subtitles. Now I had no need of subtitling, but they were sometimes hard to ignore, and I read them. I facepalmed a lot. When I saw how they translated ""May the odds be ever in your favor"", I had a little rant at the screen. It was completely wrong. Sometimes half of the sentences were missing. Overall, it was a poor job, whoever did it. So all you people out there who don't have to see that abomination, be ever so glad. Why was that phrase so important to translate right? Because it's a mockery. The odds never were, and never will be in their favor, for anyone in the Districts. It depicts their relationship to the Capitol in one, simple sentence. They have no chance, no choices, they are just slaves to the Capitol. The people in charge feeding them that line are trying to give them a false promise of chance, but that can be ripped from them at any moment. Some people on the internet wrote that it means ""Good luck"". They were wrong. It doesn't. It means, you have a chance to make your life and that of your District better, we are giving that to you. That is the promise of the Games. What is given, however, can be taken away just as easily. That is what people realise, when they change ""ever"", to ""never"".Overall, this is a great movie. Others may not agree with me, but I was totally pumped by the end. I won't tell you what signs I was making towards the screen, intending them for Snow, when the end approached. I recommend the film for everyone, really.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
280,joshtill-98100,Another Great Instalment To A Superior Franchise,9,10 January 2021,"The Hunger Games (2012) is one of my all time favourite movies. It truly makes you feel as if you are a child, fighting for their life in the Hunger Games. So, when I heard there was a sequel, I was elated. The sequel is also amazing. Catching Fire didn't feel like the same movie as the first, nor did I feel a difference in tone or age with the characters. It just felt like a continuation. As usual, Jennifer Lawrence's performance steals the show in this franchise. However, I must applaud the newbie Jena Malone who plays Joanna in this movie, who truly captivated me with her performance.The film finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) suffering from PTSD of the events of the 74th Hunger Games. While the rest of the world is convinced that Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Katniss are madly in love, President Snow of Panem (Donald Sutherland) is not, and threatens to have District 12 wiped from existence if Peeta and Katniss do not persuade the public on their victory tour. Snow also begins to see an uprising among the population, and threatens to have Katniss killed. Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a different kind of termination, to put Katniss and Peeta back into the games. As it is the games' 75th anniversary, a Quarter Quell is held, meaning that the surviving victors must go back into the arena to fight in the games. Along the way, Katniss befriends new contestants Finnick Odair (Sam Claffin), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Joanna Mason (Jena Malone). As they form a bond, they appear to pose a threat to the Careers, but the games are more high-tech and much more physically demanding.Heres what I liked: I loved Katniss' arch in this story. Rather than feeling upset that she was involuntarily reaped into another games, she shows a very blank face, which would be very realistic in this case. I loved the performances of Jennifer Lawrence, Jena Malone, Josh Hutcherson, and Donald Sutherland. All of the other actors were great, but those were the four that really stuck out in this film. I also love the feel of the pacing of the film. In the first film, more tension was built up for the games, making it more enticing. In this film, rather than two acts (training and games), the film has three, making each portion shorter, which worked for this film (life, training and games).Here's what I didn't like: The film is great, however a few things are left to be desired. Sam Claffin and Liam Hemsworth's performances were nothing short of dull. To be fair, having seen the rest of the series I know that Sam Claffin gets more into character, but the two men were essentially cast to be a pretty face for people to swoon over. The second is the scripture of this film. In some moments, the actors lines feel predictable and cheesy, which is why I didn't love Gale or Finnick. Finally, I felt not a whole lot of emotion during this movie. In the previous film, I cried profusely when Rue passed, but in this one, I felt tension and no emotion.Overall, I'm giving Hunger Games: Catching Fire a 9/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
281,kshirad,There's only one word to describe this film: SPECTACULAR!,10,23 November 2013,"Sequels rarely live up to its predecessor. But in this case, aside from the fact that it's adapted from the book, it's expanded. It's a start-to-finish entertainment. With a gap only for one year and eight months from the first one, This is a solid fare.The movie continues the events from the first movie. Katniss Everdeen (the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence) is still struggling from her trauma of the 74th Hunger Games. She and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are presented to each district of Panem as the sole survivors. Katniss became a symbol to the people and causing them to start a rebellion. The president (Donald Sutherland) is conducting the 75th Hunger Games, named Quatrell Quell, and it's all up to Katniss on how to survive from it.What's interesting is in the script. It is so unpredictable that it keeps your heart racing waiting for what happens next. It never goes downhill. Everything is slick and unpretentious, never boring. You'll see it. I recommend you to see the first one because a lot of reference will be needed to watch this spectacle.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
282,Newsgeek13,"Well, the odds were in my favor.",8,28 November 2013,"With most sequels, you expect it to be not as good as the first. To tell you the truth, that's what I thought at first when the trailers popped up on IMDb. When I went to see it, I saw it opening day and I played hooky with my mother, older brother, little brother and little sister. My initial reaction was, ""It was good"" I was really confused about my opinions for about a day or 2 and I then realized, it was better than the first. So then 2 days later me and some friends went to see it (this being my second time). And now my opinions came full circle. The plot is just like the book, except some things from the book is dropped. The scenery is beautiful and I think because the movie was filmed in 4k H.D. (4k is roughly 4 times better then 1080p H.D.) A lot more emotion was in the movie. A great soundtrack, Lots of thrills, action, suspense and there was a bit more comedic relief in this movie. Which I think helps the overall feel of the movie when you come out of watching it. The only things I thought were negative, some of the characters were still flat, but that doesn't affect the movie for me.While the movie was great, the book was still better, but this movie I believe was better than the first movie.

283,jukangliwayway,better than the first one,7,25 November 2013,"""Eyes bright, chins up, smiles on. I'm talking to you Katniss."" Still sulky, still independent, still a pain in the ass - it's so fun to watch Katniss Everdeen (played by the ever so charming Jennifer Lawrence) annoy the hell out of President Snow and his Stormtroopers - er, Peace Keepers, once again.. and kick some baboon's ass. Francis Lawrence sitting in the director's chair seems to be a good choice (but it would have been interesting if David Cronenberg or Alfonso Cuaron, who were also considered, have been chosen). But I'm happy with Lawrence's work. Catching Fire is a huge improvement over Gary Ross' The Hunger Games. The returning cast did a way better job than what they did in the first movie. Screenplay was essentially faithful to the book. Of course changes were made, but that's necessary. I have no complaints regarding that.It's not a perfect film nor is it a perfect fantasy/sci-fi story - but considering its source material, they can only do so much, and they did more than enough, more than I've expected.

284,Caesarboy5,Another Disappointment (If you like your movies smart),6,24 December 2013,"ONE MINOR SPOILERCatching Fire was simply okay. Not bad, not great. While I usually couldn't care less about similar movies, the Hunger Game series as a whole genuinely upsets me. Mainly due to the potential it could have had. BACKGROUNDThe first book was excellent and so smart for a book geared towards teenagers. It had social commentary and teenagers killing each other. I have no idea how it got so popular with these two factors working against it. But it it did.The first film, if left in the hands of a skilled director, could have broken the trend of mediocre teen films and made something actually memorable. Unfortunately, it failed. It tried to mash too much material into one film. It also failed in developing believable and likable characters... especially the protagonists. Most people told me they ended up feeling bad for Gale, when in the book it clearly the opposite. When the girl died, I genuinely did not care... compared to the book when I actually shed a tear or two. THE BADNow, with all that said, Catching Fire was a chance to redeem the series. I saw the running time and was hopeful that maybe this time around the characters would be well defined. Catching Fire was my least favorite book in the series (many people hate me for that) so I was hoping maybe this film could make me like it... it didn't.Just like the book, I liked the first half and couldn't care less about the second half. I never liked the idea of returning to the Hunger Games, and I hoped this film would change my opinion, but it failed. Just like the book, I fail to understand why they would return. Just like the book I wished they never made a sequel. As for the long running time, the film just dragged on. It felt longer than it actually was due to a lack of attachment to the characters. I did not feel for any of them. I also didn't like how they never even explained that the mother and child operating on Gale are Katniss' mom and sister. I forgot what they looked like and I read the book when it came out, so it took me a while to figure it out. That's bad writing. While directors/writers like Tarantino and Fincher are able to use two or three lines to let an audience know who a character is and what they are like, fifty lines cannot be used in this film to say anything.THE GOODIt's a shame that the acting was really good. The whole cast put up a great performance, despite their really half-assed dialogue.Especially for Jennifer Lawrence. She does such a great job, despite the terrible dialogue she is presented with. I felt like she was just screaming Peeta's name the entire film. She also comes across as a bit unlikable due to her dialogue, but that's everyone but her's fault.Woody Harrelson also makes an amazing Haymitch. Just like the original film, I wouldn't have minded seeing more of him.VERDICTCatching Fire gets a 6 out of 10. It's entertaining and everything a dumb teenage drama should be. It only hurts that the film, as well as it's prequel, should have been a lot more. A better script with better dialogue and character development would have made all the difference.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
285,WheelzFourReelz,Catching Fire is a great movie that manages to do everything much better than the original.,8,2 March 2014,"Catching Fire is the highly anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games. Obviously. Now, I must say, The Hunger Games series is one of my favorite book series. They're well written, intense, and just downright cool. As for the first Hunger Games movie, I enjoyed it too; however, I do like the book better. I was excited for Catching Fire and my hopes were high. Was it as good as the original Hunger Games movie? No. No it wasn't. It was BETTER! LEGASP! Let's start off with the story. If you have no idea what The Hunger Games movies/books are about, then A: you live under a rock, and B: it involves a society where the government forces kids to go into a yearly tournament where they kill each other. Catching Fire is about the tributes revolting against the government in a tournament where all the previous victors are fighting each other. In the book series, Catching Fire was my favorite. And it translates very well to the big screen. It's got an interesting plot, it's well written, and it really shows us what a society of this caliber is like. Just awesome. Not the actual society, the story. The story is awesome. Yeah. The acting in this movie is great. Let's start off with Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. She's awesome. She's very stoic, yet becomes emotional and/or ready to throw down when she needs to. Katniss is just an awesome character and Jennifer Lawrence owns the role. And she's kind of good looking. That helps too. She's also surrounded by other good actors. Josh Hutcherson does a good job, Liam Hemsworth does a great job, Elizabeth Banks does a great job, Woody Harrelson does a great job, Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job, and the guy who plays President Snow (I forgot his name, shut up) did a great job. There isn't a weak link in any of the acting. Catching Fire fixed some of the flaws that The Hunger Games had. One of them is the shaky cam. The first movie had so much camera shaking in it, it got me extremely nauseous and I had to leave the theater. This movie has a very still camera most of the time. It helped me see the action and the people better. Thank you, new director! Something else this movie fixed from the first is the chemistry between Katniss and Peeta. In the first movie, their chemistry felt very stale and unbelievable. In this movie, it feels real. They worked great together in this movie. However, there are a few things that I need to address for this movie. This isn't really a negative; it's just a heads up. Before you see the movie, I'd suggest reading the book, if you haven't. There are some things in the movie that will make much more sense if you read the book. Plus, if you haven't read it, you'll think the ending will be very abrupt. Again, it's not a negative; I'm just letting you know. A negative that I have with the movie is that there's no wow factor. There isn't a scene that really stands out. Sure, the acting's great, the actions intense, and the movie itself is well shot, but there's no scene that will make you say, ""Wow. This movie is epic."" I was just hoping there would be a standout performance somewhere. I also feel that the movie pretty much ignored Haymitch's backstory. In the book, Haymitch had a long, elaborate backstory on how he entered The Hunger Games and won. In the movie, it mentions it a couple of times, but never goes into real detail. It's too bad, because Haymitch has a great backstory. Oh well Overall, Catching Fire is a great movie that's marginally better than the first. It has great acting, awesome action, no shaky cam, and an interesting plot. I have high hopes for this movie series and hope the Mockingjay movies succeed.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
286,summerinertia,BATTLE ROYALE 2 meets boring cinema,1,12 March 2015,"This is not the worst remake in film history. I have never understood the idea of a remake at all. If a film, like ""Battle Royale"", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Francis Lawrence put nothing of himself into this film.They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as Battle Royale II, and I suspect that Francis Lawrence may have wanted to explore them. Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of the popular Japanese classic. Tatsuya Fujiwara turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor, no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors (namely Donald Sutherland) have that talent stifled.In the end, Francis Lawrence set out to pay homage to a great film. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

288,edgereviews,Catching Fire Review,5,23 November 2013,"At one point in Catching Fire, Woody Harrelson's character says ""I think the games are going to be different this time."" The games certainly are different, and for the better as Catching Fire improves on it's mediocre predecessor in every way, making it one of the best blockbusters of the year.It's remarkable that Catching Fire feels so unique, because it follows the same three act structure the first one had; beginning in the district (or in this case, multiple districts), then moving to the Capitol for preparation of the Games and then finally, the Games themselves. This structure feels much better the second time round, as the people behind the movie seem to have decided how they want the movie to play out whereas with the first movie they were unsure. I haven't read the book in about half a year so I can't remember all of the tiny details, but for as much of the book as I can remember, the movie seemed to follow it very well, more so than the first movie did with the first book.One of The Hunger Game's strongest points was it's great ensemble cast, and that carries on into Catching Fire with some new additions who are very welcome. Jennifer Lawrence absolutely kills it again, as she consistently does in every movie she's in. I had never liked the casting choice of Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, and the first movie didn't sell me on him. After Catching Fire I still don't think he's the perfect choice, but he impressed me a lot more than I expected him to and he does a decent job in the role. Stanley Tucci steals every scene he's in as always, Woody Harrelson is outstanding as he was last time, and Donald Sutherland does a great job again as well. I was looking forward to seeing Sam Claflin's portrayal of Finnick, and he didn't disappoint. He perfectly embodies the character and does an excellent job, I'm looking forward to seeing him again in Mockingjay. Another new addition I was looking forward to seeing was Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and like all the other new cast members he's great as well.The biggest thing that sets Catching Fire apart from it's predecessor is that it actually has a good director. The Hunger Games was riddled with shaky cam, excessive cuts and a lack of overall direction. Thankfully there's none of that in Catching Fire, as Francis Lawrence brings a clear direction to the movie and is capable of filming action without tossing the camera around. Catching Fire also focuses a lot more on world building and the politics and culture of Panem, a vital aspect from the books that was missing from the first movie. Everything is much more focused, which in turn makes it all so much better. To compare the book and movie I'd have to read the book to have it more recent in memory, but as far as book to movie adaptations go Catching Fire is one of the better ones out there. Things in the movie actually resembled how I imagined them looking whilst reading, unlike the first movie.Catching Fire is one of the best blockbusters of the year. It's intelligently written, well acted and excellently directed, and definitely worth your time.I give Catching Fire a 9.0/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
289,barendbkj,Consider my mind...not blown...Demolished...,10,21 November 2013,"The entire year I've been waiting for this moment when The Hunger Games: Catching Fire would come out and I would go and see it. I had so many expectations going into the theater; was it going to be better than the first? Did they put everything that was in the book in the movie? Is it going to be worth it? Well I am pleased to say that the answer to all these questions are yes. This movie is by far one of the best franchise movies to date...Go suck it Twilight. Hunger Games Rule!! The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence...I am in love, I don't know where she came from but she's from out of this world. They could not have casted a better Katniss, this girl it on fire! Josh Hutcherson might have grown up a bit and his portrayal of Peeta Mellark was outstanding. The rest was awesome, the victory tour, the parties, the tributes parade, the tributes, the arena, the obstacles in the arena, the CGI was memorable, and the emotion that these actors brought to the set was unforgettable.It's way better than the first one. And I'm so glad they did this one justice. I wish I could give this movie a fifteen out of ten, because it's just fantastic.If the second one was this good...then I cannot wait for Mockingjay Part 1 and Part 2. It's gonna be epic...",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
290,tariq-hossenbux,An important social commentary and thrilling film,8,11 May 2014,"This move is well over 2 hours long but it flows so well that at the end you are in eager anticipation of the next instalment. Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth are convincing as Katnis and Peeta. In a new Survivor like setting,the two youngsters are once forced to struggle against the Capitol's interest in dominating the Districts. As this film progresses so does the interpersonal relationship between the two. The subtlety of the message is there, but the message that this film conveys is clear all the same. We are all being distracted from real life and real problems by the media of television and film. The film does present it in an interesting way though because in this story the ones who are distracting themselves are the rich and powerful ones. Issues of social stratification are also brought to light in the film, as the script shows us that no matter what their wealth status or race is people are more alike than we are indoctrinated to believe. Aside from this the action and special effects are thrilling, and the story provides some very tense moments. An important film I think because it asks many people to examine how much of their life they devote to happens on the screen.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
291,shani_dayo,Best one in the series so far,10,6 September 2015,"Catching Fire, the second installment in ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy was by far the best movie in the series that I have seen so far. This film goes more in depth with the story and the Characters feelings than the first one did, and explains more about how life is in the districts. It seems like the camera work, make up, lines, the writing, and what they did a did not cut out of the movie from the books was done with more care and thought than before. Catching fire was somewhat like the book, and kept Me on the edge of My seat until the end of the Movie, and I have seen it about 6 times sense 2013. The actors really put their hearts into this one, and gave off a believable performance, especially Jennifer Lawrence, and I am usually not impressed by Her. It left Me wondering what was going to happen next, and my anticipation for the next film was at an all time high( but that was for nothing, but that if for Me to talk about at a later time)and I really got into the story. Catching Fire deserves I higher rating than it received in My opinion.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
292,rahmannoodles22,Catching Fire - Noodles Review,6,19 December 2013,"We all know that it's going to make big bucks from all those devout fans of the books and just the teen populace of the world. But I learned that there's hope for the quality of the movies in the series. So, we left off in the first movie that Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games, and the way they did it gave way for people to get the hope to rebel against the oppressive government in this world. Let's talk about the world for a second. The world that Suzanne Collins has established is actually impressive and interesting. I really dig the lore and how everything came to be, as well as the overall atmosphere of it. This movie gets that atmosphere right. The tone throughout the beginning of this movie is spot-on and I was afraid that wouldn't get it right, because the first movie didn't quite do it. I liked the first movie to a certain degree; it did hit some good notes, but I personally don't feel like it did the source material the right amount of justice. Catching Fire, takes almost a 180- degree turn, because this is SO much better! First off, they build off of the good things in the first movie, and then they improve on some of the weak points, and I think that's a lot due to the new director because I could definitely tell that this was directed differently (for the better, though). The camera angles are a lot better, as well as the tone and placement of everything; especially the pacing. Pacing was a major problem for me in the first movie because I don't think I should be getting bored during a movie about a government-orchestrated fight to the death between teenagers in a post- apocalyptic world. But I did. Sigh. The pacing is much better in this sequel. I was invested throughout more of the movie. And here's what you've all been waiting for... wait for it... the violence in on screen! In the first movie, almost all the violence was off-screen so we didn't even see what happened; it was more-so implied. That deters the viewers from caring as much for what happened. Being able to see the actual cuts, injuries, hits, and deaths, really adds more to the emotion and investment in the film.That is also thanks to the acting because that's also great. Jennifer Lawrence has obviously proved herself as a credible actress now. We know she's great as Katniss. But I was really surprised by her in the beginning of the movie. You really begin to feel bad for Katniss and she effectively portrays her post-traumatic stress and stubbornness. What really surprised me was Josh Hutcherson. Wow, man, give yourself a pat on the back. He improved so much. In the first movie, I gave him a lot of crap since his acting was so wooden and ineffective. Back then he was just a pretty face. He's really improved, because I genuinely cared for his character in this movie, maybe even more than for Katniss at some points. Their little entourage in the Hunger Games is quite fleshed out and distinctive as well. It's inevitable that everyone's gonna love Finnick (or Aquaman as I called him). My favorite character, however, is Plutarch Heavensby, the game-master, and plots with President Snow on how to get rid of Katniss; their conversation on how to get that done is probably my favorite scene in the whole movie. He's played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, one of my favorite actors. Caesar, as well as pretty much all of the supporting cast is acted well. The only characters I sort of have a problem with are the the tributes from districts 1 and 2. I understand that they're supposed to be formidable foes, but this movie honestly doesn't play them as anything else; it feels like they're just there to be bad guys. Unfortunately, like the first movie, the pace slows down when the Hunger Games actually start out. This is a bit of a letdown because it's a little weird that the movie slows down when the ""action"" actually begins. Not only that, but the quality of the movie takes a bit of a dip as well. Yet by this point, it is a realization that the actual Hunger Games aren't the basis of the series. The Hunger Games event itself is a tool to help tell the story; it's a vehicle to propel the actual conflicts. That conflict is oppression and revolution. And this is one of the main reasons I like the book series. It's layered and has elements of politics on top of all this action and stuff. It's not just black and white wherein a good guy is trying to beat a bad guy. Catching Fire really started to show that, whereas one of my main problems with its predecessor was the lack of this layering. So up to the Hunger Games, we have actual dramatic conflict occurring, and it keeps us intrigued most of the way leading up to the games. The scope of the film was great until then, and I really felt more connected to the characters before it happened. Speaking of scope, there are some moments in the film that really make it feel more epic, and truly escalate the experience; this is part due to a great blend of sweeping cinematography and strong musical score. The score in this movie is definitely much stronger than that of the first movie since the music is actually memorable. I guess we could sum up this movie that way, because it's overall just more memorable than the first installment of the franchise. Catching Fire is a more exciting and more layered film that not only houses more intrigue, but also more cinematic prowess. Despite it having some obvious conveniences and other downfalls, Catching Fire is definitely a step in the right direction for the series",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The movie is from start to end a mishmash of good acted moments, piled together like all your favorite spices, and then blended together in a porridge that is just not good for anything.The overall storyline is usable for a 1st act, maybe..It baffles me, when amazing actors like Woody, says yes to something like this.

294,jul-kinnear,However barbaric and sad the Hunger Games seemed in the first movie is made all that much worse as the story unravels into the second.,9,20 December 2013,"""I think these Games are going to be different."",Hunger Games' mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson) utters these words in the movie trailer for The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire and they could not reflect the new movie more accurately.The first Hunger Games movie, released in 2012, immersed the audience in the unfair and devastated world of starving districts overpowered by the cruel Capitol. However barbaric and sad the Hunger Games seemed in the first movie is made all that much worse as the story unravels into the second.In the first film, District 12 tributes Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) overcame the Hunger Games and managed to trick their way into winning the Games together — something that had never happened before. By attempting to commit suicide together while all of Panem watched on their TV screens, the gamemakers had no choice but to stop them and dub them both winners. Seen as an act of love to some — Katniss refusing to live without Peeta — and an act of defiance to others, the film ended with the death of Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane.The second film takes us into the aftermath of Katniss and Peeta's victory, as they must undertake their Victor's Tour around the other districts. While on tour, there is a sense of an underlying rebellion, although President Snow makes it evident that he plans on maintaining the Capitol's dictatorship — especially as he calls for this year's tributes to be reaped from the existing victors for The Quarter Quell (the games marking the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games).The battle in the arena is different from the first, as the tributes are angry with the Capitol for forcing them back inside the nightmare they spend their nights trying to escape. While Katniss and Peeta are each determined to save the other, they slowly begin to realize there might be others with similar intentions.The film is action-packed with much darker moments than the first, as we are submerged into a world of a dictatorship where people are executed for the slightest question to authority and, it seems, for mere association with Katniss. Director Francis Lawrence did a great job showing the scenes outside of Katniss' view — scenes that are more difficult to construct, as reading the novels can't give insight to the other side until it has been discovered later on in the book.Although it's impossible to ensure total accuracy when it comes to transforming an epic novel into a blockbuster film, the cast and crew have, yet again, managed to bring us into the world of Panem, leaving the audience excited for the final release in the trilogy.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/review-catching-fire",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Snow starts to become the villain by blackmailing Katniss with a video of Gale kissing her, even though Gale initiated the kiss.

297,scottyxl,"Better than the first but still nothing special, 6/10",6,17 November 2014,"For some reason I enjoyed this movie a little more that the first one and I think it was because you know most off the characters by now. You'll hate some and love others. The pace in the first half is very slow compared to the second half in which it seams they rushed so many thing. It would have been a lot better if they slowed down the second part. The acting for most of the cast was alright but Jennifer Lawrence's acting was a lot worse than in the first movie, I hope she does better in the next THG. Throughout the movie a ton of errors are made (at one point she has 0 arrows left, few scenes later she has a dozen and in two movies I haven't seen her pickup one new arrow, she gets handed one by another Tribute). Katniss shooting at the sky was a WTF moment for me because the arrow could never reach that high, specially with a copper wire attached. I shouted why isn't she shooting at the wall 5m away, she apparently does that in the book. You got some pointers early on, on how things would end up. I wonder if this was intentional. It was an enjoyable movie but it felt too rushed and very much an in-between movie.So I give it a 6/10, just like the first movie. And is it just me or is Peeta's character the most pathetic character ever? He always needs saving and never does anything right :/",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

However it prepares us for the finale which, having read the books, I am looking forward to.Sutherland does a magnificent job as the president. He is ever bit the brilliant, sinister, psychopath the book demands. He is a menacing specter. When Snow is on screen you know trouble is afoot and you also know you won't be able to predict where and on whom the hammer will fall.Lawrence plays Katniss so perfectly I wonder if anyone else could have done the part as well.

Katniss presents a headache to President Snow as she is someone who, rather than winning the games, has transcended them by beating the premise of the format. Thus, Snow believes that she needs to be dealt with. In a great inversion of more conservative gender roles, Katniss is the one that is busy undermining the regime while Peeta just mopes around. Moreover, I have yet to discover the purpose of the character of Gale. The love-triangle gets left to one side in this one and all the better for it.Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as his character's arc takes an interesting trajectory- though its clear that he did not want anything to do with the costumes worn by everyone else- and Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the creepy, psychotic host of the whole 'show'. There is a hint of Heath Ledger's Joker in that role which must be a satire of the false, leering world of reality show television.The final act was somewhat rushed and I had to read a plot summary of it to work out what I just saw.

300,audrulyte,"Visually captivating and action packed, but...",7,10 December 2013,"I really like Hunger Games franchise for being what it is - tightly packed with action, always very visual, and with some very deep theme underneath a simple dystopian flick. Catching Fire is the second movie in the series and follows the source material quite closely but few necessary alterations. And it is what it should be - an action packed movie to catch your eyes on the screen and sit on the edge of the seat, right? Yes and no. It is very visual and beautiful, the action sequences are great, even the new cast members are great, the arena's even better than I'd imagined it to be, but... Oh, unfortunately there's a 'but' here, and quite a big one - Katnis Everdeen. While in the first movie her inner struggle translated quite decently to the screen language, in this one it fell quite hard. I've read the books, and I know what was going on inside her head and all, but my friend, who joined me to the movie, and who've never read those books, and only saw the first and now the second movie, was way too much puzzled on what kept Katnis tick and tock, and all. So I just say, that what we have here is a strong 2nd movie of total 4, and it's good on all levels but catching one on fire emotionally.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
301,thetruth45,Much Better than the First,8,8 December 2013,"I hated the first ""Hunger Games"" movie. It wasn't just bad in my opinion, it was dreadful (Poor acting, too Disney-like, poor story line, lame special effects, etc). I honestly had no desire to go see this movie based on how bad the first one was. However, it was the only thing playing and my date wanted to go see it, so we did. Wow, what a difference- this movie was an dramatically-different movie than the first movie,the horribly-flawed counterpart. And part two...well to my surprise it's GOOD!There was actual acting in this one, not brilliant but there was acting going on, the movie felt much richer (it was clear that this movie actually cost a good amount of money to make), the story was captivating (so much so that despite what-felt-like a long run time I was hoping the movie would keep going at the end instead of leaving us hanging on for Part 3). The addition of Philip Hoffman to the cast was a stroke of genius- this guy can act. He's THE BEST REAL ACTOR in this movie and helps pick up many of the loose ends that are left by some of the less-than-stellar actors out there. He adds credibility to the not-overly-talented group of actors that were assembled for this movie. So bravo for actually bringing in a heavyweight to the movie. Overall, I give the movie an 8/10. The only parts where the movie fails in my opinion are the (1) ""CHEESEBALL FACTOR."" One example- this guy brings this old woman into the Hunger Games out of Chivalry/Cockiness and then there is some ambiguity about whether they are dating- it's very odd and felt more like a scene out of comedy than a death match; (2)I still don't fully buy the darkness of the HUNGER GAMES- a death match would be more brutal than is portrayed- BUT, huge BUT because this movie is light years darker than the first one,It's dark enough that I'm happy with it, and it was believable enough. (3) I am not a fan of the PITA character. The character is a complete waste of space- he says the lamest lines, the actor who plays him is TERRIBLE... he's the worst in the movie, he over acts big time and plays attitude and mood (big no no's for acting)- He's weak sauce and the relationship between him and ""Catness"" is beyond cheesy and unrealistic. His name is completely lame- all I can think about is THE BREAD or THE ANIMALS RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. His lame/weak performance. IN FAIRNESS- I think this was more about bad casting than anything else- they could have easily switched him and the guy Catness loves/dates back home and all of a sudden you have a better casting decision and better movie.Aside from a few nit-picky gripes, good movie! Much improved. I grade is somewhere in the ""B+/A-"" range.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
302,brillmongo,Unbelievably stupid in almost every sense,1,3 February 2014,"I have nothing good to say about this film, nothing at all. Catching Fire is a film made by an incompetent director based on a garbage script featuring soulless performances and edited in the most hamfisted way possible.It only exists to appeal to the easily impressionable who mistake poorly implemented themes of violence and romance for depth and to vacuum as much money as possible from the YA audience.The Hunger Games series is an entirely cynical enterprise with not one redeeming value, do not encourage such practices by paying money to see this film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
303,cm_anon76,A play-by-play of the book,8,30 November 2013,"I think it's worth a second viewing, if this subject matter isn't too disturbing for you. There isn't much time for character development in this book adaptation, with the new characters like Finnick, Johanna, and Beetee. There are a lot of new characters. And there isn't much finesse added to the scenes by the director. I guess you could say it's a rough cut. But upon a second viewing I think you'll get a lot more out of it. It moves at a rapid pace. I wasn't thrilled by the acting, but there's plenty of good actors in this one, like Woody Harrelson. Unfortunately Cinna doesn't get much screen time. I think they could have shortened some scenes in the Capitol. This is a based on a book about people, not places. And I really couldn't care less about Donald Sutherland's President Snow character.

304,toni-cooke18,Surprised!,8,11 March 2014,"After watching the first Hunger Games and being very disappointed I was reluctant to watch this one. However, credit where credit is due, they did a superb job reenacting Suzanne's Second book of the series.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with such determination, yet still managed to portray how vulnerable and elegant this woman is.All of the actors did a fine job in this film. I actually followed this better than the book, I finally realise that everyone is trying to keep her alive. I thought it was just normal book cliché, the heroine must live, but it is much deeper than that. The film gives an excellent portrayal of the story.It is gripping and dripping with suspense throughout. And even though it is a longer film it did not drag.The only criticism I have is the ending was very abrupt. I did expect more of a finale so to speak, I had many questions that I wanted answered, but I guess it is to keep you in suspense for the next film.Overall, I gave this film an 8 and would definitely recommend it. I would probably watch it again at some point. Looking forward to the next one!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Donald Sutherland played a believable dictator and Sam Claflin even though he did a good American accent I could some how tell he was British.I haven't read any of the books so didn't know what was coming or is still to come. The plot was good, bringing the victors back to play and how they played it.It was a good film but the trouble was when I was watching it I couldn't stop thinking of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film The Running Man another survival type reality/game show. I don't think you can beat that film yes the acting probably better in this film but your more on the edge of your seat in the 80's classic than this modern version.

306,cbockiii,"Vast improvement over the first movie. Still a little lacking, but definitely worth seeing for $10.",8,23 November 2013,"I bought all of the Hunger Games audiobooks and listened to them several times. I know the story backward and forward. I wasn't thrilled with the first movie at all. I thought it was completely devoid of emotion in what should have been a moving picture. It was just OK.Breathe easy Hunger Games fans, this one was a vast improvement. Considering the volume of material, they did an admirable job of squeezing it into a little over two hours. The whole thing was a still a little rushed, but the important parts were done very well. Jennifer Lawrence was tremendous again and Josh Hutcherson was decent. When you read the books, you have a picture in your head of how the events play out. This movie really did match my ideas of how things looked. The director did a tremendous job of creating the quarter quell arena - it was perfect. The second book required a little more imagination based on the things that happened in the arena, and all of them looked realistic. Considering the amount of revenue these movies generate, I still think they could have put a little more money into the CGI because it still looked a little cheap in parts. But overall, I was pleased. I took six other people to the show this time and all of them enjoyed it much more than the first movie. More time could have been spent on the arena action, but the pacing was much better in this movie.The Finnick casting wasn't perfect, but the guy is a good actor and passed the test. Johanna Mason was a pleasant surprise, the woman nailed her part. I really liked the job she did, and she actually turned her into a likable character. As expected, PSH was good as Plutarch. Woody Harrelson is one of my favorite actors and he was just OK in this one. They can't seem to get his character right...it's just off a little. Liam Hemsworth once again was god-awful, and the romance sequences in these movies are terrible.Overall the movie was solid. Money well spent.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
307,emilyelizabeth1283,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,8,9 December 2013,"When I went to the theater to watch the first Hunger Games movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. I think I was in the mindset similar to the one I was in when I went to see Twilight. I was in college and I went with a friend on opening night, standing in line forever with a bunch of teenage girls dressed in team Jacob or team Edward T-shirts with matching purses. I'd tried reading the books but couldn't finish the first one, yet I was drawn to the core of the story, like so many others. To have a desire, but unable to satisfy it, you circle round the object, follow it, smell it, fantasize about it, always burdened with the knowledge that if you were to give in to that desire you would destroy it. Throw in some sexy actors and shimmering diamond effects and you have created an army of loyal team Edward-ites. It was an entertaining movie, and infinitely more interesting than the books.I was in a similar situation with The Hunger Games. I'd read the first two books, enjoyed the first, lost interest in the second, and didn't even finish the third. But the core of the story was intoxicating, and also very familiar as I'd already been a long time fan of Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale from the year 2000. I was not prepared, however, for the emotional roller coaster I experienced.Like Jude Law's character in The Holiday, I am ""a weeper."" I am moved to tears all the time listening to music and watching movies, and of course I love it. But I was taken aback when I watched the scene from the first Hunger Games movie when Katniss mourns over the dead body of Prim on the battle field. She adorns Prim with flowers and there is a cut to Prim's district where the people watch in horror at the death of this child...and then I began to seriously sob. I can honestly say that I have never had this reaction watching a movie before. I've cried streams of tears before, but I suddenly found myself in this theater putting serious effort into controlling myself from sobbing out loud. And another thing...I wasn't the only one! I could hear a few other girls in the theater, one a couple of rows back and another sitting near the front row. All of us in an awkward state of remorse, embarrassment, and all of us, I think, surprised at being in that position. It haunted me for days afterward as I thought very hard about what it was, exactly, that affected me so. Obviously the subject matter of the film itself was very moving, but after seeing Catching Fire, and experiencing nearly the same thing as Katniss delivers an impromptu speech in front of Prim's family and a mass of people from her district, I realized that the effect was prompted by two very important things. Things that any drama strives for, and which I believe coalesced to full capacity with these films.For years the districts of this earth have followed along the lines of what is expected according to a system in which they've had no say, with no one even daring to stand up to it. The epic event of Katniss Everdeen showing her emotion through placing flowers and crying over Prim's body is at once an action of defiance, and also the shouldering of the entire country's silent rage and overwhelming guilt finally brought to the fore. It is the weight of not just one person but of thousands who come together in a span of a few minutes as something is stirred and awakened inside them. It is a giant tsunami of a realization that crashes through the sheen and illusion of stability and leaves in its wake the dead body of an innocent child. Like Sonmi 451 in Cloud Atlas as she awakens and witnesses the lie that hides the destruction of her own kind behind a promise of new life, or the discovery of the zombie-like underground workers by the privileged Gustav Fröhlich in Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the weight of a thousand heavy hearts is more than enough to move the viewer to tears. Katniss is a representative in those moments of a thousand hearts and minds which move instantly through love, sadness, then pure rage.Moving past these scenes, the films hold countless moments of breath-taking visual shots that achieve incredible effect because they are built up to, like the pulsing and building of chords in a song that prepares you for the explosion of chorus. These moments are paced well with the key points of the story itself and each one creates a statement of purpose which is strengthened and built upon by the previous one. There is a balance of intimate scenes with large, sweeping shots which serves to orient the viewer and give perspective that allows the viewer to both identify with the mind of a single protagonist and also to ride the awesome shows of spectacle. Throw in an engaging triangle of love that begets friction and jealousy and you have one hell of a fun movie.http://funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com/",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

From the chilling first moments to the unforgettable climax, this movie grabs you, hoists you into the arena with Jennifer Lawrence, and doesn't let you go, even after the movie has ended.Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire, in the follow-up to the (slightly depressing) first Hunger Games movie. She plays a teenage girl, still shaking from the trauma of the televised gladiatorial child-killing spree, the annual Hunger Games. The trauma is real on her face, as is every other emotion through the movie.Josh Hutcherson returns (much to the teenage girls of America's delight) as Peeta Mellark, a bread maker, also a Victor from the previous year. His desperate attempts to calm Katniss, befriend Katniss, and woo Katniss are as real as they come. Following them is a line of former victors and supporting actors. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Stanley Tucci as Cesar Flickerman, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, to name a few, are particularly good.And that's not mentioning the film's visuals. From start to finish, the movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, from the sumptuous visuals of the Capitol to the danger and excitement of the arena.This movie will keep you reeling with suspense, rolling on the floor from occasional bursts of humor, and cheering with the entire cast of this, the 75th annual HUNGER GAMES!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
309,marulez,Boring! Why does it have such a high rating?,1,20 January 2014,"This movie does not deserve to be seen even for $1! Save the money people and watch something else.Its high IMDb rating reflects people's easy way to appease but I'm not satisfied that easily. The acting was average, very few effects, the love story between a woman and two men was pathetic, quite similar to that seen in the Twilit teenage vampire movies. All of this raises the question of where exactly did they spend $130 million on this movie? $120 million on advertising and bribing positive reviews and $10 million on the film itself?There's nothing more to say about it other than the high 8.2 IMDb rating being a complete mystery which brings a lot of questions to the table as to are these ratings even real? Does everyone's rating gets approved or was it pre-established according to the payment received from Hollywood?Anyway... just skip this movie, it's not worth it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
310,johnnyinmtl,Very lame,1,23 January 2014,"Obviously I watched this because I have seen the first. After not being too overly impressed in any way shape or form with the first I thought it was good enough to watch the second. My mistake. Or better expressed, my bad.This movie and it's ratings simply show me the powers of persuasion and advertising. Kind of like sheep that love to follow.I did not entirely waste my time watching this however. It kept me amused enough until the wife got home.Watch this if you don't want to be too bored waiting for a loved one to come home.Btw, I couldn't give it a zero with the choices available.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
311,kynick2,Hungry For A Real Movie,3,24 December 2013,"Let me start by saying that I wasn't to enthralled with the first movie but after it was given high praise by one of my co-workers I decided to give it a shot. I don't really know what to say...I thought it was terrible, terribly boring and a waste of time and money. It was basically the exact same movie as the first one albeit with a few subtle changes. I was completely and utterly bored for the first half of the film and completely and utterly bored during the second half although the reasons are different. The latter half was painfully boring because it was painfully predictable. I found myself passing the time by looking for continuity errors, they weren't difficult to spot. for example, there was a scene where Catniss used just about every arrow in her quiver. I made a comment to my date as soon as the fighting stopped....less than 30 seconds later, she had her full stock of arrows. A petty and expected thing for sure but a testament to how bored I was. Character development, you ask...there was none but there was CARICATURE development. I could go on but I could be writing about something more deserving. This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't want to offend anyone but it felt like it was written for 12 year olds. I am truly baffled by the positive reviews I see on this site and others...makes me wish I could be a fly on the wall of some of these folks brain.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
312,brickmoviereviews,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire - Lawrence Heats Up Theaters Once Again,9,27 November 2013,"After the events of The Hunger Games, the pressure was on production company Lionsgate to make a good sequel - which is exactly what we got. With Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark having survived the 74th annual Hunger Games, they are now forced to keep up the image of a relationship for the media. Our two protagonists are on a tour to visit and give their thanks to the 12 districts who lost lives during the Games. With broken families and angered people, the districts are anything but satisfied. With increasing tension mounting between the Capitol and the districts, a rebellion is on it's way.To keep up their public image, Katniss and Peeta are forced to act as if they are star-crossed lovers. Along with this pressure from the media, Katniss begins to stress over having to kill people in the last Hunger Games, and feels she has lost all of her morals.While on their tour, and fighting the urge to express their true feelings about the Games, Katniss and Peeta put on their best stage face, while the people from the 12 districts blatantly express their feelings about the Games. The districts begin to experience outbreaks of violence and revolts. With Katniss being a symbol of hope for the people, the President has a plan to get rid of that hope. Instead of a traditional Hunger Games this year, President Snow has a plan to have winners from each district (one boy one girl) to be reselected and fight in the games. With Katniss being the only girl and Peeta volunteering, they are in another Hunger Games. Yet this one is different than all others.Overall this is a quality movie. Not many franchises can say they have a better sequel than they do an original. However The Hunger Games franchise is an exception. With the phenomenal acting by everyone, and the amazing story, this is one of the best movies this year has seen. Catching Fire is a must see.Rating: 9 of 10 BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
313,bsbulldogs,A solid and serviceable sequel to the Hunger Games,7,23 November 2014,"I had written that the first movie left me with an empty feeling in terms of what was served up as I wanted more than what was given to me and some of the void from that was filled with Catching Fire which is a more than serviceable sequel to the original Hunger Games. Just when you thought that Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)had graduated from the whole Hunger Games experience, think again as they are now thrust right back into the action after completing their little ""victory tour"" in an effort to keep the rebellious population in tow. It was definite improvement from the first film as it is better in just about every way, from improved character development to better special effects and better acting from not just the new members of the cast including Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Amanda Plummer, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright but also from returning cast members Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci. They were all good in their own way but if I had to single out individuals here, it would be Woody Harrelson who gives a better performance this time around as more of his character is explored and gives an understated performance here, Donald Sutherland who thrives on more screen time than in the previous film, showing us that he is the brutal dictator of Panem and that he will get his way, his scenes with the granddaughter are well done and Philip Seymour Hoffman who is always a treat to watch him hone his craft and who plays one of the more complex individuals in the film as there seems to be more than meets the eye with his character but then again, that he is what he is known for, just blending in to his environment like a true character actor attempts to do. In terms of the leads, Lawrence and Hutcherson's chemistry goes up a notch from the first movie as they have shown more matureness and their coupling seems more and more believable as the film goes on. So if this is anything to go by, the sequels should be just as impressive. Positives for the movie include, once again, the chemistry between the two leads, the supporting cast of which some I have notably highlighted as well as the film feeling more mature and darker than the first one and some negatives could be Liam Hemsworth and his chemistry with Lawrence but in fairness I might give him the benefit of the doubt as that may be the fault of the screenwriter here, a couple of characters looking like passengers- say for example the guy who plays Commander Thread as he had shown a little bit of promise but ultimately that promise disappeared. Overall, a solid sequel and worth watching.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

315,mikecart1,A Solid Sequel That is At Least As Good As the First!,9,21 November 2013,"I gave this a 9 out of 10. When the nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes of movie time were up, I was expecting more. It isn't that it ended horribly, it is mostly because I never read the books and this is all new to me. Basically it ended to where the next two movies will be the conclusion.The plot was great but there is some original factor missing because the movie felt similar to the first. It isn't that it is a bad thing but it is more of a Matrix Reloaded than a Terminator 2 as far as original, groundbreaking material if that makes sense.The special effects were extraordinary as usual and the other characters outside the stars were great. Another thing that was missing was that emotional element I guess. While there were some scenes that made you feel for the characters, I think the first Hunger Games made you really care about some of the other contenders.Overall, this movie was a solid 9 and Jennifer Lawrence as usual lives up to expectations. My biggest issue was that when it ended, I didn't think it was over yet if you know what I mean.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Unlike the 1st part, catching fire concentrates more on Capitol targeting Katniss because she inspired a rebellion in the districts. OK, thats how it goes against a totalitarian government, right?!This one is more darker, exactly how a middle installment should be and the climax revealing a smart twist which drives the franchise into Mockingjay. Waiting for that. Visually, Catching fire is double that of hunger games. While i enjoyed the later part of the movie but didn't get through the lengthy setting for an already established characters. should have been more crisp instead of prolonging Katniss relationship. Of course, that is one of the main subplot but still i don't get the length they gave to the relationship. Jennifer Lawrence getting better day by day.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
318,bethany-lewis,Jennifer Lawrence: The Girl On Fire!,10,24 November 2013,"Hence the title, I'd just like to make it clear Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely brilliant throughout this film. She got the audience both laughing and crying, sad and angry, amused and annoyed -- at the right times! Lawrence aside, the whole cast were at high standards, particularly Harrelson, Hutcherson and Claflin. Even the extras seemed to convince you the whole Hunger Games world was real.The film gripped your attention throughout. If you were a fan of the first movie, you are going to love the second! The special effects have improved by a million years, everything seems so much more advanced. The costumes were mesmerizing, if your a fashion freak I'm sure you'll love this movie even more! The arena was done very well. If you've read the books, the arena will have been on your mind before the film. I was asking myself the same question before the film started: what will the arena be like? Well, I can tell you it was fantastic, just like the film was.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
319,GodofGSXR1977,The CGI Games,5,25 November 2013,"This film was nearly 3 hours of an emo Cabbage Patch Doll delivering monotone monologues to other angst-ridden emo teens in strange outfits.But seriously, I was just hoping for the film to exceed its predecessor and it did on some levels but was just flat out SLOW & full of unnecessary and random scenes. They could have cut out several of the pointless character-intros and had a much more powerful film. I mean, do we really need to see a tedious action sequence of people fixing up a man's whipped body? I guess that was for the ladies.Now, I do like how they are going for the 1984-feel, and I realize this is based on a book (I did not read) ... But this film's universe DOES NOT feel lived in whatsoever. Not only is it too reliant on CGI spectacle, but it does not challenge the viewers to any serious moral questions. It has chances to do so but follows the movie cliché of thinking the audience is too dumb to swallow anything besides Black Vs. White, bad guys are bad, good guys are completely innocent in every way, paradigm.And maybe they describe this world better in the book but it is absolutely ridiculous to think that the only thing this society ever talks about 24/7 is the HUNGER GAMES. Really? This prospering government with endless resources and military power spends their every living moments talking about the annual hunger games? Where are the factories or businesses that profit on the war toys or the amazing fashion technology, architecture, transportation, etc? They absolutely push the limits of dumb by pretending this world would be so obsessed with the hunger games instead of other issues in their very vast infrastructure. Just not sure how any society could thrive over anyone when their only concern in the world is the stupid annual game where emo teens kill each other. Okay, the have ""sponsors"" which are not really discussed in this film but they could have at least explained why the only thing on TV is talk about these stupid games. Just saying, it is a paper thin reality, unlike a more detailed universe like Harry Potter or LOTR.5/10 because it had some intriguing action, interesting twists, and funny CGI monkeys. Me like CGI.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

321,williamzim2000,Slow and boring. I fell asleep. Disappointing.,2,24 November 2013,"An hour into the movie, I was looking at my watch, wondering when the inciting incident was going to happen. Turns out, it does not until almost an hour 10 minutes into the film! So, instead of this starting out in the exciting way the first did, it is slow, prodding, with lots of character introduction. But no excitement. So you spend the first hour and 10 minutes waiting for the adventure to happen. I actually fell asleep. This film is lacking in the excitement of the first. When they finally get to the second games, they are not as interesting. I really consider this movie to be a disappointment.I believe the filmmakers so depended on the anticipation of the second games that they felt they could leave the action out, with the sheer waiting enough to hold the audience's interest. It did not work for me. Normally, you need a central character with a goal, moving towards something, to give the story a sense of direction, action and to involve the viewer. But this is not present. The movie just hops around, from one conversation with two people, to another conversation with someone else. Then to yet another conversation with others. And she just meanders around, like Freddie Quell in The Master, rendering the movie directionless and uninvolved. Not a fault of her acting. But her character has no goal, and therefore that through line isn't there, so the movie lags. A surprising disappointment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
322,xx-slay-n-xx,How to Do a Sequel Right,9,5 May 2020,"There are two types of sequels. On one side you have The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The The Dark Knight (2008), and on the other you have Jaws II (1978) and Terminator Genysis (2015). Thankfully, Catching Fire falls squarely in the first category. After an exciting, if not entirely fleshed out, first film, Catching Fire delivers on all the promises of intense action, compelling and intriguing story-line and dynamic relationships between the characters that we were all waiting for. The Hunger Games is a series which, conceptually, deserves a well put-together film series. It is a fun and interesting concept which matures with the audience from a usual action-filled romp into a political thriller which can inspire almost anyone. We got what we needed thanks to this wonderful sequel.In the first film, one of the key issues was the pacing. Many things felled rushed, especially the backstory for the characters which was more or less only seen in brief flashbacks and allusions. The lead up to The Games felt like a formality that they needed to get through so they could show us the action. This is understandable. Everyone wants to see people fighting, not sappy emotional moments from characters we don't even know yet. In Catching Fire, we get a much more fluid arc which gives us the perfect amount of set-up before dropping us into the second installment of The Games, which now have considerably more meaning than just staying alive. In some ways, it is allowed to because now we are familiar with the premises and characters, but the film goes beyond that to an extra level.Take for example the character of President Snow. In the first film, we get only fleeting glimpses of this menacing character (which, I should add, does mimic the books). In the novel, this is okay because it's from Katniss' point of view. In the film, we need an antagonist, and Donald Sutherland puts on a menacing performance in this role. In Catching Fire, we get to see that in its full development. Snow is at the same time fatherly and forbidding, gentle but powerful. He has that same appeal as Emperor Palpatine or Xerxes, ones who have no accountability and all the power and thus are beholden to no law or morality but their own. This comes through perfectly thanks to the phenomenal acting and fitting script.At the end of the day though, we get out of the house and go to the theater for a movie like this because we want to see action. It's not shameful to want to see a bit of blood and battling every now and then. Well, let's just say we are not left disappointed. The Games have taken on a whole new life in this installment, and it feels that way. In the first film, The Games are nearly quaint. It is just a simple scenario for the combatants to do what they will, free mostly from egregious deus ex situations. Primitive and effective. In the sequel, it doesn't just seem like person against person, but instead the heroes versus the machine. It is the spark of the rebellion even before it is fully revealed to us. There are enough tricks and surprises of The Games to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, wondering how our protagonists will get out of this one.Predictability is something that a film can suffer or thrive on. Have too much and your audience becomes bored, but too little and you risk raising the brow too high and going over too many heads. Catching Fire seems to find that perfect balance. I found myself often saying ""Ah, I know what's going to happen here."" and nearly immediately having it happen. I am not saying that as if I have some clairvoyant ability. What this film does it set the scenes up so tightly that you are rewarded for making guesses and allowed to feel like you've won by seeing the action in advance. It is not a cheap tactic either. They hit the mark here by giving you enough to work with but still leaving room for you to be excited and cheer when Katniss does the right thing. At the end, we are given enough of a cliffhanger leave us wanting more from the next sequel.Catching Fire is what sequels should strive to be. It didn't fall into any of the traps of a well-known series with a good original. It took what made the books and the original great and built on them. It helps that the actors seem to feel natural in their roles and with each other, likely the product of much more time working together. A perfect mix of action, thrills, mystery and socio-political drama, Catching Fire is simply altogether a great film. With this trend in the series, I am excited to see what Mockingjay has in store for me.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
323,MediaPanther,A Powerful Adaptation Of The Second Book,8,21 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a powerful adaptation of the second book in The Hunger Games Trilogy. Director Francis Lawrence has successfully taken the franchise and built from the first film's foundations. This was a smart choice as the characters, world and themes of the story are now more fleshed out and most importantly- easier to see (no shaky cam).Picking up almost a year after the first film, Catching Fire finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation to the director) still reeling from her time in the arena during the previous years' Hunger Games- a scare tactic to keep the people of ""Panem"" quiet and grateful to their oppressors as they watch 24 of their children go into a televised fight to the death. Katniss and Peeta (Hutcherson) are the first double winners of the games thanks to their ""true love"". Now both of them find themselves thrown back in to the arena as the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) declares that the reaping of the tributes will be selected from previous winners of the games.Jennifer Lawrence gives an intense, heartbreaking and invigorating performance as the reluctant heroine Katniss. She really seems to grasp the pain and terror Katniss goes through throughout the film. Katniss is not a girl of many words but when you have an actress who can convey genuine emotion without speaking- it doesn't matter.As Peeta, Josh Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right, Epic) has grown from the baby faced baker's boy to a steadfast calm in an ongoing storm, keeping Katniss tethered to sanity. Liam Hemsworth still has minimal screen time as the lovesick and angry Gale, but he also represents the inner turmoil of an oppressed society that has had enough.Elizabeth Banks is stunning to watch as the overdressed and chipper Capitol escort Effie Trinket. Her outfits scream Capitol City Coutour, and she smiles with mad ignorance at the pain and oppression happening in Panem. Yet her face, when Katniss and Peeta are again called to be in the arena, shows a woman torn between her friends and her lifestyle. Jenna Malone gives a memorable turn as the troubled tribute Joanna. She is a controlled manic bringing electricity to every scene she steals. Joanna is a character only an actress as devoted and creative as Malone could pull off so magnificently.Sutherland's power obsessed President Snow is again given much more screen time than page time in the books. This is a smart move for the film. Snow represents the evil of The Capitol without the thrill and glamor of it. He is a man desperately holding on to a system that is bound to fall apart. Sutherland revels in the role and brings his own special brand of creepiness to it. In one scene Katniss and Snow converse across a desk that seems to be the only thing between them killing one another with their bare hands. The tension is high and that is the beauty of two highly skilled actors playing off one another.The film leans a little too heavily on the romance between Gale and Katniss. In the books Katniss indeed cares for Peeta and Gale, but she doesn't really have time or heart for romantic love. She is seen showing affection to Gale and this betrays her character. It does the book and it's message a disservice by hyping up a love triangle that certainly exists but is secondary to the story.Gone is the shaky cam from the first film, though it maintains its moody dark blue and grey color scheme. Shot in Hawaii, the Arena is almost exactly as pictured in the book and all the horrors they face keep you on the edge of your seat until the heart pounding finale. Catching Fire is in no means a feel good film. There is very little comic relief as the stakes get higher and higher and the people of Panem get angrier and angrier. All while the citizens of the glittering Capitol City watch the blood shed and horrific chaos from their comfy seats in their temperature controlled theaters, wearing their colorful clothes and eating their endless supply of junk food seems a little familiar doesn't it? - Christina Kishpaugh www.mediumraretv.org",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Catching Fire is a must see for all people interested in Jennifer Lawrence's career, with her amazingly, emotion performance as the beautiful Katniss Everdeen she definitely puts ""her all"" into the film; or may you're just seeking to embrace into the land of the twelve districts.

326,f-luchetta-785-445724,Disappointed,6,9 October 2014,"the sequel to ""hunger games"" seems almost a remake, a bad remake, of the first movie. Major part of the film has many, too many points in common with the prequel.the rebellion , the dictatorship, are things that deserved to be told more comprehensively , but The film focuses on boring (and very long!) fights already seen in the previous chapter.

327,bobbystryker,The original left us 'hungry' for a decent film - whereas this sequel left us full and wanting more!!! Read on to find out why!,8,3 December 2013,"Did you like the original Hunger Games movie last year? I really didn't. Kids on an island fighting to the death – that's Battle Royale isn't it? Okok, I was still willing to give it a shot but then came the silly story about how the government used the games to remind people of the government's power and control, to prevent any uprisings and rebellions. Not really believable that a bunch of kids fighting on an island would somehow stop adults in the real world from revolting if they wanted to, don't really see how the two are connected at all. To compound things, there was a random love triangle and then the movie finally anti-climaxed in the actual Hunger Game action sequence at the end. It was just a highly forgettable experience and never really seemed believable. So here we are yet again. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen with Josh Hutcherson as fellow Hunger Game winner Peeta Mellark. We are reintroduced to the cold grey world of the future and the iron fist with which it's ruled. Katniss and Peeta are doing the rounds as a celebrity couple; a façade that they had hoped would have ended after they won their Hunger Game. To the contrary, their defiance has drawn the eyes of the nation onto them, including those of President Snow. Through the fear that their defiance would give the people enough hope and courage to revolt, and to put an end to past winners thinking they are above reproach, President Snow decides to hold a special Hunger Game in celebration of the events 75th anniversary. He decrees that for this special Hunger Game, the contestants would be all previous Hunger Game winners.And so Katniss and Peeta once again find themselves in battle. Can they survive a second time round? You'll have to find out!So how does this sequel live up to the lackluster original? Well I'm happy to say that Catching Fire is a superior movie on every level.Everything is fleshed out more, characters are developed and we are shown more of the consequences the Hunger Games have on the society and population at large. I found myself suddenly caring for characters that I couldn't care less for in the last movie. I found myself starting to get engrossed in the unusual dystopia depicted in the movie and feeling genuine concern for the survival of the good guys. I made the connection that I tried but could not find in the previous installment, helped no end by a pretty great action finale. This is by no means a perfect movie. The love story still feels unnecessary and the socio-political significance of having the Hunger Games still remains highly questionable. Additionally, the semi-twist ending is quite obvious and easy to see coming. None of this, however, made the film any less enjoyable.I never thought I'd say this but I'm already looking forward to the next movie in the series.An enjoyable movie even for those who did not like the original.

It had better special affects, to me seemed more entertaining, also they did much better with the camera work ( in the first movie in some scenes the camera work was a little shaky) the basic for all the hunger games is people killing each other. Some other directors could have gone all out with the blood and gore, but this director Francis Lawrence did an excellent job if directing. He never made it to gory but gory enough that it was still intriguing.

Even most great movies to me are perhaps a 9 at best, as there is usually something for me to wish for, or find fault in. There is just nothing lacking here. Catching Fire is BRILLIANTLY well-done. Acting, direction, cinematography ... all flawless or close enough.Think of it as ""inspired by the book"". It follows all the pertinent elements from the writing but then takes everything to the next level. It's all very believable, visceral, and real.

331,feudalserfer,Excellent,8,22 March 2014,"These days I shy away from any kind of violence in movies .... I hate violence in films. There's quite enough in the real world. So, I subsist on a light diet of children's films, costume dramas, rom-coms, historical adaptations of the classics, and SF. But the violence in the Hunger Games: Catching Fire is one of the few films where the distressing violence, cruelty and torture really is justified. It is a brilliant allegory of a modern, technocratic, dystopian society where those in control of all the resources keep ordinary people starving, living in fear, at each other's throats, and diverted by a powerful propaganda machine which contains a modern-day parallel of the Roman Gladiators: The Hunger Games. It is also a story of how even the most powerful regimes, based on inequality and a reign of terror will eventually drive even the weakest, disenfranchised citizenry to revolution. I enjoyed the first movie, but Catching Fire is .... stupendous.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
332,SouthSideChgo,The Seeds of Rebellion Are On Fire...,10,14 December 2013,"***Contains NO spoilers*** Everyone wants to be a symbol of inspiration within some point of their life. However, what if you were pressured into being that symbol against your will ...would you still accept the role? It's the basis for this year's blockbuster sequel to The Hunger Games - The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson returning to their roles as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark, current winners of the 74th Hunger Games in Panem.Life hasn't really changed much for the two main characters within this sequel. Katniss is torn between being ""in love"" with Gale Hawthrone (Liam Hemsworth) and being with Peeta as the second half of the ""starcrossed lovers"" ploy which helped them win the previous games. Outside the Winner's Quarters (where those who have won The Hunger Games along with their families live in comfort for the rest of their lives), life in District 12 has gone from worst to even more worst (if there's such a thing). And it's not just District 12 where life is looking grim but in the other districts except for 1 and 2 as well as The Capitol where those (who can afford it) live the opulent life. Poor Katniss ...she really has it bad. She's now the symbol of hope and freedom amongst the other 10 districts which gains much unwanted notice by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the new Games Keeper Plutarch Heavensbee (diabolically portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Both who plot to bring the downfall of Katniss Everdeen in hopes of squashing the rebellious uprisings in the districts during the victors' Victory Tour. Yet, not everything goes according to plan for President Snow who ultimately decides to pull a fast one by announcing that ALL past and current victors of The Hunger Games will compete in the 75th Hunger Games which is also known as the 3rd Quarter Quell. This sneaky move pits Katniss and Peeta fighting much more than their ""starcrossed lovers"" premise because rules have changed ...there can be one winner in this game. Can they save each other before President Snow tries to destroy them both? Sorry, no spoilers here! You have to see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire yourself to find out what happens to Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and the other colorful cast of characters that make up the fantastical world of Panem in this sequel. SouthSide enjoyed how the movie itself quickly opens by instantly drawing you into the storyline where the first ended without any titles or opening credits (like the previous movie). You immediately get the sense of how bleak things have become not in just District 12 but in the other districts while Peeta and Katniss embark on their victory tour. And even before that, you get the sense of how times have changed for Panem when President Snow makes a surprise visit to Katniss blackmailing her to live up to the image that was created for her ...or suffer the consequences. Not her per se but her family and Gale. Yet, that's one of many problems weighing our young heroine down. She has to live up to the ""chins up and smiles on"" during the glitz and glamour parties hosted within The Capitol as the ever fabulously stylish Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) escorts them around the districts along with Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and the team of stylists keep them looking good. The action before the games (which is played on a new game grid with a unique tropical twist) is somewhat fast pace but not slow because the story within this sequel will keep your interest going. Yet once the games begin, expect the unexpected while Heavensbee upping the treacherous dangers cleverly disguised as a way to kill Katniss in the process. Again, kudos for stealing Lady Gaga's current Artpop style. This reviewer absolutely LOVED the costume designs which were inspired by the late Alexander McQueen used for the sequel ...you can clearly see his work when Katniss wears her ""wedding dress"" (watch for a surprise designed by Cinna). This reviewer is certain that some of Effie's colorful attire could be found Gaga's closet sometime soon ...if not now.Overall, go see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire while it's showing in theatres but hopefully it's not a long wait for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay since the final scenes to this movie will surprise you (unless you read the books).",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
333,aquamanUK,USA television and films and Trains,1,6 February 2014,"Every Hollywood film or television programme that spends money on the CGI to make trains as in this and the first incarnation of the hunger games fail to comprehend and realise that NO ONE operates trains 'bi-directionally' on a single line. Would a freeway be built with 1 lane with traffic going both ways? NOTrains have an UP and DOWN line and if high capacity area's - have 4, 6, 8... 20 etc sets of train tracks. Each with a Dedicated Path. Any one who runs trains bi-directionally would be a high speed crash waiting to happen. In short, it is only logical, but something that with CGI trains on CGI tracks would be not that difficult to show the UP and DOWN tracks. Yes the CGI was scenic for CGI but it is not reality and I continue to see every single Hollywood television programme or film with trains on a 'single line of track'.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
334,FugitiveAmoeba,Bleak.,7,10 January 2014,"""The Hunger Games"" when it came out, promised to be more than just another young adult story thanks to flashes of some tasteful dystopia - a theme that continues and expands in the second episode of the trilogy, ""Catching Fire"".""Bleak"" is a word that springs to mind when describing Katniss Everdeen's latest adventure, and it has all the bearings of a world gone wrong - wanton executions, oppression and a simmering rebellion against the some who rule over the many. Unfortunately, the film spends little time elaborating on these important issues and the world fades into the background of the travails of the reluctant heroine played ably by Jennifer Lawrence who is maturing into a very capable actor with every film. Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and the newcomer Philip Seymour Hoffman all provide great support.The film is long at over 2 hrs runtime, but never drags thanks to some good pacing, compelling visuals and believable acting. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" serves as a bridge between the first and final episodes with little material to offer on its own, but works mostly, thanks to some characters who you come to care for, and more importantly, root for. 7/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
335,jacobclark512,"More Confident, More Polished, and Much Improved",8,4 March 2014,"After seeing The Hunger Games, I wanted desperately to see the sequel, Catching Fire. There was so much potential for the franchise after the first film, and as I liked Catching Fire better than the first novel, I had high hopes. When I heard Lionsgate had replaced Gary Ross with a new director, Francis Lawrence, I was even more excited for this film. In my mind, a new director was just what this franchise needed.I'll start with the script and story, as their quality was largely unaltered from the first film. Even though the series's author Suzanne Collins would not stay on to write the script for Catching Fire, it largely stayed true to the novel. The largest changes mainly highlighted the political undertones of the series in a good way, bringing the Games out to be a more political statement than perhaps Collins wanted. However, these moments between Plutarch Heavensbee and President Snow added a lot of thematic depth and really made the film all that much better. They better explained the motivations of President Snow and kept us guessing about Plutarch and what his actual motivations were. Also, these scenes along with several others make it clear that the film's message is one of overthrowing the oppression of tyranny, making a more coherent film throughout. Overall, the changes made to the script of Catching Fire enhanced, not detracted, from Collins's original work. Visually, Catching Fire has improved from the first film. In the story, the Capitol has spared no expense on the 75th Hunger Games; likewise, the visuals feel and look more extravagant and special. Many times, we are reminded of this fact: many scenes from the arena take descriptions from Collins's book and bring them to life in a magnificent way. This is truly a visual masterpiece, even for its seeming lack of special effects, as it brings Collins's world to life in incredibly vibrant ways. The acting of Catching Fire is much improved from its predecessor. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson feel more confident in their lead roles of Katniss and Peeta, respectively, while the characters that were truly stellar in the first film are given more of an opportunity to shine. Haymitch and Effie both are given the time needed to be considered major supporting roles, allowing Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks to excel in their respective roles. The additions to the cast perform admirably as well, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch. He makes us keep guessing about where his character's allegiances lie until the end, just as his character does in the book. Donald Sutherland is another highlight, as he makes us want to hate President Snow with a passion. Overall, a solid group of actors produces a solid group of performances that seem straight out of the novel. The direction of Catching Fire is arguably the greatest improvement of the film. Francis Lawrence is unafraid to take the reigns and show us how a no-name director can make a splash. He ditches the shaky camera-work of Gary Ross and replaces it with smooth, steady shots from mounted cameras. This is a marked improvement in many of the more exciting scenes, as they seem more coherent on screen. The use of IMAX cameras in the arena also helps us further distinguish it as its own world from the rest of Panem. However, the best part of the cinematography is that it remains very personal, despite it not being hand-held. This makes it never be missed and gives a more polished look to the film. Overall, Catching Fire is a marked improvement over its predecessor. It feels more confident and more polished as a whole, and this extra shine makes it a much more enjoyable film and a better one. This film would probably be placed in my top 20 overall. It's that good. There's not a single bad component to this film. Some things could be better, but they're so small you'll hardly notice. A fine job by the cast and crew to make Catching Fire a very, very good film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
336,ninetails888,Remember Who The Enemy Is,8,19 January 2014,"I read Catching Fire even before the first Hunger Games movie came out and I was impressed with the whole series, not only The Hunger Games. Is the movie adaptation of Catching Fire worthy of the book?My answer is yes. In many ways, it surpasses the book. Jennifer Lawrence, who has no relation to the director Frances Lawrence, breathes life into the character of Katniss and no one could play it better. There is no question that Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast and an amazing actress who has not only proved her abilities in this film and the original The Hunger Games but last years Silver Linings Playbook and the indie gem Winter's Bone. She brings the ferocity necessary to her role but not only brings what is necessary but adds to the character which is the best an actress or actor can do.The supporting cast, lead by Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are all great. The only actress I had a problem with was Jena Malone because although she shined her some scenes, particularly her interview with Stanley Tucci's hilarious game-show host character, Caeser Flickerman, she overacted a lot in the arena. Josh Hutcherson gives a strong performance as Peeta, also.Francis Lawrence breathes new life into the film and although doing a tremendous job, I'm surprised that he was chosen as the director. So many crazy-talented directors were considered such as Alfonso Cuaron, director of this year's Gravity which is thought to be a tough competitor for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Special Effects, Tomas Alfredson, director of one of the best vampire films ever made, Let the Right One In, and Bennett Miller, director of the 2011 success Moneyball and Capote, starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then you have Lawrence, the director of the decent I Am Legend but I have to say, he did an outstanding job. The arena scenes are intense as they should be and the ideas that were only explored a tiny bit in the first are almost completely fleshed out. He made a thought-provoking and insanely entertaining film. My only complaint is the writing. I loved how it completely dove into these darker ideas that were always kind of lurking in the shadows in the first film but in the second one, they're fully exposed but the love scenes between Katniss and Peeta can get pretty cheesy. Luckily, the actors have the skill to make them more bearable.I really did like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and I thought it was better than the original source material and the first film so if the movies go at this rate, this will probably be a film series that many more are compared to in terms of quality.

337,ceidt,The Jumanji Games: The Empire Strikes Backward,6,24 November 2013,"Went for the crowds, stayed for the laughs and the cheers...both of which were lacking severely. The Empire Strikes Back: Catching Fire is a highly anticipated flick for this Holiday season, and one I had no anticipation for, much like with the first installment of THE THANKSGIVING GAMES. Seriously, turkeys will even be hunted. Luckily the Humane Society was standing by for that scene, though.This flick had it's moments. It's 28 times better than the entire Twilight Saga (if you really do the math). One, your excitement from seeing Philip Seymour Hoffman enter, even if your excitement ultimately goes nowhere (no spoiler alerts). Then, the performance of Jena Malone. She's quite the scene stealer, and my favorite part. Even when she was covered in blood, I was hoping for some kind of love-scene. It would have worked given the random nature of story progression. Seriously, just when the first half of the movie makes you almost forget they're going to remake the first film for the second half, you wonder how it will fit into the story. Then another ten minutes go by, and they force it in. Oh, and it's the 75th anniversary of the games. You know what that means. (The Hunger Games becomes the story again. We're thankful for this, because there wasn't much story to begin with).Then Jeffrey Wright, who played Felix Leiter to badass perfection in the James Bond reboot ""Casino Royale,"" saves the day and much of the movie. I even enjoyed seeing Amanda Plummer (of ""Pulp Fiction"" fame). BUT, I really found Jennifer Lawrence to be inconsistent. As good as the direction is, and it is much better than the shaky-cam first outing, I still felt like her work was manufactured. As if she would ""turn it on"" for a couple of look-what-an-academy-award-winner-is-capable-of scenes, and then was bored for the rest of it.See, it's not that I don't get it. I understand that there's a lot more than just a movie trailer bringing people to the theater for a movie like this. There are a lot of movies like these...these days. Made from books that begin a fan base, or as movie studio heads refer to as guaranteed ticket sales...especially when you can stretch three books into four installments of a movie...um...trilogy.My problem with movies ""these days"" is...there's hardly any rewatch value! It may have taken me too many years to realize ""Hook"" was NOT one of the greatest movies ever made, but I was still always waiting for Peter Banning (Robin Williams) to take flight, and that's what I felt like I was waiting for during the first half or two thirds of this flick. I was waiting for Robin Williams to fly...but at least once he does, there's no Tinker Bell scene to slow it back down. (Following me? When the hunger games start, it stays pretty engaging, and it's better than ""Hook"" for the most part).There's a formula. Movies thrive on a formula. Half an hour into the movie, you better have a shark attack or people are going to forget what they're waiting for. Then, an hour into the movie, you have your big twist or action sequence that propels you into the second act of your story. This is when the Millennium Falcon lands on the Death Star (check it, 60 minutes in). NOT when we learn there's going to be a new Hunger Games! That's what we came to see! Then we forgot about what we came to see and were invested in exploring this alternate-reality deal we got going on.What director Topher Allen woulda coulda shoulda done is start us in the jungle from Predator so we could see The Jumaji Games right from the start. Movies don't play like books. The closest we'll see is a Tarantino flick. Right down to the Chapter Titles. Actually, his favorite flick of the past 20 years (since he's been making movies) is a film called ""Battle Royale."" On the American blu-ray is a quote saying ""I wish I made this movie!"" by Tarantino. If you're willing to prove your love for the story of ""The Hunger Games,"" I dare you to watch this Japanese film. Long story short, ""The Hunger Games"" was a creative way to remake ""Battle Royale."" Of course, when I say ""creative,"" I just think rip-off is an ugly word. Plus, an ultra-violent gory Japanese kill-em-all turns into a tween movie sensation much like the Twilight Saga? Creativity.With the sequel, though, we don't even get to hear the Jumanji drums until it's halfway over. And they come in the form of deaths in the games, even though the players don't use the sound of the drums to their advantage. (Katniss falls down in a scene and plays dead. Her killer completely ignored the fact that there were no death-signifying drums, but this conveniently played into a twist a few minutes later, I guess). Anyways, in my version of this film, we should have flashbacked to the oh-so-important details from the book that fans have been waiting to complain about being left out! Alas, here we're back in the alternate-reality-future from the first movie that I've never been quite sure about. How did we get to this? I think I fell asleep during these same scenes from the first flick and missed out on the whole concept.Is this our future or alternate reality? Is it Earth? Wherever it is, thank whatever God exists for the jumpsuits by Adidas for being the saving grace for human sexuality. Without them, I doubt there'd be any reason to procreate in a society with that sense of fashion and style. Woody Harrelson's freaking hair doesn't even fit, and you're not even supposed to take him seriously.Go see ""Ender's Game.""",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I hadn't seen the first film but I was right to expect that I would somehow manage to pick up the great subtleties of the story.Set in a clichéd dystopian future, the film is stodgily paced, cringeingly acted and preposterously conceived. It's yet another example of the tendency for really bad films to resemble computer games - spinning lakes of doom! Giant man-eating baboons! Special skills! One of the many contenders for the most embarrassing feature of this festering mess is the over-stylised attempt to show the decadence of the wealthy section of society. It's been done so much better so many times that it wasn't really worth bothering, especially in a talentless cash-in like this.Having seen and appreciated much better efforts on this theme - the original Battle Royale and the rather interesting 1960s experimental film Punishment Park - the only thing to appreciate about this one was being in a comfy seat as the nonsense dragged on.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Jennifer Lawrence's performance is excellent. Believable, intense, with layers. I've read the books. It's written in first person, from Katniss's perspective only. The movie could develop the story from other people's angles, too. It has so much potential to explore from different perspectives. And it fails to do that. I will have to put the blame on the director. The arena scenes are very disappointing. Less excitement than the first movie. Overall, I am quite disappointed.

This is a spectacular film, which is visually entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The first movie was rally excellent, and when I heard about the director switch, I was worried. I went to see Catching Fire opening night, hoping this will be good. After watching this movie, I realize: Francis Lawrence is a genius. He crafted this movie so well, and kept me engaged through out. The visual effects were outstanding and truly beautiful.

She his lying down in a hovercraft, next to the unawakened Beetee. She removes her breathing mask and walks through the corridors. She hears talking about her losing her mind, when she finds out about Peeta. Katniss storms in to see Haymitch, Finnick and Plutarch all standing. She grabs a syringe and attacks Maymitch for betraying her. She is taken down and god the truth. She was their plan from the beginning. She was the symbol of rebellion. She was meant to destroy the dome. They picked up Katniss, Beetee and Finnick after the games, but the Capital captured Peeta and Johanna. Katniss freaks out and attacks, and is drugged. She wakes up to Gale in front of her. He says that not to worry, Prim and her Mother were saved by Gale. Saved? Katniss questions hi. He says that after the games, the capitol dropped bombs on district 12. FINAL LINE: There is no district 12. Katniss cries and cries then looked at the camera, anger in her eyes and the scene ends.

It's odd because this movie cost 125 million dollars and yet it has all the special effects of a made for TV movie...I just finished watching ""Maze Runner"" which was surprisingly good for what it was, and I was shocked to find out that it only had a $34 million budget. Honestly, there was 2-3 times the action and excitement in Maze Runner vs Mockingjay.I like Hunger Games for a lot of reasons but this movie just dropped the ball big time, it is boring, it adds nothing of real note to the story, and it makes the actors in it look bad.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I actually had to re-read Catching Fire before I saw the movie just to get a refresher of what was going on. The movie is a night and day difference between this one and the first one. The first one actually did look like a low-budget movie that it was, they really spent every penny in their budget for this one.Probably the funniest part of the movie was when Johanna started cussing out President Snow during Caeser Flickerman's show.Probably the one thing that they should've added into the movie that was in the book, was when Plutarch Heavensbee showed Katniss his Mockingjay watch during their dance. Even though it was not added to show the audience that he was part of the Rebellion, it still would've been a nice touch.One thing that really does help to watch these movies is to read the books, or listen to the audio version of it just so you can understand it.

348,sawaugh,Make a film not the book.,7,27 November 2013,"The opening of the film is positive – I felt it had a strong definition and a good tempo. The early stages of the movie did a good job building motives and some of the confusion in the character development really did help build the plot. The film got to a critical point where something great could have been unleashed. Then just when you thought it was about to get good, that something was really going to kick in it didn't. Firstly, the introduction of the other districts characters seemed rushed. Secondly, the fight scenes totalled a couple of minutes, the biggest fight scene with some monkeys (I know baboons) was poorly lit. I enjoyed the concept of Amanda Plummer's character discovering the time zones but this was never developed in the plot (I think the director just wanted her to act a little Pulp Fiction). I did think Jeffrey Wright's character was interesting and needs a little spin off series- how to kill people by science. However, the ending was lazy - the cliff hangers only purpose was to sell the next film in the series. I actually got to the point during the tournament where there were a few little yawns – did anyone actually care when someone died? I wasn't even sad when the nice old bird got cannoned by the gas. In summary – the film starts with good tempo then moves into scenes which are disjointed and unorganised, most running at double speed during important moments. The film could be just so much better if Francis Lawrence had made a film and not tried to make the book.Note, I do still recommend watching the film as its entertaining – and no disrespect to the book is intended in this review.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
349,jwv-823-79715,"Beautiful, action-packed and overall a good adaptation",8,28 January 2014,"From the very start, you can see that Catching Fire is a much bigger production than The Hunger Games. It's a good thing the movie elaborates more on the relationship between Katniss and Prim, because we finally get to see some real feeling behind Katniss' motive, which is a thing that the book lacked. Secondly, I also like how the movie elaborates on the precarious situation the president Snow is in, and how he copes with it. The movie does succeed in portraying an exotic lethal and especially dynamic arena, featuring great special effects, decors and non-stop action. The acting is good overall, although the two TV-commentators are amazingly flat characters, firing off meaningless and dull one-liners and acting ostentatiously. These are not the characters that Collins creates in the book that I criticize however, but the actual clumsiness by which the movie handles them. Actually every public appearance or speech of any kind is very empty of meaning and substance. In a repressive system where twelve districts are controlled (against their will) by a totalitarian regime, the power of propaganda should extend beyond the TV-set. What I mean is that not only the repetition of visual display of power is enough to sketch a believable world. The power of rhetoric is nowhere to be seen, which is a shame.The movie does in certain ways improve over the book (ie. providing different points of focalization) and it does a great job in compacting the book into a consistent two hour movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I was waiting anxiously and as a die hard fan of the books, my expectations were very high. From the very first scene, I was hooked! Jennifer's acting (as usual) was superb while other characters got extended roles too. I especially liked Haymitch and Plutarch Heavensbee the most (RIP Philip Seymour Hoffman)=(The direction was outstanding, with even the seemingly most plain scenes carrying an irresistible vibe. In my opinion, the games were better portrayed here than in the first installment, and the climax was filmed so beautifully that I'm 125% sure those who have not read the book would never be able to guess what's in the store! (okay, so now I'm jealous =P)And that last scene with Katniss turning all angry and vengeful, well, I don't have the words to describe it; Jennifer Lawrence is definitely THE best young actress around at the moment.All in all, a very very good film, well worth watching multiple times. I conclude by highly recommending this to everyone. A bit of a request though, start with watching the first part.. You'll easily get the story then =)Ah man, I just CAN'T wait for the next parts!!! =D",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
351,AudreyAwesome,Katniss begins the revolution....,8,25 August 2015,"The Hunger Games Catching Fire is a great movie! It is thought provoking and raw. I am a fan of the books, and while this is about 75 percent book material, it is still very good.The great thing about The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is that it introduces the themes of the revolution beginning. Katniss has started this and everyone is looking to her. However, she never wanted this. President Snow is not convinced, however, that Katniss has not done this on purpose and wants to get rid of her in the least suspecting way possible. She is pitted into The Hunger Games once again.Also, Katniss also starts to realize where her love (between Gale and Peeta) truly lies.At the end though, she shatters the games forever. Let the take down of Snow and his autocratic rule begin!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
352,adammfeeley,A great sequel,10,24 May 2015,"I don't get why this film is receiving so much hate. It is a sequel that is better than the original. The new director definitely helps the franchise. The whole cast shines: Jennifer Lawrence is great as feisty Katniss, Woddy Harrelson is superb as drunk Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks is superb as the eccentric Effie. The special effects are superb and I especially the arty kind of effect when you see the arena for the first time. The only negative thing I wouuld have to say would be the slightly fast and the cliffhanger like ending which makes you scream for the next one. It is a great sequel and it surpasses the original because the first on e was slightly disappointing. The outfits and costume design is amazing and Donald Sutherland is mesmerising as the calculating as President Snow.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
353,manizeh-78126,Loved it!,10,14 December 2018,"As with the other movies, this installment is one of the best so far.For starters, I love how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) actually become closer as friends. I absolutely love how Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) shows her real personality when she says to Katniss and Peeta, ""You deserved...SO much better."" One of my favorite scenes from the movie is this:PEETA: You see, Katniss, the how whole friend thing works is that you have to tell each other the deep stuff.KATNISS: The deep stuff?PEETA: The deep stuff.KATNISS: Uh oh. Like what?PEETA: Like, um...what's your favorite color?KATNISS: Oh, NOW you stepped over the line.That's probably the funniest thing in the whole movie. Ever. Another funny scene is the one where Katniss meets Finnick (Sam Claflin).During the Victory Tour, the poor old man being shot and Katniss's rage at that event is VERY emotionally disturbing, but necessary to add in the movie. It shows how much trauma Katniss goes through.It sweet when in the train, Katniss wakes up screaming, and Peeta comes to check on her. As Peeta is about to leave, Katniss asks if he could stay with her. He agrees with no question, saying, ""Yeah."" That's nice.One thing I could say over and over again is the word ""eyes"". Eyes tell you everything, and the fact that I could see the fear in Katniss's eyes, the hatred, and the love, too is amazing. If these actors and actresses can accomplish such realistic emotions, they are excellent at their jobs.I like how serious Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) is when he tells Katniss and Peeta instructions to stay alive.In the arena, I like the scene where Finnick used CPR when Peeta ran into a force field. That was probably one of the most sweetest scenes in the movie. After Finnick rescues Peeta, Katniss starts sobbing, saying, ""You were dead!"" She gives him a big hug. It's not disgustingly romantic, but it's the sweet kind.I feel sad when Katniss and Haymitch's friendship turns into hatred for Katniss when she realizes Peeta was captured by the Capitol, and Haymitch had broken his promise to keep Peeta alive and safe.I got a little scared when Johanna (Jena Malone) dug her knife into Katniss's arm to get the tracker out.Lastly, I like how after Gale (Liam Hemsworth) tells Katniss that District 12 had been destroyed, she looks into the camera with shock, which gradually turns into realization, and then into anger. That smooth transition between emotions is a nice touch to the movie.Overall, I love this movie. It's compelling, and the storyline is, yet again, amazingly true to the book.Guide: Not too much profanity. Just once use of ""sh*t"" by Haymitch. Much more bloody and scary than the first movie. Recommended for 14 and older.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

355,seeksSilence,"Boring, over-long, slow and annoying.",2,31 December 2013,"Firstly, I am neither a teenager nor a girl; so I don't fit the target demographic. Never-the-less, I was hoping to be entertained.Sequels tend be by nature an extension of the original and many fail to live up to expectations, and this film fails 'Big-Time'. If you've seen the trailer then you've seen everything except the boring bits.Sequels also tend to be a money-grabbing enterprise to repay those who took a chance on the first outing.Sadly this woeful, boring and extremely slow disaster will make money purely because it's the next instalment of what could be a great franchise.Unfortunately there is far too much crying, hugging and the amount of times the name 'Peter' is mentioned in almost every scene becomes excruciatingly annoying.As for the 'games' these last for all of 15 minutes of a 2hr movie, and is so undeniably dull. I started to hope they would all die, just so there wouldn't be the inevitable third part.As for the 'plot' it's the same as the original only shorter and less interesting.The only saving grace is Donald Sutherland who is deliciously 'evil' and steals every scene. This would be a complete train wreck without him, this is the only reason I have given a 2 star rating.btwThat noise you can hear whilst you're in the cinema, is the world going by while you're wasting your time on this drivel.You have been warned....",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
356,shagrog,Nope. Nope. Nope.,3,21 January 2014,"Honestly, I'm giving this 3 stars because I read a 2 star review and think I'm nicer than that.This is a sequel to a movie that didn't make any sense from the start. Not only that, it contradicts many things that were set in the first one.In my opinion, the story on this one gains points for not having 10 year olds fighting adults. On the other hand, it has 80 year olds fighting young adults, so... We also keep having pairs of contestants. I never got that. OK, yes, every District has two chances, but then they also never win. In the end, the winning District gets nothing and has one less person, so inside the arena both tributes are enemies too and fight solely for their own lives. How can they always fight together when they should be fighting each other?At some point, Katniss has some sort of PTSD attack after shooting a bird. Then proceeds to ace a simulation without blinking.This is one example. This movie, much like it's predecessor and anyone who voted it all the way up to the erroneous rating of 8.1, is screwed up. I never read the books and now I won't for sure. Everyone deserves a second chance, this was it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

You really need to see the first one BEFORE watching this one though, so you know what is going on. It had a good story line, and good special effects also. The only thing I did not like was how it ended!!! Not to give away too much, but it leaves you hanging!! BIG TIME. You have to wait until the third movie to see the conclusion. Stops right in the middle of the action. Now I know a lot of movies are doing this these days, but I myself would have liked at least a little resolution at the end!!

358,originalchc,Awful,1,15 December 2013,"Where do I begin? Of course the length. It's just ridiculously long, without anything that would make the viewer interested in, without principles or a cause. The main protagonist is a dumb little girl who can't even fathom her convictions, let alone hold on to them. She has a guy loving her, working in the MINES, while she's pretending not to like the parade of her and her ""victorious"" boyfriend from the games and all the posh show-off that happens. When the guy opens up to her and shows her that more than *she* matters, and the fact that he won't just run off with her, while all the rest stay in misery, all she can do is just leave. Then there's the other (long) part of the movie where she just starts to create this whole different relationship, while her lover is left behind the screen. What sort of morality is this movie trying to portray? Is this what the western world is moving towards to? Just awful.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
359,garth-mailman,Mid Series Set-up,7,23 March 2015,"This is my critique of the film adaptation of book 2 of The Hunger Games. In a lot of ways it were better to say that the book was the inspiration for Catching Fire the movie. Strangely Gale gets more air time here than he did in the first movie though he barely figures in the book. The Gamemaker's character is written in to move the story along. Alliances are played up and Finnick has a much expanded role, was there a need to provide a strong character to support Katniss and match her strength pushing the wimpy Peetah to the background. This time round most of the killings occur off-screen their occurrence marked by the cannon shots. Much is implied and fore-shadowed in this middle movie of the series. In a lot of ways it sets the scene for the epic battle to come.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
360,chrisdmeads-304-886334,Turns up the heat!,9,21 November 2013,"Continuing the trend of superior science fiction sequels set by The Empire Strikes Back and Aliens, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire outshines its predecessor in every department. Whilst the first instalment was a solid offering, it had some glaring problems such as the pacing, the performances of some of the younger actors and director Garry Ross' use of shaky cam. Thanks to the introduction of new blood in the form of director Francis Lawrence,these problems have been dealt with and as a result, Catching Fire is a darker, bigger and more exciting film.The film begins with heroine Katniss Everdeen dealing with post traumatic stress, which has manifested itself since her and fellow tribute Peeta Mallark's victory in the 74th hunger games. Katniss' troubles are compounded by the fact that she is under increasing pressure from the ruthless dictator President Snow,to continue to publicly put on the act of being a star-crossed lover, in order to put an end to the unrest caused by her act of defiance in the previous games. This situation is further complicated by Katniss' feelings for hunk Gale, creating a classic love triangle. Now you may be forgiven for thinking that the film has all the hallmarks of a clichéd romantic drama for teenage girls. Thankfully the film's surprisingly sophisticated themes prevent this familiar nightmarish scenario from becoming a reality.The political elements of the film contribute to its darker tone,as the societal implications of living under an authoritarian regime are explored unflinchingly. Public executions, torture and media propaganda are all showcased in surprisingly realistic fashion for a 12A, with the presence of stormtrooper like enforcers, adding to the parallels with Nazi Germany. These themes are building very competently towards a civil war type scenario.There are some outstanding performances in Catching Fire from both older and younger actors. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence steals the show as one of the most compelling female protagonists of our time, proving that she can handle indie and mainstream expectations. Male lead Josh Hutcherson gives a far more mature performance this time around, with his and Lawrence's performances being complimented greatly by the work of veterans like Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright. However,the most underrated performance in the film and indeed the franchise,is Woody Harrelson's portrayal of mentor Haymtich. Harrelson brings all the laughs in the film thanks to his impeccable comedic timing, preventing audience members from becoming overwhelmed by the film's darker more serious themes. However, Harrelson's performance shouldn't simply be classed as comic relief, as his portrayal of a fatherly protector to these two young people is also great.The few problems the film has predominantly stem from its action sequences and special effects. Whilst some effects like the poisonous fog and the explosions were excellent, other effects were lacking slightly. As mentioned previously the action sequences were much better this time around in the absence of shaky cam, however I still felt unable to fully engage with the human combat and found one fight with monkeys, to be utterly ridiculous. The remaining problems Catching Fire has lie in the decision of the director and the writers to not explore certain themes further. This is hardly a significant criticism, but it still would've be interesting to explore Katniss' PTSD further and to have seen more of the media circus, particularly since Stanley Tucci expertly portrays a materialistic talent show host.Ultimately, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a much bigger, more adult and dramatic film than its solid predecessor. This second instalment has well and truly cemented the franchises place in pop cultural history, with its excellent cliffhanger leaving me ravenous for the next instalment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
361,guptaraghav-24,Just (Awfully) Plain Surprised !!!.....,1,7 December 2013,"the tile of the movie should be ""re-run of lost"" but with different characters.forget about getting a climax in any part of the movie, it took the movie most of the pre interval to relieve itself from the past (so that it can be in continuation with it first movie) and then it started to create the plot for the movie which took some time of the post interval as well.all of the scenarios presented in the games (which finally began when the people were about to leave) were just modified form of big boss.the action scenes were cut paste from movies like the planet of apes, the jungle, the rundown, lost (as mentioned) etc.just when the plot of the movie was getting thicker, it ended !!! to put it in a nutshell, life is short, so wait for other movies to get released and don't go by the fact that this movie made big bucks, twilight had a similar run (which is still an unsolved mystery *$&!!!).",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
362,harsh-kabeer1,The games continue.,8,16 December 2013,"I had few problems with the first movie based on the trilogy of the books authored by Suzanne Collins. The build up was excellent. They really caught the nitty gritty of the reality shows in all its glory of their hypocrisy. And you could sense that there was something 'orwellian' about the whole setting-the bleakness, the play of power and the dearth of freedom. But then the second half happened and all the tension, all that build up was lost to a very timid climax. And all this for what? So that it could earn more bucks by decreasing the viewers' restrictions. I have never understood the criteria by which they rate the movie for the different ages of the audience. No matter how much you tone down the violence the movie, the content of the story, that is brimming with darkness, still works on the mind painting a vivid picture of gore and violence. So if physical display of violence you ban, how would you justify the mental picture of violence that draws itself as soon as the story starts? The rating system is nuts and stupid. Now coming to the movie that I am supposed to be writing about. The second part in the four installments series does everything that its predecessor does, and improves on it. It expands on its 'orwellian settings' giving a detailed bleakness to the state of the affairs and those little flowers of hope that have sprung in that tyrannical state, all thanks to earlier exploits of Jennifer Lawrence's character. The screenplay is coherent and swift and interesting despite the fact that movie is about two and a half hours long. There are few jarring notes here and there in few suspected character developments and unrealistic motives. But that could be forgiven. The ending is abrupt and that is bit of a problem. The greatest accomplishment of the movie is to sway you into that anger, helplessness and hope of the people as it simmers to the boiling point of a rebellion. And yet it makes you question the thin line between the martyrdom and cold blooded murder for the cause. Like every good dystopian world movie, you would be able to identify the roots of the present in that future. I think it did a pretty okay character study with most of the characters. Katniss is torn between safety of her family and the depressing state of the people, between her love for Gale and affection for Peeta and between the demons of the past and the present. Peeta is a disappointment. He seems to be a sort of breed between a puppy and a sitting duck. And that is a pity when so much depth could have been added to him. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is one of sequels that improves upon its predecessors in every way, but still falls short of greatness. No doubt it is braver than its predecessor, but I wish it could have been bolder.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
363,English-Class2014,It never ever gets boring.,9,21 April 2014,"The movie 'The Hunger Games – Catching Fire' is the second film of the trilogy directed by Gary Ross, which is based on the novel by Suzanne Collins. The book is very gripping and so is the movie because there aren't many differences between the book and the movie and that's why we think that everyone likes it. It's a many sided movie which consists of action and love so everyone can find interest in it and we think it definitely is worth seeing it.In the second part of the series, the main characters Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (‎Josh Hutcherson) are forced to take part in the 75th hunger games and present their districts. But this year is not like the year before because there can only be one winner. In the arena, they have to fight against the other tributes from the other districts but it's different this time because Katniss and Peeta form a group to survive.The love story between Katniss and Peeta is complicated because Katniss actually fancies Gail (Liam Hemsworth) with whom she was together all her childhood. But all she and Peeta went through in the past welded them together and you can see how Katniss slowly develops feelings for Peeta. But Peeta has a crush on Katniss and says that he would rather die than live without her. It's cute that he says something like that because it shows how much he loves her. You can say it's really touching and it is a proof of love to Katniss.All in one the movie is really gripping and worth seeing. When you watch it, it is like you are with them in the arena and feel with them. You don't know what is going to happen and you're feeling scared at some points but then there are scenes in which you feel joy and happiness. We really like the movie because for us it's a movie you can always watch and it never ever gets boring.Lisa S. and Jasmin W.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
364,dylansgabriel,The crowds stuffing sold-out showings of Catching Fire strongly resemble the Capital citizens eagerly awaiting the latest Hunger Games battle.,2,4 May 2014,"After winning the seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return home to District 12. They go back to their old routine (kind of; they now live in the Victor's Village, and possess terrific wealth) with Katniss and Gale hunting together, Peeta baking and isolating himself, and Haymitch getting very drunk. Katniss shows major signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.President Snow pays an unexpected visit to Katniss' house. Apparently, because her and Peeta broke the rules to survive the Games, they have ignited rebellion in the Districts, against the Capital. Snow threatens everyone Katniss loves, and tells her that on the upcoming Victory Tour, her and Peeta need to convince the public they are in love. This will show the Districts that their stunt with the berries was out of love, and not in defiance of the Capital.The Victory Tour is a disaster. The Peacekeepers are murdering and terrorizing innocents, and Katniss and Peeta can only helplessly watch it all, forced to praise the Capital. When they get back home, the violence and repression against the population only escalates. Then the bombshell: for the seventy-fifth Hunger Games (a special ""Quarter Quell"" Games is held every twenty-five years) they will reap from the pool of past victors. Katniss and Peeta are both chosen, and so they are going into the Games a second time, in a new arena, with a murderous batch of past winners.I saw ""Catching Fire"" in IMAX during a pre-screening, and then again in IMAX the following evening, on opening day. I had been looking forward to the film for months, but I kept my expectations low. I am unhappy to report that ""Catching Fire"" is not the success that the reviews would have you believe. In the end it was a really, really lousy movie.When I saw the initial previews for Catching Fire, the teaser trailer and the first theatrical trailer, I was aflame with excitement. But the film itself was flavorless, too tame, too watered down, and too rushed. For a movie about teens locked in an arena, forced to fight to the death... I don't think I saw more than a cupful of blood, drawn by a weapon. This is absolutely unacceptable, because the violence plays a very critical part in the source material's themes: the glamorizing of violence, present day desensitization to violence, and the sensationalism of modern entertainment, among others. But instead of exploring these and other ideas in the film, the gamemakers - sorry, I mean filmmakers - just watered down the politics, and everything else that might have induced too much thinking, to appeal to the widest audience possible. (I was speaking with someone about the film after we saw it, and he put forth the idea that perhaps the thinning of the material was fiscally strategic. He suggested that maybe if the film was too complex, it just simply would not translate well into other languages. Since overseas gross is a gigantic portion of blockbuster film revenue, I thought this was an excellent point, and true to some degree.) Among the other simplifications was the story of the rebellion, and even, just the barbarism of those in the Capital. These two things, detailed extensively in the novel, had barely any depth in the film.The film was severely brought down by the godawful music, which was very poorly integrated. I lost count of the number of scenes, where it would have had much greater emotional impact without the added music.""Catching Fire"" was overproduced and rushed. The CGI in the film looked very phony. But they filmed on location in Hawaii, and had a massive budget ($130 million-double the budget of the first film) so why are huge chunks of the arena made of obvious-CGI? Other than for, say, the baboon creatures, there is no reason why this film should have the amount of CGI it does. The excessive effects took away from the film's authenticity, and feeling. ""Catching Fire"" looks like a expensive, overdone Hollywood product.The same thing that happened with the first film, is happening with ""Catching Fire"". The first film was highly anticipated, released to critical praise, and made boatloads of cash. Then as time went on, people's opinion of the film went down. People started to admit that it wasn't that amazing. Meanwhile, the studio pocketed the profits, and fast-tracked the sequel. The hype for the sequel was insane, and then it was released. The second film received even more critical praise than the first film, had a bigger budget, and made more money. And I can guarantee, time will go on, and once people are not high on the hype, they will realize that the film isn't so fantastic. But it doesn't matter, because the studio is pocketing the profits, and now pumping out two back-to-back sequels....Sound like a familiar pattern? Yes. Yes it does. It sounds a little bit like... ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012)? And so many other ballbusters. Sorry sorry, I mean blockbusters. This happens really, really often, and it annoys me.All one must do to learn the truth about ""Catching Fire"", amongst all the biased, bought-and-paid-for critics, and the delusional mooing public, is to observe. The truth can be gained from simple observation.""Catching Fire"" is slap in the face to any fan of the book. The sad irony of it all is that the crowds stuffing sold-out showings of Catching Fire strongly resemble the Capital citizens eagerly awaiting the latest Hunger Games battle. Meanwhile, the Capital elite - woops, I mean Hollywood - make obscene profit from it all, doing everything they can to make sure the current system stays in place...screenplayisles.blogspot",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
365,simontaylor-44498,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,8,3 April 2016,"The Hunger Games returns for its second outing in this bolder, more focused sequel based on Suzanne Collin's novel.This is another faithful adaption that is much more sure of itself. Donald Sutherland's chilling scenes as President Snow are terrifyingly creepy, while Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) is impossible not to adore. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson are much better utilised as Effie and Haymitch respectively, though arguably the greatest improvement is in the writing for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who finally grows a backbone. The new cast for the Quarter Quell are superb, particularly Jena Malone and Sam Claflin.With the cast having better material to work with, their development is also better to track. Katniss continues her transformation from frightened girl to Panem's Joan of Arc, and the Peeta/Gale/Katniss love triangle tugs at the heartstrings where it could so easily have been clichéd and dull.Visually, the arena is much more epic than in the first movie, and Collins' ambitious creation is brought to life despite its impressive scale.Catching Fire is a big improvement.

Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss, and Josh Hutcherson is great as Peeta. This film is a large improvement over it's predecessor, with less shaky can, and more scenes in District 12. They also toned down the love triangle, which is great. The addition of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee is great, and the story-line is good as well. The Games were portrayed very well, and the action was pulse-pounding. However, the Careers were much less of a threat than in the first film, and Katniss doesn't do hand-to-hand combat at all. Those are the only bad stuff I can think of, since the film was great, and there wasn't a single dull moment in it. All the new tributes were interesting, especially Finnick, Johanna and Beetee.

Even it was less than the first one, but still it was great and I enjoyed it. The performances were great like the first part even I didn't like Liam that much to be honest. Jennifer Lewrance was so great in the movie. I also loved how they showed the real impacts of the hunger games on everything even the ones who win. And as Haymich said there are no winners there are only survivors. There sth I didn't like about the movie tbh which is how it saves the main heros lives always. I mean that you can see that whatever happens the main characters survive somehow. I think if there was more sacrifices with the characters it could've been more excited. As an overall I loved the movie and I am so excited to watch the next one.

368,bb_man94,Francis Lawrence Raises the Stakes for a Stand Out Sequel,10,18 November 2013,"Being a big fan of the books, I went into the Hunger Games: Catching Fire with unrealistically high expectations. With the first being such a success, there was not much else to capitalize on. Some people were even worried about the change of director for the series; but Francis Lawrence has created a film that not only improves over the first in every way, but also makes a stunning transition from book to film. Fans of the novel should be pleased; almost every major event carries over to the big screen. The only thing I was disappointed with was the lack of Haymitch's games in the movie, those were cut. But there is plenty to be excited about. Plenty of dialog was taken right out of the novel, Costumes have improved, (Effie looks better than ever!) CGI was much smoother, a fantastic use of it is during the sequence with the monkeys, and nothing can make a film great without an A-List cast; greats such as Donald Sutherland (President Snow) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Plutarch Havensbee) create an interesting chemistry on screen and Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence steps it up a notch as Katniss Everdeen with some of the best reactions I've seen in a young actress in recent years; no one could have portrayed the girl on fire better than her. Truly this film was a joyride for me; it's explosive, dramatic, interesting, and the series has something for everyone.

369,JBlueNote,Made me hungry for more,8,23 November 2013,"Just got out of the theater an hour or so ago from seeing this movie. Last night (thanks to Netflix), I started what seems like a tradition of watching a movie trilogy's first movie and watching the new sequel the night after. With it and the books (somewhat) fresh in my mind, I was ready for how this one would play out, and I was thoroughly enjoyed. From my memory, I think that the movie actually did about everything that happened in book from chapter to chapter. Usually with these movie/book type of franchises, you sometime see big, crucial parts from the book not in the film, but that wasn't the case for this film.The plot was pretty easy to follow, and felt pretty much the same from the first movie, but this time, the fake aspect to it that the two main characters had to put on in the first wasn't as prevalent as in this one. To be honest, that part almost killed the first one for me even though it was essential to the plot. Thankfully it didn't get to the confusing levels of Twilight. The violence, being part that actually got me into this whole franchise, really kept me in more in this one than in the first. It felt a bit more gritter with more violent and smart ways of killings than that which was seen in the first. It did feel that it sped through the first half again, but it definitely slowed down for the whole reason people were watching it for. I went with a friend who actually wasn't as pleased from this as I was since they felt it didn't focus on the new opponents as much as they kind of did in the first movie. For me, it felt as if they kind of went over them in about the same, quick manner.The acting was great, but of course there were some funny bits thanks to some characters' ways of acting. It was great to see how Phillip Seymour Hoffman played as the new game maker. For some reason, the funny delivery of his line, ""I'm going to hurt her,"" from Mission Impossible III kept playing in my mind during the whole movie, which made some serious parts a little funny. Jennifer Lawrence shined again as Katniss, acting at about the same level, if not higher, as she did in the first. It really felt like this for the rest of the characters, with a slight bump. The new characters were great, and of course my favorite was Johanna played by Jena Malone. She was the kind of character that shocked you at first and really made you wonder where her alliance was after.If I were to rate this movie in terms of decimals, I'd give it an 8.3/10. In my view, it was better than the first, and if you read the books, it's a must see. Can't wait for Mockingjay, which I hear will be a two-parter.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
370,rjromero202,Catching fire has sparked the franchise.,8,26 November 2013,"Well the sequel to the hunger games franchise has arrived (Catching Fire) into theaters, and I have to say it is good. Though this film drags and I do mean drraagg along in the beginning, it does lead up to a climatic moment that does give some chills. It surpasses it's predecessor with more of a emotional roller coaster and mental madness that the world of hunger games presents. It did represent the book more than the first film did but still missed a few key points that I felt should've been put in. I love the creative of the challenges and how it affected everyone in the games and most of all I love Jennifer Lawrence performance. Definitely a movie you should see in the theaters and if it's not your cup of tea Netflix hands down. RJ's Rating: 3/4 stars.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
371,keelan_ruls,A Cetinich Review (#1 - Cathing Fire): Don't Always Trust An IMDb Rating,6,8 December 2013,"To begin with, I've read The Hunger Games books and absolutely loved them. It was thrilling and there was a twist at the end of each chapter, which made you want to read on. The first Hunger Games movie was OKAY - it didn't refer to the book a lot but still had its fair share of action scenes and reasonable acting. I waited a whole year for Catching Fire, and when it came out I couldn't wait to see it - my expectations were high ... even before I saw the IMDb rating of 8.2. I walked into the theatre, took my seat and watched. When the movie came to an end, I just shook my head and left. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire felt very rushed - even for a two and a half hour movie. The first hour was a lot of nothingness (to me anyway). When they got into the arena, I hoped the action would save the movie, but unfortunately, it made it worse. The action scenes were rushed, they figured a lot of the issues out very quickly and there was far too many ""near-death"" moments for Peeta. If there was one thing that saved this movie, it would have to be Jennifer Lawrence's acting. She's very good at what she does, and she is most definitely a rising star in the movie industry. Hopefully the next two Hunger Games movies won't be as bad. Catching Fire was a rushed movie, with boring action scenes but reasonable acting. And come to think of it, I don't think I even saw the title screen at the beginning of the movie to say what the movie was called. Someone sat in front of me said to himself, ""this isn't Prisoners,"" and left. Acting: 7/10Action: 5/10Writing: 4/10Setting: 6/10Overall Rating: 5.5",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
372,victoriasimon86,Girl on Fire Delivers Again,10,22 November 2013,"Catching Fire (2013) Katniss played by Lawrence delivers again as everyone's favorite heroine. She is a favorite heroine by keeping it classy and true never overdoing it, ever. It's just right. She doesn't sexualize herself or pull that act that so many females in lead roles pull. Her strength, conviction and kindness make her the Katniss we love. Her costumes will blow you away as well as how the costumes compliment her mood or vibe in the scene. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth do not disappoint in this continued love triangle. Woody Harrelson with his dry and biting humor nails Haymitch again. The scenes are so compact and so much is happening, I really give credit to the writers. The weirdest thing is that some scenes felt like they left my brain where I imagined them and were on screen exactly as I pictured them after reading the book. Everyone is so true to their characters including Finnick, Beety, Johanna and of course Cinna. If you love the HG trilogy then this is a must see. If you love pretty scenes, great actors and a good story, it is also a must see. I'll check both of those and add that I can't get enough of Jennifer Lawrence right now on screen. The theater was full of girls in Junior High and that makes me happy because Katniss and JLaw are exactly what these girls need to be looking up too. Look out, JLaw is the wrecking ball on more than one parade, thank goodness!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
373,heatherderringer,Probably the Worst of The BATTLE ROYALE Wanna-bes,1,27 June 2014,"Wow, another really bad made Sci-Fi channel formulaic stink-fest. ""Catching Fire"" fails to bring any of the creative fun of the second BATTLE ROYALE movie. This second one is pretty juvenile, coming across as mainly a trite rehash of the first (and a bore). Jennifer Lawrence, who was captivating in the first Hunger Games, is too fine an actress to be treated to such a thoughtless and mundane script. I suppose we will watch the third installment just to see how it all turns out, but hopefully the creators will make a production that exceeds this by-the-numbers disappointment.This movie was given so many great reviews, I expected to be entertained. Instead, I struggled to stay awake. The writing was uninteresting. The acting wasn't great. And even good actors like Donald Sutherland or Woody Harrelson can't make a poorly written script any better. We finally stopped watching about 40 minutes in, when both of us turned to the other and realized we had lost interest a while ago. It was a shallow carbon copy of the first movie, with none of the suspense or intrigue of the Hunger Games. The screenplay was an unambitious bore fest. seems very likely the third movie will rise above this lackluster mess.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
374,ayushagrawaldev,Outstanding,10,29 November 2019,I find lord of the rings overrated. This is the kind of movie that we want in the name of adventure.

376,Karin_Reimertz,Good - but not really good enough,6,13 January 2016,"I was positively surprised by the books. Didn't think I would like them but ended up liking them a lot. My biggest concern before reading the books was that a lot of violence – and violence between kids – would be made into entertainment without the moral, ethic and realistic aspect of such violence. The books does address these questions in a very good way in a way the movie(s) doesn't – probably since the movie(s) has been made for a younger audience (?). (However it would surely be possible to make a movie that does address these important questions without necessarily making it more gore.)So, I could have just written that my main concern with the movie is this – it takes some very serious and violent scenes and makes it into the viewers' pleasure and entertainment, without taking any stand against the moral, ethic and realistic aspect of such violence. (So I'm taking the books into defense here but I have to criticize the movie for it.) It tells a very dramatic and violent story without the morale questions and simply turns it into a series of entertaining events to watch. If we put the morale question aside it ends up being a rather OK movie. We have a bunch of really talented and ambitious actors who really put their effort into the movie – with good results. Lawrence, Hutcherson, Harrelson really ARE their characters and are giving a true and believable faces to Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch. Donald Sutherland is without any hesitation President Snow. Banks gives Effie so much life and colour she should without any doubt get 1,2,3 awards for best supporting role.The movie is filmed and put together a lot better than the first movie, without those long, annoying and not really saying anything- flashbacks. Even unbelievable scenes are made believable and true. The colours, environment and cut are all thought through, sometimes even breath-taking. It all comes together so very well, if it just wasn't for the fact that when you remove the important questions from a book you end up with a good, but not good enough movie. It just doesn't touch you, it doesn't mean anything and it doesn't stay with you. You watch it, and when the movie ends, it just leaves you and after a few days it just fades away, leaving nothing. I would recommend this movie, it is good, it keeps you without doubt occupied and gladly watching it. But it really saddens me that such a good book isn't given a better result as a movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
377,danieljknight,"For a secular movie, it was overall well made",7,9 March 2014,"The beginning was boring, and the boyfriend's make up was too noticeable, I could see the blush. He looks too clean cut for a mine worker, as if the cliché that the audience wouldn't want to see exposed skin etc, but we don't want to see unrealistic make up, we don't want the movie interrupted because we're thinking, ""Why does this guy look like he was modeling?"" and realize we're still back in our boring lives.The beginning is so boring that after having seen it once that I felt nothing when watching it again and actually went to go to sleep. I found the part where Catnip (I know...) freaked out and the music with it to be HIGHLY irritating. The guy she shot should have screamed out, instead he falls like a dummy.The parts of the movie that made it least convincing were:1) The bad makeup on Catnip's bf 2) Catnip and Baker Boy's unconvincing acting in a few parts, specifically the train convo - it happened too fast and was too clean, it sounded scripted and pretentious, not casual, or fearful, like someone might suddenly pop out somewhere and decide to shoot them. Catnip and Bread Boy were too confident. They didn't have butterflies in their stomach like you'd expect for poor ignorants too have, worrying in general, having nightmares of killing people or being hung etc, instead Catnip just has one hallucination and one bad nightmare, and a bad experience with a black guy being killed. Catnip wasn't convincing after going into the house behind her and upstairs and being distraught over the old black guy being killed. The part where Baker Boy dies and she gets distraught was convincing, but there was a hint of fake, maybe because the tone of her skin should have been a little more red and her eyes more red from crying and so on. So a bad make up / effects job there, or lack of it.Some might think Catnip wasn't acting well or too forced in the scene where she's talking with the leader at home, but I think it's just right, since teens and a little older can become arrogant with some great successes, especially if they haven't had such experience before, they get puffed up.3) There wasn't much engaging conflict between the opposing players, or character development, it was as if they were all hidden and the main enemy was special effects as one reviewer implied. They made a movie over two hours long yet you don't get to know anyone else but the usual characters. Kind of a let down. I was hoping to see Tree Girl more since she was so lively, but instead her appearances were fleeting. One reviewer was disappointed that he didn't feel like cheering anyone on because it was a bland movie, and looking back on it, I thought that too, because it was too brainy and too distracting looking at certain ugly characters, and you know who I am talking about if you watched the movie. I don't want to think: ugly woman, ugly nerd guy, weird nerd guy acting like a psychopath, I want to think, ""pretty, but strange girl, likable nerdy guy"".4) It often sounds like characters calling Katness ""Catnip"", I say Catnip because that's what I first thought her name was and it seems easier on my mind to say than the awkward ""Katness"". What a stupid name. I'd accept it more if there was some story behind the name, like when she was a baby she'd say catnip as katness and so was named that, but no, that's just her name with no explanation.5) Peeta's name is soooooooooo annoying. It's like being reminded of PETA and pita bread at the same time! I don't want to think of that crazy ole PETA liberal lady that head's PETA or mocker Bill Maher while watching an epic movie ugh, or pita bread - it's dry and it sucks!6) Is this a movie or a book problem?: Why was there no talk of anyone having previously escaped into the woods? Why no, ""Remember the legend of Tommy Bob, how he escaped and came back and told us there was another village far away, free from the tyranny? Let's see if we can find it? Or is it in the next movie we find out there's a barrier?Now the good: The acting was very good on the part of Haymitch and Effie was spectacular. I never once thought ""It's Woody"" or it was a fleeting thought. I think they over did his hair though, making it so messy it was ugly. Elizabeth Banks should be right up there in popularity with Catnip in most popular actors, because she was a star actor in this movie, the part where she cries gets me, and I'm a guy. I cry with her... And this one pose she does in the movie is so adorable. Why she's down at about 66 in actorworld stardom I think has to do with age discrimination/bias among the younger folk, or perhaps transferring their anger at the elite over on to her in real life since she played one. I think perhaps the weakest link was Baker Boy (Peeta) (is that supposed to sound like Pita on purpose, as in pita bread?). His acting was seemingly wood and emotionless in the first movie and this one. It comes across as psychopathic or like he just doesn't care about life. If it's meant to convey that he's a depressed guy, I never saw it. Maybe it's his eye structure...I agree with one review I read that the ending was too abrupt, there should have been at least some captivating musical point to it, it felt like someone cut the film roll all the sudden and you were like, what, what the hell happened?",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
378,joshuaiyer,"Good film, okay score...",8,15 March 2014,"I just watched the film tonight, and overall, I liked it. Having not read the books or really been in the world of Panem for about a year, it was nice to return there in this film. I thought overall the acting was spectacular, improving upon the first film. The special effects were also fantastic; I particularly enjoyed the ending sequence with the burning arena and falling objects as Katniss is carried up to safety. Again, it's been a while since I read the books, but I felt like they ended it at a good spot that can be continued on for the third (and they're splitting it into two parts, just like everything else!) film.However, I feel that while all these elements were good, I want to focus on the music a little bit, as I have done in some other reviews. James Newton Howard isn't a composer I'm entirely familiar with, having only heard his scores for The Hunger Games (I remember really enjoying his score for the first film, as that was when I was starting to get into the violin and music) and his collaborations for The Dark Knight trilogy. In Catching Fire, Howard reuses the same majestic motif for the Quarter Quell music, which is nice, but it wouldn't hurt to hear something new... Overall, there wasn't as much music in this film as there is in others, but there were definitely moments. The orchestra follows Katniss's emotions during various parts of the film. I liked the moment after Katniss's speech to District 11, with the lush strings and brass, which was immediately taken over by pounding timpani as the Peacemakers started to intervene. There was a burning sense of loss in the music when Katniss was separated from Prim without so much as a goodbye, off on her way to the 75th Hunger Games, and this music was also slow and powerful in the brass. However, in my opinion, there was too little music, and what was there was just okay. It was powerful, but not quite as amazing as some of the other composers I've listened to. However, I really did enjoy the film. Perhaps the Mockingjay films will offer more for the musical score...",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
379,Weasel100,Bored (Almost) To Death,3,6 May 2014,"How can a movie this poor rate so highly? I usually find that my own score for a movie is pretty close to the overall score on IMDb. I don't always agree with the score on IMDb but usually IMDb's score is a balanced one; balanced by those who love a movie and also by those who hate the same one. A few days ago, I watched the first Hunger Games movie (well, the first one with Jennifer Lawrence that is). I thought that one was too long and not all that absorbing but, all the same, I rated it high sixes. I see that this one currently rates 7.8 on IMDb, having slipped a bit in recent times. Not surprisingly I say. Like so many movies these days it is WAY TOO LONG at nearly two and a half hours. Now, I like a good romance but the romance in this one was overdone, terribly clichéd and schmaltzy to the point of nausea. An aside here. I understand and accept that The Lord of the Rings trilogy necessarily involved three long movies, having been made from three long and complicated books. But stretching the Hell out of a small book like the Hobbit to make three long movies (I was bored to death by the first two and won't be paying a cinema admission to see the third one) is going way too far. This is so typical of movie producers these days. It probably goes back at least as far as the Rocky movies (all of which were poor I think) but it's more recently been taken to a whole new level to milk a theme in making several movies and milk the audience that pays to see trash like this. I admit that I've never read any of The Hunger Games books so I really pay can't compare the original concept to the tripe that's been served up to us here. But, tripe it is in my view. I see that the are at least two more Hunger Games movies currently in production. I can hardly wait to avoid those. Don't waste your time with this movie. Save it and see something else instead and try to make that a one off like the recent Walter Mitty which I think was just wonderful.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
380,david-m-b95,"Finally, a blockbuster movie worth the hype",9,23 November 2013,"Superbly acted, amazing visuals, constant thrills and much improved camera work. Catching Fire takes the foundations of it's predecessor's success and builds the ultimate blockbuster. The knockout punch of the year is here.After surviving the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen has unwillingly become a beacon of hope for the people and they see her as their spark, the spark that will start the fires of revolution to bring an end to the oppressive ways of the government of Panem, led by the merciless President Snow. And Snow is not happy. Whilst trying to figure out her own emotions and feelings towards her on screen sweetheart Peeta Mellark and her rugged and rebellious friend Gale Hawthorne, Katniss is placed in a precarious position; will she become a puppet for the Capitol to restore order? Or will she embrace the rebellion and change Panem forever? The stakes are high and one false move could spell doom for Katniss and those she loves.The superb Academy Award winning Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form once again and injects more emotion and passion into Katniss Everdeen. Fortunately, she is no longer having to carry the film through as many scenes as she did in the original due to the superb performances of the supporting cast.Firstly, Josh Hutcherson. Branded as just another pretty face by many, Hutcherson steps out of the shadows and ups his game, Peeta is no longer the wimpy lover boy that many saw him as but he is now a fierce and passionate warrior willing to sacrifice all he has for Katniss. A vast improvement from the first film, Hutcherson really has come on leaps and bounds.Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland improve greatly on their portrayals and become really convincing as Katniss' mentor and enemy respectively. This is probably down to more screen time, we rarely saw these two in the first film but this time round they play much more central roles to the film's plot. Elizabeth Banks is as superb as ever in her role as Effie Trinket, Katniss' chaperone. Phillip Seymour-Hoffman is an exciting addition of star power to the already big name cast, his role as new games makes Plutarch Heavansbee is well done but lacks some of the real intelligence that the character has from the book. Phillip's delivery at times is also a little blunt but he still does enough to create a great character. Liam Hemsworth's performance as Gale is perhaps the only blemish. His character gets more screen time this time around but he lacks any real conviction and comes across as quite bland.Rejoice! No more shaky cam! Francis Lawrence, director, breathes a well needed breath of fresh life into the film. The camera work is superb and very well edited with some super fast cuts which add much more thrill and tension to the film. The scenery is stunning and brilliantly constructed and we get a good look at several different locations within Panem. And the story? Well, if you've read the books, you'll know that you're in for a thrill. But if not, then this film will grab by the neck and never let you go. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jump but most of all you'll never be able to forget it. This film will stick with you for a long time.The perfect blockbuster? Absolutely.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
381,KatieB181997,A step up from the first!,9,16 March 2015,"I was a huge fan of the previous film, The Hunger Games, and the books so I was so excited to watch this and the film didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen and the film is set a few months after she and fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark (played by Josh Hutcherson), have won The Hunger Games. There has been an uprising in the districts due to the fact that were two victors instead of one and Katniss and Peeta have to face these results of their rebellion on their Victory Tour where they visit the 12 districts and make a speech about how thankful they are to have won the Games. After finishing the tour, Katniss thinks she is well clear of the Games until President Snow announces that each living victor from the previous Games will fight to the death in the 75th Hunger Games, also known as a Quarter Quell. Since Katniss is the only female victor from her district to have won the Games, she has no choice but to battle other tributes in the arena once again. Will she survive the Arena again? As much as I loved the first film, I definitely think this one was better which is quite rare as, usually, the sequels are worse than the first film (Kick-Ass 2, Taken 2, and many more) but in this case, the second film was a lot better than the first. I think the Games in this one are a lot more violent and scarier than the first Games as the Capitol are doing everything they can to prevent a rebellion from happening. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the leading lady, Katniss Everdeen, she really understands the depths of the character and shows it. We are also introduced to several new characters, including the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as the latest gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. In one of his last performances he is the perfect casting as Heavensbee, he is exactly how I imagined him in the book. We are also introduced to some new Tributes as well including Sam Claflin as the charming Finnick Odair and Jena Malone as the fierce and independent Johanna Mason. These two pull off great performances. I wasn't so sure of the casting, at first, but my opinions soon changed once I watched the film. This sequel is full of drama and action and ends with a cliffhanger that will make you dying to watch the third. If you love action, then I'd definitely recommend this.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
382,aditya_vashisht,Can't Miss Katniss,7,10 December 2013,"Hype for a movie can be completely misleading (read Twilight). The first of the Hunger Games movies also wasn't up to the expectations. I only remember the blood shed and shaky cams from that one. This time, I wanted to play safe, so I checked out the credits. And they make the new Hunger Games movie quite credible.Francis Lawrence dons the director's hat for the sequel (even the future ones) to make an adaptation that sports emotional depth and consistent storytelling. Who's Lawrence? As a director he's ventured us into the unknown realms with 'I Am Legend', 'Constantine' & 'Water For Elephants' (Awesome, Awesome & Lovely respectively). This time too he brings along his skills for uninterrupted, no fillers and sensitive storytelling. Living in the limelight post their win in the last year's Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are again drawn into the arena to their fright to participate in Quarter Quell. This quarter centenary games involves participation of all living winners from each district. Only this time things have changed. People have found hope against the system in Katniss as a beacon. Her victory is showing sparks of revolt all around. Its only in time we will know how the system reacts.The sequel is an overhaul of sensibilities. The fragility and the vulnerability of emotions among the ones who survived the horror of previous games is among the chief elements that were portrayed genuinely. Academy Award winner Simon Beufoy's (for 'Slumdog Millionaire') script is a thorough exercise in a build up to what will become of the revolution. Comparisons can be made with the first part of Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows which in a similar manner made only the story proceed and build anxiety for the action and showdowns in the sequels.Overall the atmospherics make this movie worth the time. For me, my favorite Hollywood composer James Newton Howard's score supportingly provides the emotional leverage to the scenes. For me it's hard to believe, but I am already waiting for the sequels. Let the Mocking Jay take flight.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
383,kcb294,Eh...,7,16 June 2017,"I enjoyed this movie. I read all the books a long time ago. I hate Katniss. In the books, I only liked Gale. The second book I felt was just trying to keep the hype from the first book. There was no need for a second Hunger Games. She could have went a different way with that. Anyway I thought Lawrence did well like before. Nothing too fancy, but the costumes and locations were good. Above average movie that kept me entertained.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
384,paxdriver,Bone Dry,4,18 May 2015,"Hunger Games 2 is undoubtedly the most trying experience in recent cinematic history. From the unoriginality of naming all their birds ""something-jay"", to the forced use of its symbolism, the entire plot trudges onward without ever taking the viewer with them. Scene after scene features our heroine's throaty, ear piercing shrieks through glass walls, at fog, when she's lost, dreaming, thirsty, swimming, etc etc etc. The whole movie just feels like the same scenes over and over again in a new set. You'll not be won over by the heart throbs, the tears or cries of solidarity. Frankly, you won't care about any of the movie's characters except the few children that offer a line or two. The under 14's in this movie are the only actors that truly deliver quality in their lines, come to think of it. Overall, Hunger Games Catching Fire was a dial tone, and borderline offensive... mentally. All of Hollywood's bells and whistles can't cover the look, feel and smell of a warm, steaming pile of feces. Thank God for endings - oh wait, there are sequels.

385,bjhomeboy08,A great movie but with some noticeable faults,7,26 November 2013,"*I have read the books so this review may be biased.I'll try not to sound like a book snob because I despise people who compare novels to the film adaptations. However, my main problem with this iteration of the Hunger Games series was the pacing. The beginning of the film immediately establishes the harsh circumstances of which Katniss, Peeta, and those of district 12 are forced into. Also it establishes Katniss' complex relationships between her family, friends, and most importantly her lovers, which she tries desperately to balance. However, soon after the main characters have been established the film seems to go into hyper drive as it jumps from a somber moment between Katniss and her family to her and Peeta heading off on their victory tour. And this is my biggest complaint about the film. The film seemed like it tried to fit too much of the narrative, from the novel, into the first hour. But I will give credit to the writers, the novel does contain many heavy handed themes and narrative plots that would have easily made this film even longer. Yet, I felt disoriented when the film would build up one scene and suddenly cut forward and jump to the next. Characters would be introduced without much build-up, and certain shot locations that would be ideal to create tension between characters would only be seen for minutes before the next scene was introduced. But the worst offense was the editing of the dialogues. I'm sure that not many people had problems with the dialogue, however, I was taken out of several moments mainly because of the timing of characters responses. When a character would ask a question it would be answered immediately with an impromptu response that was perfectly delivered, and due to the camera placement it felt like the actors were reading from a test manuscript rather than fluidly interacting with one-another. Again this is probably a personal preference, but adding both the jumping from scene to scene and the awkward dialogue cuts made the film feel like it was playing at 1.5x speed. But the film regains it's footing once the contestants are in the arena. The second half of the film does an amazing job in recreating some of the most memorable moments from the book, and even causing me to squeeze my armrest from the intense action sequences. Also, some of the character development that should have been utilized in the first half of the movie is properly employed in the second half. To wrap things up, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an admirable attempt and a serviceable sequel to the superior first film. Although my review may lead you to believe that the film is disjointed and unorganized, it still maintains to be an entertaining film. It's grittier, more violent, and double the bad-ass Jennifer Lawrence you could ask for. And running at around 2 1/2 hours you'll definitely get your moneys worth and this film is by far the best holiday blockbuster of 2013.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
386,stanley_biggs,"Best book adaptation I've seen. Gripping, riveting stuff.",10,27 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is exquisite and is made so by a strong storyline, great pace, tension and great actors.What impressed me most in the books were the perfectly timed plot twists and how each turn of events consistently tops the previous ones. The book also manages to plant subtle suspicions, fears and ideas in the reader's mind that is just as often helped by what the characters DO NOT SAY than what they DO say. Combine that with the honesty and immediacy with which Katniss Everdeen narrates her own tale in the book and you have your job cut out if you want to bring her story to the big screen. But that is exactly what director Francis Lawrence has done with panache.The movie is superbly paced. Each plot twist and storyline is given enough focus to give the user time to process and appreciate. I dare say it evokes some of the same thrills and shocks as the chapter-endings had when reading the book.Jennifer Lawrence brings perfect life to Katniss as she struggles to adapt to her new status as a symbol of hope. This time around Peeta gets given much more opportunity to play his very central role and reveal his character. The complexity of the relationship between Katniss and Peeta is also explored in more depth and with more conviction than in the first film.Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. The introduction of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee as well as the introduction of some victors from previous Hunger Games adds a great deal of tension to the film.Visually the film is stunning. From the gray military-style districts through to the technicolor over-indulgence in the capital and through forests, each setting contributes strongly to the mood and enjoyment of the film.The film balances a dark mood and action with moments of light humor. It is not devoid of emotional moments that evoke great empathy but manages to do so without becoming sentimental.I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire my highest rating - something I don't easily do. It is one of the few films where, at the end, I stayed behind through all the end credits - Elated, stunned, somehow tired but very very satisfied. I'd say that this is probably the best book-adaptation I have seen in a film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
387,soldier9428,"Visually amazing, and follows book well, but feels like the first one.",7,14 December 2013,"One of the things that first leaped out to me about this movie is it's stunning visuals. The beautiful shots of capitol and the game landscape are amazing. Capitol is sort of like a mix between Las Vegas and Los Angeles with many bright lights with loads of celebrity like influence. Catching Fire also gives you a good connection to the characters. During one moment in the movie, I was rubbing my neck and cringing at how painful certain parts felt.One problem with Catching Fire as a book though is that it feels too similar to the first book. Catching Fire seems in many ways like the first movie shot in different ways with slight plot changes and this makes you feel like the author used this book to milk the franchise rather than actually have more substance. While this is reviewing the book rather than the movie, I feel this is important because one good thing about the movie is how well it does follow the book. Those are however, the original creator's faults and the director has no control over that.As a book this particular story has issues, but in my mind the director and screen writer did their best with this movie and it turned out great.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
388,johntomccarty,I see it and enjoy it very much,10,17 October 2014,"The reviews all said that this sequel was even better than the original. I wouldn't go that far but it is indeed an excellent and ""Catnip"" does not disappoint. In addition to all the movies, I have read all the books and I am impressed with the way that the producer and director stayed fairly close to the books. Not to mention, of course, that Jennifer Lawrence is a top notch talent. The only complaint I might have is leaving the audience suspended, having to wait for the other sequels to come out which is not exactly around the corner. Of course, in order to extend the franchise, they also chopped the final installment into two parts knowing that this was their last chance to keep their audience. I would recommend buying the DVD.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
389,AlexandraBello,Another ending,8,22 November 2013,"I loved the movie but another ending would've been appreciated. I am not speaking of altering the facts and elements for the ending, because I know this movie is following a novel that I didn't read. However, after all that build up, I probably wanted more explanation or a little more closeness between Katniss and her love Gale.Unfortunately I am a fan of Peeta and Katniss, even if I know it's not going to happen.The cinematography was beautiful and the set design was inviting. Even if the world created to depict Panem was set to be dark and cold. The plot was entertaining and the surprise factor kept popping up.I did know that Katniss was going to be inserted in the game somehow and that was why we were watching another movie, bringing all of the victors into the competition was just a massacre plan that only portrayed the evil inside the Capitol's intellectual minds along with the President.I also knew that Plutarch was not legitimately on the Capitol's team but I couldn't explain why just yet. However at the end we audience, discover along with Katniss what is the real plan behind all this mess and nonsense.I think that Donald Sutherland was the perfect pick to play President Snow and I enjoyed the character development of Caesar by Stanley Tucci. I particularly don't follow Liam Hemsworth, because there is some work to be done with his acting, still. Effie was the comic relief, of course, and make the experience more enjoyable; thanks to the brilliant writing which kept all the dynamic in tune, without sounding unnatural.I think this story is brilliant and beautiful, a little unreal but no necessarily that unreal for other times, both from the past and the future. I loved it and I will definitely go watch the next one, since I have so many questions still.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
390,Jayden933,Improves Upon Everything That Needed Improving,9,25 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire improves upon almost every one of the (already few) imperfections of the first stellar movie. Most notably, the intensely dramatic and emotional scenes are better emphasized this time around. Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss is better than ever, though her sister and mother are still lackluster. Hutcherson's performance has improved greatly compared to his first turn. The rest of the A-list cast (Harrelson, Banks, Kravits, Sutherland, Tucci, and newcomer Hoffman) continue to give all-star portrayals. This movie is all around bigger and better than its predecessor. The scope feels larger and the grand scheme of the story is beginning to develop. This movie is darker and more morbid due simply to its story content, and I absolutely love that about it. Again, it was the best possible film adaptation of the book. The main drawback is the somewhat rushed middle section (and some points towards the end). At just under 2.5 hours, I still think they could've added ~15 minutes to expand upon the movie's ideas, themes, and character introductions that happened around that time without turning people away for thinking it's too long. Overall, Catching Fire is one of the few blockbuster sequels that is able to truly outshine the incredible original, and it sets the bar high for two even more hotly anticipated sequels with great promise in their future. 8.9/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
391,moviestics,Better than the first one.,6,23 January 2014,"Review #3.I was not very much happy with the first movie. So I didn't go to see it in a theatre. I saw it on my laptop. And I have to say, it is much better than the previous one.The second installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy, The Hunger Games - Catching Fire is very sharply adapted from the book. The conversations, the scenarios and all other things just work perfectly for the film. The film starts with the victor tour of Katniss and Peeta. They see that things are changed in the districts. Due to these events, somehow, the third Quarter-Quell is designed in a way so that Katniss is in the games again. What happens next is the main plot.Talking about the performances, Jennifer Lawrence is in top form. Others provide good support. The direction is superb. The music is good too. The visual effects bring beauty to the film. At last, I will say that it is a pleasant watch with good suspense, fine visuals and superlative performances.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

After reading the book, i expected much excitement and it literally projected it from letters to screen perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence, is breathe-taking, she totally understood Katniss Everdeen and portrayed her role perfectly. There was never any sense of boredom or a dead scene that would made me take my eyes off the screen. It was good. I can confidently say it is better than the first one. The Hunger Catching Fire has a more cloudy tone and setting and the excitement of every scene is non-stop compare to the first movie. However, the first movie has more suspense and a brighter tone. But i am not complaining, the movie was well done. Inappropriate language however caught my attention. It was not said once nor twice, and on occasions the actor's tried their best saying it and at the same time trying to hide it. Kiss scenes passed the amount i expected. But overall the movie was good, full of excitement, and I recommend for everybody to see it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
393,gurpreet-dusanjh10,Excellent! A great movie with great performances..,9,1 December 2013,This was a great movie. Amazing performance by Jenniffer Lawrence. She was amazing as a Katniss Everdeen. Everyone is so good. Josh Hutcherson is better in this movie than last hunger games as Peeta Mellarck. Liam Hemsworth also good as Gale Hawthorne. Newcomer of The hunger Games Cathing Fire's Sam Claffin is also gives a great in his role (Finnick Odair). This movie is really good. Performances are good. Actions are good. It's visually stunning. Some said it's boring but it's not. It's Great. Go watch it In theaters because it's a good experience guys. It's better on a big screen because action sequences are so good. Some scenes are emotional as well. It's a great adaption of a book. Story is better than first. Francis Lawrence holds it very good and made it one of best movies.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
394,ikissedaguru,BATTLE ROYALE 2 Gets Hacked to s&*t (and not in a good way),1,4 July 2016,"First off, I'm a big fan of the original Japanese version of BATTLE ROYALE 2 (2003). This is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have watched it. When I heard of a remake for the American audience, I thought it would be great and would love to see what could be done with it. I went into seeing this movie very excited. It starts off similar to the Japanese version, but seemed to lack a bit of the eerie atmosphere the original had. The characters seemed a bit more likable in this version, so I started to get a bit more excited about it the further it went.The story then take a left turn and seems very rushed once all of the action starts. The original version is a lot bloodier and contains a lot more violence. This version hints to the violence taking place but never shows whats going on. The ending, which in the original, is the part of the movie that sticks with you, is hinted to, but again, never shown. I recommend that if you do decide to watch this movie, what the original version first. Hey America, if you're going to do a remake, do it properly and don't hack a film to shite!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
395,sheance114,I died watching the book's magnificence re-engineered masterfully on the silver screen.,9,24 March 2014,"I've been a Hunger Games fan ever since before the movies came out. I've read the entire series with no halls barred from day one to day four neglecting my duties as an online teacher that day, and I've no regrets, just pure fascination on the entire series.The Hunger Games movie came out with a blast, injecting a political and showbiz paradigm of a new America called Panem with an awesome movie that garnered 83% fresh in rottentomatoes.com and was followed up by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire movie this year.Catching Fire is a follow up movie telling the aftermath series of events right after the first film and how Katniss Everdeen tries to outrun the trauma she's gotten into and tries to be neutral on the recent spark of revolution she's given to the citizens of Panem and the desperation of the government to kill off that uprising including Katniss herself.Why was The Hunger Games book and movie a trend lately? Because of the unique story of a new dystopian tyrant world ruled by one central successful district called Capitol and the rest are slaves or workers for them. And it cannot linger away from most political transgressions in most countries nowadays; only less showbiz killing and showoffs on cam. Also the addition of the effervescent Jennifer Lawrence who's stunning and down-to-earth celebrity who tries to concisely diminish the usual celebrity ladder to fame which is to look like a skinned doll and try to be delusion in front of the camera: no, JenLaw is not that type, and I can say she is a role model for us human beings who doesn't need to look perfect in order to please everyone.Months ago I've seen and been impressed by the trailers of the movie and how I was not afraid that it would fail me as a fan and how will it be true to the book. And then I've read fantastic reviews from critics all around the world telling how good the movie was until today.Here's what I can say to the movie.THE MIRAGEWhat I love about reading books that'll be turned into movies is for the reason that I want my imagination to be brought to life; when you read something, you promote yourself to an illusionary world where you are the director and the camera man. When I precisely have a vision on a revolutionary epic story and will be translated to the silver screen; it makes me excited.But due to the fact that, let's be honest, an adaptation of a film from a book doesn't need to be exactly what the book says since the true meaning of adaptation is not a Xerox copy; instead, the entire plot is taken into precautionary re-telling of the tale with small modifications but intends not to destroy the said plot.But this one, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire movie is a true manifestation that you could adapt and Xerox at the same time! The movie did not go far away from the book, and still has the essence and contents in it.The mirage of the events of the story inside my mind happens to look SOMEWHAT exactly in the movie! I have to applaud the director, Francis Lawrence, for doing such an amazing job to stay true to the book. Not all scenes happen to look exactly what I imagined, but close to that of the movie, especially the arena.THE ACTINGJennifer Lawrence won a best actress. JenLaw is pleasing to me seeing her acting in all the hurtful emotions displaying a traumatized girl was a bravo.And the rest of the cast were amazing in delivering their characters. I applaud Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played the role of the illusionary antagonist, Plutarch, who, I thought was scary and if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't know that he's part of the rebellion especially when he speaks with Donald Sutherland who played President Snow creating a nonchalant tension in the way he looks and speaks that displayed arrogance and evil-ish look.THE DIRECTION AND MUSICAL SCOREThankfully, they've also changed into a perfect director, Francis Lawrence, who gave out the essence of the book beautifully. It's one of those action packed books that they didn't ruin at all. Instead, they magnify every scene that still captures your attention with strong musical score.OVERALLIn totality, I was beyond amazed by the film and how it was taken from book to the screen with amazement! Not all my favorite books that were brought to the silver screen were this epic. I die watching the book's magnificence re-engineered masterfully on the silver screen.(This review is also seen on my blog, One Setting at a Time)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
396,HeroCritic,Inspired view of a Dystopian future,7,24 September 2014,"This is definitely an enjoyable movie to watch. Interesting plot, action scenes, but also emotional and romantic stuff, (which get a little mixed up to be honest). I would say the main thing of the movie is the female protagonist, everything revolves around her. This actress is quite beautiful and especially amazing was she when appearing at the ""TV Show"" in the Capital. Radiant girl, mesmerizing face, also fit for action and violence scenes! Quite a long movie, that leaves you wanting more, and a sequel follows. I am waiting to see what comes next in the ""Revolution"" against the tyrant, that is coming. Nice. Good Stuff. Will be tuning in for the next movies of the series. And let us not forget the comparisons that can be made with OUR reality and the way the world is heading socially-economically-politically... rings a bell? You one of the hungry?

397,riekondoh-116-326404,BATTLE ROYALE 2 wanna-be,1,11 March 2015,"This is not the worst remake in film history. I have never understood the idea of a remake at all. If a film, like ""Battle Royale"", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Francis Lawrence put nothing of himself into this film.They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as Battle Royale II, and I suspect that Francis Lawrence may have wanted to explore them. Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of the popular Japanese classic. Tatsuya Fujiwara turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor, no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors (namely Donald Sutherland) have that talent stifled.In the end, Francis Lawrence set out to pay homage to a great film. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

While the charm of the first movie was in its uniqueness, this one didn't have that as we've seen much of this before in the first movie. However, this movie more than made up for that in its message.An overbearing president. The need for revolution. The urban capitol vs. the outlying rural districts. To me the this movie is a parallel for what we are seeing in our country today. How more viewers haven't noticed this parallel is beyond me. The love story/triangle is secondary to the above. And the ending is brilliant. SPOILER ALERT! When Katniss learns of District 12's demise, and her sadness turns to anger, it reminded me of when the affordable care act got ramrodded down our throats.10 stars isn't enough.

But one twist doesn't work twice. Either they should've done slow scenario or it was better to change motivation.
BUT!
Everything stays the same including plot twists.
That's why pure characters were really spoiled by this. Who loves whom etc?
The next minus is no background story about characters. It could be really interesting to know more about mentors or other players.
Also the president and his power doesn't look strong at all.
Talking about good points. I think there appeared some good seeds from first movie, I truly loved how Lawrence portrayed changes caused by Games.

I was bored throughout this movie until some unexpected action in the fog scene.Quick open ended ending. Some fifteen plus minutes of credits. They could have used those minutes for the movie but when someone needs to plug all studio execs and provide them with their 15 seconds of fame it is a strong indicator where the priorities of the studio fell.Caring for the characters was also difficult because so little time was devoted to their development.

404,yusuf1976,Hungry for more?,7,5 December 2013,"http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role of Katniss Everdeen in this post apocalyptic sequel to the 2012 Hunger Games trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins. Directed by I am Legend and Water for Elephants director, Francis Lawrence, who has also been finalised for the directing the remaining 2 sequels, Mockingjay 1 & 2, the film has screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn. Josh Hutcherson (Journey to the Centre of the Earth) and Liam Hemsworth continue their roles of Peeta & Gale respectively.The story resumes with the winning tributes of the 74th Hunger Games, Peeta & Katniss about to start their victory tour amongst the 12 Districts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) visits Katniss at her residence and threatens her to convince the Districts about her love for Peeta, in order to suppress a rebellion, inspired by the suicide threat by Peeta and her in the Hunger Games.Along the way, Snow announces the 75th Hunger Games which also is Panem's third Quarter Quell, a special edition of the game, held every 25 years, wherein the past winners have to participate. Here begins another round of guidance by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), competition and alliances with the other tributes, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Clafflin etc and a new game maker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The film does tend to drag in places, both before the games, but I guess the makers wanted to take their time to build the plot, but somehow it still feels that...dragging. The love triangle, becomes more prominent here, with Katniss Rest, the film has its moments once the games are announced. Full marks to the team for creating the world of Panem, of despondency and excess, beautifully shown vide a drink consumed by the people in the Capitol, so it can make them sick, in order to have more food again! Jennifer Lawrence is more at ease here than the first installment. Woody is a treat as the alcoholic mentor. Sutherland always is at his best in a negative role. It is Hoffman who provides the twists in the plot along with his flair. Lets not forget good ol' spicy Stanley Tucci, who revs up the screen with his pearly whites. In terms of character developments, the real progress or change is only in the heart of Katniss, leading to the buildup of the love triangle for the grand finale....where am sure true love will conquer all.The film ends on an interesting twist, sure to create the buzz for the 3rd book, Mockingjay which is being made into 2 parts, a la Potter.

Turn's out I was right; the chemistry between Peeta and Katniss is so beautifully executed out and can I just say all the actors' acting skills are amazing! There is just the perfect amount of action, romance, defiance, comedy, and whatever I'm forgetting balanced into one fantastic movie. The arena scenes are my favorite; the graphics and special effects are just as great. I must say the script was good; there was only like one part where I was getting uninterested, but that was quickly dissolved when the better scenes came in. My ONLY disappointment was the ending because I was so drawn into the movie that the ending seemed so sudden. I felt so empty walking out of the theater. I honestly hoped I could go back and keep watching forever.

The atmosphere is very well designed, the acting is great, and it does a perfect job of drawing you in.The second half isn't quite as flawless. Much like in the first movie, where the extra actors had been picked up from Starbucks and were attempting to read a script their first time, here too many extra characters were poorly done. The majority of ""past contestants"" were completely hollow caricatures of personalities. Basically throwaways to move the plot along.The other problem was that the final plot made no sense. When the ending is revealed it is completely absurd; there were a million reasons it should not have worked. Maybe they explain it better in the book, but if you have not read it, the movie explanation sounds pathetic.

408,tareknabulsi,A Great Archetype of The Hollywood Business,4,8 December 2013,"After a massive let down from watching the first movie, I was surprisingly curious enough to wonder where the story would go in the second. My main issue in the first film was a lack of a compelling and believable story, but I walked in the theater to see this one anyway, hoping the film makers sought redemption for what was so abysmal. It didn't surprise me much however to find that story was once again dry, rigid, and crusted over with garbage, just like a dog turd on a summer sidewalk.The story continues directly from the events following the victory of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in the hunger games. President Snow crafts the two characters towards into public figures, forcing them to positively represent the government to gain more popularity for the hunger games. The movie actually starts out quite promising as we see a great deal of tension growing between the districts and the state. We see the very beginning of martial law come into effect, rebels planning to coalesce, and fear permeating through the characters. It looks very good, until Hollywood decides drop by the scriptwriters' office with another visit. This movie's only purpose is to give you hope of something good and then crush by sending you back to the train wreck of a film we experienced in the first movie. By this point, if you haven't done so already, get ready to kick back and watch the nonsensical onslaught continue. That's right, you're in for another hunger game!About less than halfway into the movie, the viewer is virtually left watching the first movie all over again. The director should have saved time filming and simply cut and paste the first movie in at this point. While the characters are busy killing each other for the second time, it is hard not to hope that we will get some more information about what is happening on the home front. What is the government doing? How are the districts reacting? How are the families of the main characters in district 12? Rather than our questions getting answered, all we get are some more scenes of Katniss and her bow, Peeta falling in love with her for the second time, and poorly developed characters (who we are supposed to feel sorry for) die. Also, similarly to the first movie, we see more attempts of intimidation among the players, chances to win sponsorships, lots of prep talk before the big fight, and a shot of all of the contestants broadcasted in their kooky outfits before they get shipped off to the slaughter house.There are a few things I should probably mention before some fans of the movie do. Not that it matters, but the hunger game in this movie is slightly different from that of the first. In response to the uproars in the districts, the government expresses their displeasure by sending previous victors from each district back into the hunger games. This really makes no difference for the viewer, since we see over 20 new bloodthirsty contestants besides Katniss and Peeta anyway. A few other trivial differences include the new arena the game takes place in. This time, the characters start the fight in the water rather than on land. Also, the whole arena is apparently bigger (even though it just looks like another forest), and there are environmental hazards that occur on an hourly schedule. It really doesn't matter, and it is painful to think that the filmmakers think they can win their audience over with such a frivolous change. In my opinion, the only thing that this franchise really has that wins its popularity is their main cast, Jennifer Lawrence. But that doesn't fix the story. The essence of the film is still fundamentally flawed. It is no different than trying to treat the scent of a puddle of diarrhea with fabreeze air freshener!At one point in the movie, Katniss and her friends contrive a plot to eliminate the remaining contestants. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the plan's execution, she somehow figures out how to escape the arena, and the entire infrastructure collapses. Suddenly Katniss is rescued by a ship, as if the whole plan to escape was coordinated from the beginning, and she requests to return to her home. She and the audience learn that district 12 has been destroyed. The movie ends. A long silence follows until the credits roll along with an animation of the mocking jay pin. Not only is this one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings to a film in the history of films, but the director adds insult to injury as he essentially tells us, ""Too bad, you missed out on all of the important stuff that happened in the real world, and instead, you got to watch the first movie over again!"" Not only do we get a repeat of what already happened, but we are left in complete darkness and miss out of every single detail that could have potentially progressed the storyline. The movie could have literally been cut in half if the whole hunger game was removed, and we still would have gotten the same amount of essence from the story. This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood takes something with a lot of potential and strips it of all nutrients until it becomes as bare as a pile of elephant dung. The film is nothing more than a monotonous moneymaking expedient that deserves to be flushed down the toilet! The only reason why I regard it slightly higher than the first is for the first few scenes of the movie that actually grabbed my attention. In retrospect, that momentary grasp of interest wasn't worth the other two hours of an appalling scam.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

410,mtzmcrchick111,Terrible,3,25 December 2013,"Is the general public getting dumber or what? Seriously an 8 out of 10? I really wanted to love this movie as I really enjoyed the first film. Catching Fire had no fire to it. It felt too slow most of the movie, and then when it got somewhat interesting, it was rushed in like 30 minutes. The ending was terrible, the director and the writer should be ashamed. A true artist actually cares about the work they put out more than about the money. There was no real story to this movie, its more like a transitioning filler movie from the first to the third movie. It was lacking substance and it had no life to it. I think this movie had a lot of potential into being a great movie, but it was ruined. I do however think that the acting was good, and the costumes were great. Overall, I think it was a waste of money.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
411,whuntva,The Best Film of 2013,10,16 January 2014,"How did this get shut out at the Oscars? No film got me talking, made me think more, or left me feeling more satisfied this year than ""Catching Fire"". And this is coming from someone who HATED the book. This film may also be the most relevant to the time. It is a blatant satire of celebrity culture. Our decadent society is always one step away from the Hunger Games. The culture is decadent and violent, but this is the harsh reality of our world. It hurts, but it's so true. The movie also looks GORGEOUS! At least nominations for Makeup, Visual Effects, and Costumes, please. Is it better than the original? Certainly so. And the first one was great as well. This should have gotten more awards buzz.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
412,justimagine93,Redeemed!,10,6 December 2013,"I gave the second movie a very high vote, because it not only patched up the errors from the first one, but even had the actors quoting many lines from the book. To make a very detailed book into a movie is very challenging, and this movie represented the second book good enough. It is all about interpretation, and this movie easily slides between back stories and issues with expertise. At first, I expected the movie to be mediocre, because they didn't really do well with the first movie (it wasn't detailed enough) but instead it seemed like the director knew that they needed to make this a good movie, because there are many fans that adore the books. Some things were changed around and aren't the same as the book. Some examples why the second movie was better: The makeup and computer graphics improved drastically, (example: Katniss and Peeta's chariot costumes did not look like they were consumed in fake fire, it looked like they had sizzling coals as their outfits. Also Katniss's wedding dress was epic.) They changed the cat Buttercup from the first movie to actually look like Prim's cat Buttercup in the second movie. (A small detail, but it was cool that they did so.) Even the acting was a step up from last time. Keep all the cast members and hope that the next movies are just as good!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
413,FavACgM,excellent,7,21 December 2013,"Hey, I walked with a really bad felling to the cinema thought it might be not so close to the book cause the first part wasn't close to the book too. But well i got surprised, it's close and tells every important thing. From many people I heard that the ending isn't good, but seriously it is. I don't know what's wrong with the ending, well it could have ended with a landing in district 13 and a view over an epic landscape with destroyed houses and so on. But instead they chose to show Katniss face and how it turns into anger, it shows that she now want to handle and enjoys the uprising. There's just one thing I need to complain and that's Jennifer Lawrence, well not at all but the scene she was the only person on screen weren't good. In the arena she jumped into the pond to get healed from the poison, it was a little bit too hysterical. I think she's not experienced enough to handle scene likes this.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
414,diegodve-729-161975,Brilliant,10,23 November 2013,"I went to the theater with no hope in my hands. The first movie was good. At first I liked it. I watched it a couple of times but with time I realized the books and the movie lacked something. The movie lacked heart. It was made for the audience and for budget satisfaction. The books were made for the sale (get a love triangle, a very beloved character that dies and a crappy life, mix it all up and you get a bestseller). Things done in the book work, but are dirty and cheap (read Battle Royale, it's the same but much more explained; the government, the ideals, blanks are filled), but in a movie are almost necessary. The first movie didn't encourage great acting (though Jennifer Lawrence did a wonderful job) and maybe I liked the shots (shaky cam) but the dialog and maybe the too little gore didn't encourage a HEART. Shots were missing to explain and give a little more emphasis on the injustice Katniss felt. Catching Fire, since the first ten minutes made me understand it would be BRILLIANT. A PERFECT COMBINATION of DRAMATIC DIRECTOR Francis Lawrence, and dramatic/action writer Simon Beaufoy, and comedy writer Michael Arndt (both writers Oscar winners). They were able to create a heart felt movie, a rush of emotions, I could feel anger, injustice, disappointment, desperation (maybe I'm just too good of a receiver in movies because I just love them), and were delivered flawlessly. ""Best movie I've ever seen"" said my little brother, who hated the first one. All my cousins who had said the first movie was horrible said this movie was better than GRAVITY (I do agree the idea and the story was MUCH MORE developed and less repetitive than Gravity's). I came in to see a horrible movie, but ended up getting a journey (exactly what I was thinking all the movie), with an AMAZING performance from Jennifer Lawrence and even Josh Hutcherson delivered a great heart-felted performance. Sutherland's was AMAZING as well. The cast really out-did themselves. All I could say was ""I can't believe this movie is being so amazing"" while I was watching it. I even blabbed ""better than the book"" because it worked so much better on screen (maybe I just love movies too much). The hard-work was completely notorious, the design was amazing, the CGI not cartoonish, the make-up perfect, Jennifer Lawrence HOT, the sound score was actually really good, and the execution (shots and stuff) was perfect. I do believe this movie, unlike the first one, might get some actor Oscar nominees (not saying it will, saying it has the potential) and might get a lot of recognition. AWESOME JOB CAST. CANT GET OVER THE FACT THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD. WATCH IT.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
415,Scene13,A Fantastic Film: Fixing The Parts Of The Book I Disliked *Must Watch*,10,16 December 2013,"This will probably be one of the shortest reviews I ever write. This isn't a fault of the movie it's just I could some it up with one word AWESOME!!!... The acting? AWESOME!!!.... The Plot? AWESOME!!!... What about the special effects? AWESOME!!!... and this can be said about all the separate parts of this movie. I could leave it there but I will probe a little deeper into why I thought this film so good.It is probably worth noting that being a male, in his mid-twenties, I am probably not the typical ""Target Audience"" if the film is aimed at the same audience as the book then we could assume that this is aimed at young adults and probably swinging over to the female population more than the male. However I thoroughly enjoyed the first film and the second just blew me away. I think this is probably the best book to movie ADAPTION I have ever seen. Yes a say adaption because things have been adapted. Having read the book, I noticed straight away that the introduction to the film was different and there were a few other key points which had been adapted however I do not feel this was a bad thing. For my taste (and this probably goes back to the target audience thing) I found the books played too heavily on the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale, and in fact I felt this rubbed of badly on Katniss as a character!(and bored the socks of me for pages and pages) however I felt the film really played the love triangle down almost making it seem more like a ""work"" relationship and an ""emotional"" relationship and even the blurring of these lines by the end of the film seemed much more realistically portrayed in the film. After all when Katniss and Peeta have been through so much I'm sure we would all be a little confused around our feelings. I feel although this will probably upset the die hard fans of the books, it was a great way to make the film appeal to a wider audience or at least keep a wider audience happy!especially as by making these small changes the essence of the book wasn't lost. the heart of it was still there :) Fans of the first film with love catching fire, it widens our understanding of the world and 12 districts, it brings a new and exciting adaption to the games and it gives us an exciting glimpse into how the world might change in the next instalment that all who have seen this film will be waiting for with anticipation.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
416,cynmonares,EXCELLENT. Better than the book.,10,23 November 2013,"I loved this movie. Initially, I was hesitant to go, but my sister & cousin wanted to see it. I was pleasantly surprised--the movie was much better than the book (in my opinion--I found the book a little too dark/depressing for my taste but the movie was exciting & entertaining throughout, while still being true to the book.)The acting was amazing. Jennifer Lawrence killed it. And the rest of the cast was spectacular.I would give it a 10 out of 10, especially because I didn't expect to like it so much. My cousin gave it an 8 out of 10; my sister loved it and gave it a 9. (Note: this is the kind of movie that will be hard to leave your chair to go to the bathroom, so it would be best to NOT drink too much soda/water.)Overall, the movie was very FUN and entertaining.

417,littlemisscandlewax,Unforgettable,9,24 March 2014,"All those people who are saying it's rubbish really need to get checked out, however I do think the hunger games Is not a film for every body. I am a big fan of the hunger games and no it's not because of the co-star. I watched this film 3 times at the cinemas I thought it was a really good film a bit slow at the beginning but it was a film that left me thinking about it for weeks. This film played on my mind probably because of the ending it really made me begging for more. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress and so is woody Harrelson which made the film even better. The little twist at the end really made me think and made me realize how good the film was. It's a film that looks so fun to be in and a film I can never forget. Like I said it's not for everyone and I do think people are not giving it enough credit. This film was quite sad in parts which really brought on emotion especially with the amazing music by James Newton Howard. Give this film a try because I really can't describe how it made me feel.

The music for Doggie Bag and Yumiko was so much better. People still listen to ""Princes of the Universe"" to this day, but I doubt anybody breaks out their old 45 of ""Hanging Tree!"" LPs The acting was BAD! Especially by the lead female. She was clearly cast in this role because her resemblance to Tatsuya Nanahara, and not her acting talent. The set looked like it came from a 70's kids show, and the costumes were terribly dated and cheesy.A lot of people claim that it's supposed to be cheesy Well that may be. But there is good cheese, and bad cheeseand this was just bad cheese. It's like they set out to make a sf block-busterand then said ""heck with it.""

419,J-Star,"Karl Marx For Teens In The Third Millennium, part II",7,20 November 2013,"Better than the first one.I saw this film back-to-back with the first installment at a preview screening. That probably saved Catching Fire from getting another 6/10 from me because in direct comparison to the first Hunger Games, this is a step up.Again the delivery of the story is flawless. The visuals are even better than the first. The actors have grown into their characters and give rock solid performances. The stale old gender roles we're used to from the 1900's are still nowhere to be found. The perils are more horrible and tangible. The thrills get louder screams from the audience (trust me... my ears rang). And the whole thing is grittier, dirtier and without the sickeningly sweet saccharine from the first film.Story-wise the gloves come off. The People In Absolute Power recognize the Kick-ass Underdog Hero for the trouble catalyst she is and want to rein her in to restore the status quo. The Filthy Rich need their bread and circuses from The Dirt Poor, The People In Absolute Power are hell-bent on giving it to them, and no little waif from some no-name coal mining town is going to stop that... got it, waif?Yeah... she gets it. She promises to play along and makes a valiant effort to do so. Needless to say it falls apart just as quick as you can say ""paper thin facade"".The class struggle is on for real now. After seventy five years(!) the worker class begins revolting against the upper class. The next chapter of Karl Marx's theories of the uprising of the proletariat gets under way. The Hunger Games series continues faithfully as a 2010's version of Das Kapital & The Communist Manifesto For Teens.The upper class fights to hold on. To kill off the troublemakers cleanly the protagonists are once more put into gladiator fights to duke it out to the bitter end. This time around the arena of death has been ramped up to eleven. Instead of just a couple of point-and-click perils, they now come on the hour, every hour. And again The People In Absolute Power screw around with the rules just to keep the poor sods in the games from gaining the upper hand.What saves this film and makes it more enjoyable - even for a non-target-demographic old geezer like me - is that it doesn't spend over an hour establishing the premise. It's already there, which lets you forget about it and just get sucked into the nail-biting action. It works wonders and by the time of this act's finale, I'm on board in a way the first film didn't succeed with.And the thing that makes this film step up truly from its predecessor is that people finally start reacting like human beings. The participants of the games recognize them for the perversity they are and openly show it. The people in The Capitol start hinting they want the games stopped. Even the shameless bimbo - that has been looking past the cruelty of it all in order to drown out the cries of the oppressed with food and wine - starts to show cracks in her make-up. In Hunger Games I was annoyed about the premise that everyone somehow managed to box up their emotions for three quarters of a century and just take it like door mats. In Catching Fire, they are doing just that: catching fire. That is good and makes this film more watchable.Who should see this film? If you saw the first one and enjoyed it, or at least tolerated it, then this one is a given for you. And the cliffhanger glare of determination will probably have you coming back for Mockingjay - Part 1 and 2.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Even then the ending looked as if it was an afterthought, and an incoherent one at that.If only there was a rating of zero, or even negative. It is now right down there with Armageddon as the worst movie I have ever seen.

There was a previous review that pretty much nailed my opinion, but alas, I will be slightly redundant in saying that ""It is all a human drama filled with all of the complexities of the human spirit!"" I gasped, cried, laughed, etc. It really sets you to thinking about the state of things and how humans are driven to survive. Emotional, complex, gritty, grotesque, mesmerizing, adventurous and heart-pumping. I love Jennifer L. Her passionate spirit and quiet strength in this film made it a winner. The rest of the cast holds their own as well. I have not read the book(s), but hot dog, I think I will now. I didn't see the end coming. Very smart. Well worth your time and money.

422,techno_lime28,Very fulfilling!!!,8,7 January 2014,"I am one of those people who didn't read the book but were anticipating the film so much that I feared it was gonna disappoint me but fortunately...it didn't!! Francis Lawrence successfully managed to create a proper movie sequel that kept me at the edge of my seat all the time!! Most people don't know that there is a lot more to Catching Fire than a teen movie with another love triangle and hot young stars. But I think the realistic political references within the story actually make it a very mature film, its what gives the film a lot of magnitude, excitement and suspense. I know why some people thought it was boring; the film didn't focus on chase and killing sequences in the games, but its not about the games anymore, its about the hunger revolution and the tensions the will lead up to it. That's what the film focused on and that's why we don't actually get into the games until half of the screen time. The story was build up smoothly, it takes time in the beginning to take us back to the characters, which are more mature, relatable and complex this time round, thanks to the writers and the acting talents of the cast who were not affected by cheesy stardom. Jennifer Lawrence is still on top of the game, she is so immersed in the role of Katniss that not once did I feel that that's the actress who won an Oscar last year. Josh Hutcherson gave his character huge likability through his subtle performance, it will be interesting to see how he will evolve as Peeta's character changes in the coming sequels. Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland and Elizabeth Banks return strongly and have more emotional roles than the first film. Sam Calfin (Finnick) was a great addition to the cast and Jena Malone's Johanna was a scene stealer!! However, I didn't get enough of Woody Harrelson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, they fell a little short for me.Although the dialogue was a little weak sometimes, it was very smart and witty which infused the dystopian scene of the film with such realism. They added so much more complexity to everything this time, whether you're a fan of the love triangle or the revolution idea, you'll be satisfied either way, especially because the cinematography and visual effects are so much better now, finally!!! What's missing however is a little bit more action, the climax of the film did not exactly reach its peak for me. I think if it had, the film would have definitely smashed the box office longer than The Avengers did. Despite that, it was still very fulfilling and it really deserved all the publicity it was given throughout the year. I can't wait for the next film, hopefully it will top this one!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
423,Tyrel64,Positive surprise of the year,10,24 November 2013,"Back when I saw the first Hunger Games I generally liked it, but I had several concerns about it. It was a bit predictable, at times too slow paced, and (except for Rue) I wasn't 100% satisfied with the acting performance. Still the universe of The Hunger Games seemed appealing enough to check out Catching Fire...And man it was worth it so much! The Hunger Games back at the time didn't make me read the books these are based on - now the first thing I did after getting home from the cinema (from Catching Fire) was to order the trilogy.In Catching Fire everything just clicks into it's place. The universe expands, the story and characters unfold and start to gain their twists, and the slow-pacedness is gone. The movie gains your attention right at the start and it stays entertaining, exciting, thrilling and gripping all the way to the end.The director change to Mr. Lawrence was also a blessing, the scenes are beautifully shot, the pace is very good, and the view is spectacular. Although it's not in 3D and all, things, details (e.g. Katniss's dresses) are designed with an awful lot of creativity and attention. It's obvious that the scenes got a lot of love and care during shooting, and this makes it all feel more natural, real, and very high quality. Combined with the soundtrack which was already great in the first episode, the overall experience is marvelous.The last, but most important thing I also have to mention is the acting performance. Well here it is just brilliant, both by the protagonist and all the other characters, I was left breathless! Among many things regarding the story and the characters, while walking my way out of the cinema I couldn't stop wondering about just how many unspeakable talents Hollywood has, and all they need is just a chance to be able to shine. Here they got it, and they lived with it well.There is however a negative side of Catching Fire as well, which is the fact that it is cut in half the way an ordinary TV channel cuts movies to pieces with all their advertisements. They didn't even have to bother to leave you with a great cliffhanger... There is so much of the story and characters that you crave to know and see, that when you realize you have to wait another year to continue, it physically hurts.In a nutshell: Although unfinised, without doubt this one is a masterpiece in all imaginable aspects!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
424,triskelsey,"Intense, Heartwrenching, Brilliant and Just Plain Amazing",9,23 November 2013,"I was expecting this movie to be good, from the trailers it looked to greatly mirror the book, the effects looked better and everything, I just wasn't expecting it to be SO damn good.It had the raw emotion of Prisoners and the edge of your seat thrill that Gravity brought. In the first Hunger Games, there were times it was a little slow, a little bland (still great though) but this movie managed to keep the action going even when they were sitting there talking. And when they finally entered the ring? Jesus, my heart was pounding and I was gripping the arms of my chair. I read the book but Francis Lawrence managed to make it seem like I had no idea what was coming next. The cast was amazing, superb and made me empathize with every character (except the baddies). Jennifer Lawrence was better than ever in her raw (and at times ugly) emotional state. I believed her, I believed the fear and terror in this movie. The director and the cast made this movie a masterpiece. One of my favorite movies of the year, of the decade.I won't post anymore because of spoilers but if you haven't seen it GO. Totally worth it, plus there's a Divergent trailer (eep!) and everything. I know I'm going to go see it again and again.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
425,katephillips28,Much better than the first one,8,23 November 2013,"Catching Fire had a lot to live up to. The Hunger Games was a huge hit both with audiences and critics and the books have millions of fans expecting the very best from the movie adaptation. There was so much that could go wrong in Catching Fire including the new arena, the expanding love triangle and the introduction of new, key characters. Luckily nothing, well very little, goes wrong and Catching Fire managed to improve on The Hunger Games in every way.I really liked The Hunger Games, as a movie goer and a fan of the books it ticked most of the boxes for me but the effects were less than amazing and some of the actors were not quite comfortable in their roles. The opening was confusing, especially for those who had not read the books and it could have used a little more polish. Thankfully Catching Fire had all the polish but managed to keep all the great things from The Hunger Games. Catching Fire picks up not long after themHunger Games. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are back in District 12 and barely talking to each other, they are both struggling to come to terms with what they experienced in the area. They are trying to get on with their lives but the ever present and often drunk Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) is a reminder that the experience of the games doesn't just fade away. In the capital President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and new game maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are trying to stop the start of a revolution that was sparked by Katniss' actions in The Hunger Games.Catching Fire is a darker and meaner affair than its predecessor. It pushes the boundaries of its 12 rating and there are moments of awful and menacing violence that surprisingly mainly appear out of the arena, as we get to see how very dangerous and disturbing President Snow's leadership really is. One moment in particular when Katniss and Peeta visit District 11 the home of their former allies Rue and Thresh is moving and utterly disturbing. Francis Lawrence has delivered a film that is both exciting and touching. The arena is not the only place where people are fighting for their lives and we are constantly reminded that Snow will go to any length to prevent his control from slipping. It is not always an easy watch.The acting was one of the great triumphs of this movie and is what sets the Hunger Games franchise apart from its other teen counterparts. Jennifer Lawrence seems to get better and better with everything she appears in. Katniss is wounded and defenceless in this and the emotional toll is plain to see in Lawrence's captivating and surly performance. Other stand outs are Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their conversations about how to 'end' Katniss are chilling yet subtle and are some of the best moments in the movie.Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket is one of the most improved characters from the first movie. Here she is given a little more emotional depth and she handles that brilliantly whilst still being her larger than life 'that is mahogany' self. Another improvement came from Josh Hutcherson who has really settled into Peeta's character. I thought he did alright in the first movie but he looks much more comfortable here and manages to hold his own impressively. Catching Fire is where you really start to see what kind of person Peeta is, you see how he is the good in a world full of bad and that really came across well in the movie.Out of all the new characters (of which there are many) it is Sam Claflin's Finnick Odair and Jena Malone's Johanna Mason that really shine. Finnick and Johanna are my favourite characters from the books so I was nervous that this casting might not work. Claflin is perfect as Finnick, he is devastatingly good looking, charming, yet manages to show off Finnick's massive vulnerable side. If you think what Katniss and Peeta have been through is bad it is nothing in comparison to Finnick and Sam Claflin did a great job at brining that sadness to the character. Mason is perfect as the potty mouthed and opinionated Johanna and she has some of the best and most humorous moments in the movie.But it wasn't all perfect. Gale (Liam Hemsworth) was given very little screen time and you never got to see the evolution of that character. It is in Catching Fire where he begins to come into his own but that was muted in the movie version and he was little more than someone for Jennifer Lawrence to kiss. Also I am still unconvinced that Lenny Kravitz was a great casting choice as Cinna. His performance is a little cardboard and because of that one of the moments that made me ball my eyes in the books had little effect on me whilst watching the movie.So many sequels fail to live up to the first movie in the series but Catching Fire is not one of them. It is a million times better than The Hunger Games and is a clear indication that this franchise is not going to falter any time soon.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I like how they showed us the rebellion, how Katniss was suffering from PTSD from the 74th Hunger Games, Snow % Plutarch's conversations, and even Snow's granddaughter. Over all-the film was great. I loved the new arena and how they showed the force field. WARNING: Do not watch unless you've seen the first movie and read the first two books! Please! Still, it's a good film. I liked how Phillip Seymour Hoffman played the role of the new Head Game Maker Plutarch Heavensbee-too bad that Hoffman died way before The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 will be released.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
427,lbrosprod,Visually Stunning. Beautifully Tragic. A Masterpiece. (A book fan review),8,22 November 2013,"I first want to say that if you are a fan of the books, you will NOT be disappointed. Compared to the first movie adaption, this one soars, leaving the other movie to die out in the hot desert sun.I had re-read the book a day before I saw it and so I could see what the critical changes were. I would know every fine detail they let out. I first have to let you know that every book-to-movie adaption can't have 100% of the book in their. Plus, the new director, Francis Lawrence, had to clean up the mistakes the first director left out. Another thing, all the very important and even some parts you might think Hollywood would oversee is stitched together.This has to be the BEST book-to-movie adaption I have ever seen. The visuals, for one, is spectacular. $140 million budget was not wasted, that's for sure! The director packed every little intricate piece possible to make it THE BEST experience us fans could have.The acting was phenomenal. Katniss is a lot more lively now, because Jennifer Lawrence finally understood her character. The whole cast, including Sam and Josh, were amazing. Even the actress who played Johanna Mason, was FUNNY!The music, however, copied the first, because I bought the first soundtrack, so I know every little musical detail. They must have used the same music and added a few more. That was sad. But, it did fit with the scene.The action and suspense will never leave you, as the ending is a cliff hanger, holding on for dear life! (Hunger Games book fans: you won't be disappointed with the ending)Without a shadow of a doubt, this movie, Catching Fire, really does catch fire and immerses the audience in the Hunger Games. I was truly speechless after the film because it was just so beautiful and satisfying. You don't want to miss the best film of the year, and possibly the highest grossing film of all time!!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
428,envision-greater,Better than the first but can't escape some of the same flaws,5,8 December 2013,"I went to see this simply on principle. Having not read the books, and having never really been a movie-goer who jumps on every incoming popcorn munching book-turned-film adaptation train, Hunger Games didn't hold much more weight in my book than Twilight, Mortal Instruments, Harry Potter, or The Lord of the Rings. That said, the first film was terrible in terms of emotional resonance, believable characters, well-written dialogue and action, or anything other than spectacle (which was laughable at times) making it sellable outside the book-buying populace. Fortunately, Catching Fire took most of what the first film did poorly and made it edible. The relationships seem a bit more fleshed out, the action isn't as hokey, and the stakes behind the Hunger Games themselves felt real and in the forefront. It seems like a flipside to some character coin where in the last film no one seemed to bother with the main characters and all development time was spent on the contenders. This time around it's the main characters that hold your attention, and aside from those who aid the main group of good guys the contenders could be interchangeable. And the Games' new gizmos and magic tricks? Laugh out loud ridiculous at times. This is an element they unfortunately did not make better from film to film. What's the point of rooting for an established character if at any moment a button can be pushed and the filmmakers can say ""Bet ya didn't know this was coming. It's cool right? Super cool?"" No. None of your magic little buttons and pocket watch tomfooleries were even remotely cool.The thing that kills Catching Fire is that it's only half of a movie. The film ends mid-conversation, and nothing beforehand preps you for the sudden rolling of credits. This is a terrible way to end any movie, no matter how large the story is. Sure, a lot of the movie was silly, but the time I spent in the theater started investing me in the world the filmmakers had built. Cutting off mid-stream just felt...juvenile.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
429,phoebelim96,SO much better than the first movie!!,9,15 December 2013,"SPOILERS* I felt that the scene when Katniss gets taken out of the Arena by the claw was too dragged out. Whereas scenes like the reading of the card & choosing weapons at cornucopia could have been longer. several things I don't like : waited too long to switch on their outfit during the tribute parade, Katniss didn't wear dresses during the Victory Tour, scenes where Gale and Cinna being beaten were not that impactful, the blood rain didn't soak the tributes in blood, Jabberjay scene could have been more intense, Katniss immediately knew it was a spile, they only got ONE parachute and her black mockingjay dress was a bit plain. Loved that the acting was really believable especially at the last scene when Katniss stares into the camera. there were some funny scenes and exchanges between characters. at the end of the movie, everyone in the cinema immediately started talking, a reaction i never saw before. i think that people who have read the books and feel attached to the characters would understand better what each character is going through and feel more for them. Terrific movie overall and 10000 better than the first movie, The Hunger Games. GO WATCH!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
430,Ussel_Muadib,Hunger Games is heating up,9,2 January 2014,I have read all the HG books and was disappointed with the 1st film missing out a lot of info that was in the book.The 2nd film stays as close to the book as possible (with a few bits missed out) but nothing too drastic. I guess they had to trim the book down to convert it to the screen. It starts with Katniss and Peeta visiting each of the districts (very sad when going to Rue's district) but before they know it they are then both thrown back into the arena.Some excellent acting and nice to see Peeta and Katniss working with others in a team rather than each to their own.We learn a little bit about District 13 and the film has a heck of a cliff hanger (roll on Mockingjay!) Good job to all and cant wait for the next installment.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
431,Gerryt22,Another example of a sequel that's far better,9,26 August 2014,"The first Hunger Games, in my honest opinion, was very disappointing to me. I felt that the direction was lacking, it didn't feel like it's own world and thus it felt like I was watching a ton of people play dress up, and the love triangle overshadowed the main plot. To sum it all up I thought the first film tried too hard to be like Twilight. Catching Fire comes along and everything that I felt went wrong in the first film was improved upon in this stellar sequel. The directing was on point and very well paced, the world felt BIG and also felt as if I were in this rich looking world, and, most importantly, the love triangle, even though still present, wasn't as distracting as the previous installment. Something I will never bash about with the first film is how well the acting was and in this sequel it gets even better. Jennifer Lawrence plays on of the most believable film heroes in recent years. A character with such depth and emotion, Katniss is one unforgettable character. At first I thought this series was going to be another Twilight. The lacking first installment worried me but now after viewing Catching Fire I'm now confident that, under Francis Lawrence's direction, the final sequels with be something special.8/10-Gerry T",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
432,ipseclewis,This is what it took to draw me into the series,9,6 February 2015,"I'll be honest, as much as I enjoyed Hunger Games, I didn't feel any real motivation to keep chasing after the rest of the series. I was distracted with the Marvel movies and the Hobbit movies already. My husband insisted on it, and I'm so very glad he did.There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said in numerous other reviews. The acting was incredible, the plot kept me on the edge of my seat, and the cinematography was breath-taking. Suddenly, HG had a brand new fan, and I simply couldn't wait to see more. The next day we were in theaters to see Mockingjay Part 1. I continue to be drawn in more and more as I start to wonder, how long before our own world is like this? How far will people be willing to let the governments go before they finally make the sacrifices that need to be made for the change they so long for?",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
433,smithannasmith333,I liked it,8,23 November 2013,"I really liked this movie, it captured me in every way. The main things that made this movie good was the work of the actors and suspense of the story. Like the characters in the movie, the audience does not know what happens next, what comes out from behind the next corner. Even though it was a sci-fi movie, actors made me believe all situations they were in, their reactions and emotions were believable. The visual side was good as well, but without the work of the actors it would not have held up the movie. I watched at the same week Gravity with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, also a visually stunning sci-fi film. But in the last one the work of the actors did not support the great visuals, I think Jennifer Laurence and his co-star (who played Peeta) would have done a better job in this make-believe sci-fi situation. Catching fire is definitely worth of watching.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

There's no other way to put it. It was an extremely balanced film, with frequent references to the book and it depicted the book's events perfectly.The cast was impeccably chose. The characters (such as Finnick, Mags etc.)matched descriptions from the book and also matched what I depicted them to be while reading the book.If there was one improvement I need to say, it must be the CGI. Compared to films such as the Harry Potter films and The Hobbit/Desolation of Smaug, it was a bit naff. However, the effects were still amazing and the film was an overall success. I really hope Mockingjay lives up to my expectations.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
435,irmddj,The Hunger Games: Catching Z's,3,4 August 2014,"Watching the second installment of the Hunger Games saga is like watching the fifth Harry Potter or the second Lord of the Rings movie. Annoyingly drawn-out, more of the same, not really worth the time save for a few important details which get used later on. Nothing really happens, it's all just gearing up for a grand finale which you know is coming, and which will pretty much rewrite the rules anyway. Yes, the setting feels more natural. Yes, the Games are deadlier than ever. There's more futuristic gizmos like... forcefields! Yes, there is more more mature character depiction. But do we really need to *see* all this? From the first movie it was already clear that Panem's government is a nasty and callous dictatorship which does not shirk away from sadism (in the form of the Games themselves by forcing adolescents to compete). The patterns of repression are boringly stereotypical, complete with anonymous masked soldiers with big sticks and military hardliners who have testosterone for blood. The entire movie could have been reduced to, say, Katniss and Peeta holding too many revolutionary speeches during their victors' tour; and Snow then (in a mildly interesting twist) accidentally killing Primrose, setting off the revolution. The effect is the same compared to what happens in the actual movie, but it only takes 15 to 20 minutes of your time instead of a gruelling 146. But then the audience wouldn't get to fawn at length over a good-looking and sportive natural female beauty, would they?I am reminded of Paul Verhoeven's The Running Man which I saw a long, long time ago. The Hunger Games are in many ways strikingly similar... and although The Running Man isn't perfect either, it at least gets one thing very right: over and done with in a single movie. And now I hear that the third movie in the Hunger saga is to be released in two parts. Yay. Why have the audience pay once for a story when you can get them to pay four times, eh, Mr Marketeer?Really, only see this at home. If at all. Or read the book—which by the way I haven't.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

438,gvb,Disappointing sequel,5,7 December 2013,Just like some others here I was waiting for this movie almost a year. When I left the cinema it was with a unhappy feeling. The movie was very slow and took too long. The characters where superficially and the story ended abruptly. On the positive side I noticed the good acting of the main characters. There where some beautiful scene's on the tour their took around the different districts and the speeches they gave. But I never felt involved in the story in this film. It seemed a summary of facts with no real consistency. The background of the other participants in the 75th Hunger Games was not elaborated. I don't understand that this movie got and 8!,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

When you gonna see the movie put yourself in the place of watchers of the 75th annual hunger games, and then tell me, please, would you keep watching totally orchestrated show like this. I think this is major psychological flaw in the book and in this movie. Don't get me wrong,this movie is not the worst sequel ever produced, but still slower than original first movie. Love triangle is just pitiful, poor Peeta I don't believe that you in love with the girl and I will never do so. Too many still, emotionless faces on the screen, actually real acting you can see in the last 10 seconds before titles.This movie maybe catches a spark of something, but definitely not a fire.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
440,JosephRobinson414,Sequel=Original,6,30 November 2013,"First off, I'm going to review the film, not the book seeing as how this is a film page discussing the merit of a movie, not a book written for children.As far as doing a sequel to the Hunger Games, it is a money grab. However, in sequence this film expands on the original and defines the conflict between the protagonists and the antagonists fairly well. The actors in the film seem engaged and poised to allow the characters to somewhat ""buy in"" to the story and presentation of Katniss and Peeta's journey into the new year of the games. The script and screenplay aren't overly complex, but they do a fair job of not bogging down the action with overstated themes or subsequent plot lines. The focus seems drawn on the main character, which is, to an extent, a good choice. Katniss as the ""chosen one"" heron is overly used in the Hollywood hack circuit, but hey, most people don't mind formulas given the films blockbuster success.The original film was not overly impressive. It was successful because a lot of people watched it, and it was based on a popular book at the time, but it wasn't a cinema masterpiece. The build and suspense written into the actual games in the original was unimpressive and the followup does a better job at building intensity and suspense. In that way the sequel surpasses the original. The tone of the film is less bland than the original even if some of this films most heartfelt moments felt like I was at a High School dance, which is authentic and meaningful, if you can somehow separate the gush from the fact that in the Hunger Games world people are being flogged and executed daily. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire both suffer from in my opinion the same issue. The stakes are minimal if the conflict between the have and have not's in the film aren't overstated. Katniss may be the lead, but certainly in can be made clear that she is but a conduit for the undercurrent of political duress of the masses being oppressed by a monarchy who is punishing and cold. The distance between those two sides, and the creation of that division is how the film has built any sort of credence with general audiences. However, did they go far enough? Did they put enough in front of you to really hate the opposition? Have they convinced the audience that Katniss and her district folk are really suffering? The answer to me, is no, they didn't push far enough. The story is good, but not great, because dramatically they haven't extended themselves to really convince viewers that this is a matter of life and death. I felt content with this film and don't hate that I put money in Hollywood's pocket. They took a pretty average product, polished it, pumped some needed cash flow into it, and then sent it out in the cold of Thanksgiving, leaving no trace of any other noteworthy films who didn't want to get caught in a tussle with Hunger Games.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

443,jonasies,The saturated games,1,23 February 2014,"After watching the first hunger games movie, thinking it could be a great flick cause of a potentially interesting plot, I got really disappointed. It was dull, there was terrible acting and the plot was far from compelling.Now they made a squeal. Why, I don't know. This movie is even worse than the last one. It is extremely boring. You have no compassion for any of the characters and the plot, if there even is any, is so thin it will break if you drop a feather on it.This movie is a great example of how flawed a public rating system can be when this film gets an average of 7.9. I guess it attracts younger females because of an seemingly complex (its not) love story. Just like twilight, which is also a terrible terrible movie.Obviously these kinds of movies sells big, otherwise they would not make them.

At times it was seamless, as if Gary Ross and Frances Lawrence corroborated together to satisfy fans of the book.Jen, Josh and Liam are great in the 3 main roles. Sam Chaflin and Jena Malone were superb as Finnick and Johanna. Sutherland portrays Snow in such an evil, controlling way. Woody provides comic relief as Haymitch, as does Elizabeth with her outlandish portrayal of Effie. Stanley Tucci as Caesar is just smitten with the whole Katniss/Peeta romance. Nice to have comical moments like this amidst the horror Snow imposes.Go see this movie today, you will not regret it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
445,dancermcm,"Amazing in Every Way, Shape, and Form",9,24 November 2013,"I have been eagerly awaiting the sequel to The Hunger Games for over a year. I finally went to see it yesterday after planning the date weeks ago. I would have loved to have gone earlier, but I had to be in a play. I went to a matinée and my mind was blown. I was a little scared because I was awfully disappointed with the first movie. When I heard there was a new director, I was excited, then anxious because Francis Lawrence,I figured, could go both ways: give us a portrayal of the book that was extremely accurate and way better than the first, or a crap movie that was worst than the first. Fortunately, it was not the latter. It was worth the three hours in the movie theater (There were like 8 previews!) and worth being late for my makeup call. The only reason I gave this a 9 out of 10 stars is because there were a few things I would have liked to be included that weren't and one thing done differently. I would have liked them to show Haymitch in his Hunger Games, the runaways from District 8 and how Katniss found out about the uprisings in the other districts. Most of these, however, were a direct result of the first movie's mistakes, specifically how the Mockingjay pin came into Katinss' possession. Overall, it is a very good adaption of a very good book.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
446,allyramsamy,Loved it. Amazing movie.,10,26 February 2014,"Okay, why it got a 7.9 rating is beyond me. I thought this movie was absolutely amazing. Jeniffer Lawrence was outstanding, and once again wowed us with her amazing acting. And as did Josh Hutcherson with his amazing performance - their acting was completely flawless and breathtaking and it is no surprise to me that Jen has made it onto so many top actress lists in 2013.The whole movie I was completely captivated by both the story line and the actors. The movie made me feel so many emotions, due to the fact the actors were brilliant in telling this story. I have watched both of the hunger games movies plenty of times, and have not felt bored once and yet more intrigued each time. I'm completely baffled by anyone who says you have to read the books to understand the movie. I had not read any of the books before seeing the Hunger Games movies, and yet understood the story lines completely. However I have since read the books, because I was feeling deprived, and hated the fact that I have to wait so long to watch the next installment. Of course the books are more in depth (good job Suzanne), you couldn't possibly put the whole story into the movies, otherwise we'd be sitting there for a whole day. But that's not to say that the movie is not as good as the books, it's just not as detailed, and leaves out parts that do not necessarily need to be there. I am extremely excited for the Hunger Games Mockingjay part 1 and part 2. I can't wait to see more great performances by Jen and Josh, and will hopefully get to see more of Liam in this movie too. Also I am excited to see Natalie Dormer and Lily Rabe - they're also both brilliant actors - and it will be exciting to see their faces in the upcoming production. I give the Hunger Games Catching Fire a 10/10 for both the story and the amazing actors. This is a great adaptation and is definitely a must see movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

448,clockwork_orange45,Let them starve. That'd be more entertaining.,1,11 April 2014,"I have been assured that 'The Hunger Games' books are better than the films. After seeing an endorsement from Stephanie Meyer saying 'The Hunger Games is AMAZING!' and watching both of the films I can't say I'm convinced that it was ever a story worth telling, let alone filming.Catching Fire is long, narcissistic, dumb, nonsensical, slow, and many other things.American born actress Elizabeth Banks ends up sounding like an English person trying and failing to do an American accent rather than someone who naturally has one?Lenny Kravitz as Katniss' fashion designer was the strangest piece of casting since Rihanna in Battleship. He gets beaten up just as Katniss is ascending into the game room, and like almost every other event in the movie you don't really find out why it happened. It is just an excuse to cue in Jennifer Lawrence for some more jaw out, mouth open, gurning at the camera. She looks like a bland office intern, rather than a seventeen year old firecracker. There are many other unanswered questions. Why is the magical wire allowed into the game? Why is the game trying to kill the participants when the original point was for the Capitol to enjoy watching them kill each other? Why bother being sentimental by putting an elderly lady into the game to only then have her wander off into some poisonous mist and not be spoken about again? Why must Katniss stay alive to save her boring family? Are the answers in the book? Probably. Will finding the answers make the film any better? Probably not. It's the kind of heavy handed allegory that eventually makes you feel like anyone portrayed as a victim in it probably deserves the fate they are dealt. The only saving graces are Philip Seymour Hoffman who rises miles above anyone around him, one scene that resembles Hitchcock's 'The Birds' and another that resembles 'Black Swan' which serve as reminders of bigger and better films that never felt the need to resort to the hero and heroine telling each other what their favourite colours are.Green and orange apparently.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
449,ieuah,Much more mature than the first.,8,23 November 2013,"Since I have not read the books of The Hunger Games, I cannot comment on how well the movies follow them or not, but I really enjoy the movies. I thought the first one was great, though there was a certain lack of violence that made it feel tweeny. Catching Fire was a lot more serious and mature.It continues from where the first film finished, Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, and of course the Capitol is not happy with how the last Hunger Games panned out. Their is civil unrest in all the districts, which results in the Capitol clamping down in a couple of rather fittingly upsetting scenes. I was glad to find that the new director had gotten rid of the shaky cam the previous film had so much of during action scenes. The action is much more steady in Catching Fire.Jennifer Lawrence is again outstanding as Katniss, who is suffering PTSD, and is a beacon of hope to the people of the 12 districts, even as she tries to back away from it so that her family and friends do not suffer for it. She comes off as naturally conflicted and scared. Although Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz are excellent as Haymitch and Cinna, I felt that Effie (Elizabeth Banks) stood out the most from Katniss' team. While in the first film she was just a lackey for the Capitol, in Catching Fire, she expresses a more human side as Katniss and Peeta are forced to go through their ordeal a second time.Overall Catching Fire is much more mature than it's predecessor, with some emotional moments and stellar acting, and much more steady action sequences with the shaky cam technique done away with. I look forward to the final installment in the series.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

451,camordini,Deeper into the Rabbit Hole,8,21 March 2014,"Catching Fire, Part 2 of a trilogy, captured the gritty realness of the first movie, while dropping the shaky cam and adding a bit more Hollywood drama and scale. I was afraid the new director would turn it into an action hero, dystopian adventure film and was relieved by his restraint and loyalty to the themes of the books. While the plot eventually brings our heroine to The Arena again, this is in no way a repeat of the first Games. In #1 the question is, what would you do to survive? In #2 the question is, who is the real enemy? This series is thoughtful, asking the viewer/reader to consider what they would do in a similar situation and hoping you leave with the suspicion that you ARE in a similar situation. If you just want action adventure, you will be much happier with the Avengers etc. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, as usual, showing us exactly what Katniss is thinking and feeling just with a look. Everyone else lives up to their previous performances with Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of Effie's growing compassion a particular standout. I am a big believer in comic relief and we have become very accustomed to movies where violence and humor are played off each other. This is not one of those movies. There is precious little comic relief, as I don't think Suzanne Collins (the author of the books) found her topic particularly funny. Still, this is one area I think the script writers could embellish a bit to help the flow of the movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

453,zachhaayema,Catching Fire Fails to Even Play With Fire.,6,26 November 2013,"I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I just couldn't. Don't get me wrong, this movie is worth a watch and if you are choosing between Thor 2 and Catching Fire, Catching Fire is the clear winner. But this is a film with such a radical premise that is never fully explored or realized in order to gain as much revenue as humanly possible. I was shocked to find out that this movie actually had a different director than the first. Mid-way through Catching Fire I felt as though I had just re-watched the first half of the original Hunger Games. The style, the story, even the character development was all exactly the same. LITERALLY exactly the same. Examples of similarities between Hunger Games and Catching Fire: 1. Katniss is in love with Gale and wants to run away with him because things are getting tough in district 12. 2. Katniss unexpectedly ends up in the hunger games. 3. Katniss storms out on Peta, Haymitch and Effie while on the train. 4. Fire effects on the costumes. 5. Peta's unexpected plot twist at the interviews. Of course this is a short and simple list that could be expanded. Basically both the first half of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are exactly the same (almost even the same shots).Its just repetition repetition. Other than a few twists this film is like a sour regurgitation of The Hunger Games. The director and screenwriter could have run with some of the subtexts (like violence for sport) and show some in your face shocking violence but instead chose the safe route that would guarantee a PG-13 rating... all to cater to a wider audience and generate higher earnings. Other than the costumes, there was nothing creative about this film.I should mention though, the acting performances were fantastic and spot on. No complaints there.For these reasons I give it a 6/10. Watch it if you like, but its no film of the year and will more than likely be the most quickly forgotten of the series.Zach",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
454,Ed_D17,The Hunger Games franchise just caught fire,8,23 November 2013,"The Hunger Games franchise had a lot to prove this time around. Whilst the first film was hardly a flop, it wasn't quite up to scratch with the impact the trilogy of novels had on the world.So, did it deliver? In short, absolutely. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second instalment in the Hunger Games trilogy (turned to a quadrilogy for film) and sees our star- crossed lovers Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) enter the brutal Hunger Games Arena again, this time accompanied not by other teenage children, put previous victors, many of whom are experienced killers. But amongst all this, unrest is brewing in the dystopian nation of Panem and a revolution is starting to catch fire, all thanks to our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who is largely unaware and slow to accept the influence she is having. The plot is undeniably strong. Whilst The Hunger Games provided us with a story about two teenage tributes fighting for their lives and their identities in an arena, this was merely the opening act, setting the scene and introducing us to the totalitarian and brutal society of Panem. Catching Fire is where the trilogy takes off, adding more twists and turns and starting to prepare the ground for the main event. What particularly pleased me is how Catching Fire manages to portray the imminent rebellion and the danger surrounding Kantiss and her loved ones as a result. The first instalment of the film quadrilogy, fatally, rushed the ending, failing to capture this. Catching Fire recovers from this mistake and, as a result, adds a whole new level of peril that runs throughout the film, up to the crucial twist employed by President Snow that sends Kantiss and Peeta back into the arena.But the plot was never going to be the issue, the sales of the novel are a testimony to that. All director Francis Lawrence had to do was stick as close to the story as he could, whilst making it suitable for film. Fans of the books will be glad that he manages to do this (and everyone else should be equally glad), with only one or two exceptions which do, unfortunately, result in small plot holes which will leave those unfamiliar with the books having to come up with their own ways of filling the gaps, or at the very least somewhat bemused. The only real, large let-down I have is how the film fails to truly capture the nightmares that Katniss (and Peeta) experience after their horror of the Games. Although one part at the start of the film works fantastically, this aspect is hinted at a best and could have been done much better, at little cost or time. A wasted opportunity, I feel.Fortunately, they're really the only negative points about this film though some of the acting still feels a little flat, particularly in the case of Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the latter being particularly disappointing. Aside from the exceptions I mentioned, the acting throughout the film is generally superb. The casting of both Finnick Odair (Sam Clafin) and Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) is absolutely perfect and both actors play their roles brilliantly. Although Finnick comes across as too nice too quickly (readers of the novels will know that the discovery of Finnick's true character is one of the joys of the final two novels), Sam Clafin is flawless in every other regard and you can be sure that the teenage girl part of the audience will stifle a giggle in at least one instance, as it should be. Jena Malone also captures the extreme confidence and slight insanity of Johanna perfectly and adds great value to a large number of scenes. Even Beetee (Jeffery Wright), and certain minor characters – especially Thread (Patrick St. Espirit) - deserve an honourable mention.Not to be outdone by the new additions to the cast, Jennifer Lawrence really steps up her game as Katniss. She gets across Katniss' overwhelming situation very well, portraying the difficulty of it for a teenage girl in her position, deals very well with several close-up shots and provides a great deal of humour in certain scenes with some fantastic facial expressions. Of course, no cast can make a film alone, so it's fortunate that the other aspects of Catching Fire are so well done. Gone is Gary Ross' (poor) choice of hand-held cameras (you can actually see what's going on in the Cornucopia bloodbath now) and in come some truly breath-taking scenery. The panoramic and aerial shots of the Capitol, the Arena and the forest outside District 12 are wonderful to behold and give the spectator a much better sense of the world in which this film takes place. The Arena itself looks fantastic and the locations and sets used are realistic and visually very appealing. The effects are stunning with most of the Arena threats being made truly terrifying and the rest of the effects adding a whole new level of realism and grandiose to the film. Finally, the soundtrack and sound effects fit in perfectly, with the music and sound fitting perfectly into every situation, building tension, heightening danger, or adding to emotion where appropriate. To sum up, Catching Fire is a phenomenal achievement that both eclipses and builds upon the relative success of its predecessor. Whilst the film is not perfect (hence only 9 stars), so few are, and the failings of this film are generally very small and certainly overshadowed by its power and ability to thrill, excite and stun its audience. Catching Fire has really set the bar for the next instalments in the franchise, but there's no need to worry about that just now. All you need to do is shut down whatever you're reading this on, head to the nearest cinema, purchase a ticket for Catching Fire and be blown away.Ed",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
455,joshwhitnallfilmblog,Hungry for more!,10,13 January 2014,"After winning the games in the first film, the couple Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) along with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are now world famous superstars however not all is as it seems. President Snow is set out to destroy Katniss, so he creates a more challenging Hunger Games with all the previous winners, this game will be harder, and more brutal than ever before.Now admittedly I always put of watching this series, however after I sat down and watched the first film I was addicted, and ran to the cinema that same evening to see catching fire. This is what I call a good sequel. It feels like the first film but with more grit, it has all the actors from the previous film, the continuity is exact, all which makes this an amazing sequel. The Hunger Games challenge keeps you on the edge of the seat as they aren't just facing each other, but the game maker, which adds a new element of surprises as well as heartbreak. The ending of the film makes you want more which is why I cant wait for The Hunger Games: Mokingjay part 1.The editing is sublime with special effects being at its greatest. Although I didn't see this in 3D, I could imagine it will be spectacular.http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
456,creativ_aries,The best movie i have seen in my 20 years of life,8,5 January 2014,"This was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my life. However, I haven't seen many so don't take it to heart all you hard core movie lovers! It followed the book as well as it could which was great to those who read it and are fans. It was a very intense movie experience with all the action scenes and romance in between it all. The acting was superb from all cast members (the best I have ever seen). As a sequel it was definitely taken to the next level! It was an emotional roller-coaster to say the least. However there was some things I would like to address.First and foremost: Listen to the rating!! It is PG-13 for a reason. it is really violent but that is what makes the film so good. Anyways, the first time I saw this in theaters, I sat next to a maybe 9 yr old boy and halfway through he was cuddling up to his mother. Im sure the kid was traumatized after seeing this movie. Even if your under-aged child has read the book and knows what happens, it's very different seeing it all spilled out in front of you on a screen vs imagination.My biggest critique would probably be the ending. It was a little cheesy how it ended with Katniss breathing heavy and staring into the camera. They should have used some movie magic to create a scene or something to make it end less abruptly. (although its hard because the book ends abruptly too)The only other thing is the special effects. They were AMAZING!! don't get me wrong but sometimes it was obvious they were fake.I'm sure the film has less of an impact on those who do not read the books and are not emotionally attached to all the characters. But I rated this one so high because it left me with my heart racing. It was the best movie I have ever seen.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
457,whatwouldwhippetdo,May the odds forever be in your favour,8,18 December 2013,"Hunger Games: Catching Fire I should start by telling I do not like teen movie franchises like this, I don't understand the attraction of the Harry Potter books and I thought Twilight was pretty shocking, so much so in fact I had to turn it of 30 mins into the second film as I was worried I was gonna get so annoyed with it I wold put my foot through my own rather stylish 42"" HD TV. So when I went to see the first Hunger Games film I was pleasantly surprised, and I say surprised because looking the synopsis (and regular readers would know there is no chance I would have read the books) I thought it was just going to be a watered down version of my favourite ever Japanese film Battle Royal, and truth be told it does borrow a lot of the elements from that film. A future (although to the hunger games credit a far less recognisable future) in which the government has decided the only way to suppress the power of the people is to create a world in which they live in fear, and once a year a randomly selected group of children are sent to an island in which they have to fight to their death. That is where the similarity ends though and that is why I give the writer of the Hunger Games a lot of credit as Suzanne Collins has created a whole new world and a whole new future for the audience to immerse themselves in, and it's an interesting world that that we end up buying into and caring about. So that's was the first film, so was the second film of the trilogy any good? The short answer is yes. I was worried after watching the trailers that it was pretty much going to be a rehash of the first film as once again you see Katniss sent into the hunger games arena but to the films credit it is much more than that and the scenes in the actually hunger games arena are far different to the ones in the first film. The cast once again are brilliant especially Stanley Tucci who again threatens to steal the show. I had a few issues with the film (as you expect I would) especially the love triangle that I just can't buy into too, I was actually finding it slightly annoying that one minute she was acting as though Peeta meant nothing to her then the next scene she's pleading for his life to be saved and claiming she would die for him, also because this film is aimed at the teenage audience some of the plot points and dystopian metaphors are forced fed to you by the script which makes some of the dialogue come across as slightly clunky and of course this is a set up film for the final movie of the trilogy and by proxy of that it asks more questions than it answers leaving you on the predictable cliff-hanger (think Empire strikes back or back to the future 2) but I'm possibly being a little bit too harsh because this is a really good film and I am really looking forward to the conclusion, although not enough to try and read the book between now and when it is eventually released.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
458,kyleweis,Let the flames begin,9,22 October 2015,"I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early, since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US, and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans, even though my English is not even that good: Catching Fire is a GREAT experience, and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.When I first read the books, I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun, but also with an important message for the youngsters (and every other person, age is not important) who read it, and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy, and when I watched the first adaptation, I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie, at all, but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.With that in mind, I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise: the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so, while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.I won't go into details about the plot of the movie, some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair: gone are the shaky camera action (one of my major problems with the first film) and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line, and whoever read the books know how important this is; it's part of the plot, of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening, and that is a great achievement, something that really sets this sequel apart.But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast, lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence, is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters, making you an ally (or an enemy) while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen: she makes you root for this young, brave lady every single minute of the struggle; with her sad, hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.The rest of the cast is uniformly good, but I have to highlight Jena Malone, who plays the explosive Johanna: her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in, mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking, just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow, in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.The set pieces are also vastly improved upon: bigger, more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding, hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts, full of sadness and fear, two dichotomies in every aspect.But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world, in one way or another, maybe masquerade, but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people (some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this. They were not the majority, it was packed and most people were also extremely annoyed by it too - every time Finnick appeared it was a screaming hell). It has so much more to offer.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire not only improves vastly upon it's predecessor: it's a great cinematic experience by itself, touching on important topics about the modern day society without losing it's thrilling core. It's not perfect, but what it does right it goes right into the bullseye. Don't let the hype or the teen fury on this fool you: it is entertainment at it's best.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
459,richiecarchia,Exciting,8,15 June 2019,"Thought the film largely resembles the first, it sets itself apart by using the arena in a new way. Maybe it lost speed in the middle, but more than made up for it towards the end. It exciting.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
460,txbangert,a passable prologue and a most disappointing ending ...,2,8 December 2013,"Really, this movie has a quite nice prologue ... but as it turns out its all prologue. We see the home front, then a tour of the provinces, followed by the splendour of the capital. A spectacular triumph for the survivors of the gladiatorial games of the past. All the competitors are given a nice blade-runner like intro sequence. They each have a 'special skill' (ie. sort of a super-power). Just in case you missed this, they get another intro via an all-live all-province glammed up TV interview. Very flash! But it is all building up to the 'games' and when we finally get to those games they are over before they really get started.And it turns out this time its a team sport rather than a first person shooter type of game as in the first movie. Our heroine of course is pretty good with a bow (her 'super power'). But when it comes to choosing team-mates that's when the plot starts to fall down. In a fight to the death with no chance of a reprieve do you (a) choose the carnivorous teeth sharpened jugular biting woman from the district where they have to go head to head with large vicious baboons ('think beauty and the beast -- she's both') or (b) do you choose the nice little old lady who dabbles with healing herbs? Do you go for the guy who can throw a spear with enough force to mow down 5 holograms in a row or do you choose the weirdos in the corner puttering about with the arts & crafts who the others nickname ""nuts and volts"". Maybe 'Volts' is a misunderstood genius but the herb lady is so old and arthritic she has to be carried everywhere she goes, and her herbs are pretty much useless.So OK, our heroine is pretty good with a bow but is not very smart and is useless at picking team-mates. But she has an adviser who should know what he is doing; who tells her 'stay away from nuts & volts ... and don't even think about that nice little old lady'. But who does she end up with as team-mates? How does this happen? Its not exactly clear. Supposedly they are planning the great 'revolution', but its not a revolution that our heroine wants any part of. She seems to have no political ideas, and no ideas on how to win the games. I'm quite partial to revolution and political ideas (like Terry Gilliam's Brazil) but actually there is nothing revolutionary or political in this movie. It makes Luke Skywalker look like he has a PhD in political science, so devoid is it of any real social commentary or political insight. OK, she comes from a remote mining district and so is not very well educated, and has little to no social skills or political savvy. And the older wiser authority figure is no Obi-Wan Kenobi who can tell her what is happening or given any useful advice (his special skill seems to be drinking straight from the bottle). And so she gets it into her small unthinking mind that she should sacrifice herself for her 'great love Peeta' (or as we would call him ... Peter). Never mind that she does not really care for him and that their 'love' is a ploy by the state to keep the masses contented. He is a bit like her gay best friend ... useless, no special skills of any kind, always falling over, running into force fields and that kind of thing ... but looks good on TV and and gives good motivational speeches. So of course he is on her team ... and when we finally get to the games she is constantly mumbling 'we have to save Peeta'. That gets old really fast! For 2 hours we wait for these great games to get started (which are supposed to entertain and thrill the entire world's population) and then all we get is a bit of wandering around in the jungle and mumbling about how 'Peeta' must survive. Even though the old lady with the herbs and who need a wheelchair is more likely to live longer than this toyboy! There is no fighting, no devious plots, no 'thumbs up or thumbs down' moments. What is the first thing that happens? 'Peeta' runs into a force field (despite having been given a tutorial about detecting force fields). He should have been blown to bits but seemingly by magic he is brought back to life (no, not by the herb lady -- that would have made too much sense).Once they've wandered around the jungle a bit they need a plan. The 'game makers' have left a spool of cable lying about and 'Volts' immediately comes up with a 'plan' that is just a rehash of the one he used to win (by some miracle it seems) a previous game. Past games are of course televised and studied by all the gladiators, so anyone could tell you will end in disaster ... and of course it does turn out to be a complete disaster. But then just before being blasted to oblivion our heroine comes up with the idea of plugging an extension cord from the bedroom socket into the kitchen socket. Will this form the great infinite electrical loop that will destroy the world's electrical grid? All that will happen is that if you are not careful you will get a nasty shock and die. And we would say good riddance to them. But our heroine (as if by magic) survives the nasty shock, being only stunned ... but is mistaken for dead by the 'game makers' who helicopter her seemingly dead body out. Depriving us of the GAME! The title being ""Hunger Games"" ... and the so called 'games' end seemingly before they have begun. Games which we have waited more than 2 hours to get started. Now that is a disappointment!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

464,SDockorockerty_MarkII,A movie bursting full of talent in all areas.,10,22 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has it all. What does this mean? Well, the perfect combination of action, emotion and excellent acting makes this one of the greatest popcorn movies of all time. Believe me when I say there isn't a minute when you're not on the edge of your seat but the special thing is that it's not always for those reasons. The Hunger Games goes further than providing flat out spectacle, it gives us characters we care about and actors who embody their roles and do them justice. As well as this, we get a story that isn't totally predictable and for non book-readers, the ending will likely come as a big surprise.Stand outs of the movie include the direction which was much more self- assured than the previous movie and captures the incredible action of the jungle arena as well as the acting. I didn't agree with Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" but her performances in her recent movies and her absolutely outstanding performance in this prove that she is THE actress of this movie age.The Hunger Games has gone well beyond the lame Battle Royale comparisons and really stands as an excellent movie franchise in its own right utilising the best talent Hollywood has to offer. Make sure you see it in theaters.Believe me when I say that there isn't a second during this movie when you won't be on the edge of your seat with your heart in your throat.

This film is the start of the spark and boy does it deliver Peeta and Katniss go to District 11 and we see Poor Rue and Thrash and one guy does the tribute sign of District 12 and he gets murdered and its a race car through the film even the talking has tension. Nothing this director did was wrong! I clapped at a screen for the life of me I cant remember it but it was a strong emotional like she was sticking her index in the air just for President Snow. You could see the sarifice mag makes for the Finnick Peeta and Katniss and it shows how the tributes hate the capital as much as Katniss only the Careers don't care. You can see the pain the joy and sadness of this film. GO SEE IT! Cinnia I think dies in this one and its so sad but necessary for Katniss to see so she can do more.I felt sadness on the edge of my seat and something good has to happen and it did Katniss survives at least for now.

467,nicolefe92,Jennifer Lawrence is pure gold,9,28 April 2014,"This is an amazing movie in general. Being a film student and a Hunger-Games Books lover, i just cant get enough of this film. i watched it twice in theaters and i have lost the times i have seen the blue-ray edition. It gets the feeling of the books and i could hear Ms. Collins words in my head while watching the movie. Francis Lawrence was a great choice, has great vision and knows how to engage with the non-reader of the trilogy public. But the reason i wanted to write this review is non other than Jennifer Lawrence. This girl is amazing. Pure gold. Her talent is huge and I'm sure she is going to become even greater that Meryl Streep (and thats no easy thing). It doesn't matter if it a crazy role (like Silver Linnings Playbook and American Hustle) or a serious role (Winters bone) or an action role (Katniss) she does it with her heart and should and she nails it every single time she is on screen. She became Katniss. Period. I decided to re-read the books after watching this movie and was amazed by my realization that the Katniss Ms. Collins describes in her books is the same Katniss Ms.Lawrence has created on screen. The only choice i didn't love was the scene in the training center elevator with Johanna Mason. Ms. Lawrence reaction was, i think, more herself than Katniss. But i have heard must people love it and said that was a pure Katniss reaction. I cant wait for the next Jennifer Lawrence movie to come out. Even if it sucks I'm going to see it just for her. Amazing talent. Amazing movie. Worth every penny i paid for theater tickets and for the Blue-ray special edition. If you have not seen it, go see it now!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The change of the director definitely made a difference and we all can see it. It was a good change though. Many good fans who read the trilogy loved the second book and this movie did a really good job at it. They've put every important scenes and even a slice of modification on specific things that Gary Ross didn't do correctly (I am talking about Buttercup the cat and even Madge). I was impressed by the CGI which was way better than the first one and of course there was no more shaky-cam. The story overall is as rich in content as the book and is absolutely amazing. The actors are incredible and yes I knew Jennifer Lawrence would be terrific but the actor who surprised me was Jena Malone because she made her character look more bad-ass than the book. I couldn't find any problem with the movie except maybe they cut off some parts of the book but I can totally understand that.

470,karthik4291,A Perfect end for a movie that's gonna have a sequel,8,24 January 2014,"For those of you who do not have an habit of reading fiction, This movie ending can have mixed feeling. That is either it is going to make you read the last one or make you feel really unhappy for watching this one before the final parts would be out. Why do I say this is As we approach the end of the movie, The entire ""ball game"" of the movie changes. Which means that we will be treated with the completely new scenarios in the coming movies of the saga. There are no games anymore, and The Rebellion begins. The plight of dear old Katniss is ever so great now because she finds herself right in the middle of all this. She becomes the Symbol of Rebellion(without her choice). OK!! I got too carried over by the ending and the beautiful acting of the great Jennifer Lawrence, Let me come back to review this movie. Basically if you are looking for some action like the previous one, Let me assure you , You shall be disappointed!. This movie acts as a build up for the following 2 movies.It shows more of the acting brilliance of Miss. Jennifer Lawrence. Never to forget, Mr. Josh Hucherson as well.All the supporting actors have done a very good job. In the first half, the movie actually shows about the vulnerability of Katniss everdeen to cope up with her new found limelight and her fight to stay away from the same. Unfortunately, the more she tries, the more she is brought closer to the inevitable glitz and glam. The second half focuses more on the feisty and intellectual part of her where she meticulously studies her environment in the games like a true hunter. As we move closer to the end, we get to see Katniss falling more for Peeta and her lack of hardheartedness that a hunger games player is supposed to have, even more. At the end, as said earlier The viewers are treated with the exceptional turn of events where Hamish , Feenich and the game setter are together and Katniss is startled at the revelation of everything that has happened in her life in the near past was a set up. Ultimately, There comes a moment at the very end when the camera moves closer to Katniss's face and there is shift of emotions from utter emotional pain, anguish and desperation to frustration to anger, Madness and Rage. All of the emotions are perfectly executed by Jennifer Lawrence.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
471,aswinkurungot,May the odds be ever in your favour,9,26 January 2014,"I realize many people hated this movie from reading the reviews. Personally i loved it. I am not a huge fan of decorated love stories or ""one person against the world"" or superhero stuff. But I appreciate those movies which move me in a way that cant be explained. The movies doesn't introduce you to or explain the events that led to hunger games much. About the dark days in a place which was called America.. Suzanne Collins writes about the hardships that we may face when power resides in the hand of few after a war in the future with technology more advanced and new faces of dictatorship that may be born with it. The film portrays Katniss Everdeen as a symbol of hope after she's crowned victor in the 74th hunger games and how President Snow plans is infuriated by the idea she could start off a rebellion. The film is neither slow nor fast.. Only at this pace we can enjoy the beautiful story in the way Suzanne Collins meant it to be.. Its no an action movie with a lot shooting and blood and gore. And president Snow looks like a normal human being but Donald Sutherland makes sure that he did justice to the role.. He was calm and there was something ominous about him throughout the movie. Academy award winner Jennifer Lawrence puts up another stunning performance and so does the remaining members of the cast..",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The director who introduced the world to serious Will Smith (or re-introduced). And the hottest, most-wanted, A- List actress. And yet......you can't help but yawn. More than once, unfortunately. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" opens months after the ""The Hunger Games"" (an awful excuse of an ode to Suzanne Collins masterpiece, even though she was heavily involved with production) as we find Katniss Everdeen suffering from extreme moments of PTSD. We watch her endure the fake, Capitol induced life and the desire for the simplicity of that in District 12. The opening of the film is strong. Actually- almost near-perfect. Much darker and more visually attractive, these sparse moments give you a feeling that the film could actually live up to everything it should be. Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"", ""Constantine"", ""Water for Elephants"") works hard to undo previous director Gary Ross' established bland visuals, and succeeds. But the cinematography can't save the shaky dialogue and pacing. Watching Katniss and Peeta's struggle through the tour is beautiful. It really is. And the revelation of the Quarter Quell plays out exactly as you hope. It's after the emotional tension releases that we're left with a boring shell of a film. The acting breaks (even J. Lawrence's..sometimes), the pacing seems as though the writers gave up, and the visual effects...well, it's nice to see that the VFX artists from 1980 wanted to keep the same continuity between the horrid attempts in this film and the awfulness of the first one. But, it makes a comeback...sort of. As soon as the Quell starts- BAM. You're back in it. The charming use of 65mm IMAX is a nice touch, but immediately reminds you, ""oh yeah- I'm NOT watching 'The Dark Knight Rises'...I should probably re-watch that"". Hawai'i is shown off beautifully, the VFX, again, are not. And the pacing feels rushed. Then slows back down. And then speeds back up. And then slows...and never finds it's balance again. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" reminds me a little bit of when I first watched Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"". I was left with that ""wait...what?!"" feeling. The difference, however, is that ""The Prestige"" is supposed to feel like that. You want to watch it over and over. Films should be like that. Instead, ""Catching Fire"" leaves you feeling that you just want to move on. It can't find that perfect balance between beautiful, tragic, and slow; intense, bloody and fast. It's an improvement from the first film, this is true. However, is it a great film? No. It is a film that has a beautiful opening and a perfect introduction into Francis Lawrence's interpretation of Collin's novel, that falls apart with dead pacing and laughable dialogue. ""Catching Fire"" is forgettable (not box office-wise, obviously). But, hopefully, ""Mockingjay"" (slated to be a two-parter released within the next 2-3 years) will finally be The Hunger Games that the book establishes. Third/Fourth times a charm, guys.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
473,kanisadrian,A Beautiful Nightmare,10,23 November 2013,"Between the first movie and this one, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire definitely owns it.As a fan of the book, I see that it embodies the book perfectly. The quote, the scenes, all the beautiful and the nightmares of the book is all poured upon this movie. I cried whilst reading the book, and so I shall cry watching this movie.First of all, the story is perfectly well written and although i think most of the lines were from the book, the actors acted it out perfectly. It won't ever disappoint book fans and will absolutely amaze the people who never did read the book and have already watched the first movie. But it will probably be a little bit confusing for the ones that just watched the movie straight on to the sequel because there is not much explanation from the first movie, it just went to the point of the matter.The scenes of the rebellion, the arena, the anger of the President of Panem to the Victors, all of the Victors, District 12, is all written perfectly and the locations were so great.The effects were also breath-taking and stunning. The suspense on the arena really got to me and probably frightened me (in a good way of course). The whole arena was the best part of the movie because it highlighted all the things they didn't show in the trailers which is just the scenes on District 12 and the Victory Tour. But the truth is the scenes that I just mention had really great acting from the actors and actresses. Big applause to Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, and the others. Such a great cast.On the top of it, I would love to see this movie over and over and over. It is highly recommended.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
474,kieranwyatts,"Orwell light, Twilight dark or something much more?",7,2 December 2013,"Catching Fire is a massive step up for the Hunger Games. I had a lot of problems with the first film and although I still have issues with its successor they are nowhere near as substantial and actually Catching Fire does a lot to remedy its predecessor's pit-falls. At two and a half hours Catching Fire is a long film by any standard, however, the story is compact and the dead weight is little to none. The story shoots off; sprinting to that Cornucopia like the long running time doesn't matter. Ironically, it's a long time till we get to that watery Cornucopia but that's another point. One of my main problems with The Hunger Games was the lack of character, or more importantly the lack of development and even more importantly a space for the audience and characters to breathe. Catching Fire still runs at the same break neck speed but for the most part it considers its characters more; respecting the audience by giving Peta real emotion instead of a card board cut out grin and a sappy sore leg that the reluctant Katniss has to make better. I liked Peta in this picture, and I understood both his and Gale's plight more. The triangle is there and in my opinion it works. Catching Fire gives a lot more of its time to the romance, a romance which could if not handled with care become tired and old. However, unlike the Twilight series, for example, the romance between Katniss and Peta and Katniss and Gale is much more woven into the story. The teen love triangle is not the centre of the film, it is an important part which adds to the stakes, emotion and story but it is not the heart.

Everything about this movie is perfect. It's the most faithful on-screen adaptation in history! It uses dialogue directly from the book and is a real testament as to how great Book Movies can be if you respect the source material. The casting? Perfect. Acting? Perfect (especially from Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence). Sets and Locations? Perfect! All of the characters are pulled off how they are in the book. And the emotional aspect of the movie is better than shown anywhere else. This movie had plenty of Laugh Out Loud moments, but plenty of heartbreaking ones as well. Whether it was a simple emotional scene or line, or the death of a great character, this movie had audiences bawling like babies and laughing like hyenas. If anyone insults this movie, they will have me to answer to, because there is not one flaw as far as I'm concerned. 10/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

In my opinion Sam Claflin how plays Finnick Odair did some amazing acting it was just as it was done in the book this goes for every cast member. but then again you need the characters to be as close to the book as the film because it was so much like the book that it was really exciting sitting in the cinema saying ""oh i remember this bit"" it was above my expectations and i really enjoyed jumping out my chair at various moments and crying at others i think you will too to be honest.That is why i strongly recommend you watch this attention seeking film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I liked the original but I thought it was mediocre and, dare I say, low budget. I thought everything was dull and confusing. However, this turned my opinion of the series on its head. A MAJOR step up from the first Hunger Games! Everything was well written and acted. The motives were clear as a bell and blazing like fire. Jennifer Lawrence deserves to get an Oscar for this performance because it was jaw-dropping and inspiring. She portrayed strength and defiance for what it was. The rest of the actors played wonderfully as well. The emotions were high up and provoking to the audience, bringing someone like me to tears.

Returning actors improve in their roles and the new faces (Jenna Malone, Sam Claflin, Philip Seymour Hoffman) deliver. The movie takes some time to set up the remainder of the drama but once the action starts it is unrelenting.There is a huge discrepancy in reviews for both movies so far. I attribute this to the preconceptions/egos of the reviewers and the ""I've read the book"" factor. The movies are well made and important in introducing the relevant-as-ever dystopian/totalitarian/revolutionary themes to a new generation. Personally, I thought the directing/cinematography of the first movie was incredible, a visual and auditory ride. The plot, action, and performances of the second make up for what I see as a slight drop off in the sensory experience.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
479,qianzhengyi,Remake (particularly bad one) of Japanese Battle Royale 2,1,6 November 2014,Hollywood should NEVER try to be as ambitious to tackle films like Battle Royale 2. American morality eventually gets in the way. Such attempts are cringeworthy. Do not bother watching Hunger Games 2 unless you like talentless 'eye candy' type films. Watch the original instead. What is it with Hollywood anyway? They shamelessly copy from oriental cinema/Bollywood and try to pass it off as their own. You can't help but feel disappointed. It was a massacre of the cultish Battle Royale 2. You have to have a strong stomach to stomach some of the things that happen in Battle Royale. Its like Bollywood was sugar coating the themes in Battle Royale and what do you end up with? A version which your granny can watch with you without feeling too offended. If that was the case then Hunger Games should never have been made. Well it shouldn't have!,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

This movie feels fresh and there is no time wasting in this which is great and allows you to leave feeling you have had a total overall experience.

481,DanielJamesAplin,Better then the first one!,10,14 December 2016,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", is a more then solid sequel to 2012's ""The Hunger Games"". ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games, The Quarter Quell, a competition that could change Panem forever. The Quarter Quell for the seventy fifth games are that the tributes will be reaped from the existing victors. Katniss must make choices that will put herself and her family in danger of being killed. She and her fellow tribute Peeta must train once again for another games, but this time they must make allies as everyone who they are fighting against know one another, Katniss and Peeta are the outsiders. The Directing in this film is very well done and very smooth. ""Francis Lawrence"" boosted the game from the previous film in the franchise, which was directed by ""Gary Ross"". The difference between the two directors is that ""Francis Lawrence"" is a visionary which clearly stands out in the film. ""Jennifer Lawrence"" once again did a fantastic job as Katniss Everdeen but unfortunately ""Josh Hutcherson"" didn't quiet reach the heights of the last film as Peeta Mellark and its hard to say but ""Josh Hutcherson"" kind of sucks in this film. ""Sam Claflin"" did a fantastic job playing Finnick Odair as well as ""Jena Malon"" Playing another secondary character Johanna Mason. Although ""Jena Malons"" Johanna Mason was easily a scene stealer. Which bring me to the characters, the secondary characters in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" are sensational and they have some enormous character development throughout the movie, as well as Katniss and Peeta. The Cinematography in this film couldn't get better, which is another improvement over the first movie as there is no shaky cam. ""James Newton Howards"" composition of the Score was amazing with the standouts being, ""The Tour"", ""A Quarter Quell"", ""Lets Start"" and ""Arena Crumbles."" There are 29 songs in the score. Lastly The Special Effects in this film are very good in some parts but noticeable in other parts. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" improved enormously over its predecessor with better acting by ""Jennifer Lawrence"", smooth directing by ""Francis Lawrence"", great characters and good special effects. I give 2013's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" a 10/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
482,cellsbellsian,Simply a Decent and Fun Movie,7,28 April 2018,"I watched this movie after reading the books, if that adds anything.This is a solid movie, better than the first. It does everything pretty well, from characters to special effects, wich plenty of memorable scenes splattered in. The special effects look fine, and the characters are mostly likable, bar a few. Everything is recreated pretty faithfully from the book, and it works because of this. If they went their own route, this movie would certainly be worse.The music is forgettable and uninspired. I really can't remember any track besides the unecesarry song in the credits. The sound design is passable, but does fail a lot. You'd expect more from a movie like this, and the sound design is really the big failure here.Jennifer Lawrance does a good job in this film, but I'm sad to say that it is not the same for everyone else. The acting as a whole is quite poor, and it sadly makes a lot of scenes unconvincing and much less tense than they should be.The action in this is alright. It works for a movie like this, and is kind of tense. You'll probably enjoy it. The choreography, where there is any, is good and the set design is fun.All in all, you'll enjoy this movie, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.

483,cribble,Not as good as the first,6,6 December 2013,The second installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy was really a bit of a letdown. I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all of the rave reviews on IMDb but was sorely disappointed. The first half of the movie moves really slow and by the time you get to the action scenes at the end of the movie it feels rushed. The movie probably needed an extra 30 minutes or so in order to give you a better feel for the new characters introduced in this movie. They deviated from the book in several scenes but nothing that was too horribly distorted. The acting in this movie also took a step back. The characters didn't seem as believable in this film and you don't get enough time for this movie to develop the supporting roles. Overall it was okay but it was by far the best book and unfortunately it fell way short of expectations.,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
484,Kaanb,"Unnecessarily long, poorly directed and mostly boring",5,4 December 2013,"I have neither seen the first movie, nor read the book. So I should admit that I am an outsider to this Hunger Games hype. However, high expectations for this sequel among the fans and high rating at IMDb tempted me to watch it. The first thing I do not really get is 8.3 rating here. My ratings and IMDb ratings have never fallen that apart in recent years!The first 1:30 hours, (ie complete duration of a regular feature film) is definitely one of the most boring fist halves I have ever seen. The story evolves but without any strategic emphasis or proofs on none of the important plots of the story. The directing was so weak that I would not understand a real uprising is baking among the districts, if president Snow had explicitly informed us about that risk previously in the opening. The Victors' Tour meeting scenes were definitely far from adequate to reflect the revolutionary atmosphere in the districts.Jennifer Lawrence's performance is one of the good things in the movie. In fact, in some parts her lead was the only reason to stay focused. But despite her acting performance we could not get her actual view of the events. The hope she creates in the people, or what she really cares, even her indecision between two man was not properly explored. And considering this superficial character building for the lead role, I am not surprised none of the other characters had a chance to become real. Shallow characters wasted a lot of drama during the film, especially in the more intense action scenes. Director's understanding of character building is having mere close-ups on beautiful face of Katniss Everdeen.President Snow can not escape from the fate of being a shallow character. While Snow is the symbol of the authoritarian government, his character was only partly revealed and the director misses the valuable moments with sub par dialogs between Snow and his grand daughter, or others to create a solid portrait of a man of power and loneliness.Finally, in the second half, the action starts. Despite the quality of the cinematography even action scenes can not surround you enough. As an important example, the idea of poisonous fog is a brilliant one, but the chase between the spreading fog and Katniss and her allies is not thrilling or even believable at all.The final is the worst part. The whole final scene rushed into a mere couple of minutes to miss and ruin many important aspects of the story. Revealing the revolutionaries, explaining the whole grand plan behind the 75th hunger game are all squeezed into 2-3 sequences in the last 5 minutes. This short and economical final is of course a choice of director Francis Lawrence but then why did he kill us by boredom of around two and a half hours?And of course the final scene is like a teaser of a TV series for inviting the audience to the third hunger games. No Sir, movies should be complete even if there will be planned sequels. There is a start and an end to the movies, at least the ones I prefer to watch.So, why I still gave it a 5/10. I think this very poorly directed story is indeed interesting and progressive. The Capital, suppressed and poor districts, growing feeling of injustice, police terror, authoritarian and corrupt government and dictator Snow. All make up a good setting for a dystopian yet realistic sci-fi atmosphere. But director trivializes this brilliant story. Still Jennifer Lawrence leads the movie with her strong character. Cinematography is good, despite lacking in drama especially in action scenes. So the story would have really made it big in the big screen. But in the hands of Francis Lawrence, it became a boring and long sci-fi flick.While I was leaving the theater, I was still trying to understand why it got 8.3 from IMDb.

485,CharlesTheBold,Well-Done Futuristic Political Thriller,9,16 August 2015,"This is a sequel to 2012's HUNGER GAMES, and is set in the same future world: a post-apocalyptic world where an Empire, called Panem, has imposed peace on the survivors only to decay into brutal tyranny. The symbol of the tyranny is the Hunger Games, a gladiator-type combat where only one ""victor"" is permitted and the rest of the fighters die. To keep the flow of victims coming, 12 districts of Panem are required each year to supply a teenage boy and girl for the fight, ostensibly as punishment for decades-old rebellion.The theme of this movie is the moral issues over how to oppose such tyranny. Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), the spirited girl who won the previous year's Games, wishes to stop the oppression, but fears that outright revolution will hurt too many people. There is another character (whom I won't identify to avoid spoilers) who doesn't care how many people are hurt as long as the revolution is advanced. Many of the subjects of the Empire are resigned to submitting until some messianic deliverer will appear. Meanwhile the ruthless President-for-life Coriolanus Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is determined to destroy the rebels before they can get organized. Who will win out? Therein lies the suspense.There's enough special effects to make the futuristic background and technology credible without overwhelming the movie.Aside from Lawrence and Sutherland as the impressive antagonists, the movie has a strong supporting cast: Woody Harrelson as Katniss's shrewd but alcoholic mentor; Liam Hemworth and Josh Hutcherson as two boys representing the aggressive vs sensitive sides of Katniss's character; Elizabeth Banks as a kindly but naive woman oblivious to the tyranny; Oscar-winner Philip Hoffman as Snow's Machiavellian adviser, and Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and Jena Malone as formidable former victors drawn into the conflict.The movie's only real flaw is that being part of a continuing story keeps the plot from being resolved in the end.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
486,fermata125,What an Adrenaline Rush!,9,24 November 2013,"This was an excellent step up from the first film, which I enjoyed immensely. I think the best choice the filmmakers made was depicting greater stakes at this point--the feeling of the upcoming revolution was ever-present and the bleakness of the situation was unable to be ignored. That urgency, I think, is what makes this a better film than its predecessor.The acting throughout was superb, particularly Jennifer Lawrence (of course). I was also pleasantly surprised by Jena Malone and Sam Claflin, who both gave memorable and strong personalities to their characters.The build-up to the Arena--all the District 12 scenes and the Victory Tour--was so well-handled that they could have made up the entire movie by itself. I almost forgot there was an Arena section of the story. The Arena itself was beautifully filmed and incredibly tense throughout. Even as a book reader and someone who is very familiar with the story, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.I feel that the only weaknesses were the last 10 minutes or so, which could have been expanded just a bit to better explain the situation. I would also have liked to see a bit more of the other Tributes in the Quarter Quell, especially the brother/sister pair which could have been a real interesting dynamic to explore (how did being in the Games together affect them? Did it make them less willing to be ""Careers"" again?). A missed opportunity, but it is understandable why the director chose to focus on the other, more important themes and characters.All in all, my issues with the film are simply minor gripes. It is well-acted, well-shot and thrilling throughout and never, ever drags, despite its 146-minute running time. I wholeheartedly recommend the movie, both as an adaptation of the novel and as a stand-alone cinema experience. It is not to be missed.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
487,ashere15-1,Probably one of the best novel adapted films I've seen in a while,8,24 November 2013,"As far at goes most times,sequels are never good or as good as their predecessors. As far as novel adaptions go, they either have their stories simplified or changed to the point that that it should no longer be called an adaption. 'Catching Fire' changes this. The film is eons ahead of it's predecessor 'The Hunger Games'(which was not a bad film). First of all, it's tone is serious, no frills and dismal-you see people suffering in and out of the arena-an element I felt was a bit lacking in THG. The film's script is well executed without being cheesy and at times takes the novel by word. As a reader of the series, I did not feel they neglected the novel. The special effects of 'Catching Fire' makes 'The Hunger Games' look frankly like child's play.(The success of the first film secured more money-which honestly-Lionsgate should've known off the bat that THG would be a hit given the novel's success.) The acting was also much better. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a better performance,as does Josh Hutcherson. Some other gems to point out in the cast would be Elizabeth Banks(who's character grows progressively throughout the film), Jena Malone and Sam Claflin, whose characters are moody and aggressive, and playboy-esque(respectively) with soft spots that are revealed in time. Amanda Plummer as well delivers a great performance(wish she had more screen time) and plays off of Jeffery Wright's Beetee successfully. The film splits it's time between districts/capitol and arena(which is beautifully and steadily shot) but delivers it's more prominent messages of oppression and revolution throughout.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
488,PipedupMovies,A downgrade from the first film.,6,9 February 2014,"A dystopian future run by a magalomaniacal dictator who makes young people fight to the death in gladiatorial like contests.That's a great idea for a film and it is the reason why I loved The Hunger Games (2012). I went into this one with really high expectations. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire started really well. Darker than the first film and displaying more government oppression as well as the seeds of a revolution, it is certainly an interesting concept. The build-up to the games is done well and the stakes are upped in a simple but brilliant way: past winners are made to fight each other.Unfortunately, the film starts falling apart when the games start. There are three main problems with the film:1) Most of the contestants are never properly introduced so it is hard to care for them when they start to die.2) In a gladiatorial film, the audience wants to see contestants fighting and killing each other. Here, the contestants don't really fight each other, rendering the gladiatorial aspect of the film meaningless. Instead, the contestants spend most of their time battling the weather and other natural calamities. 3) The ending was abrupt, lame and left me feeling cold. It was more of a ruse to get people to the next film than a satisfying ending to this one.Overall, The Hunger Games series has some really good ideas but in this outing, the film went pear-shaped halfway through. Special mention goes to Philip Seymour Hoffman who lights up the screen whenever he appears and to Jennifer Lawrence who is still wonderful as Katniss Everdeen but the film doesn't gel and has too many flaws.I give it a 6/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
489,Lucifershal0,Worst than the first,1,23 November 2013,First of all I have to start by saying I thought the first movie was a total rip off from a Japanese movie called Battle Royale. Same plot about some kids who are chosen to kill each other. The only difference between the two is that Hunger Games is a total Hollywood funded movie and Battle Royale is not. I didn't see ANYTHING different in the 2nd film than the first. I feel bad because my wife had paid for our movie tickets and I did not enjoy the movie at all. I don't see what the big hype and excitement is over these films. I also only read books about actual facts instead of fantasy so reading the books would serve no purpose. If you thought the first movie was mediocre then don't waste your money seeing the 2nd. With the cost of going to the movie theater your better off staying at home and maybe renting or downloading this when it comes out.

493,suresh28286,The FLAMES strikes again...,7,6 December 2013,"I watched day one which released recently in India...I must tell you, this movie is a great tribute to THE HUNGER GAMES fans...Jennifer Lawrence well proved actress and did a wonderful job for her character...She gave a good justice to all emotions in the movie...Rest of the actor and actress did their job well done...Movie is mixed package of action,emotions,love and some most thrilling moments...First 60 minutes, its all about story around Jennifer and reset was good...action sequence not bloody but interesting...The poison fog,scene with monkeys/gorillas and house rotating scene in middle of the river was excellent...Francis Lawrence did the decent job, still we can expect more from him for next upcoming movies...",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
494,shawnkanyer,Simply Amazing!,9,23 November 2013,"I was not really into the first one. I never read the books. But this movie was so much better. Jennifer Lawrence was superb. She did a great job acting out PTSD from the first movie. And her reaction to the crowds in the other districts was also superb.What I loved most is that this movie adds so much more to the plot. In the first, I felt like the game was the entire movie. In this one, that is not so. I'm actually less interested in the game, and more interested in the way the government treats it's people, which we get a glimpse at here. The so called peace keepers only have minutes of screen time, but the viewer hates them instantly. This movie is full of emotion, and I can't wait for the third installment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
495,AndyMic,Big No-No! No..No.. How could they...??,5,19 February 2014,"I just dropped by here to read some of the reviews, and was Shocked by the undeserved high rating...First of all I want to say: I Love Jennifer Lawrence as the great actress she is. Liam Hemsworth rocks, Donald Sutherland is a living Legend, but folks Please.. Have I missed something here? Is it our personal level of interest in our idolized actors/actresses we are voting about, or is it the film as a whole?I feel I can always rely on an IMDb rating when more than 10-20 000 people have voted, this is one of the exceptions that confirms the rule.With that said; it was awhile ago I saw Catching Fire, I watched the premiere.. Into the great halls of the saloon I walked with anticipation, with the The Hunger Games in Loving memory..Then I watched, and waited, then I watched some more, waited some more.. Then there was an Explosion!!! Then it was over.If I wanted to I could have written this review very short, briefly, something in style with: Boring, Thin, Not at all Thrilling, and most of all So F-in Disrespectful to the book. This is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen, and That my fellows is why I just can't keep it short here, I read a lot, and I absolutely Loved the entire Hunger Games Book trilogy. I am almost 30 years old and I know it is a movie perhaps made for a younger audience, but Hello!?'!??!?!? So is the books!!And they are Way more scarier and horrifying, but most of all they are true to their nature of what they're about - War and Politics, and of course - Love.It seems the filmmakers have missed this, entirely. Jennifer Lawrence sure have not, she tried, but as they say; it's hard to soar like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys.I cant understand how the screenwriters just can kill a book like this, Especially since they had Two Hours doing something really great with it! The writer of the novels - Suzanne Collins - she has a message with these books, they should be F-in Schoolmaterial in Sociology. I'm not gonna review the books here but I have to make myself clear so you the reader understand where I'm coming from, that is - a book so good you just have to have the IQ of a rock to fail making a descent script out of it.The script is so hollow, and I have to say that this (for me) is where the movie fails so so deep. I know there is no way you can fit a book into a movie script, but the political schemes, the fight inside the characters, inside Katniss heart - It's all missing, instead they have focused on the Visual S***, which is Great, the photo is true to the book, but hey, a little word here and there, some political sympathies, I don't know.. All I can say is that this film really disappointed me. The only reason I did not leave the theater is because I wanted to see how they had manage to make their (sadly) poor adaptation. I also happen to Love Ms Lawrence, as mentioned.. But most of all I love the books.So for All of you out there, if you have seen the two films and not read the books, I highly recommend you to do so, read all three, and you will know what the phrase Catching Fire (aaaarrrghh!!!!!) >>Really<< is about. Peace",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
496,easygoingm2,Syfy wouldn't touch this one...,1,5 December 2013,"To make this as short as possible, this movie is not as good as the first one. Now considering the first one was nothing shy of terrible it speaks worlds about how much money was wasted on making this movie look like a low-budget Sci-fi film you'd see late night on Syfy, you know, the ones with no big names and the graphics are lousy, but they make you laugh a bit because of it... I certainly hope the books of this series were not even close to as bad as the portrayal of them in these films. I understand the Twilight series was mentioned in some viewers comparisons, but clearly these movies have trouble measuring up to those atrocities. To get such a great rating I'm seeing on several sites I was hoping would be for a well put together film... unfortunately it is quite the opposite. The money loyal fans spent to ruin their Friday night is why this movie wasn't wisely cast out from all theaters worldwide. I mean casting an unattractive lead who should have used her parents money to buy some emotions instead of acting positions ruined everything about both films. The one spoiler I'll give is you have to look at her face searching for the right emotion to use in the closing seconds, ultimately depressing venture. The filmmakers should be ashamed, I know I am.

497,Yellow-Psychopath,Disappointing.,6,27 November 2013,"Yes, it is to me. Well, like most of you out there, I was so hyped for this film to come out, but tried to lower down my expectations, and when I finally saw it, it kind of left me dumbfounded, because of the ending. Of course, you can call me unfair in the first place because I haven't read the original book, but if this film is truly faithful to the book, either that the novel is not my cup of tea, or that the story elements doesn't translate well onto the screen. Yeah, my problem with this film is with some of the plot elements.First of all, some of the scenes in the first half seems to just continue to drag on and on, until it gets boring, or at least, uninteresting. It really affects the pacing of the whole movie and doesn't make up for the real deal during the second half, which seemed a little too short, and rushed. The game can be quite intense, but instead of seeing tributes slaughtering each other, you mostly get the tributes forming a nice, friendly group, trying to avoid 'natural disasters', and then lots of talking. I mean the idea of the clock is unique and interesting, but it is completely missing the point of what the game is, or at least that's what the audience is seeing only. Most of the deaths are off-screen, otherwise they are deaths of man-made animals. Before you can say ""Hey! What are they going to do after..."", the plot twists, and it just suddenly ends, abruptly. Its like they are doing their best to remind you that there is another Hunger Games movie in the making, be sure to check that out!!! Seriously? Otherwise, the acting is really not bad at all, and it has some neat ideas. If you really love the book, you would most probably love this too, otherwise, you might not understand.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
498,dexfm,Much better than I expected,8,25 November 2013,"This part is better than the first one, maybe because it sticked with the book with accuracy. The winning bet of the franchise is casting Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. I was very curious how they will put the events in the arena on screen. They did it quite well. My girlfriend was not impressed by first movie of the series, but she liked this movie so much that even her was surprised about that. Woody Harrelson is a delight in interpretation, as usual. The tribute characters were well chosen and did the book justice. The only negative thing that caught my eye was the crying of Katniss for Peta in arena. It felt forced, exaggerated and not in place. As an experienced fighter who can keep his cool in a dangerous environment, when someone you care is injured, first instinct is to help him, not cry hopelessly near his body. On the other hand i liked Johanna :)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I was completely blown away by its captivating and intriguing plot. I have read all the books, and am proud to say that the movie was delectably accurate. Jennifer Lawrence performs a stunning performance, that really blew me away. Her emotion was so raw and powerful that I couldn't believe it. She is a truly amazing actress that can demonstrate emotion like I have never seen before. Even though I have read the book, the movie still threw me through twists and turns, and managed to create genuine worry for all of the actors and the outcome of the plot. Extremely wonderful and I recommend this incredible movie to anyone and everyone out there!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The plot twists, story, and characters were absolutely spectacular! The ending gave me chills, how everything works together. The characters are so lovable, and Effie whom I couldn't stand, went from my hatred of her to one of my favorites in this movie! It also goes deeper within President Snow's evilness. He just one of those characters you want to brain. If you have seen the first one (which you have to before you see this one) then I HIGHLY suggest you see this one. Awesome plot, awesome characters, and awesome ending! The movie flows so well with the other one!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I however found it to be great so i watched the next installment... I started watching it and was OK cool i can see where this is going and it did follow my thoughts as to where it was going. I still was greatly entertained but i felt i knew how it was gonna end and then someone takes a gun and points it at my head and Boom mind ****. I was so surprised by the ending that i seriously am looking forward to the next 1 and when it launches i will be first in line to see it!!! **SPOILER**from this point!!!!!!(YOU ARE WARNED!!!!!

502,pvinue,The perfect adaptation,7,19 January 2014,"The hunger games: Catching fire was, for me, the best out of the three books. Therefore, as you can imagine, I was really looking forward to watching this film, especially since it has an 8.2 in IMDb. I must say I was not disappointed. Sure, they left out a few awesome moments from the book; but had it been in the film, it would have been almost three hours long. I felt satisfied in that sense, unlike with the first one (7/10). I felt the first film was missing too many things and there were certain scenes that disappointed me.Jennifer Lawrence is good in EVERYTHING!! So it goes without saying that she nails the Katniss role for the second time in a row. The other actors are very good as well, especially the one who plays Finnick. He is fantastic! The directing is a big improvement from the first one. Not much else to comment on, except that you should totally watch this film despite having, or not, read the book. In conclusion: this is, easily, the best adaptation book-to-film I have ever seen.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

It is my favorite book with the best arena and set of characters. It was not only a lovely follow up to the first that I enjoyed it, but it converted my brother who saw the first but wasn't sure how to feel about the movie and was enough of a stand alone movie that my father was able to enjoy and understand it without seeing The Hunger Games. 10/10 I cannot rave about how much I loved it and how perfect it was!!! The acting was great, everyone held their own even Jena Malone who I wasn't a big fan of until seeing her as Johanna Mason. She did such a good job as did everyone else!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
504,stevenfersh,Let it Fly!,9,23 November 2013,"My wife and I went to this title last night, from the start it immerses you right into the action or at least old memories from the first movie, the actors and actresses all do a fine job portraying the anguish and hardships of their given roles. We felt that the movie had an entirely different atmosphere from the first. One could only compare the capital forces to the Germans in WW2. With that said we see a different Katniss from the first, she's not just a weak scared girl anymore and for the first time you see her go on the offensive rather than defensive. Her bow skills have improved from the first but with that she now struggles with the terrors and memories from the 74th game. Peeta has grown up and you get the sense he is totally dedicated to Katniss and her survival. No hiding in the tree's or creek bed for those two in this one. You will not be disappointed by this movie; sadly the ending will leave you wanting more. I give this film a 9 stars instead of 10 only because of its ending. Enjoy!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

But it felt that all the key points in this film weren't explained enough and everything feels rushed, this may just be because I read the book and had very high expectations I don't know. But if you really want to get into the story I suggest the book, or as I did with the first film, watch the film and then read the book, it makes everything a lot better. The acting however is well done and so is the visual effects, it still looks nice, a much bigger improvements on the first films in terms of CGI.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
506,johnnysmash-700-422378,"The Hunger Games is now just a cliché ""defeat the evil empire"" movie series",6,25 November 2013,"The draw of ""The Hunger Games"" movie series, to me, are The Hunger Games themselves. The concept of a Survivor style deathmatch where normal people have to fight to the death is very interesting. There's so much room for suspense, drama, betrayal, etc. The entire world of this movie is warped around The Hunger Games existing, so you think they'd make The Hunger Games the point of the movie.WELL. In this movie they went full-force with the tired movie trope of ""an evil empire with a tyrannical ruler that has armies of dudes with their faces covered up that oppress the normal people and jeez we have to stop them."" At least 2/3rds of the movie is bent around this plot line, with The Hunger Games being a (pretty okay) last third. Needless to say, I think if the first movie had been this focused on the whole ""evil empire"" thing, people would have been confused and perturbed and not gotten the point of why The Hunger Games were even in the movie. So that's what this movie felt like.The Hunger Games section doesn't even seem like it wants to be The Hunger Games. Most of the games is spent on running away from poison fog, fighting baboons, or trying to hold on to a spinning island. After the poison fog I was like ""Okay, that was the cool non-human interaction thing. Let's see what they've got cooked up next."" When the baboons showed up, I thought ""Nooooo."" The Hunger Games concept shouldn't be about people vs. CGI monsters, it should be about people vs. PEOPLE.As I watched, it started to feel like the movie didn't even want people to battle to the death in an arena. But I thought ""Surely, since there can only be one victor, we're going to get to some down-and-dirty fighting, betrayals, and emotions any minute now."" NOPE. It turns out the movie really DIDN'T want any of that stuff to happen, because Katniss ends The Hunger Games early by blowing up the roof! So we see them fight some CGI, then the roof is blown up. Great.In conclusion: This has turned into a series about taking down the evil empire, and it doesn't even want there to be Hunger Games in its own storyline anymore. Overall it's ""okay"" but really disappointing if the reason you got into these movies was because the ""Hunger Games"" concept sounded dramatic and interesting.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
507,darkwitchery2,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (Don't Judge by the Books...,7,1 December 2013,"Literal by any means though - otherwise the film adaptation would never measure up to the standard expectation based on Suzanne Collins originally written series of The Hunger Games books. For a start I think the plot of the first film was a bit wee understated due to lack clarity on the history of the formation of Panem (which previously known as North America). Some audiences especially from the group of non-followers of Suzanne Collins were bound to be riddled by the question, 'Why did the Capitol come out with the idea of the Hunger Games at first place..? There was a tiny loophole in the prelude of the first film I just thought it could have been better to navigate with some opening scene of nuclear holocaust launched by Capitol to destroy the District 13 entire population due their rebellion against Capitol. At that point, I was left to wonder, it seems that the dir. Gary Ross merely count on the popularity of Suzanne Collins' books to do the job for viewers' comprehension on history details outlining the remarkable turnover reign from North America to Panem; and also under the regimentation on food ration by the federal government of Capitol, the Districts population are thrust into massive level of hunger. But sadly, all of these vivid imagery can only be reached out through the perspective of the books.'Against all the odds in the 2nd film follows Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who leads a glamorous life and gains popularity on both Capitol and the Districts. But soon she is about to learn that the remarkable shift in her life proves always comes with a price. During her touring with her fellow victor, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, there are signs of rebellion brewing across the Districts that inadvertently attributes President Snow to see Katniss as a potential threat who will rally people from Districts to rebel against the Capitol.Soon Katniss is thrown into an ultimate showdown against other victors from the past Hunger Games. But this time around, the 75th Annual Hunger Games which is also known as 'Quarter Quell' turns outs to be underlying conspiracy by Snow to destroy Katniss Everdeen - once and for all.' Overall the 2nd film of The Hunger Games converged at the angle outlining our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen on her road of her spiritual exploration followed with her determination on which path she will be undertaking, to become the ally of the supremo Capitol; or the rebellious group from all over the Districts? There were a couple of few hits in the plots particularly the idea of 'Tik Tok' and Cabin in the Woods traps- alike in the arena were pretty amazing. I've got my emotional struck at certain scenes particularly when Katniss witnessing an old man gunned down in cold blood by a 'peacemaker' (a Capitol soldier) during the time when she mourned the deceased Rue at District 11.Plot aside, I find the dystopian set somehow appeared more like a contemporary metropolitan, not the surreal futuristic which supposed to be, the one with flying automobiles which could be seen in the sci-fi backdrops of Fifth Element and Total Recall Remake by Len Wiseman.Choreography disposition was fairly smooth despite few gasps in between. The most fascinating moment in term of action sequences would be Katniss using her archery skills at training center, taking down all the holograms! Nonetheless, it could have been better if such combat expertise being fully translated into Katniss' fight with a horde of 'Afterearth'-alike carnivorous baboons.Jennifer Lawrence undeniably the 'Girl on Fire', she earned that and no other girl can steal that title from her. But sadly her thunders in my opinion, was not being equally shared to her two male sidekicks, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth who played Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne respectively. (Sorry..not that I'm sexist, it just that I couldn't shake off the film adaptation just don't do the justice for this duo compared to the original characteristics as in Suzanne Collins books) Peeta Mellark in the book is an exceptional intelligent boy beyond his age, exuberant as the way he sees thing lightly and positive, not as portrayed by Josh in film adaptation (no hardfeelings to Josh's fans, Josh was more like a broody and a little whiny type). There goes to his rival as well, Gale Hawthorne who was supposed to be a strikingly bold and savvy fighter/hunter in the Suzanne Collins' version. I'm sorry to say that despite with lots of publicities, I just don't see that burning spirits unleashed out by Liam Hemsworth (or perhaps Liam should be taking on Peeta Mellark just as what he auditioned before for that role) In a nutshell, The Hunger Games is a decent film adaptation, but still a milestone from the original imagery as in Suzanne Collins' Panem world. Bad investment advice..? Set your expectation a bit wee lower then you'll see it differently!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The storyline is great, but i also equate some of that due to the book. The movie holds the viewers attention and looks at the characters with more depth which is very refreshing in the modern age of same story different scenes.The cons of the movie that the storyline is jamming quite a few plot points in which can leave the viewers focus more invested in one part than the other, then the movie seemingly stops. there is no story wrap up assumingly to keep the viewer pumped for the next installment of the movie, but it feels unsatisfactory. overall a fun watch",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
511,prestoncicala,"Reviewed in terms of Style, Story, and Substance.",9,25 November 2013,"Style - Catchy effects and musical score. The overall presentation. Story - You know what that is. Substance - Outright or subliminal themes or messages.Continuing a budding film franchise is tricky work. Especially if the first project is considered a decent piece of cinema. The job is made much more difficult when the original director has absolutely nothing to do with the follow-up to his own film. Catching Fire is an excellent accomplishment for Francis Lawrence- the series current (and contractual) director. While Gary Ross, who handled the first film, made the responsible decision not to sign onto direct a sequel with a mere year-and-a-half's production time, Francis Lawrence made an equally wise choice by maintaining much of the style that Ross' instituted originally. There is still a shift in filmmaking style, but this is not a bad thing. In fact, I wish more series would allow a hand-off between competent individuals. It makes each installment feel more unique.There are no outright flaws in the visual effects. Explosions and creatures look as natural as ever and do not detract from the strong points of the film - the acting and architecture. Catching Fire broadens the scope of The Hunger Games, and we get to see much more of Districts 11, 12 and the Capitol. All is faithful to the original art, and is expertly elaborated on. The acting has also done nothing but improve, and thankfully, no cast members have been swapped. If anything is a much more noticeable improvement, it's that the musical score does contribute to the experience more than the first. While the books are much more focused on Katniss (being written as a First Person narrative), the movies utilize the opportunity to elaborate on the setting and story. If nothing else, the make it much more interesting while carefully avoiding contradictions with the source material. The Hunger Games was very contained in itself, revolving around District 12, the Training Center, and of course, The Games themselves. Catching Fire broadens the setting, progresses the story, and develops the characters - some more than others, but at least it covers good ground. The story successfully makes the jump from ""Katniss trying to survive through the Hunger Games"", to; ""Katniss trying to kiss up to the government to stay alive"". Another underlying plot comes to the fore as full on civil war becomes unavoidable. Needless to say, that sounds super exciting.When the story arc takes our hero jumps from the role of gladiator to that of pop idol, we will not ask ourselves a lot of the moral question that the first film raised. When you go to a movie that is set in a world where kids killing kids is an acceptable pastime, you can't help but be bothered by that fact that you just paid money to watch it as well. Of course, the presentation is different, but it highlights the moral ambiguity of warfare and sanctioned killings. Catching Fire's storyline just doesn't prompt the same degree of deep moral reflections. However, we still have some subtle themes regarding politics and the media that one could read into when they watch Catching Fire. For whatever this movie might lack when compared to the original, it makes up for. In fact, most would agree that it surpasses The Hunger Games in most every way. I prefer to be happy with the fact that they are each different, but at the same time good. I'm thrilled that each movie has done its part toward turning a popular book series into a great film franchise.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
512,viethj,As good as the book,9,29 November 2013,"This movie is true to the original book, but yet still somehow adds something that the book cannot provide. The cinematography is beautiful. When you watch the movie, you truly feel like you're in the future—the *real* future. Everything is pretty much the same as it is today, except oddly grungy as things have actually regressed in many ways, and people in some districts live more primitively, yet the signs of future technology are there. In this way, I feel the treatment of the future is very realistic. The cast is excellent. Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful as always. Woody Harrelson is at his best—could have stood seeing more of him. All the rest of the cast meets or exceeds their performances in the first Hunger Games movie. The movie is action packed and suspenseful. I would have given it a perfect 10 if the ending had been stronger. As this is based on the second book in a trilogy, the ending is not as satisfying as I would like, and serves mostly to give us a hing of what's coming in part three. But mostly this movie was excellent.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
513,raymond-houser,Plot holes but entertaining,9,28 March 2016,"Spoilers I don't usually write reviews; but after reading many that compare this to Battle Royale, I thought it would be prudent to say a few words. In my opinion, comparing this series to Battle Royale is very irresponsible. It's like comparing American football to a game of catch. Battle Royale was like the game of catch. It was a single aspect of the Hunger game series, elongated into a movie. The Hunger games is like a professional football game. Sure aspects of it bear similarities to the Battle Royale series, but there is a deeper and more engrossing story-arch. The Hunger Games franchise isn't about the actual hunger games themselves, it's about rebellion. The Hunger Games are a single facet of a much larger, much more detailed story. Both movie franchises are good, but they are very different. Please don't believe the people spouting off about plagiarism. They are flat out wrong.In addition, the only real negative reviews, other than the people who don't understand what plagiarism is, are complaints about it ""dragging on."" This movie is about more than people running around killing each other. The people complaining about this issue should go watch Rambo movies. Not all movies are mindless action from start to finish.

514,Alexander_Eldridge,a must see film,10,17 December 2013,I have seen this movie 5 times yes 5 times and it has not gotten old the plot is set around a year after the 74th hunger games where Catniss and Peeta won and they haven't really spoken since coming home and you can tell the distance between them every time there around each other until they leave to go to the other districts to where president snow keeps a close eye on Catniss because many people in the districts do not believe the love story so they have to go around and make it believable which doesn't work at first then they come up with an idea to get married but this is put on pause when the president and the game maker decide to have past winners be picked at the reaping and in the game Peta and Catniss stay together and share tender moments you could tell Catniss was starting to fall in love with him.Now in retrospect this movie has met my expectations and more I wasn't big on the first film I thought it moved kind of slow and had very little action unlike this one which in my opinion is better than the first film the actors did a great job the plot was great and the special effects were amazing this is a must watch for all...,The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
515,Sapphira12345,Action Packed and Dramatic,9,4 December 2013,"Avid fans of The Hunger Games Trilogy would know that while Collins' book series is mainly focused on the gut wrenching action that takes place in the brutal live televised event known as The Hunger Games, there are more subtle dramatic elements incorporated into the books as well. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent representation of this. The film is both action packed and emotionally raw, it offers the intensity of heart racing action but also offers moments that tug on the heart strings. Both elements combine splendidly to create a truly remarkable film. As expected, most of the action of the film takes place in the clock-shaped arena. The audience are practically forced on the edge of their seats as they watch the poor 're-reaped' past victors avoid poisonous fog, kill frightening mutt baboons and evade being murdered by other tributes. The scenes are both terrifying and intense, yet for some strange, unknown reason it is almost impossible to take your eyes off of the screen (even for a second). Katniss, Finnick and Peeta are a trio that display wicked fighting skills and that are the cause of most of the gritty action contained in the film. The film is also able to highlight the emotional struggles that Katniss Everdeen faces following her shared victory of the 74th annual Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) shows audiences why she has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar, the girl is literally on fire and isn't gong to let anything get in her way! In this film, Katniss a girl whose mind bursts with fear and unease, she is an emotional wreck. The audience really witness this when Katniss delivers a elegy to the fallen tributes of District 11 (Thresh and Rue). Lawrence's performance in this scene is so powerful that she makes the audience feel her grief and misery at the death of her friend and ally Rue. Let's not forget the romance factor, in the film Katniss is tossing and turning between Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthrone (Liam Hemsworth, however, there is only one truly romantic scene in the entirety of the film, that is the sweet scene where Peeta attempts to convince Katniss that she needs to live instead of him. Peeta then proceeds to say that nobody needs him, Katniss' response is ""I do, I need you."" Then the two share a lengthy and passionate kiss. All in all the film is good, perhaps one of the only downer was Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). In the book, Cinna is a charismatic, energetic character, however, in the film he is dull and uninteresting (but why? We all know Lenny Kravitz is full of energy and excitement). Just go see the film and judge for yourself, me? Well I'm going to spend a long year waiting in agony for the third film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
516,ThatWasVeryAwesome,Catching Fire Burnt my Opinion,6,2 May 2014,"Waiting until this movie came out on bluray, was definitely a smart decision. I really enjoyed the previous Hunger Games movie but this sequel didn't follow up with the same caliber of film. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was strong as always, she plays the tough underdog everyone loves to get behind. Josh Hutcherson never really shows a wide emotional range, he seems to have the same monotone attitude through the whole movie. Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci all round out the cast with great supporting roles. It is a real shame Philip Seymour Hoffman passed away because it is going to be hard to fill his shoes with the last two movies in the series.The first movie consisted a lot of the actually games where this movie was majority of setting up the games. The movie doesn't really start off strong and kind of drags. It is heavy on the romance Katniss and Peeta have to put on display for all of the districts. I just feel the pace of the movie was a lot slower than the first and some of the material could have been cut out. I wish there was more shown of how the other tributes were eliminated in the games, especially how interesting the new arena was. The ending also felt a bit rushed and it did not leave me wanting more. After the first movie I couldn't wait until the sequel came out and this just didn't make me feel the same way.I did enjoy while they were training for the games, though it was a bit short. The action in this movie was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat when it was happening. The start of the games was definitely awesome because not only did they beat up Cinna(Lenny Kravitz) in front of Katniss moments before the start, but all of the tributes were placed on pedestals in the middle of a lake. The jungle atmosphere seemed a lot more energetic than the forest than the previous film. The concept of the clock with deadly booby traps every hour was clever and different. I was intrigued and wanted to see more of what the dome had in store for the tributes but was ultimately let down. Hopefully the next film will rekindle my interest for this series. That is why I am giving this movie a 6/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
517,sidrahali27,Brilliant film,10,1 June 2014,"The film has a bit of everything: humor, romance, action... It was thought provoking at time and had a few twists and turns here and there. The first film was good, but this one surpassed my expectations. I expected it to be really good, but it surprised me how brilliant it was scripted. Another way it outdid the first one was that the camera didn't flash around as much as the first one. The viewer could just about keep up with the film, and the ending of the film left viewers hungry for more. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was impeccable, as was Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson's. I would definitely recommend the film for anyone who loves action, romance and thrillers, because this film caters for everyone, and if you haven't seen it, you're missing out. The first film wasn't as good as the book, but this one is definitely on the same page as the book. Go see it guys, you won't be disappointed :D",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
518,Saad-Awadi,A re-release of BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM would have been better.,1,4 January 2016,"I went to the theater expecting to be let down, but it was still worse than I expected. If this was just a standalone movie the plot, character development and action would all be considered pretty weak. But this was supposed to be aBATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM rip.The characters are weak, we are given no insight whatsoever about the politics that are at play, the areana battle fights are few and far between, and manage to be both underwhelming and completely unbelievable. The worst part, however, was that the studio decided it was a good idea to simply recycle the REQUIEM Universe and just make a movie of the poorly conceived plots found there, rather than making something original.The only redeeming part of the movie were some really excellent and enjoyable visuals, especially on the cgi stuff. If you really don't know or care that much about BR2 you will probably enjoy this movie. Anyone who really likes Battle Royale and cares about it will simply be less disappointed watching the originals.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
519,waynerad,"The ultimate ""Zeitgeist"" movie",10,26 March 2014,"The Hunger Games is the ultimate ""Zeitgeist"" movie (series). Zeitgeist is a German word, ""Zeit"" means ""time"" and ""Geist"" means ""ghost"" or ""spirit"", and ""Zeitgeist"" means ""the spirit of the times"". Nothing better captures the *feeling* of what it feels like to be alive in the 2010s.I first noticed this in the first movie (warning: everything that follows contains spoilers) when they were in the Arena and it looked like a natural forest, but was being controlled behind the scenes by the gamemasters and was full of cameras for reality TV. This is just like what our virtual environments feel like -- it looks superficially like a normal thing, we're just interacting with our friends or whatever, but in reality the whole environment is artificially built by humans who manipulate everything behind the scenes for their own ends, financially, or politically, or what have you, and they don't tell us what they are doing or why, and we never get to know. We never meaningfully interact with the natural world any more, only with these artificial built systems. Whether it's a man-made system of rules that has taken on a life of its own, like our school system, or a system where the rules are encoded in software, like an online social network, we're always trying to guess the hidden rules and game the system, while the people who built the system try to change the rules and game the system themselves for their own advantage. And the ""reality TV"" angle is fitting, too, as any blunder we make online today can ""go viral"" and make us superstar-fools. The way the characters have to both compete brutally and sell themselves for sponsorships also seems to perfectly fit the way the world of today feels -- we have to be ruthless competitors to some while being the most friendly and amicable salespeople to others. That's all in the first movie but in this movie, Catching Fire, the world of the Hunger Games reveals itself to be a full-fledged ubiquitous surveillance society, just like our real world. When Katniss and Beetee are strategizing, Snow and Heavensbee are watching them and changing their own strategy in response. And it's not just in the Arena -- Snow can see Katniss everywhere in District 12. The surveillance is ubiquitous and so you never know when anything you say is being watched. Just like reality.The parallels with our Zeitgeist go on. Our world feels like a weird mix of old and new technology. You never know when you'll have some amazing new solution to a task, a new mobile app or machine learning system, or when you'll have to fill out piles of paper forms. Similarly in the world of the Hunger Games, there's all this super-advanced technology -- maglev trains, hovercraft, the ""Holodeck""-like training area in the Capitol -- yet the contestants fight with the most primitive of weapons, like bows and arrows. The mix of ""old"" and ""new"" extends to styles as well, in clothes, architecture, and so on, for example all the clothing styles in the Capitol are styles from the 1940s, done up to be more flamboyant, while the Hunger Games contestants wear modern styles.The catchphrase ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" perfectly encapsulates the central contradiction of our times of how anyone can succeed at anything yet the odds are always against you because so small a percentage of the population actually do succeed. In the Hunger Games, ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" is always given to *all* the contestants. It's the ultimate cynicism. The odds can't be ever in everyone's favor by the very way The Hunger Games are set up.Ultimately, we identify with Katniss because of her struggle to maintain her humanity, her compassion, in the face of a world, a society, that is hell-bent on turning her into the exact opposite. So it is in our real world, where we are pitted against one another in a giant, cutthroat, all-against-all competition.Katniss demonstrates her compassion from the very beginning, when she volunteers as tribute in place of her sister Prim, through all her interactions with the other contestants, even to the ""love triangle"" that people like to talk so much about -- the ""love triangle"" in The Hunger Games is not like other movies, where it is just two men competing for one woman or vice-versa. In The Hunger Games we know from the beginning that Katniss is in love with Gale, and while the first movie leaves it ambiguous whether she loves Peeta or was faking it, when this movie opens we immediately know she was faking it -- but not out of malice, that was what kept both of them alive. At the end of this movie, we are left with ambiguity again, as to whether Katniss is starting to romantically love Peeta or whether she just cares about him deeply as a person.I haven't read the books and of course the 3rd movie hasn't come out yet, so I say all this with a certain amount of trepidation, as the 3rd movie could veer off in some completely different direction, rendering my interpretations invalid. There's a ""revolution"" brewing at the end of the 2nd movie and if a ""revolution"" happens, that could mean The Hunger Games goes off in a direction that goes against the Zeitgeist of our time. Because at least here in the US, ""revolution"" is impossible -- the US has the world's largest prison population, the world's largest, most powerful and most militarized police, not to mention the world's most powerful and technologically advanced military. Perhaps the political system in the world of The Hunger Games is more fragile, and such a thing as a ""revolution"" is possible.The Hunger Games series is a work of genius.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
520,rrfsantos,I actually liked it better than the original,10,1 June 2016,"I loved the movie, but what I don't like is that people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale (which I guess is true, but not completely and exactly the same) Catching Fire is awesome, I loved the cast (especially the new ones) and the action is pretty amazing. But why do people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale?!! It's not the same, sure it shares similar traits, but that doesn't make it a ripoff. But it's awesome, and sorry, but it seems better than Twilight (not completely sure, never saw Twilight, so I can't guarantee that.)Anyway, the characters are awesome, the Quarter Quell is a twist that was awesome. And, no more shaky cameras (even though I didn't notice that very well.) This film is by far the best of the franchise. Even better than The Fault in Our Stars, though it didn't seem like it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I'm sure there's a few teenage girls out there whom just rage quit this review, but I digress. This review isn't about the first Hunger Games movie. It is in-fact about ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" the first sequel in a quadrilogy of movies based on a trilogy of books by Suzane Collins. While I'm not going to claim this movie is cinematic gold (it's not even close), I will say it was highly entertaining. Catching fire really stepped up the story from it's predecessor. There was far less mindless action scenes, and far more goosebumps on my arms as we follow a nation on the brink of revolution. That's not to say there isn't a fair amount of action in this movie, cause in-fact there is. I'm just saying the action in Catching Fire feels far more relevant, as compared to the first movie. The revolution in Panem is knocking at the door, and looking for Katniss as it's leader. Check out more of my reviews over at WatchPlayRead!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

And those that love the film actually read the books. I can understand if you hadn't read one page of the books why the films might irritate you. It isn't the films fault. It is your fault. READ the books! Guess what? The films will make more sense? And it is to the Directors credit that the films are so like the books, enough that the true fans love the movies as much as they love the books. So to all you haters: pick up a book! Read!

523,iambic-pentameter,For those wondering...,9,22 November 2013,"..if this is better than The Hunger Games? Yes, oh yes it is. The Hunger Games was a fantastic opening to this epic franchise and Catching Fire wastes no time in going bigger while taking advantage of its massive $140 million budget.The games themselves seem so much more intense this time round, where danger is literally right around every corner. The budget has gloriously afforded Panem and all the districts to be fleshed out in both colour and scale. Jennifer Lawrence goes above and beyond in her role of Katniss. She has rooted herself firmly in this franchise as the star player and makes precious every moment of screen time she is given.While Josh Hutcherson has come into his own playing the more underlining emotions of rejection and his acknowledgment of it. A very welcome element to Catching Fire is the humour. As the plot is quite dark, these moments allow the audience to relax a bit!Catching Fire is very slick in terms of building tension. It always feels as if it is going somewhere, and the climax echoes this nicely, which left me reaching for a copy of Mockingjay, desperate to find out what happens next!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The movie itself is not bad and has a good cast. But the ending is abrupt and you will not feel like you had watched a complete movie. it is like an episode in an TV series. This is the way all the big companies earn their money and not good for the audience. there is not much action scenes and the plot drags in the expected way. The movie lost the novelty and this movie is just another run of the mill movie. Go with less expectation and you may be rewarded.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The first part of the film is important because it provides background information, as well as some important things. It also develops the characters and gives us an insight as to what is happening in Panem. This is obviously crucial to the plot of Mockingjay. I saw somebody say that it was predictable, but I don't think so. When I read the book I was shocked when the Quarter Quell was announced. It is also a good opportunity to add characters like Finnick and Johanna. Someone also said that it was boring, which I find very hard to believe. It's quite the opposite! Watch if you can!

I found myself using the fast forward on my remote. The hype over the movie was all it had going for it. I saw the first hunger games and would give that a 6. I guess I expected more. The acting was good but the movie seemed to drag and I lost interest quickly. The special effects were good but they couldn't save the very poor story line. I don't think my criteria for at least a good movie is out of touch with the rest of the world. Many of my coworkers said the same. It was boring and difficult to get interested in.

Dark people are playing game with nice ones and it's just going to be revolution against dark ones and... ugh It's reminding me of Hollywood's lame fight against Communism during cold war era.

I am a normal real-life movie buff who likes to SEE it before READING it.And I am happy to say, I am not disappointed. The movie is the best book-to-movie adaptation and overcomes all the flaws from the first movie. Performances become strong, Music is pacy with the story, Screenplay keeps you gripped to the screen, Visual Effects are much better than the first movie and best in class too. To sum it up, 140 Mills well spent and its a treat. At the climax, the movie keeps you wanting for more and that lays the foundation for the final lap of this film.Supporting characters are also the important glue that hold the story together.

533,lafavesj-139-607849,Great Movie!,9,24 November 2013,"I've also never read the books, so I'm judging the films for what they are. As pure entertainment, this film was very good, although in my opinion if someone were to see it without the benefit of having seen the first film, they would be pretty lost. The writing was done well, the acting was OK (no Oscar nods here), and the costumes as well as visuals were what you'd expect from a large budget film these days. SPOILER ALERT: A few plot points that I found odd....the game director has the island spin to keep the combatants from knowing which direction was 12 o'clock, but this is never utilized in the film. Also, Katneis tells Gale she can't even think of telling him she loves him with all that she has going on (leaving me to think they have hope of ending up in love), THEN kisses Peeta as if she loves him as well. She also seems to have an endless supply of arrows in her quiver, and when she gets picked up by the ship towards the end of the film, all of the blood on her neck is gone and her uniform is not torn. I thought the film ended with a lot unanswered, so not being a fan of sequels that don't stand on their own...I can't say I applauded the end credits. I really feel Phillip Seymor Hoffman as well as Donald Sutherland are being underused in their roles, and would have liked to see the newly introduced granddaughter become pivotal to the plot.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

If you like this movie, go read the books. Harry potter/ Eragon/ Percy Jackson/ Avatar, all missed major details. But in this movie only minor details were missing. And those weren't even really necessary, they made a great comeback from the Hunger Games. I cried during their visit to district 11.

This movie was awesome! It satisfies both the readers and the viewers. I'm going to talk from a reader's view, because I'm a big fan of the books. Imagine that every detail is mentioned in the movie, every scene, every outfit, every fight. It illustrates your imagination to the maximum limit. You will think about the movie for at least a week. The new director Francis Lawrence (I am legend, Water For Elephants)made all the difference. The graphics, the visuals, and the details will make you watch the movie one more time, and believe me, it will be worth it. The acting is just perfect, Jennifer Lawrance is proving one more time that she is one of the best in her generation, I wouldn't be surprised if she wins another Oscar very soon. I thought it was impossible to fall more in love with Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, but nothing is impossible with this guy! Sam Claffin as Finnick proved that he isn't just a pretty boy with nice abs, and Jenna Malone as Johanna was just hilarious!I rated it as 9 out of 10 because of the music, everything was perfect but the music was only good.I told my friends once I finished watching it, that the difference between The Hunger Games and Catching Fire is the same as the difference between Twilight and Lord of The Rings.

536,a-andrew900,A fantastic sequel to a franchise that is indeed catching fire.,9,28 November 2013,"To start, i was a fan of the Hunger Games despite it's poorly directed and edited overall result; the characters being established and somewhat molded, the games being somewhat violent (if you could keep up with director Senor Shaky Cam's attempt at PG-13 violence) yet well paced, and it's overall well set yet un-established tone. That being said, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a much different animal altogether, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) helming the project, it's clear that the course of the movie took a darker, more mature direction. The pacing is amazing overall; each character within the cast, even within the other victors', has somewhat of an overall impact within the story and the main cast has some fantastic moments. SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEADWhen the movie begins, you can tell within the first 30 minutes that Lawrence knows exactly where he wants this film to go and how he wants it done. The Peacekeepers establish an almost Holocaust-Esq ghetto within district 12, violence and punishment being the key components to beating down a potential rebellion.The first hour and half features no victor-on-victor deaths, but makes this movie receive the review i give it for it's knowledge of political awareness within it's universe. It's clear that the Capitol has it's own agenda and does not wish to include anyone but themselves with it's undertaking. The special effects rock, and each main allied victor (Beetee, Finnick, Johanna, Mags and Wiress) gives a solid and memorable performance. This film sets hopes for Mockingjay to be one of the best installments within a franchise; the hope riding on everyone's shoulders is that the odds for it will really be in it's favor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I went into this movie as a moviegoer hoping that I would be pleased by the films adaptation onto the big screen. I loved the first movie, it was great and well done, but I am highly disappointed by this sequel. Of course, the acting was great, but the movie itself, was very boring and stretched out. I could care less if it is like the book or not, since I did not read. It had some funny parts in this movie but that was the only thing that caught my eye. There is pretty much 40-50 useless minutes at the beginning of the film before they even start the games. They use cheesiness throughout the film which makes it laughable and unbearable. Don't get me wrong, I went into this film expecting very highly of the film and was very disappointed. I went in believe what the ""fan girls"" of the movie said. They said it was ""the best movie ever!!"" or ""very awesome!"". Overall, don't waste your money seeing it in theaters. Wait until you can rent it at home or even watch it on television. It is not a must see movie as people suggest. Also, I only paid 3 dollars for my movie ticket to see this, so that is saying something.

I was really nervous about seeing this film, different director usually means lots of changes! I was afraid that Francis Lawrence was going to ""freestyle"" Catching Fire and not reference the book like the first director did, but I can say without holding back that, FRANCIS LAWRENCE KILLED IT!!!The directing was amazing! The cinematography was incredible! The script was real! The acting was SPECTACULAR!!! Costume, ON POINT and STUNNING!!! Katniss's wedding dress and entrance fire dress was BEAUTIFUL! FIERCE! and SEXY! Effie's costumes..HILARIOUS!!! This film definitely had me entertained throughout the entire film! But, there were some rather intense moments in the film. But, i mean it in the best way possible! Francis Lawrence deserves an A+ for suspense! Jennifer Lawrence deserves an Oscar nomination for her raw performance! The entire cast, including the extras, were INCREDIBLE! The Hunger Games: Catching Fire dropped my jaw at least twice! Right when you think it's going to all be fine and good, everyone's walking away...BOOM!!! Francis Lawrence definitely did not hold back, and neither did Jennifer Lawrence. With the new director also came some new Visual Effects! I really was proud of the VFX team on this film, they took it to a whole new level! The modeling and texturing was amazing and realistic, and THE FIRE was FIRE!!! In the first film, the fire didn't really look like fire. I'm very pleased that they improved on the realism of the flames on her dress. The arena was beautiful, as if it had been pulled straight out of the book! And even the SFX make up artist did an amazing job!The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is thrilling throughout, it WILL keep you at the edge of your seat, guaranteed! With an amazing ending, it leads us perfectly into MockingJay. The Hunger Games is a film that everyone can enjoy, even if you haven't read the book, you're still in for an original treat! The Hunger Games: Catching Fire deserves a 5 star rating in my opinion! And I hope the film continues to shred up the box office!!! Happy Hunger Games...and my the odds be NEVER in your favor!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
539,gumby507,Catching Fire,8,24 November 2013,"As a person who has read all three books, ""Catching Fire"", the movie was an entertaining experience. I myself would have liked to have seen certain instances from the book that did not make the final film but I can understand why they were cut out.For the people who have not read the books, this sequel was everything the first movie gave us and more. It had action, it had emotion and it had twists to the plot. I would go see it.For the book readers, this movie was a fair representation of the novel. Go see it!I can't wait for the third installment of the series.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
540,mimi-kj,A strong film with a weak ending.,7,20 December 2013,"Jennifer Lawrence returns in the Hunger Games: Catching Fire, as Katniss Everdeen, and once again stuns with her brilliance. Her acting is just so believable, and I love the part where Jennifer Lawrence's random character shines through when another Hunger Games champion strips. The film basically continues on a year after the Hunger Games. Trouble is brewing in the Districts of Panem and there are uprisings against the Capital. President Snow is not happy about the uprisings and orders Katniss to present a unified front with the Capital on her tour round the Districts. Katniss and Peeta, having spent a year trying to recover from the traumas of the Games, are forced to tour the Districts and pledge their allegiance with the Capital - under President Snow's careful watch. Unfortunately this is unsuccessful, and despite their best efforts to act as a loving couple, Snow decides to end the uprising by killing off the Districts' hero, Katniss. He declares that the 75th Hunger Games will be a fight to the death for past champions. It is a good film that is a very nice translation of the book. The actors are brilliant, it is entertaining and full of action. It is lovely to see the change in Effie Trinket, because she had seemed so cold in the first one and she really tries to connect with Katniss and Peeta - which really shows how the Capital loses its unity. It turns out that there is a conspiracy against the Capital, and some of the Champions help to protect Katniss during the games. The Games is weirdly short, it should really be given more time on screen. Unfortunately they don't explain the secret plan very well and it is left hanging, not really explained and not really built up well enough. Gail is there for some reason, even though Katniss has made it clear she loves Peeta. The ending is abrupt and it felt like a really unnatural ending. I gave it 7 out of 10 because I could watch Jennifer Lawrence all day, but the film needed to be organised a little better. The ending also needed to be changed so that it felt like more of a natural and exciting ending.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
541,redglitterbomb,Love it! True to the books!,9,28 January 2014,"I 100% love this movie. Not only does it follow true to the books, it also has great use of cinematography! The actors are great choice, and really play their parts well. The opening scene is shot superbly, on the lake with the sunrise.As for the bad reviews from people already, especially those slating the film for an abrupt ending... First of all, it's part of a series of films and it's leading you to the next film - Of course they're going to leave you with a cliffhanger, it's what they want for you to want to see more! And secondly, it follows true to the book and it's also how the book ends. Jennifer Lawrence has definitely come far and will become a much wanted leading lady in future movies. She plays the part of Katniss superbly, being raw and showing little emotion and showing the correct emotion we feel from the book when needed. I even welled up when she was talking to Rue's family and district!Love, love, love the Hunger Games series and I can't wait to see the final instalments.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
542,jcolucci0105,It's exactly what you think,8,25 November 2013,"I really enjoyed The Hunger Games so I was excited to see Catching Fire. Was it a good entertaining film, yes of course. If you liked the first film should you see this one? Again, yes of course.This film takes place about a year later and revolves around the winners Katniss and Peeta and the approaching 75th annual hunger games. What I didn't like is that the first half of the film is exactly like the first movie. Don't get me wrong, I love character building and most movies suffer from the lack of character building but should I dare say that between these two film there might be too much character building? That's for you to decide.All in all, once things get rolling it is a suspenseful, and plot twisting ride. The first half of the film is more of the same old same old, Katness is reluctant, Peeta is confused but then once the 75th Hunger Games gets underway you won't want the film to end.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
543,jacomurray141,"Impressive, really impressive",9,24 November 2013,"I loved the first Hunger Games, it made me go and read all of the books. Catching Fire was my favorite book in the HG series. There was a lot I really wanted to see on-screen, and the twist was the main one. I was really satisfied with how the twist was executed, Katniss being pulled up by the ship as the arena was falling to bits was just so well done. One of the only bad things was they did not show Haymitches game, like they did it the book, but a movie can only go for so long. The acting was superb, you don't see great acting like this these days, and Jennifer Lawrence was especially amazing, I mean she was great in the first, but this was just so great. The thing I liked about the movie that the book did not do was, it enhanced the emotions a lot, I'm not saying the book was not like that, it is just that the movie did it better. Another thing the movie improved on was actually making Johanna likable, well for me at least. In the book I hated Johanna, I don't know why I just did, but in the movie I actually kink of liked her. Another thing I loved about this movie was the CGI was used wisely, not used for every damn thing and not used for things that would be simple to do without CG which is really rare these days.Overall this movie was amazing, better than the first movie, it was better than the book in my opinion. Kudos to the director Francis Lawrence and the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence for this masterpiece.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
544,mishty27,Intense from beginning to end,9,7 December 2013,"The movie felt like 5 hours because so much was happening, and I mean that in a good way. I felt so many emotions in the nearly 2 and a half hours that I was watching it that it felt like a much longer movie.This movie has a lot more depth and themes running through it than the previous one did. They really showed emotions and the psychological aftermath of everything the Hunger Games does to the survivor. Reading the negative reviews posted by some of the critics I have to say that they haven't really used all of their senses when they watched the movie and that's why they seemed to think that it was dry or that the dialogue was lacking. Or perhaps they haven't watched the first movie at all or were unable to keep track of the various key turning points. In any case don't let the negative reviews put you off.In this movie you get revolution, dissent, rebellion, courage, fear, real hurt and terrorism. You get psychological damages affecting the different actors, you get problems in love. Probably not a good movie to watch if you cant keep up with more than one theme or problem at a time.The acting was quite good given the heavy demands made on the characters, the story was presented clearly. Thank God this wasn't in 3D. All in all it was an intense and emotional movie. I loved it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
545,zalaa2000,it is simply amazing,9,21 November 2013,"I really love the movie, it is so close to the story yet so different, the actors all have added a touch to the characters in a way you do not read in the story which makes it a great experience.The graphics was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence gave Katniss the strength we missed in the novel plus lets face the facts.. she is really sexy :)Now the reason I did not give it 10 out of 10 is not really because of the film it self, it is rather things that I wish it will be considered in the third movie, first, I would prefer to sense more evil from Donald Sutherland; he played President Snow perfectly and was pleasant to see on the screen, yet, I don't believe he was evil enough, maybe more anger will help. Also I would love to see Woody Harrelson more drunk and more active, he also did an excellent role as Haymitch, the mentor and the friend, yet, he was not drunk enough in the movie, he had a bigger role on the story and did a better acting on the first movie, there were also a very very bad acting scene during the first 15 minutes in which Katniss through water at him, his reaction was really bad and did not sell it. let us not forget that his role on Mockingjay will be huge. Finally, I would have loved to see more from Cinna, we barely see him, although the character is really important all through the novel, I do understand that even on the novel, his character does not appear much, but it is mentioned so many times in Katniss thoughts.In general, it is a movie that I will watch over and over and over again, I loved it and cannot wait to Mockingjay to be released :)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
546,lochircof,"Dark, scary, intense-- wasn't expecting that",8,21 December 2013,"This movie shocked me at how crazy it was. It truly is a thrill ride, and much, much darker and scarier that the first one. There isn't as much on screen violence, rather it is implied, except now the main source of violence is riots/ riot patrol. Citizens are taken away (death implied, off-screen) if they are seen as rebels, which leads to the film having deeper implications beneath the plot. Topics touched by this film include the causes/effects of a corrupt government, differentiating between honest people and people who will hurt you, and so much more. This is one of those movies where you grow attached to certain characters, and sometimes you get your heart ripped out. One of the only main problems is that it ends in ""to-be-continued"" form (obviously, as it is a series), but that is okay, because it will just pump you up for Mockingjay! Anyway, this movie is a must-see, even if you don't read the books (I do not) and although it will never be nominated for Best Picture, it is perhaps one of my top 7 films of the year.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
547,jflo12,Catching Fire has spread its flames,10,1 December 2013,"Well what can I say. I'm not some prolific writer, so I'm just going to say it. This movie was awesome. The first movie was pretty good, but it wasn't great. Catching Fire, on the other hand, tops it almost every way. Acting was excellent, story was really good, music, visuals, makeup all of it. When I read the book I though the first half outside the games was good, but I got a little bored at times. But the movie makes it a whole lot more interesting in their adaption. I almost liked it more than the Games themselves. Oh yeah, the Games. They were the highlight of the film, way less boring than the forest of the first film. But I wont spoil its design. Thought provoking themes along with an awesome story, definitely worth checking out.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
548,Ink777,In-freaking-credible!,10,28 November 2013,"This was a truly amazing movie! It translated the book in a TRULY remarkable way! I'd say it's pretty necessary to see the first movie first, and it would assist you immensely to read the first and second book prior to watching this film (and reading the first book before the first film would also be better for you). This is actually much better than the first movie, in my opinion. The PG-13 rating is very appropriate for it, and anyone under the age of maybe eleven or twelve should not see it, as the movie is highly intense and what the characters experience and endure is teenager and above material (same goes for the first movie and the books). The movie Catching Fire has got to be one of the best book- to-film movies I've ever seen! It was definitely worth the two hour wait to see it!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
549,vrk98,I was in total awe of the way I felt. I haven't seen this good of a movie in a while.,10,22 November 2013,"I could not even explain the feelings this movie gave me. It was spot on with the book. I admit there could have been a little more time added onto the movie because the book explained a lot more with the arena and time zones, but it was so spot on! I was extremely satisfied and VERY happy with the film's turn out. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson's performances were outstanding along with the other victors for the Quarter Quell! I have to say, I'm also very happy with the pick of Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He is very intimidating at times and always plays a GREAT liar... Finnick (Sam Claflin) was exactly how I would have hoped for him to be, and exactly what I had imagined as I read the books. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks did quite well too, and the setting of the film was mind blowing. The action was great and it was just how I imagined it, but BETTER. A few of the characters I felt would have looked different but not too much. They even succeeded in making me feel confused on what was going on in the end, even though I read the books! I could just go on and on with how happy I am with the turn out of the film. I did wish there was a little more Katniss/Peeta time , but we have yet to see more. Also when the districts rose their signs of peace during speeches my heart melted and dropped. Especially Jennifer's performance in Rue's district. The movie had my chest twisting and pounding throughout the whole film. I cannot wait at all for the next movie! I didn't know what I'd do after Harry Potter was done, I could survive without Twilight. Hunger Games is probably my favorite next to Harry Potter. The cliff hanger has left me in Hunger Games withdraw and I will be crossing my fingers waiting for the next golden film to come out. And there is a GREAT special effect at the end! *I swear President Snow showed Katniss a clip of her and Peeta when they were old kissing somehow when he visited her village and I need clarification on what that was...* !!! - Small summary of movie- !!! Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have just settled down after their close run in on death after the 74th Hunger games. Living in the quiet Victors Village, they try and deal with the mental confusion and instability the games have left them in. Thinking it's all over, President Snow announces the plans for the 75th Quarter Quell... all victors must return. One female and one male that have survived the games. Katniss must find a way to get through this again, and also, prove her love was real to the people after a threat on her family from President Snow. They must overcome everything and put behind them the past and worry about their new problem. Right under Katniss' nose (and President Snow) though, the victors have formed a certain alliance in place to keep her safe. She is hope for the new world. She is... the Mockingjay.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
550,vagia1992,better be burned,5,29 September 2014,"I don't understand why all this noise about this film and why it has so high rating in IMDb. It is one of the Hollywood-HIGH BUDGET trashes. Why some people can' t open their eyes and distinguish a good movie from this garbage. The whole idea about 12 poor districts and kids fight each other is pointless and silly. It doesn't give any message and doesn't have any interest. The dialogs are short without any meaning and the directing is bad...I think the second movie is worse than the first, so long and boring and so predictable. Unfortunately there will be another two movies which I am NOT going to see. I don' t want to waste my time.The 5 goes for some scenes that can be tolerable and for the acting of the cast.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
551,JohnSmith5412,A Spectacular Movie,9,31 March 2014,"Catching Fire was a phenomenal follow-up to the first movie. It was a lot less romantic, with much more focus on the real problem with Panem: the Capitol's totalitarian rule over the districts. Philip Seymour Hoffman nailed the role of Plutarch Heavensbee, bringing a sense of calm to the story, even though he's the head Gamemaker. The relationships Katniss forms while in the arena, both with Peeta and with the other tributes, adds much more depth to this film, compared to the first installment. With the next two installments on the way, the cliffhanger ending for this movie leaves everyone in the audience disappointed: not by the quality of the movie, but by the fact that it has to end and they have to wait for the next movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
552,btw_912,Good adaptation of a bad story,5,21 November 2013,"OVERRATED!! I cant believe that everybody thinks that is the best movie of the year, because is not, at all. Even if it is a very good adaptation of the book, the story sucks, the first book and movie were fine, but not awesome, the second is just a bad sequel and the third, well it gets worst than ever. I have to mention that even if Jennifer won an Oscar, it doesn't mean that every character that she plays is a great job, in this case Katniss is just another character The story and the saga in general shows that Hollywood's industry is just desesperated about get another story that gives tons of money, Everybody with a little of common sense knows that it just promote the consumism to the new generations. the worst thing of all is that the youth thinks that they read too much because they read The Hunger Games, but is just CHEAP LITERATURE, and Commercial films. Catching Fire just shows to the world the lack of creativity of the author after the amazing Hunger Games. In some point of the movie and the book you realize that everybody behind the project wants much more money, and that they only will make 4 movies to get a fortune. Catching Fire is a very good adaptation of a bad story in every single way. The movie only shows to the world that much of the actual public just wants the most superficial and bad movies of all time, even if in this time there are masterpieces such as Gravity and Captain Phillips",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I know this movie is trying to express a lot insights, controlling, love, friendship or whatever. But, obviously, at least i don't go to threat to learn a lesson, i go to theater to have fun. First hour, totally make me feel asleep. Game started after 1.15 hour and only last like 25 minutes. A lot strange person wear strange cloth, didn't find any beauty about that. Wedding dress is pretty though. Give this movie 2 points instead of 1 is because the actress played a good role, at least she expressed her emotion pretty well, though she is not pretty",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
555,anthonywaynesteel,Amazing! (A book fan review),8,25 November 2013,"First of all, I have been anticipating this movie for almost a year long and it was well-worth the wait! After watching the first movie, I started reading the books with lots of excitement. Then the second movie finally came out and with a huge success.Director: Who would have thought that a director like Francis Lawrence can make something so good? Where he usually directs music videos for Britney Spears, Will Smith, Sarah McLachlan etc. Although, I like his directing and looking forward to see more. Acting: Jennifer Lawrence has shown great performance with the character Katniss Everdeen. She knows very well on how to show the sad emotion running through Katniss's current life of pretending to love Peeta after the incident with the berries for her own protection. Not to mention, the anger that also haunts her and in her dreams. Josh Hutcherson, on the other hand is acting well as Peeta Mellark, the one who is always good with words and the meaning they all carry. He also plays the part well where he is confused of whether or not Katniss really loves him or is just pretending. Woody Harrelson's character is funny, smart, serious and exciting at the same time, Haymitch Abernathy as the mentor of Katniss and Peeta. Well done.I also liked Donald Sutherland's performance a lot as the brutal President Snow, who rules the cruel and violent Capital that is fighting against the districts in an uprising. Last but not least, Johanna Mason, she was one of my favorite characters in the movie. Jena Malone played her so well with an entertaining rebellious attitude.Bigger and better budget:Thanks to a $140 000 000, everything looks awesome. The outfits were very well designed, like the moment when Katniss spun in her wedding dress then suddenly it setting on fire while turning into a Mocking-jay suit, epic! The CGI has also improved a lot, from the Capital city to all the way to the arena and it's exciting turns and dangers. Story-line/script:The script was well-written and stayed quite true to the book. As I was watching the movie, it had a great feel to it while watching so there was never a dull moment. Another thing that I liked a lot about the movie is the fact that it didn't feel like it took forever just to get to the arena, it came with good timing. The ending:This was one of my absolute favorite parts in the entire movie. Jennifer Lawrence plays the part so well when she attaches the wire to the arrow, aims upward then shooting it into the arena sky, just as the lighting hits the tree that results in her being thrown across the ground and destroying the arena itself! We then literally see the system losing full power over the arena and President Snow in shock. Then parts of the ""sky"" start to break as the hovercraft is in progress to save Katniss. Meanwhile, there is an awesome close-up of Katniss's face and we see in the back ground parts of the falling ""sky"" catching fire that well represents her as ""The Girl on Fire"".Soon after wards, she goes crazy after waking up on the Hovercraft where Haymitch reveals the big secret plan to her and Plutarch Heavensbee is forced to inject her to fall asleep. Finally, she wakes up again with Gale along her side where he tells her that District 12 has been fire bombed and no longer exists. Here we again see a close-up view of Katniss's face and we see it turn from sad emotions to a furious expression on her face and in her eyes showing that she wants to destroy the Capital... All-in-all, this movie is amazing, with great script, stunning acting, successful directing, a well spent budget and it will not disappoint. My opinion: 8.4/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
556,apparidown,A Bad Two Part Telly Movie All AT Once!,3,29 May 2014,"No, no ,no! This is way too long and has very little to say which hasn't already been said much, much better! It's basically an ordinary two part TV movie all at once. If those who think this was an exciting film because of the 'hunting humans' element, then I recommend Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto' which is pretty much the best 'chase/hunting/human' film ever made. There are real comparisons to be made with Apocalypto. However this film lacks any believable plot and genuine nail biting tension, except for the poison fog sequence. There's something 'plastic' about everything in the film, especially the violence....it's all so forgettable, where Apocalypto is a film you're not likely to ever forget. This film is certainly not worth the accolades given it and the 7.8 here at www.IMDb.com, which is the same as Gibson's movie, which was trashed by the critics for reasons that never applied! Clearly one work is truly outstanding in every respect while the other is a bit of a fraud in every respect and not worth the time!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
557,undeadnubs,A Vast Improvement,10,23 November 2013,"This... this exceeded my expectations.Before going to this film I was not aware that there was a different director for this film.Francis Lawrence, I applaud you.I read all the Hunger Games books in a week because they were so fantastic. I thought the first movie was pretty good. Maybe a 7. But I didn't think it really held true to the book too much. I went to see Catching Fire because I wanted to see the book redone in movie form as it was with the first. I wasn't expecting the masterpiece that I saw.Francis Lawrence has taken our beloved Hunger Games, and completely perfected it. It's as if he took it page by page. It was such a perfect rendition of the book. The shaky cameras that battered the first movie were gone. Jennifer Lawrence once again did an unbelievable job with her acting. I'm a guy, and I am not afraid to admit I teared up during the Rue speech and the scene on the beach with Peeta. It was so emotional and realistic and beautiful. Katniss' emotional struggle between the rebellion and Peeta and Gale almost felt like I was experiencing them. It felt like it truly mattered to me.Throughout the movie I had tunnel vision on the screen. I couldn't pull my eyes off this movie. It had become my new reality. On a smaller note, the action and effects were fantastic.I sincerely hope that Francis Lawrence is directing the last film.I could go on and on about why this movie is amazing. I can tell you a lot of extremely hard work and care went into this film. So instead of reading this review, you should be grabbing your car keys and heading out the door to see it yourself.And may the odds, be ever in your favor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
558,alwc37-856-350140,It does a lot right,9,28 November 2013,"With so many big name movies already out this year, it can be easy to forget about those that are still left. For me that was this movie. Until I was invited out to see it, I had actually forgotten it was even coming out anytime soon. After reading the books though, I will admit I was more then a little excited to see the movie. For me this was the book that sold me on the franchise. While I liked the idea behind the first one, this is where the story finally starts to form. Without spoiling anything, this should be the best movie in the series. So did it live up to that? Let me start by talking about the new director. Francis Lawrence takes over for Gary Ross, and it is a great change. I had nothing against Ross or the artistic direction he took in the first film. However this one felt more, well more professional. To me the first movie was done in a style you don't normally see in big budget flicks. And I am not just talking about the shaky cam most people seemed to have a issue with. From the way they tried to show the oppressive nature of the peace keepers and the Capitol, to the camera work and the pacing. Everything just felt better in this movie. Instead of using shaky cam, weird angles, and other tactics to try and elicit emotion; Lawrence uses other means. Better pacing, better timing, solid camera work that does not take away from what is going on. The difference was far more noticeable then I thought it would be. If you saw the first film, you know what to expect as far as acting goes. Jennifer Lawrence still knows what she is doing, and does very well. She brings a lot of emotion into this movie, and has more then a few stand out moments. Josh Hutcherson, who I tend not to like, did very well also. He was more likable in this movie, and seems to be growing as a actor. As most of this film was not action, and more drama, I was a little worried about that. Kravitz is still amazing, and Harrelson turns in a good performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman took me by surprise though. I don't remember his character in the book having the presence he did in the movie. He was delightfully unlikable, and yet you loved him at the same time.Speaking of the movie being more drama then action, I would like to talk about the story a little. I don't want to get into spoilers, so let me just talk about the tone of the film. This is a very depressing movie, from start to finish. When you start to see something good forming, it rips it away. This is actually what makes the film so good though. They really draw you in and make you care about the peoples struggles. From the killings, to the torture, nothing is shown in great detail....but it still really gets to you. Emotion is a powerful tool,and they use it to turn a fairly simple story into something you care about. When it does finally shift into action mode, around the final third of the film, that emotion stays with it. While there are special effects before the fighting starts, they are more noticeable late in the film. From some crazy fog, to cool forcefields, this one gets it right. Everything looked great, and yes That includes Katniss's fancy dresses. As far as the fighting goes, you don't see a lot of the actual killing. Most of the times you see the beginning, and the after math. Guessing this is a ratings thing, but it doesn't detract from anything either. You still have plenty of tension and suspense.I saw online where you could order the soundtrack to the film. After seeing it though, I can't imagine what that would comprise of. Most of the movie is silent, I don't actually remember anytime a song was playing in the background. I felt the silence added quite a bit to the overall effect. It made you feel uneasy at times, or more into what was going on on screen at others. Who me ever scored this film did a great job by going with the minimalist approach. So we have a stronger overall film then the first. Better camera work, better acting. Better story, that begins to get at the overall idea of what the series is all about. Great effect when used, and solid audio work. And a very sad and angering movie that keeps you entranced for its duration. Honestly I don't see the franchise getting better then this entry. If you enjoyed the First one, you will like this one to. If you loved the book, this does a good job with it.It does pretty much everything right. Well worth your money.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
559,Psychogene,Mediocre movie that is not deserving of 2 plus hrs.,5,29 November 2013,"I came into this movie with no expectations as I have not seen the first one and when the movie ended it felt more like 3 hours then 2 1/2 hours.The first 90 minutes or so dragged on with what seemed like a lot of monotonous dialogue and very little plot. The movie picked up a little in the last 30 minutes but not enough to make up for the first 90 minutes of dullness.I can't really fault the acting it was OK for this type of movie, but the plot and the pacing of the movie was so slow I zoned out more then once wondering if this is ever going to end. Towards the end of the movie I could care less about the fate of certain individuals.Definitely forgettable and I don't understand the rating it got at all.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

First, you need to know the point of view from which I approached this movie...in order to understand why I rated it awful. I did not read the books. I did not read any of the books. In fact, I can't remember a single book I have read in the past 10 years or so. I *DID* however see the first movie in the series, Hunger Games. I went to see Hunger Games only because I'd read it was a really good movie. I was NOT disappointed. Hunger Games (the first movie) was one of the best movies I have ever seen! 10/10, simply awesome!!!In fact, it was because I enjoyed the FIRST movie so much that I felt I definitely had to see the SECOND movie in the theater. And so I went to the second movie knowing NOTHING about it, other than having remembered that the first movie was awesome...The first hour or so of Catching Fire was pretty boring. But it was easy to sit through it, as it was building anticipation for the action that you knew was coming. And oh yes, there was plenty of action to come later. But just as quickly as the action started, the action ended.In fact, as the credits were rolling, I was glued to my seat. I was refusing to believe that it was over.I've had a couple of days to ponder how to review this movie. At first, I was thinking something along the lines of... ""It seems like the producers ran out of money halfway through filming, but decided to release it unfinished anyway..."" But later, I realized... What I'd just watched (Catching Fire) was actually a two-hour trailer for Hunger Games 3.No conclusion of plot here, just setting up plot for a future movie. I paid 10 bucks to watch a trailer. I feel ripped off.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
561,horror_rocks13,Unexpected & Entertaining,8,2 January 2014,"***ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SMALL NON-SPECIFIC SPOILERS, SO I AM WARNING YOU JUST IN CASE :) ***The sequel of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, is no doubt one of the most exciting movies of 2013. It gives a really interesting twist to the cross-lovers story that so easily won over all our hearts in the first movie. Although I have to admit I would rather have seen more of the ""arena stuff"", I think that the movie as a whole catches your attention from beginning to end, and leaves you wanting more. Plus the ending gives you an idea of conspiracy, and not knowing anymore who is good or who is bad. No one is to trust anymore on the Hunger Games. Let's wait impatiently for the third one!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
562,nader-david,Best movie I ever watched,10,30 January 2014,"Literally the best movie I ever watched. I was late in watching it and I feared that since I heard such positive reviews I would be going into it with over optimism and will be disappointed, I was wrong, it exceeded even my high expectations. You need to watch the first one to understand the second fully. The characters evolved in a very nice way. I can't wait till next November when the new movie in this series will be released. Basically the nightmare of the hunger games that has been following Katniss for such a long time actually becomes a reality again when she is forced to do it a second time, but this time the focus is not on the games but on a bigger issue.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

564,Jadetw,"Mindblowingly Intense, Absolutely Stunning",9,20 February 2014,"Firstly I would like to state I am an extreme ""fan"" of the books. I was completely in awe by the plot and to this day obsess over it. The writing and books gave me a vague idea of what to expect in the movie, but the first one was utterly disappointing and really awful. However, I was hoping he second movie would redeem itself and this it did. Catching Fire has an intense plot; it's eventful and is full of deeper meanings yet keeping humour and entertainment throughout. Although it's a rather long movie I admit they crammed an awful lot into it. The book contains so much and I do feel as if the first half was rushed or briefed over too quickly. I'm not sure how exactly it would interpreted to somebody who hadn't read the books, but I do advise it as the storyline is difficult to follow. Not all of the details were in included but what was, was finely executed. The casting was most definitely flawless and suited to the emotions and back stories of individuals. Ultimately I would recommend Catching Fire to anybody. Jennifer Lawrence will capture you into the cruelty of her time and make you understand the society now and in comparison to the deep scars of Panem.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

It is not gruesome at all, sure there is blood, if you know what the movie is about then you should expect some blood.

566,matteocatilo2905,No less than 9... The Movie of the Year,8,13 May 2014,"Outstanding, an excellent masterpiece with a polished design from the previous movie. A both emotional, moving and tense thriller. The beginning was a bit bland but the rest was full of suspense and pure action. The acting is amazing, the plot much so. Outstanding. I really enjoyed how President Snow visited Katniss and threatened her death, the arena was thrilling and the end were she destroys the arena is unbelievable. On the whole, Francis Lawrence and the gang should be truly proud of what they have produced. Once again, the first 20 minutes is a bit dull but I know that was to add some build up and development to the characters, and without it it wouldn't be the same. I don't see why its getting bad reviews.On the whole, polished to perfection, tense, thrilling, action-packed and just outstanding. The movie of the year has finally taken its toll.

The first movie was done, in my opinion, perfectly. Catching Fire was a good movie too, but I didn't like it as much as the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games really stuck with me for a long time, and it is one of my favorite movies. Catching Fire just doesn't compete with it. It doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen. It was slightly boring. I got lost a few times during the movie, even though I've red the books. Still, if you enjoy The Hunger Games of course go see Catching Fire :)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

J Law really does a phenomenal job playing Katniss as the Capitol starts progressing and trying to control the districts even more. The way she develops the character of Katniss from the first movie into this movie and to the end of this movie is excellent. It's so true to the book and as an avid reader, I really appreciate that. I feel like Catching Fire had a way big budget than the Hunger games because the effects were large scale and very well done. I liked this director a lot better than the first director to tell the truth, I feel like he did everything well. There were a few things from the book that weren't in the movie, and the ""romance"" between Gale and Katniss is over exaggerated (to make a team gale, team peeta thing for 13 year old girls), but overall I thought the movie was very well done with excellent actors. If you liked the book or the first movie, go see Catching Fire. You won't be sorry.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Every scene is drowned with noise and it simply kills the film, while most viewers don't even realize this. Would have been a much better film if music was only used for effect and not to give producers more fame, but in the end that does seem to be the Hollywood way of making entertainment and it is what's killing them, apart from forced and unmerited inclusivity/ diversity.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

When we then get into the games, Oh boy!

573,imaswedha,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,10,13 May 2019,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second continuation series of its first series entitled The Hunger Games. This action genre film is adapted from the universe novel ""The Hunger Games Trilogy"" written by Suzane Cowlins. In the first series was directed by Garry Ross, this film successfully received the attention of the audience. However, in the second series, Garry decided to resign as director and was replaced by Francis Lawrence. As a director, Francis Lawrence also managed to present the second series film with great interest and depth, exceeding the achievements in the first series.
This film is played by Katnis Everdeen presents a treat for drama adventure and struggle to win the game dice in the film. In addition, the story is made more interesting by the triangle love between Katnis, Peeta and Gale. This is what makes the story in this film very deep and not boring to watch.
By making the audience thinking about the flow and storyline, this film managed to attract the attention of the audience to focus on following the story from the beginning to the end. Unlike the previous series which showed more action scenes, in this second film more highlighted the personal character that each player built.
In addition, Jennifer Lawrence as Katnis plays her character elegantly and charming. Especially when paired with Peeta, played by Josh Huston. Both of them managed to build very good chemistry so that they made the audience dissolve into the story. In addition, other players such as Gale, played by Liam, are very compatible with his authoritative and firm character. The other players who portray finnick, Johanna and President Snow etc. also make this film perfectly presented.
In terms of technical and special effects, this film shows the setting of a place that is so real and natural. In addition, the soundtrack used successfully builds the emotions of the audience when watching it.
However, at the end of this film, the audience was made dissatisfied with the very hanging ending. Maybe it was intentionally done so that the audience felt curious about the film's advanced series, and always waiting for it to come again and I really enjoy to watch this film.
Conclusion: Catching fire is one of the most interesting action films and managed to play the emotions of the audience. The film is recommended to be watched by young people who share the same spirit of warrior as the plot in this film.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

575,michaeltobrien,The Definition of a Good Sequel,10,2 June 2020,"Ever since I first saw it in theaters, Catching Fire has been one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so much better than the first one. It explores the story's political conflict more deeply and greatly expands on the dystopian universe.The new director gives it a fresh and improved vision. The first one had audiences criticizing the shaky and desaturated camerawork and this sequel fixed it. Even though one this movie involves Katniss and Peeta competing in the games again, it never feels like a repeat of the first one. They understand that viewers already know how the games work and take advantage of the chance to explore new concepts with it.Catching Fire should be an example to all filmmakers of how to do a good sequel.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
576,janewickline,Eight out of ten stars!,8,7 June 2020,"I must say, I was worried about this one. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the trilogy, but cinematically it makes absolutely no sense. The Hunger Games reads like a screenplay--Catching Fire is a meandery epic full of worldbuilding and exposition for a war that won't even begin until Mockingjay. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this installment of the hit franchise, directed by industry rookie Francis Lawrence, was maybe even more engaging than its predecessor.Visually, it is a feat. The attention to detail is remarkable. Lawrence, along with screenwriters Michael Hardt and Suzanne Collins herself, manages to weave in all of the necessary set up to the upcoming war against The Capitol without it feeling tedious or heavy-handed. The new additions to the cast, most notably Philip Seymor Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin's Finnick O'Dair, are excellent, and the dialogue is much less wooden than, forgive me, the dialogue in the books sometimes is. Moreover, it is impressive that even with so many new people and so many moving parts, the central thread of Rebellion shines through.Of course, with so much plot, so much to set up, one can hardly blame Catching Fire for falling short in the emotional department--as is, it clocks in at 2 hours and 26 minutes--but I did find myself wanting some steamier Peeta/Katniss action. I was disappointed by Lawrence's apparent disregard for the relationship between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation) and Peeta (the incomparable Josh Hutcherson). To me, Catching Fire is about Peeta. It's the Peeta show.Here's the thing: Katniss is supposed to be conflicted, not indifferent about Peeta. In the paper version, the reader, and by extension Katniss herself, feels truly torn between Gale and Peeta. She can't help but slowly fall in love with Peeta, who is so charming and funny and relentlessly Good. In this iteration, Katniss and Peeta have little to no chemistry, and Peeta only speaks when it is necessary to move the plot forward. Gale, on the other hand, is 6'4 and literally a Hemsworth. That he is a Hemsworth is no one's fault, I guess, but maybe Peeta should have been allowed to say some of the cute stuff he says in the books.The ""adults"" in the cast--Woody Harrelson's Haymitch and Donald Sutherland's President Snow have much meatier roles than they do in the books. To their credit, they are fantastic. But I can't help but wonder how much more potent this movie could have been if Lawrence had trusted his young stars a bit more with the emotional heavy lifting.Though it fell a bit short of exceptional, Catching Fire is by no means a Sophomore Slump, and I look forward to watching Mockingjay Part 1 on the big screen when it comes out!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Nothing, Absolutely nothing happens for the first 1 hour and 15 minutes. By nothing, I don't just mean no action, I mean NOTHING!.

The point of the movie is the political machine that needs the Games, and why they need the Games, and how the people are reacting to the Games. The point of the movie is the battle between Fear and Hope, and whether they defeat each other of support each other. The point of the movie is a little girl who, no matter how hard she tries not to, can't help but sow the seeds of a nationwide revolution.

582,lauraseabourne,Well done,8,4 December 2013,"I'm one of those people who read the Lord of the Rings as a child, then saw them on DVD years later and ruthlessly administered my most critical opinion on them based on their faithfulness to the books. The Hunger Games did not escape this fate. The day before Thanksgiving 2012, I picked up the first book in the series; thus, was in an absolute fog for the entire day of Thanksgiving that year. This year, I watched ""The Hunger Games"" at home, then saw ""Catching Fire"" in theaters the next day. It was, to say the least, beautiful. It seemed less stylistic than the first, probably since they switched directors and we were all denied a second, jarring handy cam experience; which, to be fair, I loved in ""The Hunger Games"" but would not have suited ""Catching Fire."" They truly raised the stakes, and that is evident in everything we are given on screen. The dialog is tighter, the sequences are neater--the really propel the plot, the costumes and make-up are genuinely divine; I read that Alexander McQueen is credited as Effie's main dress designer, which, if you even know a tiny bit about fashion (like me) speaks volumes. For two and a half hours, you will never be bored once. You know those scenes in movies that you watch the first time and think, ""I will always fast-forward this part once I get it on DVD because it's just boring explanation of something""? There are none of those moments in ""Catching Fire."" Completely compelling all the way through. All in all, not some psychological, mind bending, life changing film, but a feast for the eyes, sometimes nerve-wracking, always engaging, ""Catching Fire"" is a job well done. See it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
583,heli_attack_pro,"Good CGI, music and acting, but some important things were missing",7,27 November 2013,"I finally managed to catch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire with my sister and her friend last night. My sister and I are avid fans of the books and unfortunately after the movie ended, we could not help but discover many missing things which were rather important in helping the viewers, especially those that didn't read the books, understand the movie better.Here are some important things which we discovered were missing from the books which I felt were quite important to the plot of the movie: 1. No mention of Bonnie and Twill, the two citizens from District 8, who Katniss meets upon going to her late father's cottage in the woods. These 2 characters were paramount in explaining to the viewers that there was indeed a District 13 as the two of them were heading for it.2. No mention of Katniss and Peeta watching videos of the old games to strategize for this 75th Quarter Quell. I mean, the book explicitly mentions that Haymitch, their mentor, won the 50th Quarter Quell by making use of a force field at the bottom of a cliff to kill the last tribute, making him the winner that year. It'll have been better if they showed say, a flash-black of a young Haymitch (maybe cast a younger actor to play young Haymitch?) winning the 50th Hunger Games? 3. Where was the Avox, Darius? 4. No mention of Mags being Finnick's mentor when he won the 65th Hunger Games. I feel that Mags's death was so unjustified. She didn't exactly teach Katniss how to make fish hooks either, since she didn't apply in it the arena.5. The movie only shows Katniss receiving the spile from Haymitch but not the bread from District 3, which is clearly mentioned in the book where they split the bread amongst themselves (Katniss, Peeta, Johanna, Finnick, Beetee) to eat. The bread was also important in letting the viewers know exactly when the hovercraft was going to pick up Katniss and the rest. (The first number of bread the day, the second number of bread the hour etc) No mention of that! Despite all that has been said, the movie had good CGI, music and acting. The fog, monkeys and lightning were thrilling and suspenseful to watch. Most of the dialogue and scenes stayed true to the book except for some important things that were missing.Hence, I give it a 7/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The movie starts off with Kat, suffering from Post Dramatic Stress Syndrome, which creates a feeling of character emotional pain and is referenced through out he movie. I would say that the suspense is high in some parts of the movie and keeps you interested by offering strategy alternatives though out,the conflict points. Because of this the viewer starts to think about what a charters decision might be before it happens and then you see what was decided.From a Script Outline point of view. The Catching Fire movie is nearly Identical to the First part, until the last quarter. Only the End seems undesirable, by the way it is written. If you want to call it an end, because it breaks the movie script writing rules. Which is the following: A Movie must have a Beginning-Middle-End.

While I loved the movie I don't think it was good enough to be in the number 10 spot. The top two movies on the list are Avatar and Titanic, two movies that earned that spot by being fairly advanced for the time they were made, which brought in a lot of people to see it. There was no spectacular special effects in the Hunger Games: Catching Fire, and while the story behind it was creative it became boring at some points and predictable to people who didn't read the books. I think the reason it is number 10 is because of the well known actors and the fact that it was a book first.

She was shocked by my answer.We began discussing and what I learned was most of my problems with the ""holes"" in the movie were explained in the books in great detail. Examples: when does Katniss realize she is a symbol for the rebellion? In the book the cabin scene explains all of that. Who isthe woman her beau is trying to save from the guards? Oh thats explained in the book. Why does ""the clock"" changing not have a bigger impact? Explained in the book. When did her sister become so independent? Explained in the book. Why does Katniss have such a strong bond witgthe dress designer guy? Explained in the boom. Do you see a pattern here?Without reading the books you simply don't have a strong enough connection to the characters to care if they live or die. That is the worst possible scenario for a story like this.in the end I found myself wanting them all to die so the movie would end.

After reading the books, my mind was blown. Being a big fan of the books I was a little apprehensive that the movie would not live up to my expectations, but boy was I wrong. The actors producers and directors seemed to keep with the spirit of the book so well this time, it had me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2.5 hours of the film. If you have read the books you will not be disappointed. Jennifer Lawrence truly embodies the sensibility of the character of Katniss Everdeen as being ""The Girl on Fire"" and man was this film on fire! Definitely $8 well spent.

I have not read the books yet, so I can't really comment on how faithful the movie is to the series; however, I do think several aspects are worth noting: - Jennifer Lawrence reminded me she is a great actress and maybe even finished convincing me that her Oscar was deservedly earned (I was rooting for Jessica Chastain to win best actress and still supported her up until today); JL shows acting experience beyond her age. - The plot is definitely better than the first movie. The first, although entertaining, was rather predictable and even 'plain'; the second film, on the other hand, addresses politics more harshly while still having plenty action packed scenes. - The direction is also worth noting: costume, makeup and setting are once again brilliant; special effects are also pretty wicked.Last but not least, throughout the entire movie the audience managed to laugh, cry, gasp and even scream.

Everyone knows that special effects and a great shooting location are nothing without phenomenal acting, and this movie has exactly that. Every actor in this movie does an unbelievable job of bringing their character to life and making you connect with them. My favorite part of this movie was how much the characters draw you in and how well they focus on the relationships of each person with one another and with Katniss. The killing takes a backseat for a majority of this movie, but it doesn't feel like you've missed out on anything because of how well everything else is done.

Having not read the books, I expected that the storyteller would lead us, viewers, into this dystopia world and do their best to show the struggle of the main character Catnis and the people around her. To anyone who has seen at least the first movie, it must be crystal clear that an epic fight will follow up so to say, on all fronts. Yet, for 220 minutes, we don't see as much heroism as we would have wished. I blame the prolonged plot, the way too many scenes that try to explain how our characters feel, with less actions and more explaining than necessary. Still the movie isn't bad but you feel like you have some important plot points were rushed through. The dynamics in the camera action and effects isn't what you may have expected. Since I feel the books may be written with more consideration for the one who can praise them, I will read them - at least the third one. Of course, you aren't in your right mind if you have endured through 2 sequels and miss the hopefully happy ending - whether it is happy I don't know, but I will sure find out.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Boy, do I regret that. I was hoping of some kind of evolution in the story, or some big event that would show a little bit of action, emotion, or at least to make us care about the characters. In the end, it was just a lengthy copy of the first one. And that's not good.The acting is flat, the direction monotonous, the action is terrible and the audience does not care who lives and who dies.

I found the movie lacking in most important thing was action. Only the last 45-50 minutes of the movie action had. Te film into the stagnant and uninteresting until then developments passed. In addition, the desperation of the people in the film at the very front was the plan. They were so desperate that every event has a really unhinge and has reduced the credibility of the film.

First one was made with passion and believe to make a good movie and thats the only reason why people actually went to see the second movie. Unfortunately, the story is rather boring and similar to the first movie. Not much happens, when you think the movie is going to start or really reveal some story they just end it mid scene. It was a true pain to the eye if you dare to be honest and not react in a way like well everyone says it was good so I think alike. I strongly recommend not to go see this in theater and wait for the last one in the hope they don't screw that over as well. Sure, we know it was going to end in an open ending but this movie does not follow the structure every book or movie should have, beginning, middle, plot/end scene.

598,animallovur306,Speechless.,10,30 November 2013,"This movie was everything I expected it to be and more. It followed the plot line of the book so closely, I was incredibly impressed. Everything matched up perfectly - the arena being a clock, the fog being toxic, Finnick being in love with Annie. Everything.Now, Finnick. I think I speak for everyone when I say that Finnick is one of the most lovable characters in the whole trilogy, and my only concern for the movie is that his appeal wouldn't transfer over to the big screen, but boy did it ever. I fell in love with him all over again, numerous times. Also, easily one of the best men to look at on the screen, and the close-ups of his face. asdfhkl.Seriously, Catching Fire is proof that if you stick as close to the book as possible you'll end up with one heck of a movie.That being said, I've heard many people who didn't read the book complaining about how the ending was horrible, the plot was boring, Katniss was too awkward, and the soldiers were too cruel. So if you didn't read the book, you might be disappointed. Yes, this is basically me saying that you NEED TO READ THE SERIES. But if you do see the movie having not read the books, keep in mind that everything translates over exactly. Katniss is supposed to be awkward, and the last line of the book literally is ""There is no District 12. It's gone."" All in all, BEST MOVIE OF 2013. GO WATCH. NOW.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I have read all the books, and catching fire is my favorite out of the trilogy, and this movie surpassed my expectations of what I thought it was gonna be like. A definite improvement to the first one(even though i really enjoyed the first one also.)They fixed the things they got wrong in the first one, like explaining things better. They put everything that was needed in this movie, and only left out the things that weren't important in the first place. The second half of the movie was pretty much almost entirely book accurate and a lot of the lines were straight from the book. They developed the characters we already knew even more and the characters we are just now getting to know were developed very nicely. The acting was improved and I honestly think that nobody could play Katniss like Jennifer Lawrence. Overall I loved this movie, and I cant wait to get it on Blu-ray when it comes out!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
600,paulwolfstien,A stunning masterpiece!,9,22 November 2013,"OK, I have been waning to start writing reviews for movies, books, TV shows and music for quite some time now. Never a better time to begin than with the latest version of the Hunger Games!Since I never read the second book (I did read the first, however since I felt they did such a great job at adapting the book to the movie I didn't feel the need to read the second book) I cannot judge the adaptation from book to movie, therefore my review is based solely on the theatrical version. Story: Very well done indeed. While a tad predictable, the story is done well-enough to keep you involved until the end. The build-up is very dramatic and it has some very good twists that will leave your jaw on the ground. Presentation: The film looks beautiful. It is very similar to the first movie in many aspects (which is a good thing considering the first movie was so good to begin with), and nothing is left out in this one either. My only grip is that the battle scenes in this one were weaker than the first movie. Again I didn't read the book this time but I remember from reading the first book I felt like the battle scenes in that one were way dumbed down and I felt the scenes in this one were even weaker than the first. I understand they are placating to a ""PG-13"" audience which is why the battles are not very gory and detailed but the whole ""games"" scenes in this movie just seemed very rushed to me. That would be one of my major gripes but again I never read the book so I don't know if that was intentional or not... nevertheless the film looked amazing and seemed like they were able to switch between drab and vibrant environments so seamlessly. The special effects were very well done, quite impressive indeed! Overall: I would say this movie did a great job of setting up the finale. A lot of this movie seemed to mirror the first one (and if you were a fan of the first movie you will love this one, too) but I don't think they will be able to go the same route in the finale. I feel it will be much different in style. But there was much to love about Part II; from the engaging story, strong acting, special effects, etc. It had that very ""epic"" feel to it, with an amazing ending which just left you salivating for the finale. They've done a very good job with this series and you could tell that they didn't want to change much from the previous installment. **** 1/2 (out of 5)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I actually fell asleep to awake wondering if i missed half the movie and to my amazement, it was only 5 min. some cool parts, but predictable. and who are these other people that we want to survive, but then again, wonder if they are evil. this movie i feel is a scam. a scam to get you to go to another movie that is to be announced down the road. just like breaking bad. sometimes its best just to end the movie and move on.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
602,Samsuini,Better than expected - entertaining - improvement on the first one,9,6 March 2014,"So, this is my first review ever and i write it just because of all these negative ones i read here.Actually, i was pretty skeptical about this film because a) I thought the first one was just ""okay"", but sometimes way too cheesy with an obvious lack of depth and b) the new director Apart from that i never read the books and have no emotional commitment to this franchise.Nevertheless, i watched it today, and it's great. Yeah, you could argue that it's too long, or the end may come to abrupt, but i didn't feel either way. Time flew by, the idea of this whole concept remains interesting, while the whole revolution idea gives it an unexpected depth. The performances are all okay, or good, and you especially feel with Katniss, thanks to J. Lawrence. After watching the film, you literally can't wait for the next one, and although the film looses his pace at the end and very much happens in a very short time, its ending remains well enough satisfying. Yeah, you may ask yourself from time to time: ""What? How? Who?"" - but most of these questions are answered within the movie. Its crucial, though, to remember some things from the first installment.All i can say is that i went into this one without any high expectation, and got good, slightly emotional entertaining which builds up massive potential for future films.

I highly suggest go seeing this movie, even if you aren't a Hunger Games fan, you won't regret it. The CGI on the IMAX screens are ridicoulously good, and due to the stories proggresion towards the end, you NEED to see mockingjay part one when it comes out.

The first one ""The Hunger Games"" was decent but a little disappointing when compared to the book, but this 2nd one more than makes up for it! I experienced a whirlwind of emotions which intimately connected me to the characters (especially Katniss). Great job by every actor who pretty much gave it everything they had!! In my opinion, their performances have raised the bar and set a new standard in quality and genuineness!! The storyline and character development and relationships has more substance and believability than the first. The costume, hair and make up designs are meticulously detailed, imaginative and ingenious.

606,annahk1234,Catching Fire,8,13 October 2014,"I think it's about time that we find a positive review on this site. One simply cannot expect a perfect book-adaptation. Face it, have you ever seen a perfect adaptation? I believe this movie was fair. Granted, the first half does trail on, but if we think about it, what could we omit? Katniss' speech was important, as was Snow's threat, the training, the interviews, etc. The movie is as true to the book as a movie can get. The dialogue may not be identical and I'm sure Francis Lawrence (director) did not have the book under his nose during every second of filming, but what more can you expect?I have read a number of reviews who simply rain on Catching Fire's parade because they think that it's ""slow and boring"". If you read the book, you'll know exactly what it consists of. Not to mention, if the book was demolished and reassembled in a different manner for the sake of the movie, then we would have every book-reader on our backs. (So basically, nobody wins.)To the film at hand, I think it was very good. The acting was enough too piece this adaptation together and the picture itself was impressive. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) has successfully played a role of a frustrated girl who would do anything for things to go back to the way the way they were.As much as I love Josh Hutcherson, I don't feel much for Peeta. He is portrayed very well, but I suppose there are times when he becomes such a burden for Katniss (as if she didn't have enough on her shoulders) that I struggle to feel for him. He needs to put his childhood crush aside and deal with the real problem. To be fair, he is looked down upon: the whole Capitol worships the Girl on Fire and this boy from district 12 who survived the last games. Katniss doesn't tell him everything, so he is left in the dark throughout most of the movie. This is not a criticism, it's just an opinion on the character. Either way, this film has done the book justice. Most peoples were annoyed at the ""cliff-hanger"" at the end, but, as I've said before, that is how the book ends! I believe this one was better directed than the first, and I look forward to Mockingjay (which I believe can be done in one movie, I didn't enjoy the book as much as the first two, but let's see what these money-grabbing people can do)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
607,zakmovie,Hunger games a wonderful masterpiece,10,11 November 2013,"A beautiful adaptation, this second is more entertaining than the first because he's just a miracle i can say, to see how the picture is and also the acting of Jennifer Lawrence and all the cast, this must be a very very good add to cinema's masterpieces, because harry potter is good but this saga hunger games is a masterpiece because they are some scenes that are incredible, i was enjoyed seen this movie, and i think the difference is that the director is different and this what makes the movie more good than the first, not simply good but wonderful and amazing. And to see it in premiere is the best thing never happened in my life, you live with the movie like if he was not just 3D but 4d , enough emotions and sensibility, i think that you need to watch it because if you don't you missed an important part of your life, go to see it in cinemas. They found in this second installment in full "" tour winners ,"" a propaganda operation designed to calm the agitated crowd , and when the two young men lend grudgingly .

"" This is a good role model for girls . It is strong , it's a fighter , she is not afraid to stand up for what is right ,"" said she summary in London.

Part of what makes these movies so fun to watch in general is also due to their wide variety in visual settings and costumes. Acting was fine and the storyline is compelling.The only gripe I had was that some of the characters did not seem to be adequately developed.

612,madissenk,Just...Amazing,9,3 July 2014,"This movie exceeded my expectations when I came to see it on opening night. The acting is amazing. Elizabeth Banks really brings out Effie's emotional side in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson really do well together, especially Jennifer Lawrence. I wish Donald Sutherland got the ""Best Villain"" at the MTV awards, because he was chilling when he was explaining to Katniss that there was unsettlement in the Districts. Jena Malone really stole the show for me, though. I loved how she ""out- Katniss-ed"" Katniss. I also loved how the movie stayed so true to the book, although there was still a few things that didn't make it into the book. Judging by the 2.5 hour running time, I guess that's OK. They did the ending where she destroys the arena well, and it was very emotional. People who didn't read the book were like ""...What just happened..."",but in a good way. Also, I'm glad that in this movie, the Games actually seemed scary. In the first Hunger Games, the Games didn't seem like something that was too crazy scary. This movie did a better job of that. The only thing that got to me was the fact that not enough time was spent on some of the other tributes. I get that the other tributes needed a big debut for the for the last two movies, but thankfully I read the book,or else I would think Brutus as ""Old Baldy"", Enobaria as ""The One With the Sharp Teeth"", and Cashmere and Gloss as ""The Siblings That Can Throw Their Knives at the Convenient Two Targets Two Milliseconds After They See Them"". Thank goodness for the bigger budget for this movie, because looking at the Tribute Parade costumes and Katniss' interview dress in the first movie was dreadful. The costuming for this movie was amazing. I loved the arena suits that the tributes wear, and basically every Katniss outfit there is. I honestly can't see anyone else wearing all of the outfits that Jennifer Lawrence wears. One thing that got a little annoying is they made her look 35 in the beginning. She was supposed to be 17, people! There are a lot of elements of this movie that make it great, but what really got me to watch it 7 times in total was not plot, or the acting, although they were both done well. It was the score. I'm sure people like dark music every once in a while, and this really brings that. James Newton Howard has really outdone himself for this movie, although he has done very good works of art in the past. Each piece of the score is something I would want to listen to over and over again. I am also glad that with quality , there is also quantity. It is 11 songs more than The Hunger Games Score. My top ten would be 10. Horn of Plenty: I must say, this piece is as awesome as everyone says it is. 9. A Quarter Quell: I don't really have a way of describing how awesome this is. It just is. 8. There's Always A Flaw: I am SO glad that they made a Beetee theme. It really describes his intelligence and abilities. 7. Bow And Arrow: Although this is one of those pieces where you have to watch the scene along with it, it is REALLY cool :) 6. Katniss: This theme is pretty cool, because it doesn't really capture Katniss as a person, but in the scenes she's in, it really fits in well. 5. Let's Start: The first part of the song is kind of a recap of The Reaping, which was my favorite part of the Hunger Games Score, although they speed it up a little. The second half of the piece is even cooler. 4.The Tour: When Katniss gave her ""Ruelogy"", this part of the piece was very emotional and I could imagine the scene playing out in my head. Honestly at this point, I could pretty much watch this movie in my head by now, but what fun is that? Too much work. :)Then the next part of the piece comes in right about when they give their speeches to the other Districts. I thought that was a pretty cool part of the piece. 3.Katniss is Chosen: As soon as I hear it, I can think of the Lily's Theme, which also had me crying as I will reluctantly admit, but what makes this better is the fact that there is something going on in it. If it wasn't for that, then Lily's Theme would be better. This whole scene basically was as sad as heck seeing as it's Katniss and Peeta again, but the other way around, with Peeta being the volunteer. 2. The Fog: This song as a whole is fast and breathtaking, but the part that really gets me from then on is when Katniss sees the fog staying in its own barrier, at 2:53. At 3:22,when Katniss goes into the water, gives me goosebumps whether it's just the song or the actual movie. I just think the scene is very well done and I can't imagine it being any different. This song is also a repeat of the reaping, except for the fact that it is very much improved by having violins as the dominant instrument instead of trumpets at 4:00. 1. Arena Crumbles: For being such a short song, it really leaves an impact on the movie. The emotionalistness (is that even a word?) of it leaves you breathless, especially at 1:23. The song leaves me with chills EVERY time. So although I wish the other tributes were more included, I do believe that this is a strong sequel and deserves a strong 9.4 out of 10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
613,suprazboy,"Slow, but a book in words.",8,20 November 2013,"I am in no way a great movie critic, but here goes something:Starting with the only two negatives I can find about this film, the first being the belabored attempt to establish everything the first film/book contained including the alarmingly long 'introduction phase' to the actual novel hard to explain in film whilst being entertaining at times, and secondly a specific act by one of the characters I cannot mention without spoiling the film ridiculous and out of place with the feeling of the film I believe an attempt at humor,the film gripped me emotionally in all the right places. Portrayal of feelings felt only in words in the novel were portrayed so well by Jennifer Lawrence you could have sworn she wrote the novel herself. Slight variations introduced to portray what couldn't be said in words were just enough to not compromise the story and the special effects were top notch to say the least.I was left with feeling of utter immersion into the story, both surreal and involved at all times. Rating the effect of the slow start on the overall enjoyment and the minor added incident with one character, I give this film an eight out of ten, as all other aspects of the film I felt were of the highest standard.Hope I made some good points, first review.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
614,lovesmile1026,Not even comparable to the first movie,9,4 December 2013,"Lets start out by saying I know all three books from the hunger games backwards and forwards, I am not a person who is stating their opinion on this movie without anything to back it up with. I've probably read the books 7 times each, including before and after I saw each of the released movies, in order to really compare the movie to the book. When I found out these books were turning into movies I was scared and excited. Scared because every movie adaptation I've seen where I had read the book before I have HATED. And this rang true for the first Hunger Games movie. I didn't picture a lot of the cast as they were in the movie, I had even imagine the clothes,the district and the arena differently. Plus the plot and the events were so different, they left out characters like Madge, yet added scenes that weren't as important to the story line. Of course J-Law was fabulous, but isn't she always? But this review is about the second movie. No I was not excited at all to see the second after how the first turned out but I decided to give it a shot, and thank god I did. The new cast,especially Johanna and Finnick, who were two of my favorite characters in the book were amazing. I was watching the casting and wasn't sure about them at first but man was I wrong. Next the arena and the clothes and everything set involved was so much better than on the first and matched the book so much more. And there it is the main reason this movie shined in my opinion, IT STAYED TRUE TO THE BOOK. From EXACT quotes at the right moments to the arena to the ending scene, it was exactly how I hoped they would portray the book. And how I hoped the first movie would've been. I don't know what caused this change but I don't really remember as many exact quotes and things in the first but who knows maybe I was too distracted by everything else that went wrong in that movie. Whereas everything in this movie went right. It did what no other movie adaptations that I've seen did which is not add useless things to the movie in order for it to sell more. Except maybe played up the Katniss-Gale romance but I think that is just an exaggeration in order to highlight the love triangle, I'm not a huge fan of this but it doesn't really bug me either. I read some reviews before this and they said the beginning was to boring/slow moving. To this I say it was even slower in the book and that would've been bad in the movie. I think they shortened the beginning just enough so that people who didn't read the book would understand the events leading up to the Quarter Quell and it also leads into a lot of the stuff to come in MockingJay. So yes the beginning was not action filled but it was absolutely necessary. Next people DIDN'T LIKE THE END. I'm sorry what? you didn't like the cliffhanger end? IT IS LITERALLY EXACTLY AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE,they did not do it just to torture you movie goers, the book literally has the exact same ending line so if you really don't like it take it up with Suzanne Collins not people on this movie (personally i love the ending). However much I enjoyed this movies there was a little bit that could have been done better, like a little bit of the dialogue. But as a whole i think it was Action filled, of course there was romance, darkly comedic and a wonderful movie adaptation of a wonderful book. Unlike after Hunger Games I am truly excited for the first part of MockingJay. (and curious to see at which agonizing moment they decide to split those two up at, for which i have my guess, but shh that's a true spoiler)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
615,bobolize,"Much darker, mature, brutal, graphic and delightful than the prequel",8,17 December 2013,"As a viewer who hasn't read any of the books in the series my review is purely based on film which was a well crafted masterpiece. The odds were definitely in its favor more so than in the firstThe second entry in the series took a much darker and brutal turn than in the first. Focusing not just on the games but exploring in depth the severe oppression the districts face from the capital but utilizing some intense and fairly graphic scenes. The games itself take a much mature turn as well. The 140 million budget was well spent in creating such a beautiful and magnificent world on a much grander scale than in the prequelJosh and Jennifer were good leads but the true gem was the supporting cast. Woddy as alcoholic Haymitch,Donald Sutherland did a fantastic job playing the antagonist. Sam, Jena and Jeffrey also managed to steal attention away from the main two during the games.The best acting performance was by Philip Seymour Hoffman who really portrayed this antagonistic spirit rivaling Snow's.One of the few flaws was the ending which felt slightly rushed and some muddy acting from some characters throughout, but none the less one of the best films of the year. Excels in every field. Not only good acting and plot but also a cinematic marvel.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The actors were amazing.AMAZING!!!Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress, beautiful and very talented. The direction also left me breathless. Not to mention the costumes. Stunning. Moreover this movie has a meaningful, strong message. At some moments I was really about to cry. The emotion that comes out and the passion cannot be unseen. The main conclusion to be drawn is that this movie is one of the greatest of 2013 and certainly worth watching!! I 'd love to watch this movie one more time. Well actually not only one more time.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
617,gerrsim,Absolutely beautiful,9,6 January 2014,"I was really skeptical about this sequel of The Hunger Games, firstly because I did not particularly enjoy the first film and also because I didn't like the book, but in this film, since the start, I was enchanted by the poignant situations the characters were pushed into, and how well-directed the movie was. All the emotion in the film was conveyed so well to hit the viewers spot on.Did I also mention that the film was beautiful? The architecture, society and the setting was so perfectly made that it feels like a tangible future, not some fictional universe. Unlike the first film, almost all scenes in this film were artistically and beautifully shot. Also, Jennifer Lawrence's phenomenal acting made it, and the amazing cast. Loved it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
618,amazingblaise,Breathtaking and perfect,10,30 November 2013,"Just to let you know, I am a HUGE fan of the books. They were simply amazing in every way. And I also thought the first movie wasn't that great. It just felt a bit sloppy, weak and just wasn't ""The Hunger Games"" So when I went to watch this movie in theaters I wasn't expecting a lot. But the movie was absolutely amazing. Let me comment on a few things.I had always been worried about how the director would squeeze everything that happens in the book into two and a half hours. But it was surprisingly well paced while still remaining entertaining and understandable. Some parts where left out, like Bonnie and Twill, Haymitch's Games and the training scores, but it was almost unnoticeable. Much better than the first film which felt a little long while still excluding much of what happened in the book.Special effects were stunning and much better than the first film. For example, the fog and monkeys were fantastic, and the scene where Katniss blows the arena up is very well done.The acting was incredible. Jennifer Lawrence has that ability to make the audience feel what Katniss is feeling, and it really adds to the movie. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth really knew their characters well, and also did good. Sam Claflin and Jena Malone were perfect for Finnick and Johanna. But my favorite part of this movie is how it managed to capture the feel, the emotion, the importance of every scene. You are really... feeling the movie in a way I have never seen before. Gary Ross did an OK job on the first film, but really could not create much emotion for any of the characters or situations, which left us a little confused and almost bored. All in all, great movie that bested the first one in almost every way possible. Perfect.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
619,kylieriddle86,An Anxious Wait,9,22 February 2014,"After the first release of Hunger Games, it was a long and anxious wait to see the second installement Catching Fire. Having not read the books, and to be honest at first I didn't want to as I usually love to watch the movie and see how each character is portrayed and brought to life. I gave in as the wait became too long to see the movie. The books were fantastic as I read all in 3 days. This brought my excitement forward even more to see this movie. When it came out I was ready. I wasn't sure how they were going to be able to fit so much of the book in the film, but I found they did quite a good job for so much content. The performances were again fantastic, they were honest and truthful. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Jennifer and Josh being built at the start of the film, spending more time on this so the next happenings didn't seem as out of thin air. In all, I wasn't disappointed, thought it was great, excellent casting, great performances. Now for the next anxious wait of the third instalment.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
620,annaburnham11,Excellent Book to Movie!,10,21 November 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an amazing movie and deserves a higher rating than it currently has on IMDb. The Hunger Games series is one of my favorite series for several reasons. I will not spoil it for those that have yet to read the series, so my comments will be fairly vague. The series is very well written and worth the time to read. It also sends a powerful message about leaders and government, power and strength, persistence and hope, and ultimately the greater good. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is my favorite book out of the series, so I was extremely excited to see this movie in theaters. It did not disappoint. It followed the book closely and even used most of the same lines that the characters had in the book. The special effects were definitely better in this movie than in the previous one. I am glad that they got a new director. If you have chosen not to see this one because of the last one, rest assured it is entirely different and much, much better! The set was also great, it is pretty much how I had imagined it looking from reading the book. The costumes are also wonderful.One (of many) things that I am thoroughly happy about are all of the actors that have been chosen to play each character. I think they chose with care and accuracy. All of them do a wonderful job, especially Jennifer Lawrence. Amazing actually. The soundtrack for this movie is simply wonderful! As far as the violence goes, it is not as violent as the first movie. I would not recommend it for younger kids, depending on what movies they are not allowed to see. Overall, this movie is definitely in my top ten favorites! If you have not seen it yet, I recommend getting it and watching it.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
621,adam-sonneras,Well paced and keeps you at your toes at all times!,10,13 December 2013,"The movie was very good, time flew by as I watched it. It's well paced and has a good amount of action. It's a lot better than the first movie and the new director really took the trilogy in a new great direction! Jennfier Lawrence's acting is very good and makes her character very believable. Josh Hutcherson does a great job of portraying Peeta. The ending made you wanting more and the urge for the next movie got even bigger. The special effects was really well made and it was hard to spot any mistakes. The director did a great job with using enough material from the books without making the movie way too long. I have watched it twice and I will probably watch it again. I usually don't do that so it's a good sign about how well made this movie is.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
622,sds-sly,Twilight Games,1,8 March 2014,"I really don't see how this movie has a good rating to begin with. I guess the studios are like the capitol in the movie. They probably paid off the critics. I was lucky enough to wait til it was available to rent. I really enjoyed the first hunger games because it kind of felt like the novel 1984. Catching fire switched more to a twilight love issue between Peeta and Gale. First Katiness wants to run off with Gale, but he refuses because he wants to join the revolution. Then she starts falling in love with Peeta during the Games (Woohoo, another twilight!).Jennifer Lawrence's performance was terrible during the whole movie. It seems she cannot display the right facial emotion. I was getting annoyed the entire time she tried to make a sad face. Josh Hutcherson on the other hand displayed great acting and did pretty good with a terrible script (this kid has a bright acting career ahead of him after the Twilight Games). During the games we don't have a chance to have a connection with the other Tributes at all. I just kept finding myself thinking ""Oh the old lady died"" or ""Guy 2 just died from arrow shot"".At the end Peeta just disappears out of near. We never find out why he ran away, but that he was caught by the president. Wow, the writers waste all this movie time with worthless scenes, but they can't add this in? If you're looking for a Hunger games like the first one. Then you're going to be disappointed. If you're a twelve year old girl who enjoys wanting to know if Katiness is going to be with Peeta or Gale. Then this movie is for you, but you'll have to wait for the third one to find out.Twilight Games makes for a great movie to make you fall asleep though.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
623,matthijsvandam1988,Been there done that...,4,22 November 2013,"For a start: I liked the first movie. I didn't love it as other people did, but I certainly enjoyed watching it. This is the kind of movies I like to see in cinema and lose myself in the movie for 2,5 hours. So I went to the second Hunger Games with not too big expectations, but was certainly looking forward to it. Let's make clear I've been rarely so bored in cinema. At a certain point I told my friend I was almost falling asleep, he checked his watch and saw the movie was going on for almost 90 minutes already and nothing mentionable happened! The first 90% of the movie is almost the same as the first movie, which was cool the first time but not interesting at all the second time. There are elections, there's a train ride to the capitol, she gets a dress that lights on fire when she spins, they enter in a chariot both on fire and the action in the games was almost the same (which supposed to be a special this time since it was the 75th anniversary). It was horrible to see almost exactly the same for over 2 hours. Besides that, the emotions didn't get to me. Was I supposed to care about her love-life, about district 12? I didn't, while I did care about little Rue dying in part 1. So emotion wise, the first was better in my opinion. Another thing that annoyed me was how predictable it was, nothing surprised or shocked me. I won't spoil anything, but there's not much to spoil except for the end. My advise would be to only watch the last 30 minutes of the movie, those were okayish and give me hope for a better third part. Last but not least, the CGI was not so good, I won't overreact it was okay, but from a movie this popular I expect top notch, and it wasn't.Since I have a subscription to the cinema, it wasn't a waste of money. But it sure was a horrible waste of time. The best part of the movie was the trailer of The Hobbit 2. I like to go to great movies for a second or third time in cinema. The idea of having to watch this movie a second time gives me a headache.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
624,nickg5440,"Amazing, dramatic, touching..... Wow!",10,29 December 2013,"After months of anticipation and finally seeing it on the release day, the second film in the ""Hunger Games"",""Catching Fire"" follows the story after Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) after their win in the 74th Hunger Games. Much to her oblivion, their victory however sparked conflict between the districts. Both Katniss and Peeta were summoned to attend the 75th Hunger Games with this time only one winner. For someone who has not read the books, this creates concern for both Katniss and Peeta as there would only be one winner. I was quite pleased that the storyline highlighted the connection between them as they were beside each other throughout the jounery. However the relationship between them is not all what it's cracked up to be. For the most part, Katniss and Peeta, were paired against their will as the movie progresses (well for Katniss anyway). Much to the disbelief from President snow, the charade between Katniss and Peeta progressed through to the 75th Games; which would determine the game's outcome. Many scenes from Catching Fire can be acknowledged differently, for those who read the books or not. I think there is a mystifying touch to some scenes in the movie, but one must remember that this is the second movie out of three, and those unanswered questions should be revealed in the third movie: just like they did in the second. However you conclude from the movie, you will still be hanging on for the third, as I am – Overall a very engaging movie complete with an incredibly touching storyline, beautiful scenery and mind-blowing viewing.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
625,austindbasil,"""Fire is Catching.""",9,10 December 2013,"""Fire is Catching,"" and it has certainly become a blazing inferno. As an avid movie lover and specifically a huge fan of the Hunger Games franchise, I was looking forward to the movie ever since the credits on the first installment began to roll. Having read the book, the first film was initially a disappointment, but I began to love it as I stopped the comparisons and understood that movies and books cannot be exactly the same. That being said, ""Catching Fire"" surpasses the first film in every single way. From the first scene, it is apparent that Francis Lawrence and the screenwriters were going to make an effort to stay with the storyline of the book. Although there were, of course, differences, the script of ""Catching Fire"" follows the book closely. The acting in the film is near perfect, from Mags' lack of words to the facial expressions of the characters during important scenes. Jennifer Lawrence, who has now easily become one of my favorite actresses, reprises her role as the heroine Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence brings so much emotion to her character that I felt was absent from the first film. Every feeling that Everdeen felt, from rage to sympathy to love, was beautifully crafted and brought to life by Lawrence. From this role alone, Jennifer Lawrence has crafted herself as one of the best actresses of our current generation. Josh Hutcherson also reprises his role with so much more character development than the first film. He gives his character Peeta so much more depth and complexity and made viewers feel sympathy in his battle for Katniss's heart. The other returning actors, who I felt had already given their characters enough development from the first film, also give new depth and emotional strain to their characters, particularly Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrellson, and Elizabeth Banks. The new actors to the franchise were greatly cast, with specific praise to Sam Claflin as Finnick and Jena Malone as Johanna. Claflin and Malone really got a feel of who their characters are and convey them exactly as I had imagined while reading the book. The arena in ""Catching Fire"" is also much more exciting, with beautiful scenery and CGI effects that fit perfectly with the scenes. The IMAX inclusion of the entire arena sequence was much needed, as it gives a sense of authenticity and beauty as the climactic events unfold. The progressing brutality of the Capitol is also fantastically depicted in the film, which gave the audience a deeper understanding of the rebellion. I must also give credit to Donald Sutherland, who returns as President Snow and gives his character so much more wickedness and evil that was already clearly apparent in the first film. At just shy of two and a half hours, ""Catching Fire"" flies by. Although there are a lot of repetitive elements from the first film, i.e. chariot ride, interviews, every aspect is necessary to understand the events that lead up to the shocking and unexpected (if you haven't read the book) climax. Overall, ""Catching Fire"" has been a hit at box offices across the globe, and there is no question as to why. With amazing acting, an exciting story full of hope, pain, sorrow, and love, gorgeous scenery, brilliant musical scores, and a conclusion that will leave viewers breathless and impatiently awaiting the next installment, ""Catching Fire"" is sure to be a hit to any viewer with good taste in films. 9/10",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
626,katnissswift111,The best film ever!!!,10,23 November 2013,"Catching Fire was always my favorite book but I doubted that they would be able to re create the book as a film.....I was wrong!!!The film was emotional, gripping and all in all, AMAZING. I loved the book but I have to admit I preferred the film!!! I saw the film in the cinema and I was left speechless. Catching Fire was truly an incredible, fast paced film and the acting in it was so believable. I found myself crying at most scenes! I don't want to include any spoilers or clues about the film because that would ruin it for anyone reading this so I'm only going to say that I would recommend this film so much!!! I was left on a total cliff hanger and I cant wait to see Mockingjay - hoping it comes out as soon as possible!!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
627,kodytegan,Catching Fire has Caught Fire!,9,21 November 2013,"So I came to the movies with high hopes, and they were met! Though at first, the movie seemed to go a bit fast, rushing through scenes that were vital, the director constructing a story line that is glued to the book in a manner that takes it into his own hands. The Heavensbee and Snow scenes were highlights of the movies, as well as the portrayal of each tribute gone victor gone tribute. There is roughly only 45 minutes of the game itself, but all the events that lead up to the games itself, and everything has a purpose. Though somewhat disappointed with the absence of Haymitch's story, as well as the other victors, we still see the vital connection between Haymitch and the tributes such as Finnick and Johanna. Lawrence's use of humour add a lighter note to the film, the comical scenes appealing to a larger audience. One of the most powerful scenes had to be Cinna being beaten up before Katniss. Cinna will be duly missed, and the way Lenny Kravitz acted as Cinna was brilliant. The link between viewers and Cinna was emotive, which is what made everything sadder. I must also compliment Jennifer Lawrence's acting skills. Her talent breams through her, the whole movie, and she proves that she is one of the most sensational actors of this generation. Peeta and Katniss's relationship enhanced both Josh Hutcherson's and Jennifer Lawrence's talent, and though I felt that Peeta was ignored by Katniss in the beginning more than he should have been, it was still a theme that were hands to hold the whole movie. Other characters that must not go unmentioned include Haymitch and his more caring nature, Johanna and her shameless manner, Peeta and his protective demeanor, Enoboria and her vicious stances and Effie with her wild costumes. Frances Lawrence is a genius; this movie is career making for a lot of these actors, as well as bringing his name back on the market for future projects since I am Legend. The arena is just another work of genius by all those behind this film; tick tock, tick tock- tick tock the arena's a clock. It is so much better than I may have imagined. This is a movie, though not recommended for all, is aimed at a target larger than the first movie. It portrays more brutality, and what the Capital and Snow is truly capable of. It is a brilliant master piece, and the odds are truly in this film's favour, and is a must watch for anyone looking for a fantastic film with one of the largest fanbases. It is more mature, more dystopian and a lot more honest than the first film, so before you start doubting the film, grab a ticket and take a seat because you won't be disappointed.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
628,sgrace711,Reasonable expectations were greatly exceeded.,8,22 December 2013,"I loved this movie, but after reading several negative reviews, I think my enjoyment was largely due to my initial expectations. I know this is long winded but I want to explain where I was coming from going in. 1. I am not a teenager and I am not someone who generally goes for this type of thing. I originally picked up the first book in an airport shop because I was facing a lot of flying/ sitting in airports time and wanted a straightforward, simple, and entertaining story. It was easy to become immersed and (at the next airport) bought the whole series. Did I think it was a masterpiece? No. I thought it was a good story told in an engaging way but with several immature, eye-rolling (yet forgivable)flaws.2. I very very very rarely like film adaptations of popular young adult/ children's books. I was not expecting much from these movies and didn't see the first until it was on DVD. I was surprised to find that it was not terrible and found it to be a fairly enjoyable film.Basically, I feel like the books and movies as a whole are very good compared to the majority of the young-adult/ beautiful special warrior girl/ impossible odds/ love triangle genre.Now, my review of the actual movie...Yes, some of the dialogue was blah, some parts were a bit obvious, and it bore the unmistakable signs of skimming around to try to stay as true to the book as possible for a movie shorter than Lord of the Rings. However, poor dialogue was made up for by an impressive emotional depth and freakin' JENNIFER LAWRENCE. Some things are *going* to be obvious and my husband who has not read the books (and guesses the end to EVERYTHING) was still entertained and engaged. It held on to the meat of the book and was still able to stand on its own enough that I didn't have to explain/ expand on anything to my husband afterward the way so many readers have to after watching book adaptations with non-readers (I am talking to you, Harry Potter movies). Some reviewers were upset that the actual games did not start until well into the movie, but the story is about much much more than the games themselves and so it seemed natural to me that they would not be the the primary emphasis. In fact, the movie version downplayed several of the biggest issues I had with the books (Katniss's relentless silliness)which was an enormous improvement. It was visually stunning, emotionally charged, and managed to hold on to a sense of realism and maturity even with Elizabeth Banks in a glittering wig. In short; lighten up. It is an amazing blockbuster flick and a great way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon, not the next piece of cinematic history.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
629,pleasebuymeadrink,Nice movie but there is nothing we don't know there!,6,3 December 2013,"The sequel fails to convince us for it's true goals.The cast is strong (Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and Lenny Kravitz are all fabulous) but the whole project fails because of the scenario. The second part ""Catching Fire"" is obviously a try to make it look like the ""V for Vendetta"" but the result is not the same. The satirical and futuristic views of the movie combined with moments of melodrama cannot persuade us by using clichés for the serious issues is dealing with,like inequality,new world order,totalitarian regimes, government control etc. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson)will come back to the arena after an unfair decision of the games committee. Even the performances are good the scenario is predictable from the first moment. What is not predictable is the heartbreaking emotional conflict Katniss experiences standing between her lover and Peeta. I was expecting much more from the second part because it has been based on a brilliant idea. Lets hope the third part will be better.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
630,lovedwardcullen,An outstanding performance! For once a movie bested the book!,10,3 December 2013,"It. Was. Outstanding!This film really was a work of art, from the acting, cinematography, wardrobe, and the directing. A really fine piece of work that completely destroyed the book. EVERYTHING was amazing, there wasn't a single dull moment, and the acting was stupendous. Going in to the movie i had my reservations. I preferred the first book to the second (in terms of plot) and was sure the second wouldn't be as good as the first. I was dead wrong, and I'm so happy i was! The movie did more than simply bring the book to life, it took the book and recreated it into something thrilling and overflowing with emotion! I can't count the number of times this had me tearing up! From the horror during their victor parade, to the district twelve drama, to Katniss and Peeta during the quarter quell, they really delivered on the acting and turned scenes that were merely ""okay"" into an emotional roller coaster. The scene in district twelve when Katniss speak about Rue and the old man starts the three finger sign and gets beaten up and shot...it killed me! I didn't remember that particular scene and i was in tears, not tearing up but a silent sob, it was so emotional! And when she hears the news that she'll be in the next hunger games and her mother loses it..that got to me as well. There were so many sad scenes, from the speech and death of the district 11 people, to Sienna's death, Mags death, and the numerous events with Peeta it was heartbreaking. I sincerely did not expect to be as moved as i was during this film. A true adaptation that well exceeds the book. If you're a fan of the hunger games series you will not be disappointed by the book to movie result, it was accurate with some flourishes, and action packed and brilliantly acted to make you wanting more! A beautiful adaptation that bested the book in every way possible!An outstanding film, truly well done!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
631,kristenn678,Miles Above!,10,21 November 2013,"First off, I'll point you that I went into the cinema with very low expectations, but an open mind. I wanted the film to be good, but after the first one, wasn't sure it would be. Boy, have i ever got a shock! It was fantastic, especially to a reader of the books. Without having to worry about introducing back story and characters, they really focused on the actual story, the emotions, and it showed. Even the actors seemed to have grown more into their rolls. Peeta was heart breaking, and Katniss, well, Jennifer portrayed her with such raw emotion it was hard not to believe. The relationships, which I thought were shown all wrong in the first film, were done to the tee and were everything they should have been. They captured the dark side of the theme, as well as the more light side. They stuck mostly completely to the book, which made it flow a lot easier as well. It was just fabulously done. And don't even get me started on Finnick! perfection doesn't begin to cover it. I have never been so shocked with a movie. It is many, many many miles above its predecessor.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I'm looking forward to the third movie. I think third movie will be exciting than of all.The third part of the film divided into two.So the movie to be continued two more years.I think ıt's great but we have to wait so it a little sad.

633,juanpramirez63,Loyal to the book,9,14 December 2013,"This movie was great for me, but not perfect.First, i got to say it follows everything that is on the book. Every detail needed to understand the story is in there. And the plot is well directed to, what i'm guessing, Suzanne Collins wanted. This movie is completely different from the first one. Don't expect to see the same Hunger Games. From the beginning of this movie (and book) is a whole new story.But here is the reason why this movie is not a 10. If you haven't read the book, you won't understand some of the little details that make the book so enjoyable. And also there are some other parts of the book that are not very important for the plot, but makes it really interesting and could add more drama to the movie.Talking about the director, i see he did a great job catching the essence of the book and putting it in a picture. Francis Lawrence did take the reins and accomplish what the book did... Make us want to see the next movie soon.The acting was really good, but i'm gonna focus only in Jennifer Lawrence and say just one thing: she shows us why she already win an Oscar!The last i want to say is: i'm expecting the next movie.

634,justinbagan-839-815388,Terrible,1,1 December 2013,"My friend and I walked out. . 1) Poor writing (on par with 4 out of 5 Hollywood movies these days).This includes poor character development, unnatural dialogue, and a boring plot with no explanation of the world or characters (similar to the first, which I almost turned off). No explanation of the previous movie. (My friend hadn't seen the first. Even I saw the first and felt the dialogue was assuming too much). 2) Length - It felt like a first draft everyone was too afraid to edit down (and switch around). A shorter film (around 90 minutes) means a more concise story, and money left over in the budget to improve everything overall. From a business perspective, keeping people in their seats longer has no benefits in making the film money. Quantity does not equal quality. 3) Instead of trying to challenge or educate young people or teens (their target audience) about the world and politics by providing an intelligent story, they are doing the opposite.Writing is the essence, which holds everything together and gives purpose. It is the mind of the film and the rest is the body. No amount of excellent sound, cinematography, good looking actors, special effects, or creative costumes can mask a poorly written or shallow story.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
635,chrisjcockcroft,Great!... if you're a fan of movie trailers,3,20 December 2013,"I wasn't overly impressed with the first Hunger Games movie but saw this one to let the series have another chance to win me over. Afterwards I'm afraid I think the first one was actually better.This felt like an extended trailer.Game of Thrones and The Hobbit get a lot of stick for their fluff and filler but this film takes the gold. The plot progression from the first film to the end of this is insulting. the narrative focus on huge sections of drawn out breathy dialogue and superfluous story threads, followed by a half backed build up to and then unconvincing replay of the games from the first film, which no one seems very in to and the curtain falls on the same exposition we established at the end of the first film, in an abrupt, unfulfilling brick-wall anticlimax!Story wise there's the ongoing duality of Katniss and Peter's (Peeta's!?) faux romance, but it's still as wooden as before with only token justification. Evil Colonel Sanders type President is being even more needlessly violent and oppressive to a vastly outgunned underclass and vacuous character redundancy Peeta needs saving more times then princess' Leia and Peach combined. A central element is how crucial Katniss is to some revolution you don't get to enjoy but exactly why is so weak and the plight so tangential to the main thread that it's difficult to get invested in. The visuals and action are quite pretty but most of this is thanks to expensive graphics and at this point big budget films can't keep getting points for this. I'm told it's close to the book but again that's no justification for a boring film, and in a death match, can someone please tell me the point of all this teaming up!?My Favourite, most genuine and emotive performance was given by supporting role Elizabeth Banks. Her brief but touching portrayal as the product of a superficial world trying desperately to communicate deep, empathic feelings beyond her experience was my highlight of the film. Her internal conflict and the face value absurdity of her gesture are a poetically haunting commentary of the Capitol's society, bravo!Overall not worth the ticket price, probably more palatable to franchise fans.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
636,tom_skdoosh,Fantastic sequel to the first! Worth watching...,9,14 November 2013,"As a huge fan of the books and of the first film, I was sceptical at first walking in to watch the second Hunger Games film in what is to be a 4 film series based on the best selling trilogy written by Suzanne Collins.I'm extremely glad to say that the film delivered in all areas! From the effects, to the pace of the film, the acting and everything in between. The start of the film could have been a bit shorter but it was nice to get back into the mind frame that the first movie had left me in, and without the build up, the film wouldn't be anywhere near as good!Director Francis Lawrence really delivered following on from the first film directed by Garry Ross; the acting was absolutely superb from start to finish and once again a brilliant, effortless and capturing performance from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson and the rest of the cast. Jennifer has been on a winning streak with other great films such as Silver Linings Playbook and this film too is full of spectacular acting.Absolutely brilliant film. Don't not see it because you don't want it to ruin the books, it's superb... I've already pre-ordered tickets to see it again, that's how good it is! :D",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
637,vics112,My opinion of this wonderful film,10,13 March 2014,"I personally feel like this film was a vast improvement in comparison to the first adaptation. I think it was clear in the first film how Gary Ross had interpreted The Hunger Games, but I personally feel like I preferred Francis Lawrences' adaptation. I feel like Lawrence clearly enhanced and showcased the development of Katniss from the first games to that of the second games. Lawrence showed the monumental development of the love between Katniss and Peeta in such an elegant way, I honestly believe that the beach scene is that of pure genius and is rather sentimental and true to that of the book. I am a drama student so I pay attention to acting a lot as I am told to by my lecturers. I can honestly say I did feel like some parts the acting wasn't 100%, but it is to be expected, nobody is perfect after all. However, the brilliant acting completely outweighs that of the questionable acting. Sam Clafflin was the perfect choice to play the character of Finnick Odair, his portrayal was exacting and true to the character in the book. I felt his emotions as he felt them, in particular when Mags ran into the fog and he was truly heartbroken, the fact that he wanted to go and get her when he had been effected by the fog was just brave - I really believed everything he done. There was a particular scene that really got me to thinking; 'How would I react if I was in that situation'. In which I got completely teary eyed. It was the Jabberyjay scene, it completely threw me, I have never experienced the feeling of dread and absolute loss whilst watching film as I did when I watched that scene. Jennifer and Sam acted so amazingly with absolute conviction, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen at any moment. I absolutely adored Josh's interaction and utter despair at the fact he couldn't do anything to help Katniss, it is truly a beautiful scene. As they were acting using naturalism and I imagine they may have used a few of Stanislavski's techniques, then they completely nailed them. They got me as a viewer to question how I would feel and that is exactly what naturalism and Stan's techniques are meant to make you feel and react. When using naturalism/the techniques you should get a reaction from the audience and they achieved a reaction from me. I was completely at the mercy of this film and I commend the actors and Francis Lawrence for a brilliant book to film adaptation, it was brilliant. I respect that some people may not feel the same, but opinions lie where they lie and I truly feel this film adaptation is breath taking.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
638,broitsayesha,"A flawless depiction of the book, absolutely incredible",10,24 November 2013,"I just... I can't. I have no words. Francis Lawrence, I applaud youLol I lied; of course I have words, let's do this!Since 2008, The Hunger Games trilogy has stuck with me. It is, and will always be, one of my absolute favourites. So of course, when the first movie came out, it was with sheer disappointment and fury that I down- right hated how it turned out. With this is mind, I tried to go into Catching Fire with minimal expectations (obviously this was difficult, after being swooned by the freaking amazing trailers). And then... Something amazing happened. As I sat there, watching things unfold, I quickly started to realise something.The entire movie, down to every last line and scene, was a direct reflection of what Suzanne Collins depicted in the book. I kid you not, I'm not over exaggerating here. There were literally giant chunks of text, word for word from the book, transformed visually onto the screen. After a while, I completely lost count of how many there were.And it's not just that Suzanne Collin's exact words were used in the script, but the entire feeling I got whilst reading the scene was replicated entirely on the big screen. The feeling, atmosphere and setting of every single scene was actually created exactly the way I'd pictured it in my head.As a reader, I can honestly say that I have never, ever seen such a flawless book-to-movie adaptation before. Ever. This movie was so true to the book, it was freaking insane.In the first movie, I really felt like the script had let the actors down a lot. They had what it took to portray the characters, but the movie was just so badly written and directed. Alas, Francis Lawrence would not stand for such nonsense! In Catching Fire, the script was just so damn perfect and every line was so well-fitted to the characters! Honestly, I was in complete awe.The camera work in The Hunger Games was also a really big let-down. It screwed the movie over so badly. But of course, the all-mighty Francis would never allow something like that. The shots in this movie were amazing, and the cinematography of the entire movie was just pure perfection.I don't ever say things like this lightly, especially when it comes to stories that I hold so dear to me, but... Catching Fire, from the start and down to the very last scene, was FLAWLESS. ***SPOLER-ISH SECTION COMING UP, WALK AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS. I WARNED YOU!***I know some idiot is going to say these things eventually, so I'll just address them now. Here goes:""If the movie was so flawless and true to the book, why did Katniss kiss Gale twice? That doesn't happen in the book""The book is written from Katniss's point of view. In the book, she tells us about her true feelings for Gale. She mentions that she is his, and he is hers, and she could never think of it any other way. Of course, in a movie, we can't just stare at Katniss for 20 minutes whilst she has these thoughts. So Francis depicted it in the most simple way possible: through a kiss. ""It wasn't perfect because there were so many parts from the book missing, like Katniss modeling the wedding dresses!!""Yes, there were some things missing from the movie. You know why? Because if every little detail was included, the movie would be 12 hours long. Shut up, don't be an idiot. Every crucial scene and turning point in the book was included in the movie, and that's what matters. ""The movie was awful because Johanna didn't slap Katniss""You're awful, and I'm gonna slap you.""I didn't read the book but I don't even understand this stupid movie. It doesn't make sense. It's so boring""Hahahaha... Run.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

640,jo-khinmaung,The odds are never in our favour,8,22 November 2013,"Roll up, roll up! For more bread and circuses. Catching Fire fuses the reality- type show of Big Brother, the horror of Lord of the Flies, the sinister surveillance of Orwell's 1984, and the glamour of Strictly Come Dancing, all in one. The cruelty of fighting to the death continues with more games; the victors of the first games, Katniss and Peeta, are warned by their mentor Haymitch: 'From now on, your job is to be a distraction so that people forget what the real problems are.' The Games and its victors- cum-celebrities are used as 'entertainment' to distract from the real problems of impoverished and starving people in the Districts outside the Capitol of Panem. Just as Roman emperors placated the masses with 'bread (panem) and circuses' or gladiators.We might kid ourselves that this is just a film, set in a horrific future world, that doesn't reflect our lives today. But, at some point, I'm sure that we've all chosen to watch some light-hearted entertainment on TV like I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here where we're encouraged to laugh at other people's uncomfortable experiences.I already see signs of us living in a world of inequality, not far off The Hunger Games trilogy, and the ways in which we distract ourselves from the real problems, like the citizens of the Capitol do. We go shopping for clothes or stuff that we don't really need and ignore a homeless person on the street. We buy more food than we need and throw away £60 worth every month, whilst more and more people rely on food banks to feed their families each week.For more, read the full review here http://rth.ms/18r26hR",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
641,josuemc,Surpassed my expectations to say the least,9,22 November 2013,"I was interested in this movie ever since the teaser trailer came out. I have already read all of the books prior to the release of the first movie. The Hunger Games, although I enjoyed it as a film, it wasn't great or anywhere near as good as the book. Catching Fire is my favorite book out of the 3, so coming in I was nervous to see if I would come out love/hating it like the first film, and let me say I was really blown away with how much they got RIGHT both as an adaption and as a quality film. The sets, the costume designs, the CGI, and especially the cinematography were just great and leagues above the first one. The film was solidly paced and written, with a lot more character development that makes the characters more easily to digest rather than them being forced, as well as the performances. We get to understand Katniss on a deeper level, get to see Peeta develop as a character, we get to see President Snow's true evil and ruthlessness, and we get to see the development of important plot points in the entire series. I am going to make it clear that I am NOT one of those fans that immediately gives a movie exaggerated amounts of praise (or there lack of) just because I like the books. I respect the art of film too much to even base a movie's judgement by fanboyism. Francis Lawrence, I give a standing ovation to his direction. This film is real quality, has real substance, great performances, and leaves you wanting more. Mockingjay Part 1 will definitely be a treat knowing Francis will be on board for both parts. Never in my life did I expect this movie to be this great in both film terms and as an adaption.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I am usually the first one to pick out any difference between any book being made into film. Loved it! I laughed a lot and I cried a lot! I think I loved Catching Fire almost more than I loved The Hunger Games. The casting of the new comers was perfect! Jenna Stone is amazing as Johanna! I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but I will say the casting, directing and acting are all on point! It truly is a great movie and an excellent addition to The Hunger Games franchise. The movie stayed true to the book which was the biggest thing for me! Definitely a must see even if you're someone who thinks this movie is just for girls! It's not!

643,brooksordich,"Catching Fire, A Review",9,22 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching FireCatching Fire, is the long awaited second part of the Hunger Games Saga. After the resounding success of the first movie, fans were hopeful that the second would be just as captivating. Put simply, it was. Even after a change in Directors. (Directed now by Francis Lawrence) The second movie starts out strong. The seeds of revolution have started to take root, and the hostility towards the Capitol is growing visibly. The acting is really well done. Instead of the somewhat stoic portrayal of characters in the first movie, I felt that this one more accurately depicted the emotions of the characters as they were meant to be. Emotional train wrecks. Particularly Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence). The overall plot keeps very close to the book, much more than the first, and with the omission of only a few note-able scenes, I feel fans will appreciate the Directors attention to detail. The movie does feel a bit long at times.(Runs, just over 2 hours) This isn't really a reflection on the movie so much as it is the accurate portrayal of the book. More time is spent in the arena, and the audience feels it. Acting is spot on. Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair (played by Jena Malone and Sam Claflin respectively) are fantastically depicted. The other champions are cast expertly as well and I find it hard to criticize anything in this area. Camera angles and movements are much improved over the first, and observant movie goers will notice the screen get larger when you first enter the arena. The sets look stunning, and the Arena is a masterpiece. Perhaps my one big concern is that, without prior knowledge of the story, without reading the books, the movie COULD be hard to keep track of or interested in. It's simply the nature of the plot, and reading the books is strongly recommended. This movie should please audiences worldwide.Overall: Strong movie, excellent acting. Held back only by the complex plot. 8.5/10(Acting: 10/10) (Directing: 9/10) (Plot: 9/10) (CGI Effects: 8.5/10) (Stand Alone without book: 8/10) (Ease of viewing, without plot knowledge: 7.5/10 (Variable per viewer))",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
644,smajorrr63,Not Enough Information,8,22 November 2013,"I just watched this wonderful movie last night, and let me just say I was completely thrilled. It seemed a little fast paced, but the movie was two and a half hours long so I could see why they had to do so much cramming. For all that cramming they did pretty well. However, I went back to reading the book (which I've read numerous times and was just refreshing before I saw the movie) I noticed there were some important things missing. Then my younger sister, who had gone with me to see it but hadn't seen the first movie, pointed out some huge differences in the layouts of each movie. These are differences I can no longer get out of my head. For example, in The Hunger Games, Gary Ross made carefully sure to remind the audience through the movie that these Games are just that - Games. Its a source of entertainment for the Capitol and he refreshes this in our minds by posting the individual training scores, occasional betting board glimpses, etc. everything these kids do is a statistic and they are ""graded"" on how well they do. This is an important part of the game. In Catching Fire, not once did they show any training scores or betting boards or anything, really, outside of what's going on in Katniss's immediate life. Obviously they threw Plutarch in there arguing with Snow about whether or not to immediately kill Katniss, which was a good addition since you knew Plutarch was being duplicitous but also not necessary. We go through these Games as though they are just apart of Katniss's life when, in fact, they are something thrust upon her once again by the cruel Capitol. I'll say they did a good job portraying Katniss's slow mental breakdown; this is realistic. However, I digress. Back to the Games, it was a huge thing in the first movie that we saw each of the tributes faces. We mostly knew each of them and very single one made a full appearance in the actual movie sequence. In this movie we barely meet anyone outside of the first four districts and Johanna. They totally missed a small emotional scene between Katniss and Seeder, which was a reminder of Rue in the first Games. Frankly, I was surprised they had gone far enough to show us Annie Cresta for a brief second. They started out finally showing us the tributes' readings (maybe we can finally see them all!) and they cut it off completely with Finnick and Mags, whom they put in two separate scenes just to throw Annie in. We're lucky if we see all the tributes' faces in the sky as they die. My last beef with this movie was Willow's performance as Prim. Her entire dialogue was deadpan throughout, not the bright happy girl who is portrayed in the book. Prim is a crucial role in this movie, and I feel this actress hasn't done it justice. The rest of the movie was ideal. My sister never read the books and she still loved it, but I had to explain an awful lot to her and after seeing the first one, she agreed she had forgotten they were Games in Catching Fire. But the cast was wonderful, they hit more than enough key points and the dialogue was basically verbatim. Job well done, if it couldn't have been done better!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
645,megan-jarvis97,Absolutely loved it!,10,22 November 2013,"I read the trilogy of the Hunger Games before watching the movie and wow, is all I can say! ""Catching Fire"" definitely gave the second book justice. Almost every key detail was in the movie, from Effie's hair to Katniss screaming in bed from the nightmares, everything was included. This movie also brings out the reason why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are incredible actors, their chemistry on-screen is superb. The only negative thing I could say, in my opinion, is I felt the movie was a bit rushed? But I suppose knowing the movie goes for 146 minutes, you can't include every little thing in the movie. ""Catching Fire"" was a 10/10 for me, I want to go to the cinemas to see it again a second time!

Beautiful and engaging, it's not just another movie, it feels as if you are part of the movie. There were tears and frustrations, and tons of admiration for the brilliant screenplay. What amazed me the most was how talented the actors are, regardless of their age. Intense and filled with pent up adrenaline was how I sat through the entire 2 and a half hours long of adventure.

647,tianamariamenezes,One of the best book-to-movie adaptations in recent years.,9,23 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE AND MORE. The wait was definitely worth it. The scale was amped up to the extreme. Everything was BIGGER, BRIGHTER AND DEFINITELY BETTER than the first movie. The costumes, the sets, the cornucopia, the symbolism. Everything. The stakes are much higher this time around and you can actually feel the gravity of the situation because of the brilliant directing and acting. And oh my God, the acting in this movie was PHENOMENAL. Everyone brought their A game to the set. JENNIFER LAWRENCE, YOU ARE AN ACTING GODDESS. Seriously, she IS Katniss through and through. She owns that character and nobody is even in the same league as her. In only the first 5 minutes of the movie, I started shaking. Her fear, her vulnerability her stubbornness. She nailed it on the head! Josh Hutcherson did a great job as Peeta and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), and Effie (Elizabeth Backs) totally transformed into their characters so awesomely. Gale (Liam Hemsworth) felt a lot more human in this movie and pulled off the character well. Finnick and Johanna were freaking awesome! Perfect casting in my opinion. Jena Malone's acting was one of the best parts of this movie. She embodied the character to the tee; her fierceness, fiery attitude and her unforgiving demeanor. And Sam Claflin was smoldering hot, and sassy yet vulnerable at the same time; everything Finnick is. Donald Sutherland and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were SO GOOD. You could actually feel the 'EVIL' flowing through their veins. And Stanley Tucci is Stanley Tucci. Perfect as always. Now on to the plot. The story picks after the 74th games, when the victors have to go on the Victory tour. And it is here when the start of the rebellion begins and Katniss decides which side she wants to be on. First of all I have to say, Francis Lawrence did an absolutely brilliant job with this movie. The symbolism, and parallelism present in this really hit you hard. I was so impressed by how much he managed to cover and how stunning everything looked. The visuals and the CGI were definitely an upgrade from the first one and it all looked fantastic. I was also super surprised to hear so many direct quotes from the book, included in the script (something which the previous movie seriously lacked!) The Music Score was good. Nothing that exhilarating about it except for maybe Panem's Nation Anthem. It sounded even more majestic than before.The costumes this time round were stunning! Trish Summervile really outdid herself by designing so many gorgeous and unique outfits for the film. I really hope she gets considered for an Oscar. All in all Catching Fire was a FANTASTIC movie and I think it is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations ever made. Francis Lawrence did an amazing job and Jennifer Lawrence just owned this movie. I give it an A- Can't wait for Mockingjay!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

650,AdamSJames,Continuation Errors Galore,6,23 November 2013,"Another almost great film, ruined by plot holes, continuation errors and an obvious story. Although better than the first film, Catching Fire still didn't meet my expectations created by the ridiculous amount of hype about the film before it's release. Starts slow and only really picks up around the half way mark. Just when you're starting to get into the story, which as, I said, is rather predictable although full of continuation errors, it ends. The ending how ever, is barely and ending. It may as well say 'you can't enjoy this film without paying to see the next one.' The first film didn't have this problem, so I don't see why they've done it here.On another note, Katniss' love triangle made this hard to watch and made me dislike her as a character.

I mean ya, they had to cuz some minor parts out otherwise it would've been too long of a movie but I think they put in all of the major points that shouldve been in there and did them justice. Acted them out exactly as the book has them written. This movie is spectacular and I'm a huge fan of the first movie and all of the books. I was tearing up through pretty much the whole thing. You could feel the pain and loss and sadness and determination. The only thing id criticize on is the ending. It ended too sudden and they don't go into enough detail about district 13.

Almost every important details were in the movie but some important were missing, but the major ideas were here. I felt that the movie was so fast, maybe it's because they are more details in the book and I payed attention to what there were or not. Catching Fire is different of the first one, the movie is more dark and mature, especially you'll see the difference in the direction because of the budget increases. I liked that we felt all kind of feelings: joy, sadness, fear, impatience, there are also beautiful sequences full of emotions.

654,fictiver,Badly directed with poor dialogue.,5,25 November 2013,"I went to see this movie after seeing that in IMDb, it got a rating of 8.3 out of 10. Even though I saw some bad reviews about it, I was certain that a movie that got such a high rating in this kind of site must have something to offer. My god was I wrong. Where do I begin?Dialogue is poorly written and awkward at times. For example, when Peeta finds a pearl in the clam he just tells Katniss ""For you"" or something, and she replies with ""Thanks"" and takes the pearl. Wow. Just wow. What was the screenwriter or whoever writes that thing thinking? I honestly started laughing when I heard these lines.Screen time is wasted and an hour and fifteen minutes into the movie, almost nothing happened and I started drifting away, something that has never happened in the first movie which I saw like three times. They did switch directors from the first movie, and it shows.Unlike the previous Hunger Games, the sequel is plain boring, even in its most action-packed scenes, such as the toxic fog and the part where Peeta dies. So they manage to get past the fog and Peeta lives. Wooh, a twist! Everything that happens is so damn predictable and just uninteresting. Since over an hour passed until the games actually start, we don't get a chance to bond with the other tributes, and we just don't care about anyone except Katniss and Peeta. The part where the old lady runs into the fog in order to ""save the others"" could be much more emotional for the viewer if we only cared about her!Also, ending a movie with a cliffhanger like this is just frustrating and plain lazy. This is something you can do in a TV series, where you get to see the resolution in the next episode in a week, but when done in a movie, it is clearly a way to force us viewers to watch the next sequel in order to get a satisfying resolution and cash-in on the way. In short, the ending is disappointing and doesn't resolve anything that happened so far. Did I just pay a full price for a prequel to when the story really kicks in to action?I can go on and on about other things, such as the poor decision-making done by some of the characters (The bare-chested tribute knifing down the genius' wife while exposing himself to Katniss shooting him in the chest) or the stereotypical depiction of soldiers being sadistic, ruthless and unmerciful like robots instead of showing some small shred of humanity. I mean seriously, the Nazis weren't this cruel.However, there are some good sides to this movie. Jennifer Lawrence acts wonderfully and does try to express some of Katniss' feelings. She does a great job. Josh Hutcherson gives a decent performance as well, playing the confused-from-love-and-fame Peeta. Other side-characters are depicted very well, and the overall acting in this film is superb.Here and there there are some stronger scenes that save the movie from being a total bore, such as the fight against the baboons and Katniss and Peeta's first speech which was wonderfully acted.Overall, this is a 5. There are some bright spots here and there in this movie, but they are just outweighed by the general boredom and heaviness of the rest of the film, and I found myself not giving a damn about nearly anything that happened on screen. Great acting and some strong scenes are burdened by poor dialogue and weak directing.And that's pretty much it. I can't believe that this movie is believed to be one of 2013's best movies.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
655,Hadley17,The Girl On Fire Burns On,10,25 November 2013,"Let me just start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the books, especially Catching Fire. That said, I had high expectations going into the theater, and this movie did not disappoint. One of the things I love about this movie is how true it is to the book. Although obviously not everything from the book made it to the big screen, the scenes that were included made sense and incorporated anything that needed to be incorporated. The screenwriters give you enough information to understand what is going on, but also allow you to figure out certain details for yourself, which is something I immensely enjoyed. The bigger budget and new director made a positive difference, as well. I'll start off by talking about the visuals, especially the scenes in the Capitol. Everything in the Capitol looked so realistic, colorful, and over the top, just as described in the books. The images seemed to pop right off the screen! The stark contrast between the districts and the Capitol were masterfully done, with the colors of the Capitol shocking you after the grays of the districts. I also have to give big kudos to the costume designer. The costumes were amazing, from the simple clothes in the districts to the extravagant costumes of the Capitol. Everything worn by Katniss and Peeta, especially on the victory tour, tells a story, and all the costumes were expertly done with great attention to detail.However great the visuals and aesthetics were in Catching Fire, what really made this movie amazing for me was the acting. This movie is perfectly casted. The returning supporting actors add more depth to their characters. Elizabeth Banks molds Effie into someone more human, and you can really see how much she has come to care about Peeta and Katniss. The new additions are even better. Sam Claflin provides a great portrayal of Finnick, and Jena Malone's performance as Johanna really blew me away. The lead actors also bring more to the table. Josh Hutcherson does a great job as Peeta, giving him more emotional depth than in the first film, and Liam Hemsworth plays a convincing Gale. But the real star of this film is Jennifer Lawrence. Without Jennifer Lawrence, this movie would never be half as good. Katniss is a complex character, with many different levels, and Jennifer expertly brings them to life. Her face portrays everything Katniss is feeling, including both what she is showing the outside world, and what she feels inside. She brings Katniss to life in a way that I never thought possible, showing us every aspect of her character, no matter how small. She portrays Katniss' outward strength, but also her vulnerability and fear, something everyone can relate to. Both Lawrence and Hutcherson bring the complex and fascinating relationship of Peeta and Katniss to life in this film. What every actor in this film has in common is that they all portray every aspect of their character, even the subtle things. In some cases, such as Jena Malone as Johanna, they make their character's feelings on the events of the movie blatantly clear. But in others, such as Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, their eyes just barely hint on their true feelings of their situation and the world around them. Through Caesar's cheerful facade, you can still see that he is afraid of the events going on around him. It may be subtle, but it is there none the less.Overall, this was a fantastic movie. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, eager for whatever was coming next. This is the kind of movie you just can't get out of your head for days, as you keep replaying the images and conversations in your mind. I will definitely be seeing this movie again! I'm so glad Francis Lawrence will be directing the next two, and I am so excited to see those as well!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
656,LoganCMonahan,A Remarkable Film from Top to Bottom!,10,26 November 2013,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire could not have been more sensational. From the cinematography and soundtrack to the plot itself created by Suzanne Collins, it's really a heart wrenching ceremony. I haven't read the books, and after the first Hunger Games, I decided to begin reading Catching Fire myself, but never got the chance to read more than the first chapter because of my forgetfulness, but the film had much more to itself. Francis Lawrence did a very nice job with directing and topped the first movie to the trilogy! Acting was very well done, especially Jennifer Lawrence. The soundtrack was very relevant and similar to the first, only a few tweaks with the tracks, but it still really was re mindful of the first movie and the tragedies within it. However, I was hoping for a more different soundtrack to make it more unique from the first movie, and hopefully it should be more different once the next two films arrive. There are some flaws in this movie also, because no film is perfect, but they were pretty small in contrast to the rest of the movie I can't really remember them, but overall this film had really impressed me, more than what I was hoping for. Very well done!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
657,sean_1101,Still can't get enough of this.,9,26 November 2013,"Last Thursday, November 21, the most anticipated movie event of the year was premiered. Both fans of the book and movie were waiting for this day for almost a year, when Lionsgate released a date for the movie, fans all over the world got excited especially when they gave us the trailers and the movie posters.The first movie was a blockbuster reaching a hundred million sales on its first screening day, The Hunger Games was directed by Gary Ross who gave the film great visualizations and better castings and without him we won't be able to see the second installment of the film.The second film has a different director, Francis Lawrence. He directed many movies that are surely exceptional and Catching Fire movie is very much like the book, one of the best directors I've seen.Set in a dystopian world where twelve districts are ruled by the Capitol, every year the twelve districts are needed to send a boy and a girl as a tribute for the rebellion of the districts in the Panem decades ago.The last games in which Katniss participated made President Snow looks like a fool to the Capitol citizens. What Katniss did, didn't look like an act of love, more of like an act of defiance to them.In the celebration of the 75th Annual Hunger Games and which the year of Quarter Quell, Snow decided to eliminate Katniss Everdeen by reaping the tributes in the existing pool of victors. He saw her as a sign of revolution to the Capitol and he saw her as a threat that will destroy the Capitol.The actors were very brilliant to the characters they were playing, especially Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner; she embodied Katniss very well, from her looks and her attitudes. She's really the real-life Katniss. Also her co-actors, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, I remember his interview where he said that he felt like he's Peeta. Well he's right, you could see the character transformation of Peeta from the first movie to the second, he fits the role of Peeta, no doubt. I really like the relationship of Peeta and Katniss in this film, they have that aura.At first I thought Sam Claflin couldn't bring the Finnick we've all book readers imagined, but we are wrong. He portrayed him very well, its like Finnick is the actor and Sam is the character he is playing. Lastly, our very own Johanna Mason played by Jena Malone, she brings out Johanna's rudeness and rebellious attitude towards the Capitol, I really enjoyed her acting whenever she has screen time.At the first scene of the bloodbath where the game makers started the countdown, you will feel like you're one of the tributes who will fight for their lives. I love how they make the movie very realistic to us viewers. And kudos to Francis Lawrence for making this big like the first installment and to Suzzane Collins, our Queen, for writing and creating this exciting world full of astonishing characters that can make you attached with them.As a whole, the film was very well made. It doesn't lack any elements, it does have humor, the actions, the killings and especially the romance and the dialogue that they delivered are great also. But the love triangle didn't work out for me because I'm not a big fan of Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) it feels like he is an extra character.This is my first time reviewing a movie so basically its not that good but at least this movie is so good.I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's really worth it! Fans will not be disappointed and I bet that this movie will be more hit than the first one! I may watch this movie at the theaters for a couple times. Best book adaptation so far, go for it now, you don't want to miss this!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
658,gabyscanlon,Did it match the first Hunger Games???,10,26 November 2013,"After reading all 3 books, i was unsure as to whether the first film was going to be any good. After then watching the first film i was surprised at how amazing it was. I never would have thought the Second Hunger Games would match it. But it was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Lawrence is the perfect actress to play Katniss, she is extremely pretty and her acting is just superb! Obviously you have to keep your eyes on the screen constantly, because it is full of action, which for some might be hard to follow, especially at times when scenes are dark, but the action just like the first is extremely good. All the actors who were chose to be in this film are also perfectly chosen, and fit into key characters very well. If you liked the first i would definitely suggest to go and watch this one!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
659,bobbietalley123,I was NOT disappointed.,9,27 November 2013,"Naturally, it would be impossible to include every detail and every nuance of the book, but this director worked at incorporating the elements that had the most impact. The awesome special effects brought the book's images to life, and what had to be left out due to time constraints was not that disappointing. A little... but you'll get over it soon enough. I was also very appreciative of the fact this director chose not to use that 'shaky camera' effect which was used in the opening scene of the first movie. That is so annoying. The movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours, but it went so fast that I was left hungry for more. (No pun intended!) The only negative thing I have is that, for some reason, Liam's character, 'Gale' seems to have aged considerably between making the first and second movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
660,mockingjayxxxx,The Hunger Games; Catching Fire is flawless,10,28 November 2013,"The Hunger Games; Catching Fire was an astounding improvement from The Hunger Games (Directed by Gary Ross). It followed the book (Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins) perfectly, which was amazing for Hunger Games fans who have read the book and had expectations - because it sure does meet them. Even for people who haven't read Catching Fire, it was an intense and emotional movie that can keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. It doesn't have a dull moment and all effects and casting couldn't get better. The actors and actresses did a flawless job of becoming their characters, and acting freely with great lines and memorial moments. Director, Francis Lawrence, truly did an amazing job on Catching Fire and I recommend this movie to everyone as it couldn't get better and is allot better than the previous movie. In one word Catching Fire was just purely flawless.May the odds be ever in your favor - Effie Trinket (District 12 escort)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Although wealth and fame have followed winning the event, the winners are still ultimately under the submission of the President. This is reminded to them, when for the 75th annual Hunger Games, the rules are changed and the tributes are pulled from the pool of past winners. This movie does a great job in providing some background on the competitors of the Hunger Games and in so, creating sympathy for their situation. The actors do a great job in conveying the complex emotions that trouble them and build a sense of community within the film. Overall it was a great and deeply moving movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The end is so abrupt every one was waiting that at least director would give one good scene, but credits appear.2/3 movie is about last movie and it was too hard to relate to any character and you feel what do I care...in last 30 minutes games start, no parallel story lines for other participants, again you feel I don't care if they win or loose. The action scenes are very average and the entire movie is so predictable.It does not deserve this high rating.

First off, the hunger games themselves are supposed to be the people in the games killing each other right. Not anymore. I mean, a few if the players were killed by the others but in the end, most were killed by the disastrous weather and other things. It was basically just Peeta, Katnis and their allies running away from whatever thing Snow sent to kill them instead of the other people. Second, we never really got to know any of the other tributes. Towards the end they kept saying that these two people were still out there and I just kept asking myself, who are these people. You never knew who the real threats were in the competition. Finally, the ending was horrible. My brother looked at me and asked if it was over and all I could say was i don't know. People say that it was a cliff hanger. It was not. They tell you where the important people are and what the Capitol did. The only positive i found in the movie was the acting.

665,user-861-634894,Truly one of the best films of this generation,10,4 December 2013,"As a huge fan of the books, I can honestly say that Francis Lawrence took this book, along with my expectations, and blew it sky high. He is such an amazing director. He of course had to take a few things out, but managed to stay true to the book. Jennifer Lawrence portrays her character in a very good way, and for the whole film, you don't think of her as ""Jennifer Lawrence the Oscar winner"" you think of her as Katniss Everdeen. In case you couldn't tell, I am a very big fan of Jennifer Lawrence as well. I have seen all of her films. It's too bad I don't own them all, or else I'd have a Jennifer Lawrence movie marathon everyday. I am so proud of how far this trilogy has come, and I cannot wait until MockingJay Part 1. I will definitely be at the London Premier.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
666,h12100412,Exceptional film experience,9,4 December 2013,"Jennifer Lawrence is the driving force of this film. She is exceptional. I can't imagine this movie with another actress in her role. Lawrence is able to emote katniss's pain, fear, anger effortlessly, and so believably...that, if you allow yourself to just respond, then she is able to make you connect with her, which enables an emotional film experience. My primary reason for watching movies, is to experience feelings. And to feel, you have to make a connection with the characters in some way. And Jennifer Lawrence allows this in a powerful way. Yes, there were parts of movie I thought could have been done better. But, if you allow your self to connect with Lawrence's character, and rather than asking questions, simply allow yourself to feel her emotions, then...an exceptional movie experience awaits you.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
667,bolanosmarilyn,Hungry For More,9,12 December 2013,"My favorite thing to do in my free time is watch a good movie. Every Saturday night my family likes to rent or go out to watch a movie. A good movie to me is a film where you can enjoy the story line, a movie that makes you ask yourself what will happen next, and has your attention all throughout the film. I like movies that seem realistic even if there's no way in the world that can happen. That's why I was so excited to go watch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.Recently, a novel created by Suzanne Collins became a motion picture film that has been watched by millions. I can say The Hunger Games is like no other movie I have ever watched. It's a captivating, thrilling, and overall an exhilarating movie. Like many people, I was excited to watch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire after watching first Hunger Games movie.Watching the trailer for the second movie, Catching Fire, I was thrilled to know it was coming out very soon and looking as interesting as the last one. I was also hoping some of my questions I had after watching the first movie would be answered in the upcoming film, which they were. I have not read any of the books, so I was unable to make any connections, between the movies and the books. My younger sister has and she mentioned that Catching Fire was based on a lot of parts from the book, and that it was amazing how similar it was to the book, having said that those who enjoyed reading the book will most likely enjoy watching the movie. What I enjoyed about Catching Fire was that it was a continuance of the first film and it didn't confuse the audience on what was going on, like other movies with sequence do. They were many emotional and action scenes, but I was just expecting more. I strongly recommend watching the first Hunger Games before watching Catching Fire, because the audience will be unable to follow what is going on in Catching Fire if they don't. I really enjoy when movies use the same characters they had in the first film in their second one as well, and that's exactly what Catching Fire did, except for those who died, obviously. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire did reminisce a lot on what happened in the past movie, especially to certain characters,which allows the audience to know what the motivations of the characters are. The acting was great and very realistic, not like other films where it seems like actors are reading off cue cards. They incorporated a lot of well-known actors like Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, and Josh Hucherson, which made it more fun to watch. Especially since Liam Hemsworth is such a good looking guy. I suggest if the audience love watching those actors in other movies they should definitely come and watch Catching Fire. Even though the movie was pretty long, it keeps the audience attention the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I appreciated the hard work that was obviously put into this movie. The audience gets a deeper understanding of the characters in Catching Fire and they show them a different side of the characters. They did add a little humor throughout the film, which made the viewer's laugh a bit. Catching Fire had mostly everything a movie could have; action, drama,romance, and death. Movies are created to entertain people and this one certainly did. My favorite part would have to be the ending, which is left off with a jaw dropping event, leaving the audience anxious for the next one. I did hear many are disappointed by this ending,including my older sister, which made her dislike the entire movie. If you don't like cliff hangers then I recommend that maybe you should wait until the next movie comes out. Opening weekend made about $158,074,286, and I am not ashamed to admit my $10 contributed to that amount of money that was made. It makes you think if so many people are watching this film why shouldn't I go? I am a huge fan of The Hunger Games and I have to say the movies are getting better and better through time. If you haven't seen either of The Hunger Games you are missing out. I HIGHLY recommend The Hunger Games: Catching Fire for any age group, even though the film is PG-13, go drag your parents to go watch it with you if you're under thirteen. I am 90% sure you will enjoy this film. It's a perfect film to go watch when you need to relax and get your mind off things. This movie will not disappoint you!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I like the movie, because it shows some good moments in it, and maybe cry able, as i did, because i thought it was so good. From the first movie they have improved and make it even better, like how its not all about the hunger games in the beginning, and i LOVE the trailer, cant simple stop watching it.

It was a true yawner. Actually remarkable for its lack of originality. Only in the final moments of the film was their even a suggestion that a new idea might be introduced. And then only to end abruptly in cliff hanger.Only a die-hard sucker will be inclined to see the third film in the series after the disappointing experience of sitting through this one. This is a movie that will leave you angry and wanting to demand your money back.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
671,ixheartxreno,Catching Fire review. Does Contain Spoiler,9,12 December 2013,"Hunger Games:Catching Fire Review By CaroleI didn't want to watch the new Hunger Games: Catching Fire, movie. The first one had killed the trilogy for me. I would rather remember the, Hunger Games from the books I had read and loved. I was skeptical when my best friend suggested we go see it. I reluctantly bought a movie ticket, expecting a giant two and half-hour let down; boy was I wrong.I sat down in my seat and as soon as the opening credits played, I already had goose bumps from the mocking jay song. I still wasn't holding out for a great movie, but I was intrigued at this point. The movie opens up with Gale and Katniss talking, before Katniss was to leave for the victory tour. The first thing I noticed was that Katniss looked different from the last movie. She no longer looked like child; she had a look of sadness and a harden appearance to her. Katniss looked more believable as a character that has been thorough and survived the Hunger Games. Katniss is also suffering from PTSD, with flashbacks, hallucinations, and scary dreams. The physical transformation of Katniss was much appreciated ,which made her more relatable to the book series. Even the scenery was different this go round from the last movie. The colors were noticeably subdued and the imagery no longer had the cheap feel as the first Hunger Games. The cinematographer did a wonderful job with the CGI. Last movie, I felt the CGI wasn't believable, looked extremely fake, and looked cheap. Whereas, this time the scenes are brought to life with tasteful images and colors. Even the characters Effie and Ceaser were both toned down in their appearance and colors. Ceaser no longer radioactively glowed, and Effie no longer looked dead. I also liked how President Snow was portrayed this go around. The acting was a giant step up from the previous movie. The actor really captured the hate Snow feels for Katniss, which is something I felt in the book as well.I found it very refreshing how accurate the movie portrayed the book. This is very important when making a film based on a book, especially when the books were such a hit among its readers. The last movie was not as accurate and fans of the series were pretty vocal about their disapproval. It's nice to see a new director take control and listen to the fans. The one thing I didn't think the movie portrayed correctly, was the relationships between Gale and Katniss , and the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Catching fire, plays up the Gale and Katniss relationship, and greatly downplays Peeta and Katniss. The movie doesn't really focus, on how Peeta helps with Katniss and her PTSD, by spending numerous nights with her, so she no longer has to have bad dreams. To me, this is an important fact to overlook, because this shows the feelings Katniss starts to develop for Peeta. In the book Katniss is more torn between the two guys, instead of focusing all her attention on Gale. My favorite part of the whole film was of course when the tributes are in the Arena. I liked how the movie helped put a visual to what was in my head while reading the book. The aerial view off the arena made it easy to see how it was divided into a clock. I loved how the movie made you see the arena through the eyes of Katniss, as she was standing on her platform she was blinded by bright, white, light, and everything else slowly came into focus. I loved the fight scenes, which in my opinion where much more believable then the last movie. The movie does end with a giant cliffhanger, which is very true to the ending of the Catching Fire book. I remember after reading the book, I immediately began reading the third book, Mocking Jay. I was so intrigued, I had to keep going, which is how I felt after seeing Catching Fire. I'm so excited to see what the director does in Mocking Jay. Overall, this movie was a giant step up from the last film and anyone who is fan of the books should be happy with how accurate the movie is to the book. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is skeptical about seeing it, especially after seeing the first movie. I would even suggest this movie to a person who isn't a fan of the trilogy, but wants to see a good fantasy movie to escape reality.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Jennifer Lawrence is so crushable I couldn't take my eyes off her. Ultimately disappointing because our expectations are so high and the movie is so poorly put together structure-wise.

CAtchong fire starts off with Katniss, Petta, Haymitch, and Effie going on the victory tour. During the tour they see some awful sights and people get shot. Before they had gone on the victory tour, president snow came to katniss's home and threatened her and her loved ones. He said she needed to ""convince him"".

Although it was rather long since they have to pack so much story line in so little of time, the movie still was able to hold your attention throughout. I was surprised to find that this movie was pretty sad (I haven't read the books). I found myself really feeling for the characters as they journey back to face the games yet again. Katnis is clearly having trouble dealing with all that happened to her in the games. She does make some very interesting new allies, or what appear to be allies, in the new movie. Without them she may not have survived the games another time around. I'm really interested to see if these so called friends stay friendly or if they are really her greatest enemies. I think I may just have to read the books before the next movies come out I'm not sure I will be able to wait that long for a conclusion!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
678,giulia-armiero,"for me, best movie of all time",10,29 December 2013,"Being a HUGE hunger games fan, I can honestly say Francis Lawrence is a God. He was absolutely amazing with the production, script and directing of this movie. Catching Fire finally proves that if you stick to the book, it'll be the #1 movie in the world for TWO WEEKS IN A ROW! (Talking to you, Percy Jackson ;) ) I know many people complain about the length of the movie, but I was SO happy it was this long as it was extremely true to the book (I would make it even longer). I think Francis Lawrence was right in taking up an hour of the movie on the Victory Tour and District 12 and the «other hour in the Arena. The first part really creates the imagery of Panem and the world of The Hunger Games which was't shown in the first movie. With the shots of the Districts you can really get the feeling of their society, you can see the revolts and desperate need of rebelling from the citizens and that becomes very important later on in the next movies. Of course, the spectator also sees the poverty in the Districts and that creates a massive contrast when shots of the Capitol are shown. The cast was flawless, as always. Apart from the extraordinary acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, I loved how slightly smaller characters had such huge developments from the first movie and book. For example, Elizabeth Banks played Effie perfectly, and I could really see her evolve, how the two victors almost made her change her opinion on the Capitol and the Games and the motherly nature in her, finally having victors from her assigned District. The new cast members, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright etc, could not have been better. Sam was able to show so many sides of Finnick Odair that I was dreaming to see ever since I read the books: his arrogance, his love for Mags, his honor and then his vulnerability. Jena was exactly how I pictured Johanna Mason (who is also my favourite female) and I applaud her infinitely. I will never finish this review because it never seems to be complete for me, but to stop myself I'll say: BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN FOR AND TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
679,Hanky92,Just gets better!,9,4 January 2014,"I loved this movie. Just as much, or more than than the first. I enjoyed the plot for this movie/book, because they are starting to take action against the Capital. I loved actually seeing the new arena. It is awesome to actually see what I pictured in the book. It looked way better than I every imagines it could. It looked great! The new casting was good. I was looking forward to some new characters and the actors played them well. I knew everything about the movie from the book, yet I was kept interested the whole time. The only real negative thing I would have to say about it, would be that the movie was very fast-paced. I get why they have to that, because so much detail happened in the book and they don't want the movie to be too long. But everything seemed to go by in the blink of eye. However, it stayed true to the novel. I can't wait for Mocking Jay Part 1 and Part 2! :)",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
680,thunderwing303,My Thoughts,9,7 January 2014,"I thought that this movie was astounding. One of the best book-to-movie adaptations ever! Not too many sequels surpass its predecessor, however, this one completely took the cake. I was a fan of the first movie, but the second one was breathtaking.The visuals in the movie are both beautiful and frightening. From the poisonous fog to the collapse of the arena, or even the plaza area where Gale receives hi whipping. It was so detailed.Jennifer Lawrence is a damn good representation of Katniss Everdeen, I must say. She is great at portraying both a brave noble young woman, and a curious, quiet, obedient girl.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
681,celenethebest,Not good enough,5,15 January 2014,"This is the second movie of The Hunger Games trilogy, directed by Francis Lawrence and written by Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt. It was released last year in the USA as an action, adventure, sci-fi, thriller genre mix. The plot involves a post-apocalyptic world where there are 13 districts. The principal one is the first which rules the rest of the districts with an iron fist, and to avoid the threat of revolution there are televised games in which kids and teenagers (12 to 18 years old) fight each other to death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) won the last game and know they have to visit all districts, but some of the districts are starting a revolution because they see hope in Katniss. But to suppress the hopes of the districts, The Capital changes the game by placing all the Hunger Games winners to battle to death. The action and the direction still good as the first movie; Katniss is even more beautiful and bold. But the movie may be disappointing to some viewers even more after seeing the trailer. I felt there was a lot of information about the little details but very little information about the other districts and the revolution, which in my view were the focus of the movie. Overall the movie is quite predictable and vague, I hope that the third part can surprise and refill the missing gaps.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
682,larry-e-miller1,Soft looking Jennifer Lawrence plays starving kid?,1,6 February 2014,"First, let me say I like Jennifer Lawrence. I think she is beautiful. She seems like a kick in the butt on and off the set. However, I never understood how she was chosen to play a kid who grew up in the most starved district of a starving world. I can suspend disbelief for some things, but all I ask when I see her on screen for these movies is,'she was born in a starving world and has been starved all of her life, yet somehow she grew to be 5'9"" and weigh in the neighborhood of 130 pounds?"" Again, I like her (not in these Hunger Games tripe) but she's about 10 pounds away from being type cast as the next big teen hit's mom.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
683,doug-904-553905,Most predictable film ever!,4,23 January 2014,"I generally find that the really popular movies never really live up to the hype. Still, movies like Avatar and Titanic, or The Hunger Games, are at least well made, and though a little predictable and lacking in any interesting commentary on the human condition, are generally entertaining.Not so with Catching Fire, however. It was so predictable that I could have written the damn thing after seeing the first 10 minutes. To make matters worse, it was boring; really, really, boring.Please, please do the world a favour and stop making these films. I know that sequels are rarely as good as the first, and that this sequel was not nearly as bad as some (Highlander 2 stands out in my mind), but why anyone involved in this project thought it should go ahead is beyond me. Can Hollywood producers not read, or are they just brain-dead? More importantly, are movie-goers so completely controlled by advertising that they actually see this polished turd as a gem? I don't know, but I do know this; if you can think, be kind to your brain and go see a different movie. One caveat, if you do have a mind, but also suffer from insomnia, this might actually be a good choice.

684,its-lauren-riley,Great Film,9,27 January 2014,"I loved the movie and think that it's a great continuation of the first. When it came to the end I was really annoyed, not by lack of quality, but by the fact that it's a real cliff-hanger and I just wanted more. Jennifer Lawrence was a star once again and we even saw glimpses of her truly hilarious personality being portrayed through Katniss. The love story becomes much more complicated in Catching Fire and I definitely find myself feeling sorry for both Peeta and Gail. I also loved seeing more of Primrose and Katniss' mother along with president Snow. I think the movie is an almost perfect balance of romance and action with a tad of heart wrenching emotion. Truly great and I'm not afraid to admit that I have seen it more than once.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
685,jakem-909-521359,gripping plot with brilliant twists and leaves you wanting more at the end,10,8 April 2014,"The film picks up 6 months after where the first one picks off. The film starts with the annual 'victory tour' about to take place. After that concludes the quarter quell is announced by President Snow with the difference being that previous winners will be put back into the arena again to battle it out.Katniss ,played by Jennifer Lawrence, displays a more serious tone in this movie as the role of being a victor who's supposed to be madly in love to please the Capitol and is then thrust into the quarter quell. She appears very determined to save Peeta as she owes him for things in the past as shown in the first film and the books. Lawrence plays the role of Katniss expertly well, portraying brilliant scenes of emotion of all kinds along with well thought out and well acted out dialogue.Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta once again and an immediate impression from watching the movie is how much he seems to have matured as an actor as the role this time round was more challenging with him having to do more action sequences along with some impressive dramatic acting through the uses of facial expressions and tone of voice his acting has clearly gone up a few levels not that it was bad before but he was only around the age 18 then so he had time to grow and definitely has.There are some new additions to the array of actors in the movie. two of them being Jena Malone who plays Johanna Mason and Sam Claflin who plays Finnick Odair. Both play the roles very well and appear to have large roles in the upcoming films also as they're part of the rebellion. Minus one or two occasions where Finnick's accent changes to English Sam Claflin does a very good job of depicting Finnick and stays true to the book also. Jena Malone makes a brilliant transition from a happy and bubbly person in real life to what looks like quite a dark and complicated character that seems fearless. Jena doesn't seem phased by some aspects of acting either as the scene where she strips in the lift might have been a problem for other actors Jena seemed fine even though it was mainly off camera.The plot is in general very similar to the first film however it takes various twists such as the new quarter quell stipulation and the news of uprising in the districts. the main twist though is at the very end when arena collapses and Katniss is taken away by a hovercraft. Once she awakens the presence of Plutarch Heavensbee is a surprise as he is also part of the rebellion and once we hear what Gale has to tell Katniss about district 12 being destroyed and that they're on their way to district 13 and that Peeta is in the Capitol with Johanna like Haymitch said and the credits then begin rolling you feel a slight bit of disappointment as it's a massive cliffhanger but makes you crave the next one which is unfortunately in two parts and the first isn't out until late November which is a downer but it stays true to the book however and it's an incredible film and a great plot!!!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
686,jenniferhutchens,Reflection on Philip Seymour-Hoffman,10,13 February 2014,"I thought this movie was even better than the first. I couldn't help but focus on the Plutarch Heavensbee character played by the late Philip Seymour-Hoffman. Particularly when he is first introduced to Katniss by Effie Trinket at the party.(Movie Lines from their introduction)........................Plutarch: So how do you like the party? Katniss: It's a little... overwhelming. Plutarch: It's appalling. Still if you abandon your moral judgment it can be fun. Katniss: So are you having fun? Plutarch: I'm Head Game Maker, fun is my job. Katniss: I thought that's what happened to Seneca Crane, too much fun. Plutarch: Seneca decided to... quit breathing. Katniss: Decided? Plutarch: It was that or poison berries. I think Head Game Maker's never been the most secure job in the world.Katniss: And why are you here? Plutarch: Same reason as you, I volunteered. Katniss: Why? Plutarch: Ambition, a chance to make the games mean something. Katniss: The games don't mean anything, they only mean to scare us. Plutarch: Well, maybe it's you who inspired me to come back.I think its quite ironic that he suggests Seneca Crane gave up or could have taken poison berries after having ""too much fun"" in games where you were asked to ""give up your moral judgment"". Did Seymour-Hoffman give up by taking heroin (poison berries) because he was no longer having fun in the ""games"" of acting? After watching his earlier 60 Minutes interview it was plain he was tough on himself. Perhaps he contemplated on his lines a bit too long and decided to take them to heart. He didn't seem to ever want to be acknowledged for the great work he was doing. He wanted us to forget Philip and believe only in the character he was playing. Perhaps he felt too exposed and vulnerable. Regardless his death is a huge loss for Hollywood. He will be missed.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels.

Those who enjoy books such as Fahreheit 451 and 1984 are sure to find entertainment in this film once you give it a chance. The costume designs throughout this film are very Alexander McQueenesque, and stunning overall. The characters were developed far better than its predecessor, and it left me wanting more at the end.

691,Jowanlm,"this movie is one of the worst ever, maybe worse than the books",1,14 October 2014,"The Hunger Games Is the most stupid piece of literature and film ever. Here's why: As a direct result of this conundrum, the picture not only fails as a social/political commentary but becomes an ugly celebration of the very narrative that it should be condemning. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.The Hunger Games is worse than a bad movie. It's an immoral movie, possibly even an evil one. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is absolutely awful. It's stupid as hell, completely and entirely pointless, and good god is it in dire need of a freaking editor. Seriously, what genius thought that a three hour long Hunger Games movie was a good idea? By the time the actual ""games"" began, I had long since checked out of this piece of trash. I seriously did not give a crap at all about the story or a single one of these crappy characters, and I couldn't have possibly cared less how this god awful thing was gonna end, so long as it was finally just freaking over and done with already. Watching this movie in the theater is an endurance test that's almost like undergoing an entirely different sort of terrorizing group exercise as those participating in the Hunger Games themselves. As for the plot here, hell, did you see the first movie? Well guess what, you already saw this one, only minus about a good hour or so of pointless, stupid nonsense that stretches this thing to its absolute thinnest. The pre-games stuff just dragged on and on for forever and a day, taking as long as humanly possible to get to the damn point. And the whole while, it never once came close to being nearly as interesting as this portion was in the first movie. It was just a complete retread, minus the intrigue, and needlessly expanded upon with a whole lot of nothing. But not only is this movie needlessly longer than the first, but it's also infinitely more stupid. The Hunger Games themselves was just a series of traps setting off, whether it's skin eating mist (which basically just leaves poorly applied makeup marks that easily washes off in water, bad acting optional (seriously, stop over-doing it, Jennifer Lawrence)) or randomly rampaging monkeys. Hell, that baboon scene reminded me of a similar scene in After Earth, and it actually left me wishing I was watching that freaking movie instead. And at no point did I ever feel like our main characters were ever in any actual danger through all of this nonsense. Gone was the aspect of hunt or be hunted, it was like watching a really shitty and unfun version of The Cabin in the Woods, where everything transpiring was a result of the guys behind the games just interfering with the environment, only for our cast to survive in the most convenient of manners each and every time. This movie was awful, so awful I was left shaking in anger by the end of it. It's not just a worse movie than the first one, and hell, I actually liked the first movie. The first movie's a freaking godsend in comparison. But this? Catching Fire not only makes the exact same mistakes that that one made, but it adds on a whole laundry list of new ones on top of that. I couldn't have possibly cared less about the ongoing plot or the fate of any of these characters, and amongst all of the groan inducing idiocy at hand, I was never once given a reason to give a crap about any of it in the first place. Without question, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the worst movie I've seen this year so far. Katniss is the MOST annoying character of all time. Yes, the book takes the first person perspective of a 16 year old girl and therefore should be annoying however if I had to hear her whine and complain about a situation she volunteered for one more time I swear I would have created a fictional character just so I could have it slap the living stuff out of her. 'I'm hungry' 'Life isn't fair' 'I don't know what to do' 'I don't want to kill anyone in a contest I volunteered for that involves killing people.' Really Katniss? Really? Either put up or shut up! She fails as a lead character and she also fails as a strong female that the book was pretending to masquerade her as. By the end of the book I was so tired of her complaints I wish she would have died so I wouldn't be forced to listen to other people say how much they LOVED the next two books even though they were equally crappy.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
692,jat1121,I wish you fans would be honest so others don't waste precious minutes of their lives,1,15 March 2014,"Slow, boring, disjointed, and those are the good points. Let's see, in the first movie, they went to the arena and fought to the death. In the second movie . . . . they went to the arena and fought to the death! Except in the second movie you have to go through about two hours of nothing to get to that point. The nothing is really great, they live in a nicer house, they travel by train, they party, they travel by train, they whisper to each other a lot, they utter inane statements and pretend those are profound. I just saw it, and that's really all I can remember. What complete and utter dreck.Oh, and when you get to the arena, it's about as stupid as it gets. But instead of talking about that incredibly boring part, let's talk about some idiocy. Plutarch is part of the revolution. He spends his whole time relaxing with President Snow, the leader of the enemy. How about just putting his hands around Snow's neck and chocking him to death? Or hitting Snow over the head with one of the many available objects?And then there are all the twists. But why bother telling you because only someone with serious developmental disabilities would consider them to really be twists.I've watched plenty of bad movies, but never have written a review.

Remember they made the hobbit it into two films so who knows what they will do to make money!). I like the concept of the series, it mixes up modern concepts of the cult of celebrity with good old systems of control employed by any 20th century dictator. Unlike some reviewers, I did care about the actors and even the bit part hunger games contestants, the development comes from watching both films so don't watch with seeing the first one. Plus, if you can't feel something for the situation these guys are in, I would question your sanity! I should also point out, living in a violent dictatorship is not conducive to spilling emotions and feelings around wily billy, if the characters had it would ring oddly. remember it is scifi, don't expect technological reality! I note some reviewers comment on implausibility, sci if/fantasy films should be avoided if one doesn't want implausibility! putting someone in a coma for two days without securing an airway is rather dangerous so I don't see much difference in the unreality of that vs killer fog cleansed by water!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The effects that were used were absolutely ecstatic, they suited each, individual scene perfectly, without overdoing it to make it look like unrealistic.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss so well, I honestly don't think you could find a better actress for the role, I'd probably have to say the same for Peeta, Effie, Haymitch and Caesar.I hope you enjoyed my review for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.*RIP, Phillip Seymour Hoffman*~iHorwood",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
697,aia_kemeltaeva,Catching Boredom,5,26 March 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  or better: Catching Boredom.The title says enough. In contrary to the book, the movie was really boring and uninteresting to watch. Personally, I don't like to read at all but the Hunger Games trilogy really bit me and in less than 3 weeks I've read them all. So I decided to watch the sequel after a nice first film and a really amazing book. The story in the book was addictive, interesting, exciting  and all the other good things you could say about a book. Nevertheless, the story in the movie wasn't nearly as good as in the book. It didn't get my full attention. From the beginning it was clear that the film wouldn't meet my expectations I got from the book and the trailer. The action scenes weren't as good as they were in my head, maybe it was difficult to film it but the director could have done a way better job. There wasn't a connection with the characters, in the first film there was. Take Rue, the 12-year-old girl from district 11 who died, it really touched me. But when the old lady ran into the toxic fog in this movie, it didn't do much to me. It was certainly not because she was an old woman and not a cute little girl. With Rue we got the time to band with this character, Katniss cared about her and that made me care about her too, even after Rue's death: we still remember her 4 notes melody which was their communication method through the mocking jays.The end was weird. It was even disappointing, you've watched the whole film, waiting for a great plot twist but then it ends. You get to see so many important things squeezed into a couple of minutes. If the director would have paid more attention to these important things than to the 'action scenes' who weren't that great, the film would be a lot more interesting to watch. Probably it was meant to be a cliffhanger but it didn't made me want to see the 3rd film. What was interesting about the film, were all the other Hunger Games champions. It was nice to meet them, even for the short notice (so before the killing began). But all the bad things don't take away that Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson did a great job as their roll of Katniss and Peeta. They were at some points the only reason to keep on watching, how they expressed themselves as their characters was really superb. They weren't the only great actors, all the others were also great to watch.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
698,ThomasChristy,Lacking something special,5,10 April 2014,"I gave this movie a rating of 5 because it wasn't all bad. However, the movie was clearly pushed through on the success of the first. This time, all the anticipation was missing and the depth of most of the characters seemed lost. I didn't feel I was rooting for the lead character to survive, as I had done in the first. Some of the ""participants"" to the hunger-game had nothing to contribute to the storyline at all. The number of cannon (lives lost) shots seemed no- eventful. The rolling death-fog seemed to be too quick to cause havoc (almost like they had nothing else to fill the dome with) and the idea of the spinning time island was figured out far too easily, (yes I know it was a plot to get them out but more anticipation and cunning was expected). It felt like we were being quickly ushered through the storyboard and not immersed into an exciting plot, as it should have been.The whole movie just seemed to lack some special ingredient that was there for the first. It maybe that it should have been one long release and not split, we'll see on the next film. The twist at the end just finished off the disappointment for me. On the plus side, I do want to know how it pans out and if the next release will make a difference to the overall movie franchise. There were some nice effects too.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
699,mal653,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Movie (Released In 2013),5,13 May 2014,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Movie (Released in 2013)My Review is a movie. The name of this movie is The Hunger Games and it is the second series which is Catching Fire. This movie was released in 2013. The IMDb rating of this movie is 7.8. I think that everyone knows this movie because it is very famous. The main character of this movie is Katniss Everdeen. I think that for anyone who never watched this movie should watch it because they're going to get shocked at the end of the movie and I really like to see peoples' reactions when they watch a really shocking thing.Catching Fire talks about a game that is called The Hunger Games which is happened every year. In the first series, it was the 74th annual Hunger Games. Katniss was an 18 year old girl and people who contribute in the Hunger Games are 11+. Katniss's sister was 11 years old and they were forced to put their names on a piece of paper and wait for the draw. For the ladies' names, the first name that was called was ""Prim Everdeen""... Katniss started screaming and crying to volunteer instead of her sister because she knows that she is not strong enough to protect herself from getting killed. They accepted her request to volunteer, but her sister started crying. Katniss tried to tell her not to worry about her, and she also promised her that she is going to win The Hunger Games. Katniss bought that Mockingjay and she knew that it would protect her if she kept it. After she goes to that game, she won with her partner Peeta and they fell in a really quick love story. She won all because of that Mockingjay she keptIn the second series, Catching Fire, a revolution started against the Hunger Games, Katniss was the one who started it because lots of people died and children too because of the last Hunger Games. While that happens, Katniss is more hated by The Hunger Game's president, and he was already so jealous because she won with Peeta and he knows that she is acting and forcing herself to try to love him. From how jealous the president was, in The 75th Annual Hunger Games, he said that we're going to draw the names of the only previous winners of the Hunger Games. Katniss and the other people in her side were really sad because Katniss is the only winner in her whole district from the past 75 years. So, Katniss is 100% going to the Hunger Games for the second time in her life.Katniss is being so depressed now. It's going to be much harder for her to win this Hunger Games because she is versing winners now. Now Peeta has to go to the second Hunger Games too When the Hunger Games began, she had to run to get shelter for herself, but suddenly, someone was going to kill her, but got protected from a man from another District. He said that he wanted to be in her team. They become a big team. It was an adventure for them how to survive from all these danger stuff and some things were poison too. In the end, Katniss looked up to the sky and realized that it is a roof She hit it with an arrow and it got stuck at the roof. Suddenly, the roof broke and now, NO MORE PEOPLE CAN CONTROL THE HUNGER GAMES!! SHE RUINED THE HUNGER GAMES! Guess what the president is feeling now!This movie uses mostly the persuasion: Pathos. They use it because this movie is all full of feelings and how Katniss is danger and how she's living in such a poor place. Also, it shows how there are children getting killed from the Hunger Games and the place where Katniss was living had no justice. Not everything Katniss wanted, she had In conclusion, I would recommend you to watch this adventurous and really interesting movie.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

I watched the hunger games and I didn't really like it because of the poor special effects and some bad acting, also, I didn't connect to the characters at all. But, after being finished with The Hunger Games, I got Catching Fire. It started confusing. Sometimes, starting with a lot of questions makes the movie better. But with this movie I was mostly annoyed. So many things were unclear and I honestly thought that Jennifer Lawrence's character Katniss is as boring as Bella from Twilight. Then came the whole district-tour-thing. At first I was kinda bored with the whole train stuff and the shallow conversations, but when the rebellion started, the movie got interesting and Katniss became less shallow. Now Gale is getting hit with a whip lash and I'm kinda done with the movie, I really want to keep watching, but it's getting really Divergent-like ( a movie that I did enjoy ) but nit in a good way. I have no idea what's going to happen in the other half of the movie but I guess I'll find out tomorrow, because I'm taking a day-break from Katniss and her love triangle.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
701,emmacoll123-34-896201,An excellent film with and excellent story,9,22 June 2014,"FIRSTLY, I want to make it clear after reading some of these reviews I was deeply disappointed with the response from people claiming they had lost money, and that the film was a waste of time as they did not enjoy the story, to those people I want to tell them that THERE ARE BOOKS, if you was not sure about the story-line of the film then read the book before hand. As I have read the books myself I felt deeply connected to the characters of this amazing story, and as a film student I feel the film itself was visually fantastic, I'm extremely glad Francis Lawerence took on the role of director for this film as he has gotten rid of the awful shaky camera style (Seen in the first Hunger Games by Director Gary Ross) , and shown the world of Panem in detail, the way I imagined it ( and more) when reading the books. I thoroughly enjoyed every-second of the film, and the actors did a amazing job of bringing these characters to life. One criticism of the film was the fact a couple of important scenes from the book were not included, however the fact extra scenes were added that were not included in the book due to the restrictive narrative won me over. Keeping the review short I will finish it here saying that overall I loved the second instalment of The Hunger Games series more than the first, and I'm eagerly awaiting the final two films. To people who are unsure about the films, or say they dislike the story-line I urge you to read the books by Suzanne Collins and then maybe you can appreciate the characters much more and realise these films are not just about love, they include sacrifice, loss, politics, corruption and PTSD. 9/10 for Catching fire!",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
702,amy_dollartree,Excellent start to finish,10,22 November 2013,This movie was excellent and enjoyable all the way through! The action and drama were completely the way I imagined when I read the book! Jennifer Lawrence takes you on an emotional journey with her as she bring Katniss to life! Her emotions and facial expressions make you feel what she is feeling! The games are well done and make you feel the panic that the tributes are feeling! The ending of this movie leaves you wanting more! Also I find Katniss and Peeta's love story beautiful and moving and you finally see them evolve into an actual couple you are rooting for! Jena Malone's Johanna Mason is the comic relief with her witty comebacks and loathing of the capital! President Snow is the villain that actually made my flesh crawl when he is on screen! The only complaint I have with this movie is I feel that they could've given the other victors more screen time so you can actually get to know them and identify with them and their feelings of betrayal with what the capitol has done to them! I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan or just looking for an escape from reality! :),The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
703,c-kamphues,I expected a lot more,6,29 September 2015,"When I was reading the Hungergames trilogy, the second book became my absolute favorite due to the amazing characters that were introduced to us. So it's easy to understand that I was really looking forward to the movie.Even though the movie was okay and the acting was even improved a bit since the first movie, I couldn't shake off the feeling that they left out a big part of the story line. Of course, it's understandable that you have to leave some things out since there's not enough time in one movie to film it all. But I can't agree with the fact that the whole 'back-to-district-12' part took about 2/3th of the movie. I disagree even more with the fact that they are filming the last movie in two parts. Why haven't they done that with book two? The second book has so much more content to work with then the third. I really loved the idea of the arena of the second book and I'm disappointed in the amount of what was shown in the movie.However, the movie was still pretty nice and entertaining and the effects were again spot-on. But it's a shame that they did show most of the boring parts of the book in the movie while there are so much awesome scenes in it that seem to be forgotten or are shortened.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
704,peterbrown454,The Hunger Games Re-make,2,26 November 2014,"Having watched the first Hunger Games with some appreciation, I was decidedly eager to watch the second. How wrong I was.The basis of the film is laid out fairly quickly. There is discontent among the enslaved Districts. Katniss' inadvertent televised defiance of the autocratic Capitol by surviving the Hunger Games has shown its yoked peoples that it is not invincible. Hope threatens to displace fear, and there are instances of open defiance, threatening to bubble over into full-blown insurrection. All that is needed is the touch-paper to be lit. However, fearful for the people and the retribution they will suffer, Katniss is unwilling to act as a symbol against the regime.This amounts to the first twenty minutes of the film. ""OK"", you think. ""Solid, if uninspired. So she reluctantly becomes the figurehead of a revolution which topples the dastardly government. "" However, before proceeding down this well-trod path, the film-makers decide that we first need to watch a re-make of the first film, with the same actors.Katnis finds herself obligated to fight in the next Hunger Games, and must go through the same routine of making the public gush over her to win favour and friends, train in high-tech, sterile quarters, and accept the impossibility of surviving the games against superior foes. The difference is that there is a rebel conspiracy among some of the contestants and Games' Chief-Producer to ensure Katniss survive.However, when finally it is revealed to Katnis that the plan had always been for her to survive, even at the cost of others, I felt not the faintest murmur of surprise. The big twist wouldn't have registered on a CAT scan. Throughout the film it is alluded to (nay, explicated) without subtlety, ambiguity, or misdirection. For example, contestants keep dying on her behalf with no hint of reason. But this itself isn't even developed into an independent pillar of the film; the main body of which is unaltered i.e. fighting, surviving, and the nominal self-sacrifice of disposable fringe characters.The other major failed attempt to distinguish this film from the first was to introduce a genuine love interest for Katniss. The first scene of the film sees Katniss saying goodbye to her beloved...I don't remember his name. His contribution is to play martyr against nasty Capitol stormtroopers, obliging Katniss to intervene to save him from summary execution. This is the last straw for the Capitol, who declare another Hunger Games – where Katniss will kill her ""allies"" and thus discredit her as a source of inspiration for the people. It was my feeling though, that the story could have got there easily enough without him. In terms of plot development he was only there to – in chess problem terms – ""dress the board."" Eventually he joins the rebellion (I think), and then isn't even referenced for the whole second half of the film.One thing it did achieve was to thicken the theme of Peeta's unrequited love for Katniss, and her increasing – genuine or not?? - affection for him. I felt there was some body to this thread, which felt like it was actually being developed throughout the film - rather than merely another aching turn of the plot-wheel. What might be interpreted as a stolid performance by Josh Hutcherson, I thought did as much as it could to convey Peeta's character (as otherwise implied by the script). Decent, dutiful, un-querulous. The CGI was dependable enough, if not ground-breaking. The Capitol was predictable grandiosity, symmetry and perpendiculars. One of the few fine moments in the film was the scene in which Katniss' twirls and in doing so burns off her innocuous frock, revealing her (unwittingly) attired to resemble a Mockingjay - the symbol of the Resistance - live on prime-time TV. For me the best bit of the film is the performance of Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, the host of the Hunger Games broadcasts. He was a welcome source of light in a film which can otherwise be summed up as dimly-lit and lugubrious. Loud, bright, strident, believably eccentric and garrulous; just a degree removed from the modern day chat show host, which lends some authenticity to the film as a meaningful commentary on the condition of society.In sum though, the resulting film is one that makes promises on which it does not deliver. Once it was over, most of me was relieved, but the remaining part was still waiting for it to start. I felt cheated. Like buying a ticket to a fairground ride which is actually just a queue for a ride (C. South Park), or dumbly watching a frozen chicken slowly turning in the oven, and then being served it long before it's ready. My advice: If you want to watch Hunger Games: Part 2, wait for Hunger Games: Part 3",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
705,LCharlier,Great reviews a mystery...,1,24 November 2013,"I am at a complete loss as to why this movie has garnered such good reviews...My wife and I saw the movie last night inside a packed theater. Upon the appearance of the credits following the movie, we overheard many fans of the first film lament how they found the sequel to be both boring and tedious. I must agree. While I was not a huge fan of the 1st film, I did find that it held my interest most of the time - despite having cringe-worthy dialogue and gaping plot holes. That said, I decided to give the sequel a chance after reading review-after-review praising the new film, most stating that the sequel was significantly better than the first. Say what?Along with my fellow movie-goers, I found the first 2/3 of the movie to be an exercise in staying awake - bad dialogue (again) and even less character development than the first movie - all adding up to ""I don't care what happens to these people!"" Only when Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman or Woody Harrelson were on screen was I able to stifle a yawn - they're just fun to watch. Too bad their screen time was minimal...The last 1/3 of the movie was far more interesting than the first 2/3 yet it seemed to be a replay (plot-wise) of the 1st movie. Curiously enough, I have watched several movies from the 1970's and 1980's with very similar plot-lines (some made-for-TV) that better held my attention and had significantly better dialogue. Perhaps if the time and money spent on over-the-top CGI and special effects was instead invested in creating a tight script with charismatic actors playing the leads, the result would be far more satisfying.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
706,knumbers,Katniss Everdeen is targeted again..,8,4 May 2015,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are two young people who are fighting to save the districts from a very corrupt government. The pair won the 74th Hunger Games and since then are thought to be the reason for rebellion in the Districts of Panem.One of the major themes a viewer can pick out from this movie is the inequality between the rich and poor. The people that have money live lavishly in the Capitol and are less likely to be chosen for the games. The poor people on the other hand live in the districts and often times starve. Children in the districts can receive more rations for their family in exchange for entering their name again as an option for being chosen in the next reaping for the games.Katniss is from District 12 where she lives with her other and younger sister. She hunts outside of the district border to provide her family with food. The theme of this movie can be compared to so many movies to there. One example that also shows the inequalities between the rich and poor would be ""The Help"". In this movie, the ""haves"" are the white people and the ""have nots"" are the African Americans. The African Americans work for the white people and have little money. They do almost exactly as they are told because they cannot afford to lose their jobs. This is kind of like the people in the districts because they have to do as they are told for fear of losing anything the Capitol decides to take from them. In ""The Help"" the African American women who worked for the white people were treated unequally and had to use separate bathrooms because the white folk did not see using the same bathroom as being clean.In ""Catching Fire"", one of the prevalent motifs that can be observed is hunting. It is recurrent throughout the movie whether Katniss is hunting for food or hunting people in order to stay alive. Another technique I recognized was the use of symbolism with the mocking jay. A mocking jay is recurrent in the film and is a symbol that represents defiance. Katniss is seen as a person acting defiantly towards the Capitol. Another use of the mocking jay was to listen in on conversations between people in the districts. In the previous movie it was used as a tool for communication between Katniss and Rue and then in ""Catching Fire"" they were used as a tool in the games to get into the ""Victors"" heads.Catching Fire is a good example of a movie with a theme that shows the inequality between sets of people. Showing the viewers what it is like to live with money, in the Capitol and without money, in the Districts.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

708,donovantull-62869,Disgrace to the books.,1,17 May 2015,"Unless you've read the books, the way this is presented is completely unhelpful, and you will have to ask about essentially everything- if you have, you will understand the disgrace this film brings upon the Hunger games. The books are classics- they will probably be one of the few books to pass on several generations. The films are worthless. They should pay us to watch it. This feels like a film with a large budget in scenery, and.... scenery. The directing? Rubbish. The acting? Laughable. Save your eyeballs, and don't watch this. So reasons this film is worthy of something far lower than 1/10 stars- 1. Incredibly difficult to follow for those who haven't read the books- and every single person who HAS ever read the books agree that the movies suck. 2. It is a disgrace to the book. 3. The way it is presented is barely possible to follow, even if you have read the books. 4. It lacks all the personality of the books- the change from text showing her thoughts to a movie, which can only show things said aloud, doesn't work. All the charm, all the inner thought- gone. Now she's just a pretty face, incapable of anything more than hitting a few targets with arrows, and utterly dependent.Please, save yourself from having to watch this horrible excuse for a film adaptation.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

710,little-38195,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,10,26 July 2015,"Film Review on IMDbThe film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire reveals a fascinating plot that intrigues the audience. A brave woman named Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, has won the previous Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen succeeded in the previous film The Hunger Games by the help of Peeta Mellark, played by Josh Hutcherson. The plot centers around a dominating government that brutalizes its citizen's, for total control. President Snow, who is played by Donald Sutherland, has complete control of the government. Mr. Snow is not happy with the districts behavior since Peeta, and Katniss botched the Hunger Games with a stunt of eating poison berries. Forcing him to allow two contestants to win. To regain total control of his country, Mr. Snow orders Katniss to make the districts believe she is in love with Peeta. Through their journey of the districts, uprising continues. In the end, a new game has to be played to restore order. Now existing Hunger Games contestants will face each other in a scramble for life with one winner. Only with the help of Haymitch Abernathy, played by Woody Harrelson, will the couple be able to outwit the game maker.The theme of the film is that kindness deeds, self-sacrifice, and the love for people, can topple harsh conditions. The characters indulge in self-sacrifice throughout the movie and is seen by the oppressed people in the districts as hope. The various players within Katniss's allies always outperform the situations they encounter because of this trait.The first example of self-sacrifice that stands out in the movie is when Gail, Katniss's old friend is being beat in the square by Commander Thread. Katniss puts herself in front of him to protect him. Haymitch and Peeta both come to aid her by convincing Commander Thread out of the brutality. All three people put their life on the line to protect Gail.An example of kindness deeds is when Finnick Odair performs CPR on Peeta after he touched the boundary electrocuting him. Finnick Odair had no benefit of having Peeta alive. In the end, it would have been another man trying to kill him. He only did it as an act of love for life.The Film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a sequel to The Hunger Games. Another movie that has the same theme closely related to this movie would be The Condemned. The movie The Condemned is closely related and shows the same type of theme as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Both films reveal harsh conditions toppled by people trying to do the right thing. The symbol of a Mockingbird reinforces the theme. In one scene, a man in the crowd likes what Katniss Everdeen says and holds his fingers up and whistles the tune of a Mockingbird. The man loses his life for this act of defiance. Later more and more crowds in the district replicate the sign and tune. The Mockingbird becomes a symbol of hope and self-sacrifice to the people. Before the games, Katniss transforms her dress into the outfit of a Mockingbird. The love for the people and her coherence to them comes to the surface.The use of internal conflict within the film strengthens the idea of the theme. Even when faced with uncertainty the allies stick together. Katniss at one point drew her arrow back at Finnick only to do the right thing and resist the urge to win. The theme proves that kindness deeds, self-sacrifice, and the love for people, can topple harsh conditions.The film has an action packed plot that keeps the viewers concentration. The theme of the film allows the viewer to take something positive from the film. Overall this is an exceptional film.ReferencesLawrence, F. (Director). (2013). The hunger games: catching fire.

711,ricardosaldivar,It was very well adapted. Can't understand why people disliked it.,10,11 October 2015,"All the actors in the movie were great, and the movie follows the book pretty well. In fact, it enhances some of the scenes in comparison to the book. There are only two major things changed from the book to the movie. One is understandable while I wish the other would have been present in the movie. I will not spoil anything, but if you've read the book, I'm referring to the Mockingjay watch. It should have been a present symbol in the movie. Some users have expressed the movie is just a lead into the next one and lacked action, but part of that is what happens when you have a trilogy. Going from book one to book three without there being some sort of justification would have dulled out the story. Also, I felt there was way more action in comparison to the first book/movie. Every single act coming from Katniss and everyone surrounding her carries more weight. There are more dangers in every place (home, capital, etc.) and consequently, much more at stake.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
712,bunnalchheang,Movie of the series that you don't want to miss out!!,7,18 November 2015,"well if you a fan of action , fighting , and romance. I can tell you that you came to the right movie.The Hunger Games:Catching Fire is all about it from the lovable scene to the emotion and exciting fighting all in one movie.This particular part of The Hunger Book series is all what you need to see,to get your attention of exciting for the up coming part.Jennifer Lawrence cast as Katniss Everdeen whom the girl that live on the district that every year they will need volunteers to tribute in their game to fight for life.well as you may herded that Katniss is so bad ass in this movie but i has to tell you Josh Hutcherson as peeta Mellark is my favorite character in the movie because of the love that he give to his beloved once is so real.As I seen the movie I can't get my mind right because of the emotion that each character give to us it's so real the way they interact are way beyond.The movie make me can't sleep due to the excitement for what next of the book series.I got to tell you that the fighting action are one of the memorable scene so far.It'll get you stood up by how it all was went down .All the feel I got hit me just like a train it's just so much word can't even describe.Man this story..I can't get enough of it.Once thing tho,I personally didn't like how the director put the hot actor as main character like some of the viewers like this for them not how they play role but i guess the director need to get some fan by that i guess to promote their movie faster due to well known of the star.I would recommend this movie for teenager that love relationship drama , action , sci-fic .The Hunger Game:Catching Fire is not the greatest movie ever but greater if i would said from the first series I like every detail that they put into the movie based on the book by not ripping off the original.I suggest y'all to watch this Movie.I'd personally rate this 7/10.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
713,kambercreech,Catching Fire,10,13 December 2015,"Catching Fire is the second part of The Hunger Game saga. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark had just won the hunger games and are back to their district and trying to live life when they are brought back to the capital to compete on a victor's tour. This tour has one female winner and one male winner from every district to come together and compete in the hunger games again to get the best of the best. The idea for the victor's tour was Donald Sutherland as President Snow's, he was not fond of Katniss. Katniss and Peeta team up with Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair and Jena Malone as Johanna Mason and Jeffrey Wright as Beetee, these people help Katniss to do greater things than just win one set of the games. These victor's and their district partners all help together to try and eliminate the other victor's still alive. The teamwork of these victors are different from the first games because the first games they were in they weren't already familiar with Snow and his plans. The victors were mad at the situation will having their lives threatened again. Their teamwork helps to get Katniss away from the districts and the capital and away from the games. When Katniss is appeared to be ""dead"" she was actually put into district 13. When the victors teamed up Katniss had been what seemed to be ""attacked"" by Johanna but she actually just took out her tracker, and right before she thought she was going to die you could see the top of the globe they were in reflecting so she took the electric wires that where wet and about to be electrocuted she tied it on her bow and arrow and shot the top of the globe making everything go dark. With the right lighting and the right angle Katniss was able to get the revolution started by getting herself, Finnick, and Beetee into district 13, but Peeta and Johanna was left for the capital to take. The theme of this movie is that even when you believe you had won if someone wants you gone winning will never be an option, having to fight and continue to win will be the only way to prove to people that you are worthy of your winnings, love and the rest of your life. Catching Fire ends and the next movie of the saga, Mockingjay is picked up in the same spot.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

The dialogue is written for (and maybe BY?!?) 12 year olds; the story is, to be kind, contrived; and the acting/direction make you feel like you're watching one of those TV shows that somehow manages to have a huge budget but also low production values. Don't waste your time. Of course, the movie will haul in a ton of money and so everyone involved in making it will receive attention and accolades, but this turkey is definitely not going home with any of the big prizes this award season, except maybe a Razzie.

They actually copied important dialog from the book down to every word (for example, Katniss and Snow).
But this is a 2 hour movie, not a 10 hour TV series like ""My Brilliant Friend"". There is simply no way to copy every detail from the book. And by taking out discontinued pieces like this, the whole adaptation lacks a soul, seems more like patching up Frankenstein. I mean, you could train a better neural network using dropout, but you can't adapt a story like this and wish the book readers to fill in the random gaps themselves.
To reduce a 10 hour worth book to a 2 hour movie, what you need is selective fast-forward, not just randomly selecting pieces.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire

718,markweinreb,Fair movie not as good as first.,5,30 November 2014,"I had not read the book when I saw the first Hunger Games movie about 2 weeks ago. I enjoyed it, thought that the acting was generally good and creative how Katniss is able to outwit President Snow and come out with both Peeta and her as winners. So now that the third one is out (and I really don't why they have to make two movies out of it, except to double the profits like Twilight and Harry Potter did) I was anxious to see the Catching Fire, so I bought the DVD twin set at a black Friday discounted rate. So after watching ""Catching Fire"" a few items come to mind.1. Very difficult to understand the 2nd one without watching the first one, including understanding all the nuances of the interaction between katniss, president Snow,Gale and Peeta.2. Best Actor -both Moves- by far Donald Sutherland- such a joy to see him acting. He is such an underrated actor for our lifetime from his movie MASH, to Animal House to this movie.3. Other reason to watch this movie- One of the last performances of actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I really wish there were more of him in the movie-especially with interaction with Katniss such as at the beginning of the movie.4. Over the top acting of Stanley Tucci, as in last one.5. Always like Jeffrey Wright- Spoiler alert-would have been a shame if he died-glad that he didn't -just like he doesn't die as Felix Lighter in the James Bond franchiseThat being said, most of the rest is average and the ending is just unbelievable and difficult to understand.",The Hunger Games - Catching Fire
