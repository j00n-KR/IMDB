0,Leofwine_draca,Very lame,4,26 November 2017,"BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is the misfiring film version of the popular TV series, made a few years before it debuted. This one has some good ideas but a generally poor execution which makes it feel dated in that really cheesy 1990s way. A little of the humour is funny but the rest is purely a waste of time, unless you want to cringe with embarrassment upon seeing Rutger Hauer float to the floor on a wire.The film is very much a typical high school comedy loaded with supposedly witty dialogue with the addition of a few vampires, chief of whom is the annoying Paul Reubens. Luke Perry plays the edgy love interest, Donald Sutherland is wasted as Buffy's mentor, and Kristy Swanson doesn't make much progress other than being fit and athletic. It's interesting to see Hilary Swank playing feminine and against type early on in her career, and even Ben Affleck has a cameo. A shame, then, that the vampires are so silly and ineffectual, that most of the comedy is so obvious, and that the running time feels at least twice as long as it really is due to the dragged-out nature of the plot.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
1,SnoopyStyle,Good campy fun if you don't take it seriously,6,9 February 2014,"Buffy (Kristy Swanson) is the quintessential valley girl cheerleader. She and her friends are all clueless. She is approached by Merrick (Donald Sutherland) and told that she is the Slayer. There are vampires in the world, and there is a slayer who fights them. When one slayer falls, another one takes her place. It is Buffy's turn to be the Slayer. She is joined by a slacker outcast Pike (Luke Perry) in a fight against the powerful Lothos (Rutger Hauer).This is most notable for who wrote the script, Joss Whedon. Although he definitely has disowned this with all the changes to his script. It has a funny co-starring role from Paul Reubens. The style is lacking. Kristy Swanson has the looks but not quite the attitude of the valley girl exactly. She always seems a bit too bright and too serious for the clueless role. It is definitely a very light sarcastic take on the vampire movie.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
2,kosmasp,"If you really want to know about Buffys ""Origin"", read the Comics!",1,7 June 2006,"I want to start with my review, by saying that I don't like to exaggerate, so I won't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen (I've seen worse), but nonetheless it was a complete waste of time. But let's go step by step.I heard that this movie symbols the beginning of Buffy, so it would be her back-story to the series. Since the script had been changed many times, you can't really say that anymore. Sometimes it seems that there a few hidden gems in this movie, that foreshadow the future Buffy in the series and the humor in it. But it's not hardly enough to enjoy.Away from the muddled script onto the actors. Now that should be something good ... for the movie that is. But it's not. Although you have some good actors (even some ""heavyweights""), none of them nearly come to a career best. It doesn't even have the charm of a ""B-Movie"". Watching this makes you realize what great Job Joss Whedon apparently is doing on the show. SO don't be blinded by a the cast (David Arquette, Sutherland, R. Hauer, Hillary Swank ...) Speaking of actors in bad ""shape"", this movie houses one of the baddest deaths ever put on celluloid. I'm even going to call it (remember my first sentence, because I don't use that term lightly) the worst on-screen death EVER on celluloid (that I have seen and I have seen many, believe you me). It's supposed to be funny, but it's anything but.Even my (14-year old) niece was shaking her head. Why we watched it anyway to the ending? First there is my rule that I watch every movie to the ending, but secondly there was also the curiosity to see if at the end of the movie we would see something ""big"" (it's spoiled in the show/series) ... but that never happened, because the script got re-written and this much anticipated scene got cut ...My summary is: If you really want to know more about Buffy's history, than buy the comic/graphic novel ""Buffy: The Origin"". It's more accurately to the script that Joss Whedon wrote!! :o)",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
3,gavin6942,"The Show is Better, But This Is Still a Treat",7,15 February 2011,"Let me just list the cast here for you: Kristy Swanson in her best role, Donald Sutherland, Paul Reubens, Rutger Hauer, Luke Perry, Hilary Swank in her debut role as a crimped-hair Valley girl, David Arquette, Stephen Root, Thomas Jane, Ben Affleck in a very early role, Seth Green and Ricki Lake.Now, do I still need to convince you? The show is better, of course, with its blend of humor and serious plots (more serious as it went on), but this film really captures the early 1990s in all its glory, and Swanson before her downfall. Some have said this film opened the door for ""Clueless""... I think that is entirely possible.Catch this if for no other reason than to see Donald Sutherland as a great slayer trainer and Pee-Wee Herman as a weird vampire. Those two performances alone make the film. Oh, and Rutger Hauer is interesting, too... very refined.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
4,lee_eisenberg,totally STUPID,2,22 May 2008,"Looking for a real representation of 1990s air-head valley girl culture? Look no further than ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Whereas ""Clueless"" constituted something really clever, this one is just plain pathetic. Buffy (Kristy Swanson) spends as much time as possible at the mall and remains totally unaware of the rest of the world. Yes, I know, the comedy involves the fact that this mildly sarcastic SoCal teenage girl has to battle vampires. Maybe there is some humor in that. But as far as I'm concerned, looking at the overall idea behind this movie, Sam Raimi's ""Army of Darkness"" was much cooler. This is one that you watch for a completely hedonistic, silly space-out. Otherwise, it was a real step down for Donald Sutherland (especially since he had appeared in Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" just the previous year).Also starring Luke Perry, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman), Rutger Hauer, Hilary Swank, Stephen Root, and Ben Affleck in a small role.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
5,jboothmillard,Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5,21 September 2009,"Four years before the successful TV show with Sarah Michelle Gellar, writer Joss Whedon penned this cult movie that would inspire it. Basically at Hemery High School in Los Angeles, teenage air-head high school senior and cheerleader Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson), her main concerns in life are shopping, her rich, snooty friends, and her boyfriend Jeffrey (Randall Batinkoff). Then one day she is approached by an old man calling himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland) who tells her she is Slayer, or the Chosen One, destined to hunt for and kill vampires, and he is the Watcher whose duty is to guide and train her. She is unconvinced, until he describes a recurring dream she has been having in detail, then she finds herself exhibiting uncanny abilities, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance. After several successful outings to kill vampires, Buffy is drawn into conflict with local vampire king Lothos (Rutger Hauer) and his acolyte Amilyn (Paul Reubens). Oliver Pike (Luke Perry) and Benny (David Arquette) are out drinking, and are attacked by the vampires, Benny is turned, but Pike is saved by Merrick. Amilyn also abducts Buffy's classmate Cassandra (Natasha Gregson Wagner), her body is eventually found and news spreads around town. Pike tries to escape the terror, but encounters Amilyn and his gang of vampires, Amilyn loses an arm when jumping on his van, Buffy and Merrick rescue Pike, he and Buffy eventually become romantic, and he joins her in fighting the undead. During a basketball game, Buffy discovers that one of the players is a vampire, she chases after him, then confronts Lothos, who puts her into a trance. Merrick breaks the trance, but Lothos stabs the old man with his own stake, Lothos escapes, before dying, Merrick tells her to do things her own way, and gives her the clue ""Remember about the music"". But Buffy is heartbroken losing her Watcher, and feels unready with the responsibilities, she starts neglecting her Slayer duties, and her friends are more concerned with preparing with the upcoming school dance. At the senior dance, Buffy fails to patch things up with her friends, and she is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for another girl. Lothos sends his remaining minions to the school to attack the humans at the dance, Buffy confronts them, while Pike fights vampires in the gym, and kills vampire Benny. After overpowering many vampires, and killing Amilyn, the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and defends herself. The vampire king is unimpressed when she tries to repel him with a cross, he sets it alight, so she creates a makeshift flamethrower, using the fire and her hairspray to burn him, she escapes to the gym. Buffy finds her classmates recovering from the vampire attack, Lothos bursts in and says he will split Buffy in half like a piece of rotten fruit, in the end Buffy is able to defeat and stake Lothos, killing him. As the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance, and they leave together on a motorcycle. Also starring Hilary Swank as Kimberly Hannah, Michele Abrams as Jennifer, Paris Vaughan as Nicole 'Nicki', Thomas Jane as Zeph, Candy Clark as Buffy's Mom, James Paradise as Buffy's Dad, Liz Smith as Herself - Reporter, Stephen Root as Gary Murray, Ben Affleck as Basketball Player #10, Alexis Arquette (then Robert) as Vampire DJ, Seth Green as Vampire, Ricki Lake as Charlotte and Slash as DJ. Swanson is good at being dim-witted and slowly becoming confident, Sutherland is suitably cast as the wise old mentor, Hauer is reasonable as the main villain, Reubens is almost unrecognisable as his nasty sidekick, Swank is mostly seen being daft, and Affleck's cameo is amusing. Fans of the darker and more action-packed TV show will probably be disappointed by this movie, but there is just enough dark humour, okay special effects and deliberately knowing stupidity that it is kind of fun, not a bad comedy horror. Worth watching!",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
6,Tweekums,Buffy - The Movie,7,2 November 2016,"Buffy Summers thinks of herself as an ordinary student at a Los Angeles high school; her only priorities are cheerleading and shopping with her friends although she does have strange dreams in which she is other girls who are fighting vampires! Then one day a strange man, introducing himself as Merrick, tells Buffy that she the Chosen One The Vampire Slayer. He takes her to the graveyard where she faces and kills her first vampires. Soon afterwards she rescues Pike, an outsider at her school and they become friends as he is the only other person who knows about the vampires. As she starts to take her vampire slaying responsibilities more seriously she drifts away from her vacuous friends. Merrick warns her that there is one vampire, Lothos, who she must be wary of; he has killed many slayers over the years and won't be easy to defeat. Inevitably the two must eventually face each other at the school's senior dance.It is hard not to compare this film with the superior television series that is set after the events of the film however I will try. This film is lightweight fun; Kristy Swanson does a solid job as Buffy; her character develops nicely from a self-centred valley girl to somebody willing to risk herself for others. Donald Sutherland is impressive as Merrick because he plays his role dead-straight; the film may be fairly light but he appears to be taking his role seriously. Luke Perry is okay as love interest Pike; it was fun to see a boy taking the 'damsel in distress' role while Buffy saves the day. On the down side the special effects are almost non-existent; dead vampires don't turn to dust or burst into flames; they just lie down with a stake in their chests and the vampire makeup looks like something that one might wear for Halloween rather than that seen in a Hollywood film. The comedy elements are a bit mixed; Buffy's talk with the principal where he ends up talking about doing LSD in the sixties was priceless but the scene where vampire Amilyn has an extended death scene was just too silly for my taste. Overall I'd say this was a fun introduction to the world of Buffy The Vampire Slayer; just don't expect the same quality as the cult TV series.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
7,BA_Harrison,Big-screen Buffy.,5,1 October 2017,"Kristy Swanson stars as Buffy, a carefree high school cheerleader leading the valley girl lifestyle who must put down her pom-poms and pick up a stake in order to fulfil her birthright as a slayer of the undead.Buffy The Vampire Slayer was a hugely popular TV show in the '90s, but this earlier big-screen bash at bringing Buffy to life is nowhere near as slick or as satisfying as the series.Part of the problem was apparently due to the fact that Joss Whedon's original script was re-written against his wishes, rendering certain scenes incomprehensible, but much of the blame must go to director Fran Rubel Kuzui, whose dull direction makes the film rather bland when it should be a whole lot of fun. The comedy falls flat, the fight scenes are limp and there is very little in the way of blood, despite quite a few stakings. Furthermore, the whole production suffers from an air of cheapness and a lack of style (most notably, the vamps just fall over when killed, rather than disintegrating).While Swanson is no match for her TV counterpart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, I didn't think that she was all that terrible: she convinces as an airhead, and looks great in her Lycra bra-top and leggings. She is certainly no worse than Donald Sutherland as her mentor Merrick, and Rutger Hauer as head vamp Lothos, both of whom are capable of much better.Perhaps the most fun that can be had with the film is in spotting the familiar faces amongst the supporting cast: David Arquette (Scream) hams it up as slacker turned bloodsucker Benny, future Oscar winner Hilary Swank plays vacuous high schooler Kimberly, Paul 'Pee Wee Herman' Reubens is Lothos' right-hand vamp Amilyn, and both Ben Affleck and Ricki Lake have blink and you'll miss them cameos.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
8,moonspinner55,Dreadful comic-book tosh...,3,13 January 2008,"Tedious horror-comedy, intentionally silly though unfunny, has vacuous Valley girl Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) realizing her destiny as a modern-day Van Helsing, taking on an army of vampires. Mixture of high school nonsense and bloodsucking satire never really comes off, especially with such weak talent involved; the jokes are as shallow as the players! It aspires to be a cross-pollination of ""The Lost Boys"" and ""Heathers"", but with dialogue like, ""Does the word 'duh' mean anything to you?"", the movie is more embarrassing than amusing. Swanson works hard with the dumb material she's given, Donald Sutherland does an amiable walk-through as her teacher. Idea later revamped into the cult TV series. *1/2 from ****",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
9,Quinoa1984,"not funny, not campy, not dramatic: a blight on proper storytelling",3,23 November 2009,"I sort of remember going to see this as a kid in the theater. Sort of, mind you, since I barely remember anything about the actual movie from that time. It was, even for an impressionable youth, who by the by was a big Pee-Wee fan, forgettable. As an adult seeing it again- now with almost all of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series seen and digested- it comes off more like a pit of empty horrors. Its director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, takes a screenplay written by Joss Whedon and seems to keep at least some of the words, some hints and impressions of potential, the origin story of the ""Valley Girl"" who is the chosen one to slay any and all vampires in sight. But, and here's the big but, the interpretation guts out all of the true wit and clever characters and deft lines made between satire and horror and drama, and leaves it for a kind of post-mortem state. It's wrong in so many ways, and it can't even muster up the gusto to be campy.Part of it is miscasting, perhaps: Kristy Swanson isn't the worst actress on the planet, but she just can't latch on to the dialog and make it breath with the life it needs. You see her and want to play casting director: ""Ok, thank you, very good, next!"" The same can be said of Donald Sutherland, which is surprising since a ""Watcher"" (as described better on the show as the trainer-mentor-researcher of the vampire slayers) seems like something Sutherland could really sink his teeth into - a good actor playing it up as he did in something like Kelly's Heroes. Not the case. He sleepwalks through most of this role, playing creepy-old-man reasonably well and nothing else. That he's also got such a tremendously awful death scene that it's the worst death scene possible: he doesn't look, act, or talk dead. I can almost imagine a half-awake Sutherland asking, pleading, with Kuzui for him to have something to do, and her response being a ""... eh, whatever."" And it's not just that Kuzui has a general disrespect for the original material (Whedon reportedly left the set due to his disgust with the way the film was being made), but just how lamely she directs her cast. This is the prime example to show in a film school of how to direct (at least) decent material poorly. The cast mostly tries to play for laughs, but there's no sense of good comic timing. The drama is so bloodless (pun intended) that you wonder where the talent on the SyFy network was during all of this. The horror and action are a joke; perhaps this is comparing to the show much, but even in a so-called 'stupid' valley-girl-vampire comedy, you need someone who can actually choreograph action. And the storytelling itself is weak; the pacing is at best formulaic and at worst the kind of sloppy handling that is just felt. And as romantic comedy... Luke Perry (?) The best you can do is Luke Perry?! Compared to the rest of the slog (one which, by the way oddly enough, was Whedon's first big exposure - via Fox studios, who would go on in further years to screw with the man), only one really comes out unscathed. Rutger Hauer as the big baddie, vampire master Lothos, seems to be in his own realm even among good actors giving bad performances like Reubens or those not doing much acting at all like Swanson or Arquette. Hell, it's invigorating to see him at least try something different; as the only one having fun with his role, however subtly (or not, like with the grab for the kittie), he even does a little to make the climactic battle interesting. But one bad-ass actor, who probably said 'shove it' to Kuzu's non-directing, isn't enough to save this.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is turgid, and for those who find the Slayer TV show to include some of the greatest artistic achievements in its medium, it's akin to suddenly seeing your lovely wife a raggedy crackhead. One part still sees something there, but the rest of it screams JUST SAY NO!",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
10,wes-connors,Buffy Brings Home the Stake,6,11 December 2010,"""Blonde, bouncy Buffy (Kristy Swanson) is your typical high school cheerleader - her goal is to 'marry Christian Slater and die' and nothing gets in her way when it's time to shop. But all that changes when a strange man (Donald Sutherland) informs her she's been chosen by fate to kill vampires. With the help of a romantic rebel (Luke Perry), Buffy is soon spending school nights protecting L.A. from Lothos, the Vampire King (Rutger Hauer), his sidekick. Lefty (Paul Reubens), and their determined gang of bloodsuckers. It's everything you'd expect from a teen queen in the Valley,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.It's difficult to believe this horror spoof started Joss Whedon's great Vampire franchise. Of course, the ""Buffy"" series and its ""Angel"" spin-off are infinitely better. Now, it's fairly obvious that, despite some funny moments, the situation doesn't support the broadness they give this material, here, overall; the foundational story took on new life with a more serious tone. But, while this film is currently held in low regard when compared to its offspring, there are kernels of imagination to be found. It's also fun to Ricki Lake waiting tables, Ben Affleck (#10) on the basketball court, and confirm Hilary Swank had those lips from the start.****** Buffy the Vampire Slayer (7/31/92) Fran Rubel Kuzui ~ Kristy Swanson, Luke Perry, Donald Sutherland, Paul Reubens",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

The production values are also poor . I don`t know if there`s any prophetic irony involved ( Probably not )  but BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER comes across as being more like a TVM than a cinematic release , gawd it probably cost less to make this film than an episode of the show does .

13,Doylenf,Buffy fights the forces of evil...high camp horror fright flick...,5,3 June 2007,"BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is cotton candy for teeny minds...or at least teen-age minds looking for cheap thrills.It's got a sassy combination of horror (those vampires can get real nasty when provoked) and laughs, like what Luke Perry says after Buffy saves his butt: ""I mean, like, do you do this all the time?""KRISTY SWANSON is an attractive bimbo-type blonde who plays her role with tongue-in-cheek humor and manages to look athletic while throwing a punch or riding a motorcycle or doing whatever it takes to combat vampires. Luke PERRY has lots of smart one-line remarks that look as though they come easily to him, as he shrugs his shoulders a lot when delivering them in little effort to look cute. But DONALD SUTHERLAND fails to make the most of his role as Merrick, the man who tells Buffy she's ""the chosen one"". He looks bored stiff most of the time.More in keeping with the breezy tone of the film are RUTGER HAUER as the debonair vampire chief and PAUL REUBENS (Pee Wee Herman) as a wild-eyed, red-lipped vampire who takes a lot of time to die even with a stake through his heart.Somewhere in the background among Kristy Swanson's school chums is HILLARY SWANK, as one of the more vacuous of her girlfriends. She makes an impression as an obnoxious Valley Girl that gets her comeuppance.Summing up: Foolish fun has enough silly scares and bright teen dialog to please most teens and even some adults.

14,preppy-3,Totally sucks!!! (No pun intended),1,26 September 2001,"Abysmal ""comedy"" about a high school airhead learning she has a legacy to kill vampires. Donald Sutherland plays her mentor.Decent idea horribly handled. The film was heavily edited before it came out (it's only 82 minutes) because the studio realized what a bomb that had. It didn't help. Kristy Swanson is pretty good as Buffy, but Rutger Hauer is terrible as the lead vampire...he's a good actor but no comedian. Luke Perry proves he can't do comedy and Donald Sutherland phones in his performance. The script is unfunny and plodding. A total waste. This piece of crap would be totally forgotten if it didn't give us such a great TV series. Watch the series--it does everything right that the movie did wrong.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
15,poolandrews,"""You ruined my new jacket, kill him a lot"" Awful teen horror comedy.",2,15 May 2005,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer starts with an on screen caption that informs us that it's 'Europe, the Dark Ages' accompanied by a narration that says 'since the dawn of man the Vampires have walked among us killing & feeding. The only one with the strength or skill to stop their heinous evil is the slayer, she who bears the birthmark, the mark of the coven. Trained by the watcher, one slayer dies & the next is chosen...' The film then switches to 'Southern California, the Lite Ages', & no the jokes in Buffy the Vampire Slayer sadly don't get any better. Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is at first glance a normal, shallow, air-headed, teenage high school cheerleader, but one day she is approached by the mysterious Merrick Jamison-Smythe (Donald Sutherland). Merrick tries to convince Buffy that she is in fact 'the chosen one', someone who has a special ability to slay Vampires. At first Buffy doesn't believe him but soon changes her mind when he introduces her to some real Vampires in a graveyard. Merrick trains Buffy & teaches her special techniques with which to help her slay Vampires. Meanwhile the ancient evil Vampire king Lothos (Rutger Hauer) with the help of his side-kick Amilyn (Paul Reubens) is spreading Vampirism & turning half of California into Vampires. Buffy, together with a guy named Oliver Pike (Luke Perry) whose friend Benny (David Arquette) was turned into a Vampire, sets out to destroy Lothos & the plague of Vampirism that is taking over California.Executive produced & directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui I personally thought Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a feeble attempt at a comedy horror that misses the mark by a mile on both counts. The script by Joss Whedon just isn't funny in the slightest, on not one single occasion did I even smile let alone laugh. The most sophisticated joke you can expect in Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the schools principle Gary Murray (Stephen Root) threatening a bunch of Vampires with detention slips, hilarious. The horror elements are really watered down & don't impress, there is no blood drinking at all in Buffy the Vampire Slayer & considering it's supposed to be a Vampire film I think that's just all wrong. I never felt as though anyone was in danger or under threat, what was the purpose of Lothos turning annoying teenagers into Vampires anyway? The Vampires in this are far too easily killed & are some of the most pathetic on screen Vampires I've seen. There is no blood or gore at all & there's only three or four fight sequences in it. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is about as bland & unimaginative in the way it's filmed as it could be. Director Kuzui fails to eject any pace or energy into an already dull film. The acting is pretty bad throughout, Kristy Swanson is awful & I personally don't find her particularly attractive (where's Sarah Michelle Gellar when you need her, eh?!). Her transformation from teen bimbo into an invincible Vampire killing machine is about as convincing as a flabby overweight Rutger Hauer passing himself off as being the king of the Vampires. Pretty much everyone else is terrible as well, but at least Donald Sutherland had the good sense to be killed off two thirds into the film & well before the embarrassingly bad climax. Oh, & stick around during the end credits as the film continues with a terrible running gag about a dying Vampire. Overall I thought Buffy the Vampire Slayer wasted 80 odd minutes of my life without good reason, a real lame brain teen comedy horror that fails miserably in just about everything it presumably set out to achieve. Definitely one to avoid, watch the subsequent TV series (1997 - 2003) instead with the delicious Sarah Michelle Gellar who is a bit of alright, if you know what I mean...",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

The first was basically a bore, and this was not much better.The most interesting feature of the film was the snapshot of totally vacuous girls in the high school. They were consumed with their own pleasures and had no clue how the outside worked. It was interesting to see Buffy transformed slowly into someone who was focused on something besides herself.Unfortunately, that was about all there was as the fighting with vampires was totally unrealistic and suited more to some teen movie than a true horror film.All in all, it was a bore except for seeing Donald Sutherland.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
17,Boba_Fett1138,Very poorly put together movie.,3,5 August 2006,"This movie is a very poorly put together one. It has a disjointed story, a weak non-present plot and some not engaging enough characters. This movie is a failed attempt to mix teenage-comedy with horror elements.Awful dialog, awful make-up effects, awful music (and I thought only '80's music had horrendous irritating music.) and weak acting. This movie is a failed one on many accounts. Everything about it is very simple and makes a weak impression. But really the biggest problem with the movie is its story. It's still not clear to me what the main plot line and purpose of this movie was. It's a movie that goes nowhere with its story and it makes this movie a rather pointless one to watch. It's still not clear to me who the main villain Lothos exactly was, what he wanted and why.The movie is very poorly put together and its basically like the one event after the other without feeling an obvious connection. The way some sequences follow the other just doesn't make sense. It makes the movie a very disjointed and weak one that is also heavily flawed in its simple editing. It makes the story seem even more simple and pointless than it already was. Some of the events and sequences are so bad and simple that they even become laughable.Basically the movie is a failed attempt to mix teenage-comedy with horror. The movie is mainly an horror one but made in comedy style. Only problem is that the comedy style doesn't work out at all in the movie. The movie just isn't a funny one, which is mainly due to its poor dialog and weak characters. The movie isn't even fun in a campy sort of way.The movie has some great actors but the acting is weak. Kristy Swanson just isn't likable enough as the main character (who even is Kristy Swanson?) and the same goes for Luke Perry. Donald Sutherland is also in it in a sort of Van Helsing role but his screen time is not long enough to leave a big or impressive mark on the movie. Rutger Hauer as the main vampire villain sounds like a good thing but he is surprisingly disappointing in this movie. He tries to play his character with class but he just isn't scary or good enough in his role. It's a pretty shallow performance of him and it perhaps even feels like he is holding back. The supporting cast is way more impressive with some early roles from Hilary Swank and David Arquette and bit parts for Ben Affleck and Ricki Lake.A really failed, disjointed movie that is weak on basically every account.

19,AlsExGal,Campy movie shows the origins of Buffy,6,5 February 2010,"I first saw this movie back in 1992 when it was first released, and I thought it was good campy fun, nothing more. When I began watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series, and saw Joss Whedon's true vision for the story, I realize he must have been furious at how the studio basically rewrote his script. If you are a Buffy fan and you have never seen the movie, it is worthwhile from a historical standpoint to see all of the contrasts.The movie's Buffy, played by Kristy Swanson, is a tall large girl as opposed to Sarah Michelle Gellar's petite Buffy. In the movie, Buffy's mother is a boozing socialite with little time or patience for Buffy and their family appears affluent, as opposed to TV's all-American middle-class mom Joyce. Also in the movie, all victims of vampires become vampires themselves and when vampires are ""staked"" they do not turn to dust as they do in the series, but leave behind a pesky corpse. Of course, the watcher who first tells Buffy of her calling is not the Giles of the series, but regardless of that, he does not have any of the characteristics of a watcher as we have come to know them on the series. Also, the lead vampire, played by Rutger Hauer, is not the least bit scary. Instead he is more like a villain out of the equally campy Batman TV series.There is also no mention of vampires lacking a soul. There are a few moments in the movie, though, that have at least the ring of Whedon's brand of humor. What comes to my mind in that category is after Buffy has staked a large number of teen vampires that have invaded her high school dance, the principal is going around putting detention slips on all of the staked teen vampires' corpses as punishment for disrupting the event. This seems very much like something principal Snyder of Sunnydale high school would have done.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

I have never seen a full episode of the TV series, and never will, but I went to see this at the cinema as a child because it was near Halloween and it was about vampires.The fact of the matter is, the film is boring, and only Swanson and Perry look interested in being in the movie.Sutherland pops up every now and again, looking like a poor mans Father \Merrin, and as for Rutger Hauer, he looks ashamed.Yes, Swank, Affleck, and Arquette are in the movie, but they have hardly anything to do.Swanson is the saving grace though.

22,Aaron1375,The title suggests the movie should have been a lot more funny.,4,12 May 2009,"With a name like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" I was expecting a fairly good comedy/horror hybrid with the emphasis being on the comedy. However, that is not the case as there is more drama in this movie than horror or comedy for my tastes as this movie takes itself way to seriously in areas. Which is sad as there are moments in the film where it is what you think it should be a funny comedy type movie, the demise of Paul Reubens character for example. The cast is rather good too as you have veterans Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer and some up and comers of the day in it the film. There is no reason this film should have been the downer for the most part that it is. Despite its rather weak showing at theaters and such it would spawn a television series five years after its release that would go on to quite frankly be more popular than this movie ever was, despite the fact it had the same problem of being a show with Buffy and slayer in the title and it just is not as funny as it should have been. I am not saying this movie should have been a spoof along the lines of ""Airplane"" I am thinking along the lines of ""Shaun of the Dead"" perhaps. That was a movie that was not entirely a spoof, but was able to remain funny throughout with the occasional shot of drama. This is more drama with the occasional shot of comedy and it just does not work.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
23,The_Void,Great campy horror fun!,7,15 May 2005,"Just about everyone in the world has at least heard of the less-than-brilliant American TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but far better and far more less known is this movie version of the popular US comic book. While the film is a long way away from being brilliant, it benefits from a lot of things, but most notably the way it fuses two of the eighties favourite sub-genres; teen comedy and campy vampire flick. Even though it was made in the nineties, this looks, feels and even smells like eighties fodder; and that is very much in it's favour if you ask this reviewer. The film isn't quite long enough to effectively pin down many elements from both types of movie, but it uses it's eighty minute running time well enough to give a decent example of a movie that treads the line between them, and there's just something so right about a hot blonde in a white dress and leather jacket holding a wooden spike and battling legions of the undead. It's the over the top campness that is this movie's main good point, by far.It's Sarah Michelle Gellar that will always be known for the 'Buffy' character, but if you ask me Kristy Swanson deserves more praise than her more-seen counterpart. While her character may develop a little too quickly for her to adequately portray her, Swanson lights up every scene she's in and seeing her booting people in the face and ramming wooden spikes through their chests is always a pleasant experience. The film has a fine array of actors in support to the lead, which includes the likes of Donald Sutherland (in fine form!), Luke Perry, Rutger Hauer, Hilary Swank and David Arquette among others. The story behind Buffy, which tells of a 'slayer'; a person selected in every generation to slay vampires, allows the film to have a lot of fun with the classic vampire tale and this always ensures that the film remains fresh and interesting despite the vampire genre being overpopulated. I may be rating this movie a little too high, but I've somehow managed to catch it several times and at the end of each watch, I've always seen a film that I've enjoyed. Plus I really like silly horror movies.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
24,Mr-Fusion,"""Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.""",7,24 September 2013,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a movie that was made for the teen mallrat crowd. It's light, fluffy and makes very little demands of its audience. But it works for me, and mostly because of the cast. Rutger Hauer, Paul Reubens (who has one of my favorite movie death scenes), Donald Sutherland and even Luke Perry seem to fit like just-right puzzle pieces, while Stephen Root easily steals all of his scenes. Much of this movie's charm lies in its lead. Kristy Swanson has the valley girl teen down to a T. She's game for the role's physicality and brings a likability to her vapid one-liners. Smoking hot, too, let's not forget that.I didn't expect much going into this; it's a very '90s movie (not my thing) right down to its soundtrack. But I did like the vapidity of its sense of humor, very much dig the star, and it made for a good time. Certainly laughed more than I'd expected to, and it never took itself too seriously. It also helps that it's more accessible to me than the TV series. 7/10",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,And thus started the series,8,15 January 2004,"Ah, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", my favorite TV show of all time. You know, it's weird how came across it. I've always loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Movie, and I just thought they were going to play the movie on TV, but when it was a TV show, I was shocked. But I was hooked.Onto the movie. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is about a dumb blonde bimbo who lives with her rich but neglectful parents in sunny L.A. and is the most popular girl in school with her snobby friends and basketball star boyfriend. But all that changes when Buffy finds out that she is the ""chosen one"" who is destined to kill the vampires. Donald Sutherland plays Merrick, her watcher and trainer who is always in a trench coat and hat. When Buffy finally excepts her fate, she starts to loose it all, her friends, her cheer leading activities, her boyfriend, and life in general. She is also risking her life every single night and can't tell anyone about her being a slayer because it might endanger their lives. But there is one man, Luke Perry, or as we know him to be Pike. He is just your typical stoner teen, but when he meets Buffy and his best friend is turned into a vampire, everything changes. He, Merrick, and Buffy team together to fight the forces of darkness and one armless Pee Wee Herman.This is just a fun movie. No, it's Oscar material, but it's just a good movie to watch for a good laugh. You have to admit the death of Pee Wee's character was just too hilarious. The acting, come on! It's a teen flick, and we've got a very young Hilary Swank. We all have to start somewhere. Just have fun, and watch the series too! 8/10",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Like many other films that try to be both horror flicks AND comedies (for example, the 1992 ""Innocent Blood""), it doesn't  achieve the right balance and comes off as half-hearted in the horror department and not totally satisfying as a comedy, either. It also has s curious TV-movie feel and a too-quick, too-easy ending. But Kristy Swanson has the flexibility that her role calls for, and the movie is so short that you're not likely to get bored.      (**)P.S.

27,lost-in-limbo,Somewhat late... to the party.,6,15 April 2020,"As a pre-teen I grew up watching the TV series of ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"". I would watch the show religiously and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy would've been my first celebrity crush. However the movie that inspired the TV show passed me by. Never did I really thought about it, nor went out of my way to seek it out. Watching it for the first time, the tone was a lot different than I expected, even though this was penned by Joss Whedon. If I saw it back then, when the TV show was popular. Talk about a shock to the system. This film went for brightly broad comic eccentricity in what felt as if I was watching a less effective ""CLUELESS"" (which came out a couple years later) with vampires. Honestly I enjoyed the high school moments more so than the fangless slaying, but it's definitely a product of the times (early 90s with out-of-the-blue dialogue of marrying Christian Slater).While the bubblegum story is of no great shakes and can aimlessly move from one plot thread/or better put comedy set-up to another, it was the cast that won me over. Kristy Swanson really does carry it as the chosen slayer, bringing a bubbly energy that can suddenly hit a deadpan remark, but also the demanding physicality in kicking some butt. Her combination with a lurking, mock seriousness Donald Sutherland delivered dross interactions. So when Sutherland exits after the halfway point, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Now the villains of the piece, under very little make-up, pointy ears and fangs are less than menacing. In the vampire king role is a lounging Rutger Hauser looking casual, where he doesn't get up to much until the film's cartoonish final climatic battle. There he hams it up. His right-hand vampire is played by Paul Reubens, who feels rather subdued, yet how he goes out (a risibly prolonged stake to the heart death) gives you glimpses of what was kept in checked. Not the case for David Arquette. Luke Perry (and his hair) shows up, as the rebel and romance interest in a likeable performance. Everything is played for laughs at everyone's expense, sometimes falling flat therefore there was no real punch, but still it breezes by on Swanson's performance.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
28,bowmanblue,The prequel. Basically,5,6 June 2017,"Ah, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' – the seminal TV show of the nineties which launched Kirsty Swanson as a household name. Well, maybe in a parallel universe. Before Sarah Michelle Gellar started saving the world (a lot) and falling in love with almost every good-looking undead stud in Sunnydale, they actually tried the format on the big screen. This version never really took off and has kind of been lost among the annals of cinematic history, only being revived as a strange beast of interest that (TV) Buffy fans like to watch, simply in order to compare this weird 'alternate take' on their icons to what the 'real' thing turned out like. And I have to confess that that's why I watched it. I was never a mega-fan of the nineties TV series, but I've grown to watch it through my daughter and was kind of curious what the filmic incarnation of Buffy was like. If it was up to my daughter she'd probably end the review here as she could barely sit through the whole film! However, I thought it was an interesting little 'compendium piece' if nothing else.Yes, it doesn't have quite such a memorable cast list as the TV show and the dialogue isn't half as snappy (and the vamps don't 'dust' when killed, probably due to budget reasons!), yet it still maintains a strange sort of charm. Whereas in the TV show it is definitely Sarah Michelle Geller's show, here it's the older, more established actors who are a more memorable, for our non-Geller Buffy mast face off against B-movie veteran of the eighties Rutger Hauer, while being taught her slaying skills by 'watcher' Donald Sutherland.I guess the filmic incarnation of Buffy is even harder to 'sell' now in retrospect than it was at the time. When it first came out it didn't have huge names, big effects or anyone that would draw in the masses. And, let's face it the title of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' does sound a little cheesy. I know the film (and TV show) doesn't always take itself too seriously and a healthy dose of cheese is required during watching at all times. I just could imagine the audience's reaction to seeing a film entitled this. It seems to be too old for youngsters and yet to 'teen-ish' for adults, therefore didn't really draw in a wide and varied audience.As with the TV show, we meet our titular 'slayer' Buffy, who's a teenager who just so happens to be this generation's 'chosen one,' tasked with wiping vampires out from the face of the Earth (or rather just her hometown to start with!). Once you've invested your time in the TV show, it's hard to watch the film without trying to relate it back to the ongoing series. I see this as a kind of 'prequel' as it deals with Buffy learning of her heritage and being taught the ways of the Force (or slaying vamps – whatever). And, for that, it does almost work when looked at in conjunction with the TV show. Yes, there are always going to be some continuity errors that don't really match up, but, seeing as the two mediums don't occupy the same 'shared universe,' this can only be expected.It's hard to recommend the film really, as fans of the genre will undoubtedly be so into the TV show that they refuse to except this as part of the lore. However, if you're someone who can appreciate the 'evolution' of the character and wants to take a sneak peek into an alternate universe where Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't reign supreme, give this one a go. Yes, it's daft and yes, it's cheesy, but wasn't the TV show all that, too? This isn't a film for everyone, but it is one that does still have an audience out there, even if it's getting smaller by the day as more and more people only ever remember the TV show as the 'real' Buffy. But this one could be a lot worse (especially seeing as we've never got a new series from Joss Whedon!).",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Buffy is a cheerleader at a Southern Californian Highschool and is basically an airheaded blonde who only wants to shop. Unfortunately for her, this is not what she is destined for, but rather to be a Vampire Slayer.I really found this movie to be lacking in continuity and suspension of one's disbelief.

32,johnnyboyz,"Time to go back to school, perhaps?",4,6 August 2008,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer can be either one of two things. First, it can be a television series the average American teenager or young adult grew up with in the 1990s, or it can be this: a 1992 camp-fest of a film that entertains in its own way but does nothing in the long run. Ironic how the individual film that is this 1992 feature is also capable of being either one of two things; either it's plain old good fun in a 'so bad it's enjoyable' scenario or it can be one of the worst films you'll ever see. For me, it leaned toward second option and that is largely down to the film's finale.I have to say that the film was mildly interesting for two of its three thirds. I say mildly because prior knowledge that the series existed (even though I've never actually seen an entire episode) helped me through and a motivation born out of curiosity also aided. What else can you say about a film that wants to fall into the horror genre and yet has its point of attack revolve around an American high school clique going to the mall and speaking in that annoying monotone fashion? What else can you say about a film that includes vampires as its main threat and yet forgets to include a reaction of some sort from its hero Buffy, played by Kristy Swanson? It's true to say that when Buffy is first made aware of vampires' existence, the camera cuts to a shot of one of her few expressions and the face remains emotionless.But before all that, the film has its gang of teenage American girls (one of which is played by Hilary Swank) going to malls and talking about boys and all that other stuff you'd expect from the stereotype. But the group do raise an interesting point through their dialogue. It revolves around the wearing of clothes that are a season out of fashion to which the girl defends her 'old' attire by exclaiming it to be 'retro'. I'm not sure of their thinking here but it made me muse over how old something had to be in order for it to be considered 'retro'  a few months is surely not enough. But instead of an introduction of why Buffy was chosen and why the mantel is passed onto her, we get an establishment set way back in the past that 'slayers' exist and then it's all high school until the film gets going.Buffy the Vampire Slayer follows a pretty routine formula, that of: hero is unbeknown to themselves; hero meets mentor; gets removed from settled place (fish out of water); mentor trains them and then on and on with the odd defeating of evil along the way before the final showdown. In this case the helper along the way is Donald Sutherland's Merrick Jamison-Smythe who seems to be an individual with three surnames rather than one and one forename. Merrick is also the sort of individual who will appear exactly where he needs to be at any one time, usually to help Buffy out. There are also some bizarre scenes early on that tie in with the first encountering of vampires that even Buffy has issues with; she does not like walking through graveyards at night with creepy old men whom she does not even know. But hell, we'll go through with it anyway.Usually in these stories, a strong villain is required to set the tone of menace  one of great pride, stature and ruthlessness; one that will strike a deadly blow at any given time of asking. Lead vampire Lothos (Hauer) fits anything but this description and apart from turning down numerous chances to defeat his enemy, ie; Buffy, he comes across as a bit of a goon dressed in a silly outfit. Why is he even here? What is his goal? Instinct from knowledge of the genre's routine tells me world-domination but I cannot honestly remember. It is not helped by some woeful acting from Hauer himself. Apart from this, the vampires in general come across as duds. It seems these vampires only attack teenagers/young adults; either that or there are no adults in this entire city to even attack. Indeed, early on some parents leave the immediate area for a lake house; the principal at the finale comes across as the sort of person that should not be running a school and Merrick himself is pretty useless when it comes to the fight scenes.But apart from all the cute formula, which I don't have any gripes with, the film just comes straight off the rails as it enters the final third. In one character, loyal to Lothos, we have an example of one of the worst deaths in cinema history; in fact I'm not sure if we can even call it a death due to what happens at the end of the credits. I don't know if director Fran Rubel Kuzui was still in charge for the climax but to say it's a horrid and muddled finale to an average film is an understatement. Remember that odd feeling you got when you saw everyone in 1976's Bugsy Malone getting soaked with foam and cream with nobody actually dying, thus completely contradicting the film's prior rules? Well, the same feeling happens here with the principal's relaxed attitude and the sheer levels of poor production values the film reaches  it's as if someone else took over to direct. Consequently, I'm not sure how this spawned such a successful TV show given how bad it really was but I guess it's funny to see a 'good' TV series follow a 'bad' film instead of the usual vice-versa we get nowadays.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Overshadowed by the popular and well received television spin-off (1997, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar), the film version is more of a comedy than the darker, more complex TV show. Despite a strong cast including Rutger Hauer (hamming it up as Lothos, the supreme vampire) and Donald Sutherland (as mentor and watcher Merrick), Buffy-the-movie ends up being a just another sophomoric teen horror-comedy. The high-concept premise, that a shallow, blond Southern California cheerleader obsessed with image and shopping is the latest incarnation of mankind's last defense against evil is priceless and the film starts well, with Buffy and her equally superficial friends meeting the mysterious po-faced Merrick and the proto-Slayer's slow acceptance of her destiny but then degenerates into almost slapstick farce when the vampires attack the school dance. Paul (Pee Wee Herman) Reubens is initially amusing as Lothos' acolyte but the part wears thin quickly and ends up with a goofy, over-long 'comic' death scene. I'm not sure what a 'Slayer' should look like but Swanson didn't seem to fit the part (or the part of a teenager, looking older than her 23 years). Fran Rubel Kuzui's direction is flat and insipid at times, and the film ends up looking like a second-rate TV sit-com straining for laughs. Of interest only as the progenitor of the popular small-screen iteration of writer Josh Whedon's clever idea (apparently he has disowned the film version of his eponymous heroine).",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
36,MaxBorg89,"The wrong kind of ""horror""",5,5 July 2009,"It is quite difficult to approach the 1992 film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which predates the acclaimed TV series, with an open mind when even writer Joss Whedon has publicly disowned the big screen rendition of his most famous creation: as anyone familiar with Buffy lore knows, Whedon's original script was heavily modified in an attempt to make the movie ""lighter"" and more fun, which led to him leaving the set and resetting his vision for a different format. After seeing the film, however, it is undeniable Whedon had a point: although he is the sole credited writer, the Buffy movie is clearly a patchwork of ideas that just don't add up in the end.After a quick introduction to the Slayer mythology, the proper ""action"" begins: meet Buffy (Kristy Swanson), a classic shallow L.A. girl who spends her days being a cheerleader, shopping with her friends (including Hilary Swank in her film debut) and flirting with hunky football players. Everything changes once she's contacted by Merrick (Donald Sutherland), a member of the Watchers Council, who reveals her true destiny: she's the new Slayer, i.e. a woman gifted with special strength that will help her defeat vampires and other demons. Buffy dismisses all the information as nonsense, only to realize Merrick might be into something when a group of bloodsuckers, led by one Lothos (Rutger Hauer), decide to feast on the locals.To be perfectly honest, the movie isn't all bad at first (minus the introduction segment, which looks like it was taken from a cheesy adult film): any complaints about Buffy being a stupid girl are off the mark, since she is meant to be like that in the early stages of the story, and Sutherland adds some gravitas to an otherwise thankless role. Then, once the villains appear, the tonal confusion becomes all too obvious: the scary moments play out as if the film was a spoof of horror movies, whilst the comedy looks like a poor man's version of John Hughes' body of work. In fact, the plot sort of vanishes after 20 minutes or so, leaving room for a succession of poorly planned, shoddily executed set-ups.The uneven tone shows up in the performances as well: Sutherland and Luke Perry (clearly using his Beverly Hills 90210 image for the role of Buffy's sidekick Pike) take the assignment very seriously, although both are occasionally burdened with terrible lines (again, not likely to be coming from Whedon). Swanson sort of overplays the stupid side of the character, but manages to walk away rather unharmed (besides, comparisons with Sarah Michelle Gellar are a tad unfair, since the TV Buffy is a totally different person), whereas Hauer (assisted by Paul Reubens) relies too much on the villainous persona established in Blade Runner and The Hitcher to bother injecting some real life (ironic, given he's playing a walking corpse) into a toothless part (pun intended).With hindsight, it's easy to say 20th Century Fox and director Fran Rubel Kuzui (who later redeemed himself by producing the superior TV series) were wrong to think Whedon's original, darker take wouldn't have translated well on the screen. Nevertheless, even if the spin-off show had remained unproduced, it would still be clear that the movie is best remembered as a misdelivered blockbuster wannabe whose major charm is the presence of pre-fame Swank, David Arquette and a blink-and-you-miss Ben Affleck.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Now some of the jokes are bad & extremely cheesy but it's all intentional & gives the film a sense of goofy fun.
I loved the later t.v series starring Sarah Michelle Gellar & only recently finally watched this early 90's Gem but i just as much like Kristin Swanson in the role!!! Here this Buffy is much more a silly materialistic air-head type of stuck-up popular chick in high school but as she realises she has a gift & a calling as the Chosen one, well she grows as a person & changes & becomes a better character. Kristin really gets her character & really gives it a go & she's great. We get a very cool cast here too with Luke Perry, a very young David Arquette & the great legendary Rutger Hauer as the big bad head Vampire, Rutger is having a ball in his eccentric & wacky role & he's always great to watch & i love the dude R.I.P, also we get another legend of Cinema with Donald Sunderland as the old hunter type who trains Buffy & teaches her about her destiny. Small bit-parts from extremely young Ben Affleck & Thomas Jane lol.
The Vampires are silly & comical & totally un-scary & when they get staked they don't seem to bleed or melt or burn up? They just drop dead? That's disappointing but i guess it's so it's no violence on screen & it's aimed at teens really.
I did love the pure early 90's look & fashion of that great time, i grew up in the 90's & remember it all so well, the colourful ""Fresh Prince"" style clothes & the silly attitude & slang of the high school times, awww Nostalga.

But when she finds herself responsible with the taking down bloodsucking demons from hell under the eye of a newfound guardian (Donald Sutherland), her extracurricular activities take a serious hit.Something of a cult film today, and the launching pad for a series of actors (including lead Kristy Swanson, and co-stars Hilary Swank and David Arquette)—as well as birthing the wildly popular series—""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a heady brew of teen comedy and vampire splatter-lite. I'll make it clear: this is definitely a corny flick, and Joss Whedon's script takes place in an alternate reality where vampires and Valley Girls can and do co-exist. In a lot of ways, it feels like an eighties movie, akin to something ""Fright Night"" but far less sinister. Whedon's script is humorous in the right places, and Swanson plays the spunky titular character with an appropriate pep. A young Luke Perry is the high school bad boy/hunk and looks the part probably more than he plays it, but his performance is fine. The presence of Paul Reubens and Donald Sutherland lend the film more credibility than it probably deserves, although Sutherland does feel somewhat out of place here; regardless, you can't knock a film for having Donald Sutherland as a part of its cast.All in all, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a fun and energetic offering of late eighties teen comedy with a splash of vampire blood and some fantastic one-liners; it's a ridiculous, alternate world fantasy, but a fun one at that. It does a fantastic job at meeting the crosshairs of horror and comedy without steering itself into too serious territory. 7/10.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
39,guisreis,"Charming Buffy, many laughs: the movie delivers what it promises",8,11 September 2014,"This is an unpretentious and funny high school action movie with vampires. Very beautiful young Kristy Swanson does a good job playing charismatic and initially futile Buffy. Even the most obvious clichés are nice to be seen performed by her: Silverstone-Clueless-style emptiness, martial arts and vampire-slaying practice, cheer-leading for the basketball school team. Both arrogance and tenderness are convincingly portrayed at her pretty face. Quite remarkable was also Donald Sutherland in the role of Buffy's tutor, Merrick. The film gets campy sometimes, but it is not a flaw. It is quite good in what it intends to do (and that is not to frighten or to be serious). Indeed, I laughed a lot! Seeing Hillary Swank in her very first movie playing one of Buffy's best airhead friends is something to be highlighted. The same can be said about having Rutger Hauer as the comic master vampire. My positive review has nothing to do with being a fan of the TV show, as I have never watched it.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

And I choose to be shopping.,5,28 April 2012,"I watched Buffy the Vampire Layer with Kristi Myst before I watched this film with Kristy Swanson (Red Water). The first was basically a bore, and this was not much better.The most interesting feature of the film was the snapshot of totally vacuous girls in the high school. They were consumed with their own pleasures and had no clue how the outside worked. It was interesting to see Buffy transformed slowly into someone who was focused on something besides herself.Unfortunately, that was about all there was as the fighting with vampires was totally unrealistic and suited more to some teen movie than a true horror film.All in all, it was a bore except for seeing Donald Sutherland.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

If only the vampires didn't look too goofy and cheesy to be worth a look let alone a stake through the heart.Thankfully, 90210's Luke Perry shows up to add eye candy and a bit of substance to this fluff as Swanson's would-be love interest/boyfriend.Thank God for the series, this film is otherwise forgettable and overdue for a remake.

42,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1992)- A mildly entertaining and campy bit of fun, though it is far too uneven and pales in comparison to the now-classic television adaptation.",5,11 March 2017,"Blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda... something about it being totally unfair to compare and contrast the film and television versions of this particular property because they are quite different beasts and aspire to meet different tones and aesthetics. Insert a comment about how the film was clearly going for a more campy, comedic riff that interpreted Joss Whedon's script in a more light-hearted fashion and should be allowed to stand on its own. Drone on a bit about how one can like both the film and the series, or even appreciate and prefer the film for its own unique take on the material. Yakkity-yak.Well, I really don't agree. I think one can definitely compare the two forms that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" appeared in during the 90's. And it goes without saying... the series was the better version. By quite a wide margin. It's a contemporary classic and not only one of the finest television franchises to emerge in the past twenty years... but arguably one of the best shows of all time. With a great self- aware but still spooky and tension-filled tone, ideal casting and top- notch writing for the most part, the series was about as perfect as can be.The film? Well, it's a bit of an interesting failure. There's a lot to enjoy here, and it's fun to see a slightly more whimsical and campy variation of the iconic character. But it's far too uneven for its own good and ends up an entertaining but incredibly mediocre experience.Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is your typical snarky, privileged Los Angeles valley-girl high-school cheerleader. She loves shopping, talking back and her clique of preppy friends more than anything else. So you can imagine her surprise when a mysterious man called Merrick (Donald Sutherland) informs her that she is ""The Slayer""- a chosen one gifted with superhuman strength and reflexes who is destined to do battle with the forces of darkness- most notably vampires. Now, she is forced to begin training to fight the hordes of evil that begin descending upon her town, including the vile and cruel Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a vampire king who seeks to destroy her.Honestly, I didn't mind the casting and I felt for the most part they were great choices for their respective roles. Being the first person to tackle the role before it was later perfected, Swanson makes for an amusing if not sometimes grating lead in Buffy, and if you can get past the handful of moments where she's totally unlikable, you'll end up being invested enough to stick with her. Sutherland and Hauer both add a sense of class to the film and inject some much-needed elegance. I also quite enjoyed the key moments where Hauer is allowed to ham it up a bit. Given the film's more comedic leaning, it works adequately. And supporting roles by the likes of Luke Perry and Paul Reubens also round out the supporting cast quite nicely- especially Reuben's as Lothos' second- hand man Amilyn. He's flippin' brilliant in the part and has one stand-out scene that I won't spoil- but suffice to say will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.Directorial duties are handled by Fran Rubel Kuzui, who does a fairly decent job visually, but can't quite find the right balance between humor, horror and drama. She does well enough with the action, but is perhaps a bit in over her head with the mythology that is being presented, playing it up a bit too much for laughs in moments that should be serious. Thought often the gags do land well enough to illicit a laugh at least. It's a competent shot, but aiming for the wrong target.And this goes beyond direction. The film feels at odds with itself from time to time, and I can't help but feel key decisions were made that were to the detriment of the story and characters. Story goes that the film was repeatedly re-written during production by everyone from the producers to the director to the cast, and it kind of shows. There are hints of writer Joss Whedon here and there, but it feels watered- down and made all the more bland. Heck, at times it even seems contrary to itself- a prime example being the fact that the film tries to build- up Buffy as the opposite of the classic damsel, yet she has to be bailed out repeatedly by the men in her life during action set-pieces. It cheapens the whole experience. Sure, have it happen once, maybe twice... but I counted at least three times she had to be saved by men in the film. The story suffers because it feels quite fractured by the muddled tone and some issues with the pacing and structuring that I can only assume is from the re-writes and subsequent re-edits to play up the laughs. It's just pretty darned sloppy, and comes across as incredibly and irritatingly uneven far too often. They took it too far towards the light and took away too much of the darkness. It lacks purpose and impact.Still, it got a few laughs out of me. And I can see people enjoying it to one extent or another. Does it match the ideal quality of the television series that followed five short years later? No. It doesn't even come close. But is it a terrible film? Not really. It's pretty much mediocre by any stretch, but watchable and fun in a campy way. My suggestion? Watch the show first. And then check out the film if you're interested in seeing the character done in a completely different manner.I give the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
43,Joxerlives,Not bad but no sign of the heights to which the concept will soar!,7,20 December 2011,"Lets start off where it really started with Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry back in 1992. The Good; Kristy is lovely, perhaps even more so than SMG, especially in her nightie. Love the scene where she rides the motorbike and some of the valley-talk. Principal Murray is also funny as is the 'What time is it?' gag. Love the idea that 'PMS is our secret weapon' Paul Ruebens is good especially his death scene. And that's pretty much it The Bad; Personally I think both Merrick and Lothos are way over the top. The Buffy/Pike relationship lacks credibility although it's interesting to think about Buffy/Oz? Angel is sorely missed. Kristy's lovely but nowhere near as good an actress as SMG. The finale is also not up to much. It's an OK film but it lacks verve The Other; Quite a cast, double Oscar winner Hilary Swank, Ben Affleck, Ricky Lake etc. Reputedly Seth Green has a small role as one of the vamps at the window of the dance who then gets kicked in the face by Buffy. You can certainly see the beginnings of the Buffy characters here; Pike=Oz Jennifer=Cordy Kimberly=Harmony Andy=Xander Cassandra=Willow (although she dies!) Murray=Flutie. No Ford from 'Lie to Me' though. The only characters to cross from the movie to the series are Buffy, Joyce, Hank and Merrick (in flashback in Becoming pt2). Joyce's 'What time?' line to Buffy is also repeated there but in a very different context. Joyce remarks to Buffy in 'Fear Itself' that she's not the social butterfly she used to be and also in WTTH that she's read parenting books. I saw Luke Perry in 'When Harry Met Sally' with AH and he was very good (and certainly still a hit with the girls). A shame we never see Pike again in the series although he does return in the comics. I don't really think the romance between him and Buffy works, we sorely miss Angel/Spike. If you look at the video cover it has both him and Kristy, by the time it comes out on DVD it's just her. Buffy later describes her pre-Slayer personality as Cordelia-like and she is. Ironically Merrick quotes Corinthians about putting away childish things but it's by clinging to her non-slayer life that Buffy is the most successful Slayer ever. She does recall the memories of past Slayers just as Dana does in Damaged so this is presumably something shared by all Slayers. Buffy says she aims to graduate, go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die. By the end of Angel she's done 3 out of 4 (wouldn't it have been cool if they got the Immortal to be played by Christian Slater?) Now of course if Normal Again is real then Buffy's delusion starts at the point she 'meets' Merrick and ends at the final scene of Chosen (the Buffy comics her dreams and/or perhaps she writes them for a living?). On the plus side although none of her Sunnydale characters exist it means that folks like Cassandra she based them on are still alive so she still has her Scooby-Gang and both parents when she gets out of the asylum. And she can always find a new Faith and Angel/Spike and name her daughter Dawn. Lots of continuity changes. Vamps don't dust and can fly. Buffy doesn't miss the heart first time out as she later claims. It's much more overtly Christian with the Slayer clearly god's instrument. Buffy has a built in vamp-detector which is alluded to in the series but not so strongly (maybe it's more intense shortly after the Slayer inherits her powers?). More cruelty to cats! Good soundtrack from the Divinyls, they also did 'I touch myself' which Buffy recalls listening to in 'Lie to Me' What the fanficcers thought; Read a very clever one called 'The Class of 1992' where TV Buffy meets Movie Buffy on patrol one night, Movie Buffy who married Pike, had kids with him, has both parents still alive and together and never had to do any more slaying.Questions; Merrick says he is reincarnated but is that just him or all Watchers? Do Faith and co all have the birthmark Buffy had removed? I'll give it 7 out of 10 just for the sake of nostalgia",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

45,tbills2,Kristy Swanson is Buffy the Vampire Slayer,6,27 January 2014,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer takes on all those too cheesy and too lame teenage fantasy adventures you might see and turns them into something of a smart comedy that has edge and is real. Kristy Swanson is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Swanson gives Buffy a too real vibe with an impressive show. She's outstanding. Kristy's a great choice for the classic part, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Kristy can really act her way around a movie set. She is sooo hot, like, the hottest. I love Kristy Swanson. I love her in everything I see her in. I didn't get enough Kristy Swanson through her short lived career. Watching this helps. I love her in 8 Heads in a Duffle Bag and in The Chase. Kristy Swanson makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer worth watching more than just once, along with the rest of the really good cast. Donald Sutherland supports Swanson effortlessly acting from the shadows so to not take away from Buffy's story. Teen heartthrob Luke Perry brings a bit of his bad boy attitude. Funny man David Arquette brings some of his freaky deaky nature. Pee Wee Herman, Paul Reubens, brings a bit some of his wild imagination. Hilary Swank is seen in beautiful form. Hilary, now, Hilary, can act. She can like seriously, act. Hilary. This fun movie is really campy, but it pays off by the end. Kristy Swanson, I love how nice it is to see you.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
46,Son_of_Mansfield,Valley Slayer.,6,14 March 2007,"There is still some of Joss Whedon's sense of humor in this movie and that saves this from being a total waste. The story is good as is the dialogue that was written by Whedon. What kills the fun is the grody acting. There must have been daily showings of Valley Girl on the set and nightly Moon Unit Zappa parties. It's not that it isn't believable that there are people like that, it's that we hope if we ignore them, they will die out. Kristy Swanson actually looks the part a little more than Sarah Michelle Gellar, but doesn't bring the same gravitas to the part. Paul Reubens exposes his real talent in this movie, he gets the most out of his lines. Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer give the movie some veteran presence, but the gutting of the script, to make it lighter, kills the meaning behind it. Buffy's always been about isolation, the fact that everybody is alone most of the time, even when they are around other people. This is a pleasant distraction, but if you are going to take out the dark parts, or drama, of a script, you might as well stake it through the heart and get it over with.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
47,Carycomic,This made me a hungry man for more Swanson movies!,10,4 June 2003,"I must've seen this movie, in the theaters, three or four times. Then, it came out on video. Fours year after that, came the series. And, while I'm a pretty big fan of the TV version, we must still face the truth. WITHOUT THE KRISTY SWANSON VERSION, PEOPLE WOULD STILL BE SAYING: ""SARAH WHO?"" *Possible spoilers from here on out.* For one thing, there's Luke Perry as Pike, and his initial reaction to David Arquette's vampirization. BENNY (at the 2nd floor window): ""Let me in, Pike. I'm hungry, man!"" PIKE: ""You're floating, man!"" Then, there's Donald Sutherland (father of Kiefer ""Lost Boys"" Sutherland) as Buffy's Watcher. MERRICK (after hearing about the deadliness of a Slayer's keen fashion sense): ""Ewwww! Vampires of the world, beware!"" Plus, Rutger Hauer (as Lothos) and Paul Rubens (as Amelin) exuding perfect comic-strip villainy. And, Ms. Swanson, herself, an absolute _hottie_, in and out of blue spandex! In short, I'm glad Joss Whedon saved the slightly more serious elements for the spin-off.

Swanson is Buffy (who looks and acts like she's starring in 'Clueless'), who is chosen to kill off the vampires ruled by uber-vampire Hauer.

The film lacks the dark atmosphere of the TV show, which makes it better in my opinion. Donald Sutherland is fine as Buffy's mentor. Rutger Haure also makes an interesting choice for the role of Lothos. Also check out the hilarious young David Arquette as the vampire Benny.The dialogues are not as crap as expected.

The mixture of cheezy early 90s pop-style combined with corny dialogue and occasional darkness makes for a surprisingly fun movie.Amongst the sea of bad dialogue many fun utterings arise and the film is luckily low-brow enough not to alienate the audience completely. As a vampire and an action movie it is a little stale. While the stunts are convincing at times, at other times they seem rather sluggish and the semi-campy feeling keeps it from reaching any level of awesomeness.

54,Aidan McGuinness,Tongue-in-cheek but it doesn't make a great movie,6,4 February 2002,"First off I have to say my review of this movie may be somewhat coloured by my adoration of the television series. Despite sharing a few superficial elements - a character called Buffy who slays vampires and who has a watcher - the two are quite distinctive (even if Joss Whedon penned them both).""Buffy"" here is very much played with a tongue-in-cheek. It's Clueless meets Dracula. Buffy and her cohorts are shallower than an evaporated puddle and Buffy can only learn to grow up when heaped with the responsibility of being the Chosen One, destined to slay vampires. The vampires in question are just people with white faces played up in quite a camp manner and bare little resemblance to the sharp, wise, smart vampires favored by both the TV series and other movies.There's no acting of any note and the plot is wet-paper thin. The direction isn't memorable... so what stops the movie getting a 0 or a 1? The humour. The movie is played for laughs, taking a bit of a dig at pop culture and vampire lore. There's some great lines in it - particularly the ""kill him A LOT!"" line. Watch the coach at the basketball game for similar humour, and there is an unforgettable vampire staking towards the movie end that's very amusing.The movie looks like it was shot on a shoe-string budget (adding to the camp tongue-in-cheek parody feel) and has none of the production values we'd see Whedon employ later on. What it does have is a sometimes very amusing line in black humour offset somewhat by an irritating need to follow the ""Clueless"" mould of teenagers (which was, admittedly, the trend at the time). It's not an awfully bad movie but it's not really all that good. In the end it's a 5.5/10 from me.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
55,jcholguin,Stick a stake in this movie,2,5 July 2001,When I looked at the video I kinda expected something serious with the usual high school jokes but I think this movie became a comedy.  Paul Reubens as Amilyn truly displayed the lack of acting ability especially with a ridiculous and tiresome dying scene at the end.  Rutger Hauer as Lothos is not a comedic actor and it shows.  The whole film was slow and without any direction and definitely needs a stake thru its heart if it had one.,Buffy the Vampire Slayer

The idea is wonderful, the execution flawed.  It goes along nicely until chaos erupts sometime in the last third, and it never recovers.  Until then, it's a swell ride.

58,Morbius_Fitzgerald,Crushing a vision at its best.,6,28 October 2012,"I mean it when I say it in the title, of all the crushed visions from writers that I've seen. This one is easily the best.This film is in the shadow of it's remake, the TV show that everyone loves SO much. Joss Whedon also admitted he hated the end result of this film and the director changed his vision, a lot of material was altered to make it a campy teen comedy. In spite of ALL of this, I still managed to enjoy it.The acting is okay, well sort of. Kirsty Swanson will ALWAYS be compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar and unfortunately for her, SMG does portray the character better. However Swanson led the role with a certain finesse about her that was still well done. Donald Sutherland also does a good ""pre-Giles"" watcher.I do think this film is okay, it has its moments - I compare the guidance counselor with some of my other teachers when he says(during the final battle) ""I've got detention slips, and I'm not afraid to use them."" On that note as well, expect that sort of humor. If you thought that sounded like crap or ""too corny"" for your taste I suggest watching the show.If you watch this THEN the show(or for most people, the other way around), you will find many inconsistencies with the source material. For example the ending is that Buffy defeats the Vampires, dances with Pike in the school hall and they both ride away on a motorcycle together. In the show Buffy apparently burned the school hall down in an effort to stop the vampires (which is why she got expelled) and she moves to Sunnydale with her mom only. The main reason this happens is because of Whedon's last draft, he apparently left the project midway through production and never came back. I look at this film as something COMPLETELY separate to the show for this reason.Overall this is seen as the ""ugly sister"" to its TV counterpart. Even though this film as MANY weaknesses, its not too bad for a watch or two.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
59,n-mo,Campy and Buff-y,6,21 August 2010,"The TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer was built around two principal metaphors: 1. high school is hell (the school was located atop a focal point of a gateway to hell), and 2. everything is the end of the world when you're a teenager (the characters are always fending off a literal apocalypse). Neither high school nor vampire hunting is a particularly interesting subject in itself, but the juxtaposition of metaphor and a slight touch of campiness made the show... bearable. That is why it collapsed so handily after the third season (which ended with Buffy bombing her high school on graduation night): once the characters left high school, it became a sort of Felicity (with monsters on the side): painful to watch but a very enlightening exposé of the fact that shallow public-school-edumacated creatures rarely rise above the shallow materialism of their meaningless suburban U.S.A. upbringings, despite frequent libertine pretensions to the contrary. (At least Felicity, a show about undergraduate university life--a subject even less uplifting or interesting than is high school--had the decency to end with graduation.)The movie, on the other hand, self-consciously keeps the setting immersed in this shallow Southern California mall-girl culture. The premise of the slayer legacy--the insinuation that it is the same girl reincarnated--is totally fictive and off-the-wall and therefore a less obnoxious mythos than the creepy (and to this author, blasphemous) mixture of Dungeons and Dragons, Wiccan fakelore, Sartrism and Christianity that was the Buffy universe as portrayed on the TV series. Kristy Swanson was clearly much better-cast as Buffy than was Sarah Michelle Gellar: a tall, strong girl is fare more believable as a potential monster hunter waiting to break loose, even if she's been a silly blonde bimbo all her life. Donald Sutherland is also good as the Watcher, and the supporting characters add nice bits of Easter-egg-type humour here and there. Hilary Swank, in particular, shines as the implausibly idiotic cheerleader tag-along.The chief problem with the movie, more so than the ultra-cheap production elements, is, the fact that, as other reviewers have pointed out, it is more of a lead-in to the TV show than a stand-alone. By the end, Buffy has started to come out of her teen-bomb-shell ego, but very little HAPPENS in the movie: the dark scenes carry little tension and little payoff, and the campy comic moments are a little too few and far between to really carry any weight. You'd be tempted to watch the TV show to get any satisfaction out of the story (and frankly, I would advise you not to do so).Overall, a good choice for 2:00 AM when you're feeling nostalgic for some early 1990's fare.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
60,Wilbur-10,Give me Scooby Doo anyday,4,18 August 2000,"Modern-day horror/comedy, which manages to botch the few opportunities it could offer and ultimately becomes pretty pointless.The plot has promise, involving an historical slayer of vampires who is continually reincarnated into a new 'chosen one' - this person has a wise teacher who is resurrected each time to look after them. This could have been the premise for a good serious modern horror, but as seems to be the trend in the 90's, in order to appeal to the younger market, horror films have to have a large comic element.Buffy is the latest slayer; a cheerleading, American highschool, dizzy blonde goodtime girl, who is introduced to her teacher who must train her to fulfil her destined role.The film is shallow rubbish from the start, which if it were a low-budget B-movie could have offered camp fun to laugh along with. 'Buffy' though, is a major release with two decent stars - Donald Sutherland as the teacher/mentor, and Rutger Hauer as the leader of the vampire clan. The fact that both these characters in the film, despite the performers, are dull, bland and inconsistent, with no depth to either of them, firmly lays the blame for the films lack of body at the Director, script, production values etc.As Buffy, Kristy Swanson is reasonably good, giving the right amount of naivety, gutsiness and glamour. The storyline is trite though, with no coherent narrative connecting each scene, no structure, and no chance for the audience to become interested in any of the characters. Watching the film becomes tedious long before the short running time reaches its conclusion.The film also has the annoying trend of vampires being slaughtered en-masse like zombies, virtually hurling themselves onto any wooden stake held before them (see 'From Dusk Till Dawn' for more evidence of this).Overall the whole thing smacks of a TV pilot movie, and in this sense it was a huge success with the subsequent popularity of the TV series which did follow. As a stand alone movie though 'Buffy' joins the other recent hugely disappointing vampire films - 'Interview with the Vampire', 'Near Dark' - which promised much but couldn't even grasp the basics of the vampire theme. Bela Lugosi wouldn't have needed morphine with films like these to put him to sleep.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
61,Mr_PCM,How bad it could have been,4,5 January 2006,"The difference between this movie and the TV series that came after it is, to say the least, striking. Where the latter is sharp, witty and well-written with excellent special effects, the former is cheap, hammy and corny with virtually no special effects to speak of. What Donald Sutherland thought he was doing in this film defies belief, but he is by far and away the best thing about this film - maybe it is literally so he can say that!The plot tells how Buffy (Kristy Swanson) became a Vampire Slayer in the first place, including her early training and her first watcher Merrick (Sutherland). She must adjust from being a normal teenager in LA with nothing to worry about except boys, clothes and cheerleading, to the chosen one with the weight of the world resting on her shoulders.It's amazing that such a terrific TV series could come out of such an abysmal movie. Very little seems to survive from the film to the series, except the name of the main character. None of Joss Whedon's sly tongue-in-cheek self-awareness is here, and nor is the superb dusting process when a vampire is staked. There is also none of the genuine spookiness here that some of the episodes would contain. What we are left with is vampires that look like demonic versions of Mr Spock, complete with pointed ears - Sesame Street's Count had more menace. The acting is almost universally awful, with Sutherland being the only saving grace of the film; even Rutger Hauer has nothing to be proud of here.One of the few things that makes the film worth watching is that of the big screen debut of one Hilary Swank, who even under the horrendously clunky dialogue and clichés 90s manages to show real talent; something that is sadly lacking in the rest of the cast's hideously over-the-top performances.The film is only of value to the completists who want the complete works of Joss Whedon; it is little more than a historical curiosity which shows how bad Buffy the series could have been, but thankfully wasn't.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

63,jaywensley2004,"Its Buffy, its just not ""Buffy""",7,3 March 2015,"As a huge fan of the BtVS TV series I recognize that the movie is a completely different creature from the show.But the show is in here, working hard to rise to the top. If you're willing to pay attention, I think a game can be made of ""What's Whedon's?"" There are scenes where the dialogue seems clearly intact Joss Whedon (particularly the one-on-one scenes between Buffy and Merrick). And if you listen closely to Pike, Xander Harris speaks. All the elements of The Master vs. Buffy from BtVS Season 1 are in the film, including the sexual subtext, although in the movie it is much more overt, if incompletely explained.Even major visual elements that Whedon would use in the TV show are in the film. The film's training sequence could have been used in the TV show. And perhaps most significantly, Buffy in prom dress and leather jacket are icons in both the movie and the show.And its easy to believe Kristy Swanson was as much Whedon's choice as SMG would be six years later. They don't so much look alike as they do sound similar and have the same presence. It is interesting to me that Swanson's portrayal is never quite as vapid and vacuous as the character is meant to be. Always there is a sense that earnestness and sincerity are lurking. Very much like SMG's portrayal of Buffy as inherently serious but wishing she were more about good times.For me the movie's major flaw is in the editing. I have the sense that much of the plot and character development got left on the cutting room floor. Characters often seem to be picking up conversational threads the audience is not in on, especially the aforementioned sexual tension between The Master and Buffy, and Merrick's conversation with The Master as Merrick is dying. The other problem I have is that the dialogue, especially among Buffy's friends, is too too (irony intended). I saw the movie during its theatrical release and remember thinking that the actor's deliveries were too sincere for me to believe the ""pop speak"" was meant to be a parody. I have the sense that this was one of Whedon's issues with the changes Fran Kuzui allowed to his script; there's an excess of slang that suggests Kuzui was trying to ""talk to"" the target audience and she wound up patronizing them.Buffy the movie has small measures of the things that would make Buffy the show so very great. In my opinion it is not the mess many BtVS fans hold it to be. In a way, fans are fortunate to have the two versions. It gives us a chance to see Buffy as envisioned by two directors, one of whom is also the creator.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
64,Tresix,Lackluster inspiration,3,8 December 1999,"When I first saw the ads for this movie, I thought that it would be a cute, innocuous, harmless little comedy.  When I saw it, I was greatly disappointed.  First, I think they were about ten years too late with the Valspeak (""Groddy to the max!"").  Second, Rutger Hauer's Lothos was something of a lackluster villain (and to think, Hauer was Anne Rice's inspiration for Lestat).  He didn't seem to be too much of threat at all. Next, even back then, I thought Luke Perry was too old to be a teenager. Finally, the fight scenes looked as if everyone is fighting in molasses. Oddly enough, the one positive thing I found was from the one person whom I thought I would hate:  Paul ""Pee wee Herman"" Reubens!  I am no fan of Pee wee's by ANY stretch of the imagination.  Yet, he was the only thing that I found to smile, even laugh, at in the movie.  Especially his ""death scene"".  In fact, I find that I like Reubens only when he ISN'T Pee wee.

66,nealvan557,This movie is perfect for what is was written for. Too bad it didn't come out a few years earlier alongside Fast Times at Ridgemont High.,9,29 September 2018,"The cast was filled with established and unknowns who became huge stars such as Hilary Swank. Only thing odd there is that she looked like she had a bigger bustling than she has now that she's over 30 years later. Typically women get bigger if healthy with age than smaller unless they are not eating. But I'm waaaay off track...sorry.Consider the time period thisnwas made. Fast atones at Ridgemont High had been a massive success showing high school kids from all stereotypes in the LA area. Remember 'Valley Talk'? Well, words such as 'Whatever!' 'Groty to the max!' 'Gag me with a Spoon', etc. all of which can be heard in Zappa's song Valley Girl. Plus it's spandex, big hair, some leather worn by only the truly hip or bad elements. Tattoos were not the standard on men or women much then either. Of and I almost forgot the clothes women wore that had built in shoulder pads. Add all this up, the. Add in the comedic take on what it means to be The Chosen One aka Vampire Slayer with Donald Sutherland playing the creepy dude who is tasked with teaching a Valley girl cheerleader with minimal brain power to be The Chosen One who is tasked to save the world from the latest uprising of vampires which have include both Paul Rubens and Rutger Hauer as the chief vampire villains.Hilary becomes the boxing champ who has a tragedy occur right at the pinnacle of her career. Luke Perry was big at the time. Rutger Hauer was famous for Bladerunner, but then did The Hitcher and Nighthawks after this with relative newcomer C. Thomas Howell & interestingly Jennifer Jason Leigh (JJL from Fast Times at Ridgemon High fame.) in a truly creepy movie with an interesting morality point, and well known Stallone in a pretty lame movie. Paul Ruebens aka Pee Wee Herman was huge for his movies and TV show at this time. Hilary Swank was still an unknown, but in just a mere 16 years later she became most famous for Million Dollar Baby..then?? David's Arquette who is most remembered for his recurring role in the Scream movie franchise. Thomas Jane who was still in the minor leagues, but then he got known for HBO's Hung, SyFy's The Expanse, and in between, the movie The Mist. And last but not least, Joss Whedan got his foot in or perhaps further in with this successful film at the box office. Think about all he's accomplished since this movie, then the TV series which is both like and unlike, good and bad version of this movie's concept as with a title character named Buffy as the Vampire Slayer. Personally, I've always found Kristy Swanson to be not only very beautiful from my first time seeing her in Wes Craven's Deadly Friend movie. It was great to see her play a cliché Valley area bubble head. Although the movie came out in 1992, it plays as if it was from the mid-late 1980s with all the clothing worn, and Val Talk. Look up when Zappa released Valley Girl on his album entitled 'A Ship Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch'. The title is even a bit of humor if you understand the cover art.On an aside...am I the only one who noticed Hilary Swank's chest size got smaller in those 16 years from this movie to MDB? Apologies of this last bit offended anyone, but I AM actually quite curious since typically as most women get older they become chestier unless there is illness or perhaps her training as a boxer for MDB movie?",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

You have to watch the series to see what the original movie could have been.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
69,Cube_TX,"Not great, but there's fun to be had",4,16 December 2001,"Honestly, if you're looking for a fine feature film you should have guessed from the title that this wasn't it.  For what it is it's entertaining -- Luke Perry does a great job as Pike, the shiftless loser who falls for Buffy, and Kristy Swanson is good as Buffy.  The movie was intended to be cheesy and sophomoric and is funny as a parody.  No, this movie won't be winning any awards but if you want great vampire horror rent Nosferatu. Don't tell me you'd rent this flick because you're a vampire fan.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
70,Jeremy-93,bloodless,3,5 May 2000,"When a film that's had such a bad press as ""Buffy"" still manages to disappoint you, that's one bad film.  For much of its running time it manages to be no worse than mediocre - a sort of sub-""Clueless"" (which, to be fair, it predates by three years), with Kristy Swanson doing well enough as a sub-Alicia Silverstone.  It also has much the same agenda as ""Clueless"" of taking a gentle poke at affluent society's rigid class system and wafer-thin ""caring about the environment"" values.  Presumably Joss Whedon's script originally had rather more in this direction; it seems to be set up that Buffy and her class are vampires too, but nothing is done with this idea.  ""Clueless"" had the advantage of a plot by Jane Austen.  As soon as ""Buffy""'s plot starts, things rapidly collapse.  Disaster is staved off for a while by Swanson's energy, Donald Sutherland's ability to keep a straight face, and Paul Reuben's touching conviction that he's in a funny film.  But never has Rutger Hauer's natural screen presence been so totally neutralized by poor direction, unfocused character design and a story that's not only increasingly incomprehensible but not even worth trying to follow.  Again, there is an idea here: Whedon seems to want to posit a sort of eternal attraction between vampires and those who slay them, so that being the slayer according to the traditional rules simply confirms and strengthens the vampires' power.  But it all goes for nothing.  The fact that the themes and characters are so far removed from that of the spin-off series means that the movie doesn't actually suffer from comparisons with it.  It just suffers from being rubbish.  Kudos to Fox for being talked into taking on this botched project for a remarkable series, and, for that matter, for suggesting Sarah Michelle Gellar should play Buffy rather than Cordelia.  Execs get a bad press, let's give them a moment's appreciation.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
71,DiamondGirl427,Campy and So Cheesy...at the same time...,8,24 July 2010,"This is just pure nonsense entertainment. There is no moral to this story..there is no deep seated lesson being learned by the main characters..except maybe for Buffy herself..who learns to be less of a shallow snobby cheerleader after discovering she is a slayer. Considering when this film was made...it fits with the times...but there are teens today who will watch it and get into too. I recall everyone being amazed at seeing ""Dylan"" from ""90120"" in a real movie. Opposites attract..and Buffy and Pike are very different...in every way. As the movie moves along..Buffy seems to mature in attitude and realizes her friends are basically brainless idiots. They cannot see the BIGGER picture...but she now CAN..thanks in part to the training she is receiving from Merrick...aka Donald Sutherland. Seeing such a top notch actor in a film like this was a little surprising really. Maybe he liked the script when he read it. I do know..after reading about the film...that a lot was left out...some of the more gruesome details being one. It was suppose to be a dark movie...but became a campy one instead. If the film was made today..in 2010...Merricks' character would be considered very creepy...even perverted..since he was almost stalking Buffy by following her around. I did think it was odd that even though so many people in the film were disappearing without a clue...yet no one seemed too concerned..even the adults that were briefly shown here and there. Like most teen films..the ones here don't have a clue about anything the kids are doing. The principal of the school was a hoot...thinking he was in touch with the kids..when he was anything but cool. Stephen Root is so good at playing these kids of characters...his ""Milton"" in ""Office Space"" is priceless acting. I would say this is a movie about girl power..and she does kick ass..but still manages to stay girly. Rugar Hauser did an OK job of being the head vampire...I guess they didn't want too deep of a performance...the character was quite full of himself...almost vain. Seeing Pee Wee Herman in this was funny too...it was difficult to think of him as a vicious killer who drank blood..without something goofy coming out of his mouth. The best part of the movie...to me...is the dance at the end. Buffy finally makes her OWN decisions for herself...wears the boots with the dress and goes with Pike..she isn't quite ready to let go of being a high school girl yet..but will be the chosen one..in her own way. I didn't care much for the television series..it was too different from the film...there is little to compare the two. See the original film to get the real effect. Enjoy.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

If you looked at this movie as a horror film, you shouldn't have.  It was a comedy.  Yes, the love story was so cheesy, it made you laugh, but that was the idea.  I mean, what exactly do you expect from a movie titled Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  It wasn't supposed to have a in-depth plot or anything.  It was just pure entertainment.  I would give this movie at least a C. You people have no idea what comedy is if you don't watch this movie.  If you guys like the TV show, that is meant to be more horror.  The TV show is stupid as hell, and you would rather watch that than movie the show was based on, where's the logic.

""I did the same act before Mork and you hated me!"" Looking back, what did we have here? A stellar cast and crew! Joss Whedon writing, Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer, Paul Reubens (playing the dark side of Pee-Wee Herman), then teen-idol Luke Perry (doing an impressive James Dean, or does he always act that way), Hilary Swank, Thomas Jane, and some very special acting from David Arquette, and I believe it is Sasha Jensen, who played newbie vampires either euphorically, or invincibly ~ both being reasonable positions when you discover you now have unbelievable powers. Oh, and did you see Ben Affleck and Seth Green? They aren't credited but they're in there.Stephen Root baffles me here because of a striking resemblance to Randy Quaid but his role as the completely socially-detached school principal was something I could see Quaid doing. Some reviewers are obviously ahead of me on that one.If the movie isn't already a cult classic, it will be! It would be a mistake to view this film as a serious horror. It is a definite spin on the vampire genre, but neither corn-ball or excessively violent.. instead the movie plays it as a subtle comedy. The only truly hammy scene comes when Paul Reubens gets staked and then it was so deliberate I can't fault it but rather cherish it.Very sharp cinematography. One clear homage to Lost Boys. Scenes that I will never forget simply because they could never happen in real life (thinking especially of ""Benny"").Lastly, Kristy Swanson, definitely in fine athletic form, with some of her own cart-wheels and a clear transformation from valley-girl into someone who suddenly sees the big picture.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Kristy Swanson plays Buffy well, I think, and it was good seeing other familiar faces such as David Arquette, Hilary Swank and Donald Southerland (great actor, but disappointing in his role as Merrick).A film only for those fans of the Buffy television series who are curious to see how it all started.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
76,marcusman48,Kristy and Donald make this one a keeper!,6,27 January 2008,"So, what does this strange little film have going for it? Does it deliver the goods as a ""horror"" film? Hardly. The ""freak-outs"" are as drearily predictable as the creaking coffins in a carnival funhouse. The vampiric villains are more grotesquely comical than frightening. And as for gore - well, you've seen WWE ""wrestling"" matches more blood-drenched than this. Clearly, BUFFY cannot boast of an impeccable horror pedigree; its guiding spirit is more a specter of innocent adventure and self-discovery.It's not future Oscar winner Hilary Swank in an inauspicious debut, nor Luke Perry as yet another peculiarly coiffed heartthrob. Even Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens is curiously flat in this.What's more, despite a few amusing bons mots and some flavorful dark humor, BUFFY isn't really all that funny.No, it is largely thanks to Kristy Swanson and Donald Sutherland that this sleeper carries the day.No matter what the type of role she tackles, Kristy has always been captivating to watch; that she never attained bona-fide star status after this picture is a great injustice. Here, her wide-eyed and totally unaffected performance as humanity's callow savior is truly the stuff that Hollywood dreams are made of. Buffy is instantly relatable no matter who you may be, and her character development over the course of this film will win you over to her side despite yourself. Some might scoff at the notion that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER contains a feminist subtext, but I'd say that interpretation has a great deal to recommend it. In a sense, the vampires are incidental: the core theme is really concerned with the triumph of a girl overcoming her private fears.But the absolute best thing about this movie has to be Donald Sutherland as the thousand-year-old Merrick. With his icy blue eyes and eerie mumble of a voice, Sutherland always puts forth a haunting presence. Here, he is a fleshly portal to the otherworldly realm reluctantly probed by our heroine. As a rabbit hole was to Alice, a tornado was to Dorothy, and a wardrobe was to Lucy, so Merrick is to Buffy.Even if you're not a big fan of the TV series, you should give this charming little romp a look.

Especially after the very popular TV show came out. So what did I think of it? Well it's not what I expected, but that's because I've only really ever heard of the television series which is a completely different tone. This film is VERY campy (especially the action sequences and writing) and does not take itself seriously at all. Which I actually really enjoyed! Buffy herself is quite thickheaded, but she gets stuff done! Also seeing Luke Perry in this was really nice.The acting is pretty awful, but that's kind of the point so its acceptable in this case. I enjoyed the soundtrack, but it's my type of music so you might hate it if it's not your thing. Also the humour did have me going throughout the movie, as long as you go in without expecting what the TV series did than you'll probably take away the same experience. I also always have to applaud movies that have female leads as both badass and sexy. Buffy is this embodied and I'm honestly living for it.Watch the film for fun and to finally see a vampire film that doesn't either take itself too seriously or fail miserably at humor.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

But this one didn't really work for me. It was boring and rather shallow. The cast really didn't have to do much, and casting the charismatic Donald Sutherland would have been a great move if he had had any good lines. But now he just stands there. But the thing that is most remarkable is that director Kuzui and writer Joss Whedon managed to turn this stupid film (with a great premise, I have to admit) into a pretty decent TV show. The casting of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy works much better because she really looks like the normal schoolgirl with a secret (which is kinda the appeal of the whole concept) where Kristy Swanson has a much more mature attitude, and is not really suitable for the role.

It seems that writer Joss Whedon had more that kind of atmosphere in mind when he began ""Buffy,"" but I think the meddling that took place with his script is not without merit. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is about a cute but vapid high school cheerleader who finds out that she is the one chosen to kill creatures from beyond the grave. This, I think is a pretty good premise for a comedy, and one that was successfully realized. It is a fun and funny movie that never takes itself seriously.

I think Kristy Swanson is ok as Buffy, and Donald Sutherland is awesome as her watcher, but other then that the film stinks.

81,Michael_Cronin,"Dumb, half-baked rubbish",2,4 June 2004,"Not being a big fan of the TV series, I approached this film with an open mind & attempted to take it on its own terms, rather than making endless comparisons.However, comparisons are inevitable, & this feature is completely different in tone & style to the series. While I can appreciate the TV series as a well-made, tongue-in-cheek show with a dark edge & a certain amount of depth, 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' is nothing more than a confused attempt at blending a black, satirical comedy with the standard teen movie genre, & as such, fails to achieve either.You could say it's Heathers meets Clueless, with Evil Dead lurking in the background, but it's just a mess which doesn't really know what it wants to be. There are the occasional moments where it seems like it was once a very whacked out parody of The Lost Boys (largely the scenes with Paul Reubens, Donald Sutherland or Rutger Hauer), but whenever it seems to be coming together, it goes off on another tangent.As annoying as I find the character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV show, Kristy Swanson is just a total non-entity, neither funny as the dumb blonde, nor convincing as a vampire-killing vigilante.Luke Perry's usual oh-so-cool rebellious teenager role does nothing but irritate by its very presence, & with the exception of Sutherland, Reubens & Hauer (who are obviously just paying the bills), the rest of the cast might well have been dragged off the street. Even brilliant comic actor Stephen Root as the school principal has nothing to work with, & it's just bizarre to see Hilary Swank in a moronic, clichéd role as one of Buffy's bitchy friends. Had she been cast in the lead it might have been interesting.Apparently, this was a case of the studio taking away Joss Whedon's original vision & turning it into something mainstream, predictable & forgettable.I suppose all those hardcore Buffy fans can be grateful for the fact that he didn't sell the character to the studio, & the rest of us can be grateful that there were never any sequels.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

I can't watch it as a film, it's so ludicrous, but as a series of vignettes, it is magnificent(ly bad).I find it difficult to believe that, having failed with this turkey, Messrs Kuzui and Rosenman then resurrected it a few years later, took out all of the humour, just making it bad, and then made a fortune out of it.Why do I like it?Number 1 - the cast. Do any of them take it seriously? Rutger Hauer's performance is so over-the-top as to be farcical and Paul Rubens is magnificently silly as his sidekick, Lefty (a very old Transylvanian name!). They seem to have swotted up on everything that made Vampire movies so awful and included it. Both are wonderful. Donald Sutherland seems to be trying to play it straight but failing. David Arquette and Luke Perry surely are just in it for the laughs. David Arquette's vampire Benny just has me howling! The females on the cast are equally stunning. Kristy Swanson makes a wonderfully buxom Buffy (Is she fit or what?). I love her characterisation of the empty-headed, spoilt little rich girl, so ably abetted by Hilary Swank and the others. Their dialogue is marvellous. I only understand about half of it. They are just so wonderfully, cheerleaderishly, spoilt, rich, vacuous and stupid - they're alright by me!Number 2 - the plot. How ludicrous can it be? The whole thing is total nonsense which is perfect because you don't have to bother with it. Forget it and watch each sketch.Number 3 - the characters. Check out the following:- The high school principal after the massacre, Paul Rubens dying, Rutger Hauer trying to speak around his fangs, the scene when the van hits the tree (trying not to give too much away here).My favourite line? Favourite scene too. The basketball match! Cry from the crowd, 'Hey, there's a girl on the court!' and a gasp from the audience. Magic!Favourite 'actor'? Hilary Swank. Just brilliant. Her best line? After she lets the vampires into the dance - 'They're seniors!' she whines.Yes, it is rubbish. Yes, it is stupid.

83,doctorx2,Better than average vampire film,7,4 September 2009,"Okay, this is not great cinema, BUT... it is entertaining, and Joss Whedon gets high marks for creating a franchise (and a career for Sarah Michelle Geller). This 1992 film is also increasingly interesting as a trivia piece, not only for Whedon's involvement in one of his earliest works, but for its cast, which includes Rutger Hauer, then-teen-heart-throb Luke Perry, Paul Reubens, David Arquette, Hillary Swank (as a practical unknown), Candy Clark (of ""American Graffiti"" fame), and of course, Donald Sutherland, all backing Kristy Swanson in the title role.Similar in some ways to the cult classic ""Lost Boys,"" the premise is clever: a self-absorbed cheerleader discovers she is ""the Chosen One"" and must defend the world from vampires. Much of the dialog is equally clever, and the ""violence"" is so campy and intentionally fake that (with this in mind) it is hilarious. Reubens' death scene is unbelievably bogus and funny. The effects are likewise absolutely low-budget. All of this lends a certain charm to ""Buffy."" ""Buffy"" really suffers most from bad editing, which gives the film a bit of a slow, clunky pace, which comes across feeling low-budget. The soundtrack is good, if now a bit nostalgic, and there are some precious moments (e.g., Swanson baiting vampires by wandering alone down a dark alley at night, singing ""Feelings"").

The movie reminded me of the first season in a way, I could see Buffy evolve as a charachter. I personaly have been a fan of Kristy Swanson's past work, and she does well here. I still think Sarah Michelle Geller was the one who could bring Buffy to the sucsess it now recieves.Besides Swanson, I enjoyed Luke Perry, and David Arquette's preformences. Ben Affleck and Rikki Lake preform cameos.To summerize, if you are a fan of the show, this will help answer some questions you might have, and get a laugh in between.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Kirsty Swanson plays her part well enough, but she simply goes from being an annoying type extra from ""Clueless"" into an annoying Slayer...The TV series is without question one of the best shows out there. When you consider what a mess was made of Highlander, and even Timecop on the TV series, side, Joss has progressed from an imaginative director hamstrung by a pathetic cast (even Donald Sutherland & Rutger Hauer struggle here) to someone who is making stars of the characters in his series.
Only the Superman series has managed to come close to building young actors careers. Stargate SG1 is pretty good too...If you are planning on watching a prequel to a well loved tv series, stick with Superman and Stargate though...Buffy, I remember avoiding in the video store well before they made the tv series. It was on TV last night here in the UK, and the only satisfaction it gave me, was how accurate my instincts were, before I had the benefit of utilising this forum to select good films...One to avoid. Joss needs to remake this (ala Sam Raimi) now he has more money, and put Sarah Michelle Gellar in place as the young slayer, before moving school....",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

However, just under the surface you can see the foundation for what would be one of the most brilliant tv shows of the 90's, if not of all time. Looked at as a testing ground for Joss Wheadon to flesh out his backstory and ideas the film takes on greater significance.

My wife watches it religiously and can recite the season's happenings much like the Saturday paper soap opera summaries. I did, on the other hand, love this movie, and still do.

There's good actors in this movie, like Donald Sutherland, Luke Perry, Hilary Swank and David Arquette, but even they didn't do a particularly good job. Joss Whedon is a genius when it comes to many series/films, Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse, Agents of Shield - but this movie was among the worst I've seen.

A light weight fluffy movie. It may be a more sugar coated bubble gum version and not like the TV show but it's not bad and is amusing and I happen to like Kristy Swanson and have been a fan ever since seeing her in the Disney made for television movie Mr. Boogedy. Okay I prefer Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy but I also liked Kristy's take on the character and lets face it, if it wasn't for Kristy and this movie there would be no TV show with SMG!

93,MrGrundle,Different films earn stars in Different ways....,6,31 May 2006,"Buffy the vampire slayer is not a terrific film. It is not the type of cinema that leaves you breathless and reeling, nor is it the type of cinema that idles at first creeps through your dreams with pervasive intensity. No, this is Time Capsule Cinema, a voyage to the neon panoply of early 90's California in the self described ""Lite Age.""Kristy Swanson is lovely as the wise cracking eponymous star, nicely alternating between clinical sarcasm and tenderness in what is, essentially, a limited role. Donald Sutherland and Rutger Howard are hilarious as ancient figures who just happen to be hip to the slangy nature of late 20th century teen dialog. Luke Perry, David Arquette and Hillary Swank (far from her best role, but my favorite film of hers!) and a few others are fine as the assemblage of irreverent teenagers, eye rolling to the max! A highlight of the film is Stephen Root, playing the principal, regaling Buffy with a cautionary tale of his experiences with LSD in the 60's...""I was at a Doobie Brothers concert...""Oh, and by the way, that's PEE WEE FREAKIN HERMAN as the fanged creep Lefty. Boy he got outta jail just soon enough. Paul Ruebens is phenomenal, of course, and it may be his presence that allows me to shamelessly enjoy the rest of the film through my rose colored glasses of guilty nostalgia!Too many serious films reek of Los Angeles- you can almost taste the soy burgers and smog- when they take place elsewhere. This makes it difficult to differentiate the cast of actors from the characters they are paid to represent. This film revels in LA's lack of charm and sophistication. I half expected an In-N-Out Burger commercial to pop up half way through.

95,LilyRFox,Not Great; but the potential that inspired the TV show,8,21 July 2008,"The first Buffy movie is certainly not the highlight of Joss Whedon's extraordinary career, but it was the building block that led to the greatest TV show ever made so you have to it credit for that.On one hand this movie has a great script, some truly witty dialogue that showcases what would go on to become Joss Whedon's trademark, a neat story and some catching emotional sub plots. Basically the movie is a watered down version of a Buffy episode; containing action, wit, humour, scary moments and some emotional baggage, it has everything it needs to keep you hooked; BUT one problem!Simply, it has been let down by the producers; a dim heroine over played by the lead actress (in what I have no doubt was a style of performance she was forced to give by some suited and booted types) and a lack of budget make it corny from the word go. The pandering to the teenage market at the time is obvious thanks to the out-dated clothes that must have been horrendous even five years after it was made, and unfortunately have aged it considerably so that this movie's shelf life was never going to be long.Although for the average movie-viewer this would deserve little more than 4 stars if that, for a Buffy fan this is priceless. Here we view the origin of the legend; a cool early show of Whedon's talent, a sneak peak into Buffy's past and a fantastic blast from the past of uber-kitsch - and you've got a fun night in for anyone.Worth a watch for the average viewer, and definitely a must-see movie for Buffy fans.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

The characters act brain-dead, the vampires look like they are nothing more than teens in Halloween costumes with bat ears, and many of the lines were flimsy attempts to make the audience laugh but cause nothing but eye-rolling.Buffy the Vampire Slayer tries to be funny, but doesn't succeed at all.

NOT being a slayer and rooting out evil vampires! And as such, taking on the role of being the slayer has far more culture shock for her than the TV series provides.It's a funny film, and is intended to be such. The casting is solid, with Rutger Hauer as head vampire, and the great Donald Sutherland as the slayer's watcher.Look out for GREAT lines, such as ""kill him - A LOT!!"", ""Great - so my secret weapon ... is PMS!?""

The vamps look like vulcans who are going to a 1980s nightclub. It was the worst vamp make up ever in film. And whoever thought the idea of camp vampires was a good one should be shot. Paul Reubens death scene is one of the worst, misjudged, scenes in movie history. And as for the acting, well if you had shown it me before boys don't cry was made and told me Hilary Swank would win best actress oscar one day I would have laughed at you.

Regardless, good for some nice laughs, entertaining, and I love Rutger and Sutherland playing it all serious like when everyone else is laughing it up -- though Sutherland did get to let go some smiles himself. It is campy. It is fun. And it built an idea for a heroine that spawned a very successful TV show. What more could one want?

Rather than being a victim, Buffy is the unlikely hero against the droves of California Vamps.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer tries really hard to be the Fast Times at Ridgemont High of the  90's but falls short.  There is excessive use of teen-speak that tries too hard to be the next hip lingo in High Schools everywhere.  Still, some of the characters are comic gems (like the basketball coach and a surprising clever turn by Luke Perry).  Joss Whedon, the creator of the movie AND the TV show, has shown real growth with his clever writing and story lines for the Television series.  In fact, the TV show has highly superior actors, dialogue, and special effects (great vamp make up instead of just scary ears and fangs).The movie has its entertaining moments and is worth watching if for nothing more than to see Hilary Swank (newly acclaimed Oscar Winner) as a vapid teen.The movie was somewhat entertaining, but, if you have the chance, watch the TV show instead.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

For one thing, with all the acting talent in there I was hoping for a bit more character development a la the series, but then this is only 1 movie and spoofy at that, so char. development wasn't the point. Still, with the mix of Whedon writing and Kuzui directing, anyone else notice that Pike was at some points purely Xander (being drunk/early in the film), purely Angel (the dance), not to mention his name has much in common with a favorite blond vamp? Granted, the direction got a bit annoying at times with the various shots probably overdoing the cheese factor and lacking a better sophistication seen in the series, but it's been pointed out that this wasn't exactly Whedon's original version from which he based the series (it's noted in the Pilot that Buffy burned down the gym). However, the teenage valley girl turn to slayer was nailed by Kristy Swanson, which is probably the best unique quality the movie has (the series seemed to have moved past that somewhat before it even began, and besides, Cordy basically took over the fluffy material from B).If anything, I'd say this movie is the epitome of a prototype: something which lays the groundwork but still has much that can be improved upon.

Although I really like Sarah Michelle Geller Kristy makes a better Buffy, hands down. I loved the movie so much that I bought it. It usually gets me a little energetic so I do my workouts while it's on. The soundtrack is totally fitting for the movie. Every song was great. I gave this movie a 10.

Another thing-vampires usually don't act that way.Becoming one does not make you stupid,you know *rolls eyes* I advice you to watch the movie though,just to see Whedon's genius on how he managed to survive and create Buffy the Vampire Slayer(the real one,of course)Probably the nicest thing in the movie is the portrayal of Buffy's friends.

I know people ages 30 to 40 and older who love the TV series and find the movie to be cute but a little too hokey!

114,Faustus-6,Surprisingly thoughtful,7,3 February 2000,"When this movie came out I was still a young teenager and hadn't really developed a critical taste for movies yet.  Now I tend to lean more towards the off-beat or the art house type flicks.  However, as my sister was watching this movie the other day, I realized that it went a little farther below the surface of your average mass-marketed teen pleaser.  Sure there are plenty of shallow moments, but at the same time, there is a very potent undertone.  Though more and more of their peers are disappearing and being found with their blood drained, the teens are too wrapped up in their own little world to recognize the problem.  In fact, when one of their inner circle is found dead, the girls mourn because Kimberly never got her leather jacket back from the dead girl.  Also, notice the discussion for a dance theme that has to be socially aware.  These are moments that are not only funny in a black sense, but also a scathing criticism of the vacuous teenage culture of the '90's.  So don't be so quick as to write off this movie as another low-rate teen flick.  Much more lies beneath the surface.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
115,Faustus-6,Pretty Decent Flick,7,18 June 2003,"In 1992, I saw this movie twice at the theater, bought the VHS, and later added it to my DVD collection.  As a freshman in high school, I was first merely infatuated with the beautiful Kristy Swanson.  I went on to tirelessly rent all of her other mediocre at-best, and more often horrid, flicks (The Chase being the one exception.  I stand beside it as a decent movie as well).  Now some eleven years later looking back, having an M.A. in English with a thesis containing a large section devoted to vampires, I don't have that same adolescent preoccupation with Swanson, but I do still defend my position that this movie is a lot deeper than the initial surface look.I did try to watch the series that it spawned, but--and I know I will anger some close friends, including the director of my blessed Master's thesis, in saying this--it just doesn't compare to the original movie.  What I've seen of the wildly popular TV series tries to take the subject at hand far too seriously.  I mean, come on, how serious can a show be when the heroine is named Buffy.  The reason the movie works is because it is supposed to be viewed tongue-in-cheek.Aside from hosting later Oscar-winners Hillary Swank and Ben Affleck, it also serves as a very effective parody of the vampire and overall horror movie genre.  There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie, and if one delves just a bit below the surface, he/she will see that there is a deeper message at work.  Vampirism in this movie serves as a metaphor to all the ills of society, and, not unlike the culture of 1992, and even today, many people, especially the ""popular crowd"" and budding debutantes refuse to acknowledge that there is any larger issue in the world than their own little meaningless concerns of fashion and popularity.  Just as the planners of the dance have no clue as to what a socially conscious theme should ensconce, they also take little notice of the current trend of classmates being found mutilated with drained blood (refer to the ""Yellow leather jacket"" scene for a good dose of dark humor and to further my point).As for the performances, Swanson really takes the spotlight away from Luke Perry, who at the time was sizzling with his role of Dylan on 90210.  She is well cast as a ditzy slayer, though I doubt she could do much more.  Her less-than-stellar follow up career has been disgusting as best, though I once thought she might actually have the talent to become a budding Hollywood starlet.  Sutherland shines in his brief role as Merrick, slayer trainer.  Rip Torn is initially funny as the guidance counselor (love the whole ""it's drugs, isn't it?"" routine), though at the end his role delivers of the most unfunny lines of the script (the horrible ""detention"" gag and the ""Well, I saw Platoon"" line as the credits scroll).  And, of course, I cannot forget Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman) in his first role, I believe, after the whole ""Adult Theater"" scandal.  His character provides some of the greatest humor, and I must admit his death scene still makes me chuckle after all these years.At any rate, the long of the short of it is, the TV show has corrupted most people's initial view of the movie.  One has to remember when approaching this that it is not meant to be a serious drama like the series.  It is a parody, an over-the-top spoof of the vacuousness and self-absorbed malady that was sweeping over the youth of 1992.  Many of the TV fans were not yet ripe enough to remember just how Reagan-esque we still were in this era. As a child coming of age in this time, I related, and I understood.  Those of my generation will, no doubt, also.  Times have changed drastically, but remembering that turbid time in my life, when puberty, raging hormones, and the incessant search for acceptance were my all-consuming motives, I can look back at this movie and appreciate it.  Sure, it is a product of its time and the later generation might not fully understand it, but I do not know off-hand of another movie that means quite as much to me at the ripe old age of 26 as this one did.  It is more than a movie; it is a Rosetta Stone with which I can measure my formative years, and, for that reason among others, I have developed an appreciation for this much-maligned flick.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Maybe I like them because they are rebels or because they're just good actors. The ending was hard to understand and it was almost funny how nonchalant the main protagonist dies. It's like, why didn't he kill Buffy when he had the chance? Why did he just let his main minion be killed by Buffy? Why didn't his minion struggle at all when she was killing him? Didn't make much sense. Overall it's a cheap movie but it does have some nice depth and I thought a lot of the dialogue was clever too.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
121,genew,Not a bad movie but the TV show is much better.,5,10 August 2006,"I saw this movie several years before the TV show was released & this movie is an OK vampire movie. IIRC, I saw this movie around 1993/1994 on TV & I like it considering that I love horror movies/vampire movies.This is a lightheaded comedy starring Kristy Swanson as Buffy, a blonde girl who finds out that she is the Slayer & that vampires are in LA. She is trained by Merrick who is her first watcher. This is an OK comedy movie but, unfortunately, the movie is a toned down version of Joss Whedon's original script which was much more darker than the final version of this movie.Look for Paul Reubens aka Pee-Wee Herman as a vampire.This movie lead to the creation of the Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV show which is much, much better than this movie. The TV show is based on the original script for this movie.If you have only seen the TV show, you will probably not like this movie. But if you can, watch this movie to see what Buffy was before Joss created the TV series.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
122,jessieswift,"Breezy, cheesy fun, just don't expect a moody Sarah Michelle Gellar",7,14 May 2005,"It's difficult to understand how this movie, seemingly designed to be as trashily disposable as possible, spawned one of the most successful and influential TV shows of recent years. Naturally, writer Joss Whedon had to totally change his original creation to create the much larger cast of characters and ever more labyrinthine mythology of his much darker TV series and there is little similarity between that and this moderately entertaining early 90s cheesefest, more a cross between Clueless and the Lost Boys. Kristy Swanson is amiable as popular airheaded cheerleader Buffy, obsessed with some disastrous Saved By the Bell fashions, light years away from Sarah Michelle Gellar's troubled teenager with ""issues"". Donald Sutherland, as her watcher, exhibits a similar wry, detached sense of humour as Anthony Head but is often so detached he appears to be acting in a completely different movie and initially appears to just be pervy old man creepy (""You must come with me to the graveyard""). There are no real signs of even early versions of Buffy's quirkier sidekicks Willow and Xander (although apparently Seth Green was in the movie but was cut from it), instead her friends here are interchangeable airheads, check out double Oscar winner Hilary Swank in an early role in excessive make-up and permed hair. The villain is a camp and easily defeated Rutger Hauer who offers no real threat but flounces around in a ruff or, occasionally, a dressing gown and appears, at one point, to decide to have a snack on a monkey for no particular reason, while the love interest goes to perpetual teenager Luke Perry's rather pointless ""bad boy"" (although when he does any ""bad boy"" stuff in this film is hard to see, he doesn't even dress that scruffily). While Whedon developed on some ideas, some simply fell by the wayside, there's a notable lack in the TV show of Buffy's ability to sense vampires through supernatural cramps (""My secret weapon is PMS""). While undoubtedly the lack of interesting, developed supporting characters, in many ways what made the TV show watchable, is definitely a flaw with Buffy the movie, its very disposable silliness is in fact much of the attraction here. While aspects of the TV show became impenetrable to casual viewers like me, demanding constant attention across hours of series, this movie is fast paced almost to a fault and is light hearted fun enough to sustain you through it, even occasionally giving some of the witty dialogue the TV series was famous for. Certainly worth watching if you've got time to spare, just don't expect a masterpiece, or the TV series.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

You can tell immediately that this was aimed primarily at the young males in the audience by the appearance of ""jokes"" about the male anatomy. Female cycles are not funny in any context; yet rude inferences to this were allowed to remain in the finished product.I personally cannot imagine young people, especially girls, behaving in such a bawdy, slatternly manner. My impression is also that Buffy and her coterie have abundant permission from their well-heeled parents, so that they can go shopping at the drop of a Macy's credit card.Yes, the original premise of a ""cheerleader who fights vampires"" has been shown in the follow-up TV series to be entertaining and appreciable.

132,smaug69,"Fun film, sets the stage for the series",7,15 December 2006,"This is a refreshing film that pokes fun at the horror genre on many levels. The title is the first clue that this is something different. A girly girl name for someone who slays vampires as The Chosen One. Heavy stuff. lol. Females are usually the fodder in the horror genre, but not here. Empowering a female to try and save the world from the forces of darkness while she tries to maintain her keen fashion sense is both groundbreaking and hilarious. And who says a little comedy can't be interjected amidst the gore and death? Humor, after all, keeps all of us sane and this film has it in spades; whether it be in the form of a quick quip or a sight gag or an over-the-top performance, it all undercuts the seriousness perfectly.The cast is, for the most part, great- especially Rutger Hauer and Paul Reubens. Kristy Swanson carries off the title role with aplomb. Easily her best role, in my humble opinion. After having immensely enjoyed the seven seasons of the TV series, I still find myself watching this film and appreciating it even though it did not end up the way the creator, Joss Whedon, originally envisioned. I believe were it not for his strong reaction to the changes made from his original script that 4 years later, he would not have been so gung-ho to take Buffy to the little screen. Thank The Master.FYI, the trivia posted here regarding Buffy having burned down the gym in the original script version penned by Joss Whedon does not appear to be correct. I have read what looks to be the original script(found on the internet movie script database) and the ending is pretty much like how it happened in the film. The gym remains mostly intact, as the vampires all skedaddled after Buffy killed Lothos. The script is definitely darker than the film and you can see a much more direct correlation between it and the TV series.P.S. This film predates Clueless not the other way around so the references should be attributed as such. BtVS was the influence.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer

If you are determined to hate this movie because it's idiotic and juvenile don't waste your time watching it; however, I think this film has a few redeeming qualities. The first thing I noticed is that the main character, Buffy, is a snobby, popular, cheerleader but she's not a stick, she's a real human! The cheerleading scenes are extra funny because usually, the girls are not quite sychronised. Buffy's comment about being in the ""hairy mole club"" cracked me up. I love Paul Ruben as one of the vampires. His over-acting is hilarious! The snobby high school girls are also funny, especially when one of them turns up dead and the others realize that she still has a borrowed jacket.

I figured I'd never watch it because it was not faithful to the movie. Well, I did start watching it and now I can say I get great satisfaction out of both Buffy entities. For those of you who are avid (or rabid) viewers of the series and are thinking about watching the movie beware that it is absolutely NOTHING like the series.

Luckily a brilliant director came along and turned this script into a witty parody of vampire movies and high school stereotypes.

140,KJMackley,"A fun and witty movie that has a lot of potential, but slips toward the end",6,18 October 2006,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer is one of those titles that stands out in a list of movie names. The television series is among the biggest cult shows of all time, and this movie has been rattled as a pale ugly cousin. While the final product is not high art, there is a lot to recommend this movie for. One is that the primary performances are excellent. Kristy Swanson gives Buffy a great change from a airy, flighty Cheerleader to an airy, flighty Vampire Slayer. It's funny to see how she takes the same attitude between those two jobs. Donald Sutherland is an intense, intelligent and somewhat creepy adviser to Buffy, Merrick. Rutger Hauer plays the villain Lothos as a sophisticated, if generic bad guy. Paul Reubens gives a few laughs as a very excitable henchmen. Other performances are mostly okay, if unmemorable. Hillary Swank has an early career role as a friend of Buffy, and Ben Affleck has a two second moment as a basketball player.The movie plays with the themes of high school life and growing up. Buffy becomes more assertive and learning that there is more to life then the senior dance and the latest fashions. The fights are okay during the movie, but the ending was not very well set up or edited. The movements are stilted and you are thinking how easily one or the other could finish the fight by attacking when they had the chance. The only thing that really hurts the movie is the finale, there is just a fight, and obviously Buffy wins. It didn't involve any creativity and there isn't any indication as to what Buffy intends to do afterwords, the conclusion doesn't satisfy the intention of the movie. Throughout the movie, there are small things that also hurt the flow of the movie. Merrick implies that he is some sort of reincarnation of a person that always guides the chosen one, but it is never explained. Lothos seems to have some sort of vendetta against the slayer and Merrick, but again, is never explained. The love interest played by Luke Perry seems to have some importance, but never really played out. But these small things would have been minor if the ending played better.Other then that, the humor sets it apart from other generic teen horror/comedies. It is very witty, with a lot of laughs and quick throw away lines. The interaction between Buffy and Merrick are the highlights, listen carefully to the give and go with them in the locker room.

It might have made a great 15-minute short (maybe), but as an entire feature, the concept alone couldn't carry it. And then once it got to committee, any hope was lost.No, instead of being the airhead she should've been to fit the concept, utterly generic heroic (i.e., male) qualities were forced on the main character that couldn't support them. Not only did this add nothing, it made the male lead entirely lost and disposable. No character was developed beyond the minimum necessary (if that), with only Reubens being able to get a few laughs by shamelessly overacting with a character that had no business doing so. It was as if he was as bored as the audience was and just trying to entertain the otherwise somnambulant crew.Don't be fooled into thinking this is the initial form of the TV show and it'll add anything to it - this was a pitch, a raw idea.

I first caught this film when I was about 10. I loved it and bought it on VHS. I played it over and over again. The characters were spot on, and the acting was, well, cheesy. But the premise of this film is how fantastically camp it is. Kristy Swanson is beautiful, much more so (in my opinion) than Sarah Michelle Gellar. And the point of Buffy is that she is a sexy, popular, 'slut type' girl who is whisked from her dreams of moving to England and marrying Christian Slater. Where as Sarah Michelle Gellars Buffy was always in denial about something. Kristy's Buffy wanted to deny, but couldn't. So the will power between the two actresses doesn't match.

I always found it (the series) over dramatic, not campy enough and not comedic enough. now I know what I just said wil not make me popular here , plenty of reviewers below touting the greatness of the over hyped teen drama tv series version of this. But fact is the tv-series was more for a 90's teen to get into and it did that fine, but for me I couldn't stand the tv-series, it was too safe while being over dramatic about every thing and it just didn't appeal to me (even though I was a 90's teen). ok my opinion of the series out of the way let's get to this movie actually. to me it is what modern vampire flicks should be; good campy fun , nothing too deep , nothing too dramatic. Kristy swanson became one of my favorite actresses because of this movie. to me she was buffy , (I like michelle geller , but again I just could not get into the tv series). This movie got me to try the series , it was that much fun to me . aside from kristy, the movie also Donald Sutherland, and peewee hermen (out of his hermen get up obviously , and if you are wondering he was the long haired vamp underling). when I first saw this as a young teen I really wanted a sequel, but alas we never got that , and we got a series instead that erased this movie from most people's minds sadly. made in 92 , this movie had more of an 80's camp feel to it than a 90's movie , and to me that is why I loved , it , I just grew up on 80's movies, and loved that this movie felt like it was an 80's one even though it is clearly a 90's movie by its date. who knows maybe it's not too late for a sequel , kristy still alive, maybe they could have a ""grown"" up buffy movie a s sequel. then again , the original movie was more for grown ups than the tv series was. 
if you love some 80's style camp movies , even though this one is a 92 movie , I recommend it to you.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
162,Beersnob,Please don't ignore the TV show because of this bad movie!,4,8 January 2000,"I'm a huge, make that HUGE fan of the TV show, so I had always wanted to see the movie that started it all.  What a let-down. It's as if Joss Whedon was using the movie as a practice session.  The dialogue was mediocre at best, effects were non-existent, and the characters weren't developed at all.  Not to mention it was anti-climatic.  I realize it was low-budget, but man, it was low.  I'm actually surprised that they decided to even give it a second chance as a TV show. It's not like any character from the TV show was in the movie, except for Buffy, of course.Joss Whedon certainly got it all right with the TV show (if it weren't for the title, so outdated now), but I'd keep happy thoughts about the TV show, and skip the movie altogether.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
163,mearley,Good Movie if seen with right attitude,8,20 May 1999,"The unfortunate problem with Buffy the Movie is that many younger fans of the show are now probably going back and watching the movie and thinking to themselves--how DUMB.  Remember--the movie came first.I found this movie to be one of the more enjoyable movies of the 1990's--brilliant performances from otherwise duds Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) and Luke Perry (90210 fame), as well as Christy Swanson, and the ever deadly Donald Sutherland/Rutger Hauer combination, serve to make this a classic.  The key to this movie is this:  It is NOT a vampire movie, and it is NOT the movie that spawned the concepts in the TV show.If you watch this movie, consider it Black Comedy.  The brilliant one liners from the various characters are enjoyable, entertaining, and well delivered (""Come on, Pike--I'm hungry!"" ""You're floating!"").  The closing credits are hilarious, some of the funniest movie closings of all time.This is one of those movies that I go back and watch every year or so, just because it's so much fun!",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
164,buffy2003,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,10,29 December 2000,"I've seen this movie like a million times and I think it's better than the show.It's one of my favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone.  I don't understand why people dont  like it, I saw it when it came out and I still watch it and love it.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
165,mikebros,One redeeming feature,1,14 September 2000,This movie has only one redeeming feature - it spawned the excellent television series. Why they choose to produce the TV series after such a terrible movie is anyone guess but we are all glad that they did.,Buffy the Vampire Slayer
166,guardianofdarkness,too short,7,3 February 2001,"I think Buffy the vampire slayer is a fun movie. But it doesn't get close to the series, wich is great. The movie is ,as I said, fun. It isn't of great quality, but you can laugh about it. I think that what's wrong about the story is that it is just too short, everything goes too fast. The movie could be twice as long without getting boring. Just when you think the story is getting somewhere it's allmost over. Overall, it's a nice movie, with some great actors.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
167,garyyager,It's better now than then,7,29 November 2007,"Watching it again on TV recently, I liked it much better than when it came out. I was a little disappointed back then. It seemed like a great concept, a teen, comedy, horror, action flick. The movie and the writing are all over the place. At times it's really fun and funny, with really quick and witty dialogue. Sometimes the writing is awful, specially the lines for the Donald Sutherland character. At times it really worked, a lot of times it didn't. It had a fairly talented cast. The Pee Wee Herman death seen is really funny. Although Donald Sutherland often looks bored. It's funny to look back at the 90's, it did seem to capture a time and place very well. It's better now than then.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
168,xcwarrior13,Great movie to spawn an awesome show.,10,4 December 2006,"Although this movie is a lot more comedic than the show ended up being, the story is still pretty good, even if it is corny at times. If not for Josh Whedon, we would be without many great years of Sarah Michelle Gellar kicking vampire butt.Might be one of David Arquettes best performances, though that isn't saying much. Donald Sutherland is always good.The death scenes with the one vampire are great, especially at the end. He just will not die.And who wouldn't want to have a girlfriend that could kick that much butt?",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
169,canesflyers,Campy and Fun,10,6 August 2002,"This movie was meant to be funny not serious and dark.  It is great for a few laughs provided you keep an open mind.  Paul Reubens has one of the best death scenes.  It is hilarious.  Joss Whedon has made his apologies for the film and has made up for it. If you want good, serious and a bit dark watch the Buffy TV show.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
170,elric15,Sweet....,9,4 December 2001,"This is the movie that started a cult phenomenon...and for good reason...this movie's dry humor and witty surprises make for a laugh riot of apocalyptic proportions.  Well, may be not...but how often do you get to use the word ""apocalyptic.""  Rule No. 1 in enjoying this movie (or any other) is don't take it too seriously.  The movie should be fun for fans of the tv series...because you get to see the idea being born...to me it has everything the series does...it's a bit rough but it's a good laugh and goes great with popcorn.  What else can you ask from a movie",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
171,Cattri,Better than the Series.,10,12 January 2002,"My sisters and I have watched this movie dozens and dozens of times and we all still think it's one of the funniest movies we've ever watched. It beats the series by far, using black comedy that actually works and an A grade cast. I first watched it when I was twelve and found that the humour and the storyline however far fetched, doesn't get stale (as you would expect it being ten years old and watched by us about 100 times) I would recommend watching this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
172,duncre02,"Fun and funny - decent acting, too",7,19 February 2002,"This is a fun and funny movie.  It's got good humor and a story line that works.  In fact, it's pretty much a cult classic.  The acting is not bad and Kristy Swanson successfully portrays a valley girl who gains her brain through her ordeal.  It's actually one of my favorite movies.  It pokes fun at itself and the legend of vampires, which is refreshing, but it's not at all a spoof.  I gave it an 8.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
173,cwhall,Fun movie about a young woman's coming of age,7,28 May 2002,"A fun movie if not overly deep. It was fun watching Buffy just starting as a slayer. It was good seeing her change into a responsible young woman.  The early seasons of the TV show were better, but the movie is clearly better than the offerings of the past few years on the TV show. Parents should consider watching this with their daughters.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
174,OneLungTara,great movie,10,8 August 2002,"Ok, if people seeing this title and renting it thinking it's got anything to do with the should-have-never-been-created TV show, you're barking up the wrong tree.  This movie was meant to be a hilarious parody of vampire killing movies.  Not some idiotic drama about killing vampires.  This movie is one of my all time favorites; especially with the great acting from Donald Sutherland and Paul Rubens (better known as Peewee Herman...)  So if you like hilarious parodies, like Young Frankenstein, Pootie Tang, This is Spinal Tap, and/or Wet, Hot American Summer, you'll love this.  I sure do.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
175,bubbahotep25,Classic. How is this rated only 5.6?!,9,7 February 2020,"Paul Reuben's come back! Best death scene ever! This movie is a freaking classic! Swanson, Hauer, Sutherland, Perry, a young Swank.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
176,FuzzyLoveRabbit,excellent entertainment,8,20 June 2007,"Don't compare Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie with Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV program. The movie is fun, light-hearted, satirical, and whimsical. The TV program is dark, meaningful, and very orchestrated. This is not an indictment of either form. Both have their places and times. So, if you're looking for a meaningful commentary on adolescent angst in the movie, forget it. If you're looking for an incredibly funny and far-out experience, you'll love it. Especially if you like vampire movies in general.Kristy Swanson, Donald Sutherland, the basketball coach, the school principal, David Arquette, Luke Perry, Peewee Hermann, Rutger Hauer....they're all great. They play their roles without pretension. You see a wonderful young Hilary Swank. The movie is just fun and fun to watch. Don't ask for the meaning of life when you watch it. Just watch it for the ridiculous fun.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
177,buffyfan4ver,Loves It!,8,8 September 2005,"Let me tell you. This movie couldn't of had been any better. If your a Gothic freak who loves the supernatural or if your a popular cheerleader then your sure to have fun watching this movie. Buffy Summers who is a 16-year-old high school senior is told by a stranger (Meritt) that she has a destiny and a purpose in life. To stop and kill vampires. He tells her that it's her birth right. ""Into each generation a slayer is born. One girl in the world with the power to stop the forces of evil."" Buffy ends up having many dreams where she is a peasant girl and that a man (Vampire: Lothos) keeps killing her. That hes so strong for her to beat in her dreams. It seems that her dream is a reality because Lothos does exist. The chosen one has to be physically trained with weapons on how to stop and kill the vampires while also completing the task of killing one of the masters, Lothos. She ends up going to her beautiful prom which is anything but perfect when an unexpected guests decide to ruin the event. The rest is up to you. It's a great movie to watch.Rate:8/10",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
178,lalookie-1,Underrated Epic 90's Flick!!! Killer Soundtrack!!!,8,18 September 2020,"Love this movie, love the cast and love the soundtrack!!!I remember being so excited for this movie back in 1992. The poster was so cool and left me wanting more! Reading the names of the cast on the poster, I was like, this is going to be The Lost Boys for the 90's! Luke Perry (who was huge at the time... RIP), Paul Reubens, Donald Sutherland, Stephen Root, David Arquette, Andrew Lowery (He would go on to star in the awesome My Boyfriend's Back the following year), Ben Affleck, Hillary Swank and the love of my life at the time, Kristy Swanson (I would actually get to meet her about 10 years later and she was so great)! I believe this movie led the way for Clueless and Scream...Awesome soundtrack too! Classic 90's!Also, who remembers listening to the radio spots promoting this movie that featured Cracker's Teen Angst? I bought the soundtrack assuming that song would be on it and of course it wasn't... It's not in the movie either... However, any time I hear Teen Angst I associate it with this movie because of those radio spots!",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
179,owenmccormack-82002,Once more with feeling,7,25 October 2018,Why isn't Affleck listed on this page he's in the movie,Buffy the Vampire Slayer
180,MovieFreakFanatic,Bad Movie,4,7 February 2006,"I was very disappointed in this film and in Kristy Swanson's performance. She's a good actress and this role completely made her out to be just another dumb blonde, through she did make the most of it. Not just her but, David Arquette was at his worst here. Donald Sutherland was just awful! This movie makes some of the greatest actors look like complete amateurs. It has a bad storyline, lame special effects and a whole bunch of corny lines.I give it a 4 because while it was a bad movie it was entertaining to a point. Although, it's not the masterpiece the TV series was. If you like cheesy, sugarcoated horror films this is the film for you!",Buffy the Vampire Slayer
