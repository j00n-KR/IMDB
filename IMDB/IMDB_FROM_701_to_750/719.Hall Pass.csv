0,SnoopyStyle,"unlikeable subject matter, but salvaged a little something",6,8 September 2013,The Farrelly brothers are once again stuck on something uncomfortable. Are they really saying that a pass to cheat is something to root for? The fact is the subject isn't that fun to watch. The whole concept is truly unlikeable but they were able to salvage a few laughs out of the whole thing.Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are extremely likable actors. They were able to take some of ickyness out of the cheating. But the way they go about their adventures really diminishes their marriages. It doesn't help that their wives are cheating with other people.The Farrelly brothers really need to drop all these uncomfortable themes. It's as if they are trying for highest degree of difficulty. Either that or make these much more darker. Make it truly a black comedy.,Hall Pass
1,kosmasp,Pass,5,17 December 2011,"The Farrelys at it again. And I doubt that anyone will think they came close to their surprise hit ""There's Something about Mary"". While not as bad as Shallow Hal, this still lacks a lot of the punches we had back then. On the other hand, they also seem (and this might be even more important)to have forgotten about the gentleness behind it all. It is a very thin line between the being romantic and crass in Farrely land. Unfortunately those two things have not been mixed successful.The actors try their best and there are a few highlights (Richard Jenkins brings some integrity and fun into the movie, though most of those moments can be seen in the trailer). Still not enough to really get the movie going. So while there are movies worse than this (even from the brothers themselves), this will probably not excite people enough for a second viewing (even in its ""unrated"" form).",Hall Pass
2,jboothmillard,Hall Pass,4,9 July 2011,"I didn't realise this was from directing brothers, Bobby and Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, The Heartbreak Kid), I thought from the title it was going to be a teen school comedy or something, it should be called ""Free Pass"", just like the term from American Pie: The Naked Mile, but never mind. Basically Rick (Owen Wilson) is married to Maggie (Blades of Glory's Jenna Fischer), and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) is married to Grace (Anchorman's Christina Applegate), both women can tell that the boys are missing the excitement of being single, looking at other women and hating the lack of good sex. With their wives fed up of their behaviour, treating them like trash, both Rick and Fred are granted a ""hall pass"", a week of non-marriage in which they can do whatever they like, no questions, no holes barred and no consequences during or afterwards. While Fred laps up the idea of being able to have sex with any fit woman he wants, Rick is very dubious about it, since he has been with his wife for so long. It takes a couple days for one to find someone they may actually able to get into bed with, but Rick finds and flirts with attractive waitress Leigh (Nicky Whelan), and when he wakes up naked on her sofa he questions if they did anything, they didn't. Rick also gets an invite from the family babysitter Paige (Alexandra Daddario), but he turns her down for Leigh, but he is stopped from possibly doing anything when he finds out Fred, who got a woman in a hotel room, is in hospital. It should be said while all this is going on, Maggie and Grace hang out and get closer, and they end up having some invitations themselves, but it is obvious they are thinking negative things about the whole week of marriage thing. In the end, love really does prevail as Rick turns down the possibility of sex with Leigh, he is obvious cross at himself, but he loves his wife Maggie much more, and even though Fred did have sex (near enough) with another woman he is forgiven by Grace, everything goes back to being happy and normal. Also starring Richard Jenkins as Coakley, Stephen Merchant as Gary, Larry Joe Campbell as Hog-Head, J.B. Smoove as Flats, Tyler Hoechlin as Gerry, Bruce Thomas as Rick Coleman and Kathy Griffin. The cast all their parts fine, Wilson obviously being the lead did well, and Merchant when he was on had some small giggles to give, the premise is nothing very original, and it lacks the style of comedy other Farrelly brothers films provide, i.e. gross and wrong but right kind of stuff, but it isn't a terrible comedy. Okay!",Hall Pass
3,paul_haakonsen,It didn't fully deliver...,4,15 May 2011,"I watched this movie with some beforehand impressions because I had read some lukewarm reviews, so the movie wasn't looking too good from the very beginning.The story in ""Hall Pass"" is very nice, in my opinion, because it deals with friendships, middle age and the trouble that comes with it, and men's stupidity in general. (Mind you, I am a man myself!) However, the concept of getting time off from your marriage to do whatever you like, seemed a bit too far out there in my opinion!Being a comedy, I found myself laughing only two or three times throughout the movie, so to me it wasn't particularly funny. I found the movie to be more of a movie that dealt with some of life's issues, not just trying to be a funny movie, because it failed at that point. What made me laugh the most was the scene in the bathroom with the girl sitting on the edge of the bathtub.The cast in ""Hall Pass"" was good and they worked well together. Owen Wilson (playing Rick) and Jason Sudeikis (playing Fred) really had good chemistry together on the screen. And Christina Applegate (playing Grace) and Jenna Fischer (playing Maggie) were also doing really good work.However, this was, at least for me, not the type of movie that had enough value for a second watching.",Hall Pass
4,edwagreen,*1/2*,1,28 June 2016,"Simply dreadful 2011 film with Owen Wilson and his pal given a hall pass by their wives. This simply means that for one week, they can act as single guys and cavort with whomever they choose to do so.The movie then goes into their various experiences during the week. The wives also go into hall pass mode so that both the men and women are cheating on one another.The situations are ridiculous just like the film. There is a chase by the police, a guy jumping all over their car with a gun whose mother, played by Joy Behar, is the one delight of the film.After seeing this wreck, they would have been better off if they never returned from their honeymoon.",Hall Pass
5,jotix100,Rick and Fred's week off,5,29 June 2012,"""Hall Pass"" by the Farrelly brothers is a film that perpetuates the myth about American men not maturing at all, living in fantasy worlds where the most vivid memories were the time spent in high school, when everything was carefree and happy. ""Hall Pass"" is not one of their most inspired comedies, but that seems unfair because most fans are forever comparing any new effort from the brothers to their classic hit ""There's Something About Mary"".The premise here gives us two men, Rick and Fred, who have been married for a while. Their marriages are now at a point where most fail, if not given a breath of fresh air. Which is what Maggie and Grace their wives decide to let them have: a whole week by themselves where the two guys can do whatever they want, get it out of their system, and return home to a much better relationship. The film spends most of the time following Rick and Fred not having fun.It is almost impossible to think Owen Wilson had two movies in 2011 so different from each other as this one and ""Midnight in Paris"", a much serious one, of course. While Mr. Wilson has funny moments, his Rick is basically a serious man, a fish out of the water, left to his own devices. Jason Sudeikis has some good moments. Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate take second seat to their male counterparts.",Hall Pass

The Farrely Brothers are back to true-form in this frequently hilarious comedy about two married buddies (Wilson & Sudeikis having a field day) who are given a quasi 'diplomatic immunity' for a week from their wives (Fischer & Applegate) to endure the titular rite of passage with atypical mix of heart and raunch in the mix from the sibling filmmakers (who collaborated on the script with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett). Best bit – stay for the closing credits for Merchant's pausing to contemplate his wife's suggestion to follow suit.",Hall Pass
7,view_and_review,Farrelly Brothers Rusty,3,12 June 2014,"The Farrelly brothers have some serious hits under their belt: Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal and Stuck on You. They took somewhat of a writing break between Heartbreak Kid and this movie, Hall Pass. I think they got rusty.There was the typical Farrelly humor with strong and explicit sexual references but very little humor beyond that. I don't know if the movie was poorly written, poorly executed or just a bad idea altogether but I did not like it.The cast were A listers: Owen Wilson, Christina Applegate and the up and coming Jason Sudeikis, yet there was no synergy between them. Furthermore, I think Owen Wilson was outside of his element. I don't think Owen Wilson has much range as and actor. Some roles fit him and others don't; this role didn't fit him. I first saw Jason Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses and I was impressed. I don't think he did a bad job in this movie, but I stopped it during the Jason Sudeikis self-pleasuring scene. The movie was already teetering on mediocrity before that and that scene did it for me.The Farrelly brothers are superb writers and I'm sure they'll bounce back, but this was a swing and a miss. Dumb and Dumber To is coming out soon, I really hope they put their all into it to make it as classic as the first.",Hall Pass
8,neil-476,Unlikeable comedy,6,25 March 2011,"The Farelly brothers made Dumb And Dumber, and there is no other movie which has left me in so much pain from laughing after the first time I saw it. And I've also enjoyed their other movies, too. So, while I am under no illusion that anything they present will be the most tasteful movie I've seen, I am hopeful that I will laugh. Well, I did laugh a handful of times, but not much more (in the interests of honesty, there were others in the audience who laughed a lot more than I did).The scenario is quite good enough for a mildly raunchy comedy - two husbands spend rather too much time eyeing attractive women so their wives, feeling stale and middle aged, give them a week's ""hall pass"" to chase women and get it out of their system. Of course, the men are rubbish at it (except by accident) whereas the wives get sniffed around by predatory males without even trying.So far, so good, but I had big problems getting past the extreme stupidity displayed by Fred (Jason Sudeikis). This character does not, at any time, behave in any way like a human male would behave. I could deal with him being crass, boorish, insensitive and so on - that goes with the territory of this sort of movie - but he is simply monumentally, impossibly stupid. Stupidity informs his every action. In Dumb And Dumber, Harry and Lloyd's stupidity was the central conceit on which the movie was based: here, the film is notionally, at least, located in the real world, but Frank is simply not a real world character. If he was, he would never NEVER have landed a catch like Christina Applegate's Grace.Owen Wilson plays - guess what? - Owen Wilson again. Wilson needs to try harder and stretch himself. Or maybe he doesn't, if he's still making the bucks with lazy performances like this. Jenna Fischer is an attractive Maggie. The gorgeous (and, at one point, pleasingly topless)Nicky Whelan is improbably interested in Wilson's character. The usually reliable Richard Jenkins is saddled with a grimly unsympathetic character in Coakley, and plays him very well because I loathed him. Stephen Merchant probably gets the best of the minor characters.There are two faeces jokes - the first was just unpleasant, the second was even more unpleasant but very funny. But, for me, the biggest laugh came when someone punched Sudeikis, and I think this was entirely a reaction to how I felt about the character.",Hall Pass
9,anaconda-40658,This Film Gets a Hall Pass.,8,13 May 2015,"Hall Pass (2011): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate, Richard Jenkins: On the surface it regards revisiting singlehood but what it really appeals is our need of forgiveness. It stars Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis who are both married but extremely lustful when it comes to other women. After an embarrassing house party, their wives give them both a hall pass, which allows them to do as they wish outside the boundaries of marriage. This leads to many hilarious moments as both males repeatedly strike out with various women. We all know where this is headed as well as the reality that even the wives are straying. This is not among the Farrelly brothers best films, which includes Kingpin and There's Something About Mary but it does address a serious issue when it comes to marriage. Wilson and Sudeikis are hilarious in their pursuits that often land them in trouble. Wilson strikes up a connection with a beauty at the local coffee shop, and Sudeikis winds up in a hotel room with a woman who ends up throwing up from the wrong end. Jenna Fischer plays Wilson's wife who is being charmed by an older male from a local baseball team. Christina Applegate plays Sudeikis's wife who becomes the desire from a younger male. Richard Jenkins steals scenes as a lewd friend of the lead characters and was involved in the wedding of the Wilson and Fischer characters. He is also an expert of picking a woman's flaws. It asks all the right questions regarding marriage and infidelity while also factoring in age and maturity. Viewers should allow this film a hall pass into their viewing list. Score: 8 / 10",Hall Pass
10,phd_travel,One of the funnier comedies for the last few years,9,7 April 2011,The premise of a one week break from married life is the story for Hall Pass. The Brothers take a shot married life and succeed. There are many laugh out loud moments almost throughout the movie. It is really the Brothers best in a while. Put it after Something About Mary and Shallow Hal. There is a satisfying story always a moral. It's risqué without being crude even though there is some toilet humor. Also it's never painful to watch. Jokes are fresh and even though you can guess the outcome it's just really enjoyable to see how you get there. It's one of those comedies that is funny even if you watch it a second time because there are so many good lines.With this cast you can't go wrong. Owen is always charmingly droll. He even has a middle aged spread to boot. His awkward dance and pickup moves are endearing. Sudekis is a bit common looking but he's good for the part. Applegate is spot on. She really needs to get more big screen comedic roles - she is so good and very pretty. Fisher is a bit laid back but suitable. There are some familiar Farrelly Bros supporting cast. Some new faces like the Aussie temptation and the babysitter are great too.The visit The Shallow Hal like part in the bar with Richard Jenkins is hilarious. The visit to the new house of their friend is good to.Worth watching - ignore the bad reviews.,Hall Pass
11,zetes,"Has its moments, but otherwise not especially good",6,14 August 2011,"Bobby and Peter Farrelly have had kind of a disappointing career since their first three films (Dumb & Dumber, Kingpin and There's Something About Mary). It's not that they make bad films (except for their remake of The Heartbreak Kid), it's just that they're mediocre to decent. Nothing to write home about, and with no teeth. Even when they do try to do gross-out stuff, it comes off as rather lame. Hall Pass is a pretty forgettable comedy. It has a few good jokes scattered throughout, but it doesn't really feel like anyone was really trying too hard. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star as two married guys whose wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) are getting pretty sick of their constant horniness. They decide to give their husbands a week off of marriage so they can hopefully get it out of their system. The worst thing about the film is that it's predictable. We know from the start that these two guys are both going to get close to getting laid, and then will decide that they love their wives too much to cheat (although I'd like to point out that it's not cheating if their wives give them permission). The film's much more fun when it's just about Wilson and Sudeikis hanging out with their friends (played by Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell and J.B. Smoove). I don't much care for Wilson most of the time, but the other guys are all likable and fun. Sudeikis really owns the movie. His comic timing is excellent. Richard Jenkins also has a fun (though not especially believable) little role as the guys' womanizing, single buddy. The women of the film are unbelievably bitchy. Seriously, these guys never had a real desire to be with other women in the first place. It was all just innocent, harmless fantasies. Maybe if they helped their husbands to ejaculate a little more often they wouldn't be checking out every gal who passes them by. And it doesn't help when they chew them out for an hour after every time it happens, either.",Hall Pass
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hall Pass,9,7 April 2011,"Mention the Farrelly Brothers, and There's Something About Mary springs to mind almost immediately. Known for their rather raunchy brand of comedic films such as The Heartbreak Kid starring Ben Stiller, their latest film Hall Pass takes a dig at stable, married lives by introducing the titular concept of getting a mutually agreed upon break from marriage to do anything you please. Anything. And to the average Joe, this probably means to boldly go hook up with members of the opposite sex, getting drunk and wasted, and more. Or is it?I cannot answer on behalf of married men out there, but surely the thought of this is pretty enticing, with family responsibilities shelved aside of course and the shackles to commitment being broken. But for best friends Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis), having a six day pass in their hands as given by their wives Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) respectively means a window of so many opportunities being opened, one doesn't know where to start, as the days zip by one by one in episodic fashion that counts down the type of shenanigans the guys get themselves into. One thing's for sure though, trying too hard brings about plenty of laughter, though I can feel for the challenges faced when being rejected left, right and center. being toothless, domesticated predators thrown into the wild to seek out easy prey ripe for the picking.As an adult oriented comedy, expect the usual bag of jokes that stem from rude lines of dialogue (insulting an uppity mutual friend and his family got brownie points), plenty of bodily fluids released on screen (you will never forget that scene with the girl at the edge of the bathtub), enough body parts on display including male genitalia, and sometimes plain slapstick action, but don't judge me when I say I enjoyed almost every single joke that made it through, right up until the end of the credits - so don't leave your seat just yet when the credits start to roll.But those looking for a raunchy good time as the Farrelly's are known for, may find this film a wee bit disappointing, as much as how one character lamented that in a group gathering that they aren't seeing enough woman action since they're but a bunch of dudes getting together talking about geeky stuff. And in essence, this film does feel that way, even hitting one for the other side. You may think that a Hall Pass means a guy given the permission to do as he pleases, but the truth is that it works both ways as well, with the wives also enjoying some time off with some jocks, and this forms the other half of the equation in the film, which actually has a lot more provocative issues thrown into the works that make the men's shenanigans look like child's play.It's a very different Owen Wilson role here, as his usual characters usually have him in a cavalier sort of demeanour and being the chief jokester. Here, the first thing you'll notice is the very prim and proper hairdo he gets as Rick, and really toning down the alpha male aspects to become the meek and mild mannered man having absolutely no idea how to live up to his fantasies. Taking over as chief prankster is Jason Sudeikis who shows that he can hold his own in what would be a typical Owen Wilson shoo in as Fred, the man who thinks he has everything figured out, not. The pair when they come together create some comedic magic, but the best of the lot would be when Richard Jenkins enters the fray as their womanizing mentor Coakley, which is the most entertaining character in the film, with Jenkins completely playing against type, and is one of the prime reasons to sit through this comedy.True that it's probably due to age that I'm beginning to find comedies which have middle aged characters entering a crisis a lot more appealing, perhaps reflecting and addressing similar anxieties I can identify with from time to time, so much so that I'll put this as one of the best comedies of the year thus far, that is recommended for viewing. And stay put while the end credits roll, as you'll be richly rewarded with two additional hilarious clips.",Hall Pass
13,namashi_1,A Decent Flick...,6,5 June 2011,"The Farrelly Brothers are some talented names. Their body of work, includes cult-classics, that remain popular amongst, almost, all age groups. I personally am a fan of theirs, and 'Hall Pass', which is co-written, produced & directed by them, is a decent flick, that manages some earnest laughs in the goings-on.'Hall Pass' stars Owen Wilson & Jason Sudeikis, who show their wives restlessness at home, so much, their wives grant them a ""hall pass,"" one week of freedom to do whatever they want... no questions asked.The idea is interesting and funny, and the Screenplay by Bobby & Peter Farrelly, Pete Jones & Kevin Barnett, succeeds by holding your interest in the first hour and brings in a host of good jokes. The second hour, loses grip and reaches to a not-so funny climax. The Writing in the second hour, definitely could have been much better.The Farrelly Brothers have directed the film nicely. Cinematography is up-to the mark, while the Editing is average. Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson is superb. He looks the part and delivers in every sequence. Jason Sudeikis is alright. Jenna Fischer is very good. Christina Applegate also does well. Richard Jenkins is Fantastic in a brief role. Alexandra Daddario is adequate. Others lend good support.On the whole, Though not Hilarious, this comedy still manages some genuine laughs, that make you laugh even after your done watching it.",Hall Pass
14,JamesHitchcock,"That Contradiction in Terms, a Family Values Gross-Out Comedy",4,21 September 2021,"This is one of those American films which should really have been retitled for its release in the UK, ""hall pass"" not being an expression widely used in British English. In American usage it means a note giving a student permission to be outside the classroom, and metaphorically can be used to describe a situation where something is permitted that would not normally be allowed. Since this film came out in 2011, it has also been used to mean an agreement between the partners to a marriage or romantic relationship that one or both of them may have sex with other people.Rick and Fred are best friends and married men in their late thirties or early forties. Both are having difficulty in their marriages and are nostalgic for their carefree single days, so their wives, Maggie and Grace, give them a ""hall pass"" for a week during which they can have sex with other women. Without mentioning this to Rick and Fred, Maggie and Grace also give themselves ""hall passes"" to have sex with other men. The film then explores the complications which arise from this situation.""Hall Pass"" was produced and directed by the Farrelly brothers, so I should have known what to expect. Like every other film of theirs which I have seen, it is a crude gross-out comedy with plenty of sexual and scatological humour, most of it involving grown men behaving like sniggering adolescents. (Or perhaps I should have written ""humour"" as I generally find this sort of thing relentlessly unfunny). The ""Daily Telegraph"" named it as one of the ten worst films of 2011, implying that there were nine others equally bad, something which does not bode well for the film industry. It also said ""Hall Pass is outright hideous and also embarrassing, like a creepy uncle sporting a backwards baseball cap and cracking bad, lewd jokes for the under-thirties. At a funeral.""I would not dissent from that damning judgement. Yet at least ""Hall Pass"" is not as bad as the last Farrelly film I reviewed on this site, ""The Heartbreak Kid"". That film was not just crude and lavatorial but also nasty, misogynistic and mean-spirited. And, surprisingly, ""Hall Pass"" turns out to be none of those things. It is that contradiction in terms, a family values gross-out comedy. Although Rick has the chance of sex with two very attractive women, he turns both of them down, realising that it is Maggie whom he loves all along. Maggie too realises that she loves Rick too much to take advantage of her ""hall pass"". As for Fred and Grace, they do cheat on one another, but even they are eventually reconciled, and all ends happily in the best rom-com style. Are the Farrellys going soft in their old age? 4/10. (One mark higher than ""The Heartbreak Kid"").",Hall Pass
15,StevePulaski,Might be passed up with hefty comedy competition in 2011,8,27 February 2011,"It's been four years since The Farrelly Brothers' forgettable remake of The Heartbreak Kid had it's brief run in the theaters, now we have a much funnier film called Hall Pass about Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis) who are given a week off from marriage from their wives Maggie (Fischer) and Grace (Applegate). The week is anticipated to be one of the best weeks of their lives, but ends up being a slow and dull weekend of failed attempts to meet women.The Farrelly Brothers, I assume, are trying to make a point that when women separate from their men they have a lot of fun socializing, and having a rule-free week. When men separate from their wives their afraid to make the slightest commitment with a girl because of their wives' reaction. Even though they say ""rule-free"" we can pretty much all assume ""rule-free within their guidelines."" Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis have a very humorous chemistry on screen, and Christina Applegate is not only beautiful, but a pleasure to have assisting the leads as well. Knowing The Farrelly's you are sure to have a lot of gross out humor in this movie, and boy you do! Some hit hard, but some fall flat.My favorite character in this whole film is Larry Joe Campbell who plays Hog Head. He is without a doubt hysterical as he plays the dopey fat guy who gets into trouble along with the guys on their week off. He reminds me of my own father, and every scene he was in I found myself laughing. Too bad he didn't replace Sudeikis in the film so I could laugh more and give this film a higher rating, but oh well.The big problem with this film is not that not all the jokes are funny, that the drama element at the ends sort of ruins the outrageous comedy film the movie had going, but the fact that it's February and a movie like this is coming out. It's a strange complaint, but it must be stated, comedies like this are meant for the summer season or the fall season so that it has a bigger chance of making the top list of favorite comedies on critic's lists.This year especially with huge competition with The Hangover Part II being released. Hall Pass should've benefited itself by waiting till around August to be released. With it being released so early in the year it will likely suffer treatment like Book of Eli and Fired Up with being released so early they are questioned by people in later months.Hall Pass hits us with some very strong laughs, but ultimately it still doesn't blow us away. I would've liked more of the guys, less of the wives, and more of Larry Joe Campbell. You can't always get what you want, but in Hall Pass it delivers most of what you would want in an outrageous comedy.Starring: Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate, and LArry Joe Campbell. Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly.",Hall Pass
16,KineticSeoul,"Passable as a TV show, but as a movie it's below mediocre",4,3 July 2011,"This movie would be passable as a TV show, but as a movie it is below average. The plot is basically this, the wives give there husband a hall pass, which means they are giving them a week to do whatever they want with other women without consequences. So the premise might seem somewhat okay, but the direction of it all is like watching a episode of a TV show. So is how the character interact with each other, it's just not believable at all. The constant sexual jokes weren't funny maybe worth a few chuckle at best and the direction was just too predictable for the most part. As much as how ridiculous this movie is, nothing got my attention. Most of way through the grown ups just act completely immature, which is fine if it's funny but it's simply not. This movie is just bland and doesn't pull any creative punches, for this movie it would have been better if there was more crazy and wild elements that can shock the viewers a bit but that doesn't even happen. The movie just seem to go in a very simple direction and not in a good way either, even the dialogue seemed cheap. This isn't a terrible adult comedy but isn't great either.4.2/10",Hall Pass
17,Hellmant,Doesn't live up to the Farrelly Brother's glory days but it's still a pretty funny and effective comedy.,7,11 March 2011,"'HALL PASS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The Farrelly Brothers are well past their prime. Now in their 50's, they're much older than when they first broke on the scene with 'DUMB & DUMBER' seventeen years ago and had their biggest box office hit in 'THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' thirteen years ago. They've lost some of their edge over the years, as well as originality, and now they've disguised this well intentioned tribute to the values of love and marriage as a guys gone wild party film. They're films have always had heart though and this film still has plenty of dick and fart jokes. The trailers may be misleading and it may not live up to their best films but it's a decent comedy flick with enough good laughs to please most Farrelly fans.The film stars Owen Wilson (who's past his prime as well) and Jason Sudeikis (of 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' fame) as two married men who are given a week pass to pretend like their not married and sleep with as many girls as they want. Their wives, played by Jenna Fischer (of 'THE OFFICE') and Christina Applegate, think that if they let their sex obsessed husbands get it out of their system their marriages might be better off because of it. They also realize, as the men do not, that they're not the guys they used to be and will most likely fail at picking up the young hot girls they think they can get (and it's definitely a challenge for them). Things get complicated when the women are hit on by other men while their husbands are out trying to get laid by other women.The film is directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly and written by the two as well as Kevin Barnett and Pete Jones (who the Farrelly Brothers purchased the original script from back in 2005). Pete Jones was the first winner of the Project Greenlight film project and his films before this have both been religious themed. So it's no surprise that the film has a very pro-marriage conservative message. I personally liked the theme of the movie and the characters and about half the jokes. Some jokes of course fall flat and some of the emotional drama is a little over done as well. Of course parts of the film are over the top but that's to be expected. Wilson and especially Sudeikis are great in the leads and the supporting cast is all impressive as well (including Richard Jenkins, Stephen Merchant and the beautiful Nicky Whelan). It's not quite as hilarious as the films from the Farrelly Brother's glory days but it's still a pretty funny and effective comedy.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",Hall Pass
18,thesar-2,This Hall Gets a SLIGHT Pass,4,22 April 2013,"I understand a lot of comedies of the past decade practically force you to stay through the credits to see additional comedic scenes and/or outtakes. It's pretty sad, though, when Hall Pass's only laugh out loud moment is in said end-credit scene. (Note: I'm referring to ""The Next Hall Pass"" person. I have to specify since there are three separate end-credit segments.)This is not to say there were other funny bits throughout, and there were, but nothing that made me truly laugh hard. In fact, for the most part, I questioned this as a comedy and more of a drama.Married buddies with a severe case of Wandering Eye syndrome get a ""hall pass"" from their wonderful, beautiful and fed up wives for one week – or so. This is to say, the wives and children, if any, vacate for several consecutive days and the boys can be boys in any way possible. Oddly, they continued to work this week, when it would've been a sure week-off for me had I been given that chance and in this situation.At any rate, the boys act even more foolish when they're given their freedom than when they were ""restricted"" in marriage. They failed to learn the obvious reason they were so tempted and other females were so attracted to them prior to the Hall Pass: they were unattainable. Anyone that is ""taken,"" per se, or in some cases, heterosexual and the wanting party is homosexual, they're high on the list of attraction. Rabbit and the Dog, if you will.Will the duo stay faithful? Or even, will their wives, as they, too, are on ""a break""? After over a 100 minutes – depending upon which home video version you watch – you may think you know where this is going, but I actually was surprised a bit.So, the movie gets some kudos for some good twists I didn't foretell, but overall the movie was somewhat uneven and the laughs were probably for a more specific audience than I. I like these guys, these actors, especially the women halves, but damn, it just wasn't that funny.I wouldn't say the movie was a waste, but it certainly could've been re-written a few more times and cut down to a good 90 minute comedy movie standard. Luckily, Luke Wilson, one of two boys, has enough charisma to carry me, as did Jenna Fischer. But, if you're looking for less drama and more comedy, look elsewhere.",Hall Pass

20,paul2001sw-1,The Farelly brothers hit middle age,6,5 June 2011,"'Hall Pass' is not as purely funny as the Farelly brothers's best-loved film, 'There's Something About Mary'; but it's in a similar tradition, combining gross-out comedy with a sentimental undertow. Unlike the majority of mainstream Hollywood romantic comedy, it works because the brothers are actually interested in how real people are, whereas the generic blockbuster has a tediously standard plot and set of motivations behind a very thin veneer of particularity. By contrast, aspects of 'Hall Pass' that feel true to life, and acutely observed - the fact that the heroes emphatically don't end up in bed with the most beautiful girls in the room is (sadly) a recommendation in itself compared with the orthodox rom-com. Even Owen Wilson, who usually makes me want to punch the screen, is watchable in this. But at the same time, it's all a little lightweight; certainly for the male characters, who quickly discover they don't really want their freedom and who therefore have relatively little at stake as the plot unfolds. Amusing but slightly bland, maybe the brothers, like their characters, are simply reaching middle-age.",Hall Pass

Two scenes really fit this definition. First, Owen Wilson is saved from a hot tub after falling asleep by a black and a white guy, whom are naked. And the movie leaves little to the imagination and really plays are the stereotype. Second scene involves a woman Jason Sudeikis brings back to the hotel room. She's drunk and wants to vomit; however, something comes out of the wrong end.The whole premise of the movie is two guys, Rick and Fred, are given hall passes by their wives, mainly because the wives are tired of them oogling other woman. So, they tell them they can do what they want for a week, even if that includes cheating. What they didn't count on was whom would be doing the cheating. Because it doesn't take long to see that these 40 year old guys know nothing about how to pick up woman now days. And a lot of the jokes are them with their other guy friends saying they are going to do this and that but they never do it. And then unbelievably, Rick has the hot blonde coffee girl through herself at him, but he doesn't take her up on it.

I almost skipped this movie because of the bad things I was hearing about it. But because it has Owen Wilson starring and that talented Farrelly Brothers at the helm, I decided to give this film a shot. There are better R-rated comedies out there, but this still is a respectable one with lots of funny and dramatic moments.This film is about two friends who are given hall passes from their wives. That pretty much means they can do whatever they want as they get a week off from their marriages. But will they be doing the right thing?.....Owen Wilson always gives off a certain charm no matter what movie he is in. He played more of the straight-laced guy here but he still was good. I think Jason Sudekis will be a big comedy star because he had some really funny moments.Overall, Hall Pass is another good entry in the R-rated comedy category of which 2011 was famous for. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. There are a few stretches that are meant to be funny but really are not. But, most comedies are like that. I rate this film 8/10.",Hall Pass

What starts off as a blessing soon becomes more then they can handle. I was not sure what to fully expect from this movie. I expected funny but I was ready for disappointment. I was wrong. This is a laugh-out-loud movie from start to finish. Very raunchy in parts, but it is a Farrelly Brothers movie so that is expected. The casting is great and Wilson and Sudeikis do a great job of playing off each other. I do have to say that Richard Jenkins (not really known for comedic roles) is the perfect choice for his part and almost steals the movie from everyone. This is the funniest comedy to be released in a long time. While it does have a few serious moments it is more consistently funny the ""The Dilemma"" and even more so then ""Just Go With It"". Owen Wilson is back to ""Wedding Crashers"" form and it is great to see him be that funny again, it's been a while. This is a definite must see and you will laugh so hard your face will hurt.

26,Floated2,More of a light drama than comedy,3,8 September 2013,"Going into Hall Pass I did not know much but the thin premise and I decided to watch to see how it was. The film is about two best friends whose wives gives them a ""hall pass"" to do whatever they want for a week. This means that the two leads (Owen Wilson & Jason Sudeikis) do the basic comedy routine and lean towards each other. While the film happens, they both rent rooms in hotels and the drama begins. Hall Pass is targeted as a comedy however the film deals more with personal issues causing it to be a drama. I hardly found anything funny within the film, other then the typical chemistry. No laughs were found and it shows a steep fall for the directors (Farelly brothers).What holds this film back is the characters and the overall plot direction. The leads were not that interesting for us the audience to really care what they get into. However when we do start to care, the directors tone down the characters and they get soft. The film has been compared to Due Date (which I think that is far better simply because of the chemistry of the characters).The film is called Hall Pass yet when Wilson finally get into a situation leading him to get the girl we see him turn her away. Sudeikis and his wife however get there but we aren't as interested. The ending left me feeling off because it was predictable and a typical happy ending. There could have been more added on. Overall Hall Pass does not provide laughs, it is more of a drama but offers a somewhat interesting premise. 3/10. As a rewatch 08/29/19' Hall Pass offers and interesting concept although unlikely but overall there are some decent moments but nothing really funny. Rather a forgettable film.",Hall Pass

During that week, the two friends discover that it is not as easy as they thought it would be. Although someone wouldn't expect much from a movie such as Hall pass, the final result is disappointing. The humor is a little bit rough, and even though some scenes are actually funny, the movie isn't satisfying. The story lucks of creativity and originality, the romance doesn't add anything to the film, and however talented the actors are, the chemistry between them was zero.

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Middle-aged romance and Farrelly Brothers shock humor doesn't quite gel,4,26 February 2011,"Some things don't belong together. Most people, I think, would put human defecation and married couples rekindling their romance in that category. Just don't tell the Farrelly Brothers that, because such things are their bread and butter and they've slathered it up again for ""Hall Pass.""Two best buds, Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (SNL's Jason Sudeikis), have lust and female anatomy on the brain, like all men stuck in good but stale marriages, and their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) have gotten tired of it. A friend suggests the ladies let go of the leash by giving their husbands a ""hall pass,"" or a week off from marital obligations, including fidelity. Rick believes this might be some kind of tactic, but Fred convinces him to take advantage of it. Soon, the two set off to score chicks only to find they're not any bit near as capable as they might have been during their formative years.Perhaps the Farrellys felt the pressure to give in to the ""middle-aged married couples talking openly about sex"" wave of R-rated comedy. The film feels as if it has an obligation to be meaningful and make a statement about love. That's not the problem; there are some genuinely realistic and almost heartwarming moments in the film regarding its romance parts. The trouble comes when the Farrellys aim for big laughs, because their strength does not lie in weaving comedy into a romance, but manipulating a story to set up moments of raucous laughter. Those moments feel disjointed and these pivotal jokes don't pack the punch they used to back in the days of ""There's Something About Mary."" Comedy evolves faster than cell phones these days and the Farrellys have only proved they can't exactly keep up.Among the few things they understand perfectly is middle aged men trying to act cool; kudos to Owen Wilson for breaking his ""free-spirited sexual hippie and/or moron"" type casting and pulling off the awkward family man with zero sense of style or any semblance of ""game."" He and Sudeikis in their tucked-in Hawaiian shirts among other things successfully prove the Farrellys' hypothesis that 40-year-old married men suffer nothing short of de- masculinization after 15-20 years of marriage. Unfortunately, this frighteningly realistic portrait factors minimally into the film's entertainment value.More effective are a select group of gags and some extraneous characters. Richard Jenkins, for example, steals countless laughs as a friend of Rick and Fred's who still attracts the ladies over the years because he knows all the secrets. Outside of Jenkins, the Farrellys seem to have trouble grasping the idea that well-crafted characters and mindful casting can elevate humor much more naturally. Instead, you've got guys such as Larry Joe Campbell crapping in a sand trap.Shock gags like that simply doesn't work anymore. Audiences aren't surprised much these days, but that apparently hasn't discouraged the Farrellys or sent them back to the drawing board. Instead, their thought process says ""ok, we just have to go bigger and dirtier next time."" I'd like to give them credit for sticking to their guns and doing what they know, but it taints ""Hall Pass,"" which might have otherwise been a fairly (Farrelly?) decent movie.Honestly, the Farrellys, being about that age themselves, have an intuitive understanding of middle-aged guys and this makes the pathetic escapades of Rick and Fred appear to have some actual intention. Their ""failures"" coupled with the Farrelly's ""Law and Order"" inspired title cards for each day of the hall pass make for the funniest parts of the movie and give it a vague sense of depth, but they can hardly outshine a slow beginning, forced antics and tired shock humor.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Hall Pass

The conversations, the jealously and the hall pass week deliver some few (very few) laughs to the spectator. But it entertains and passes a good message about love, so that's why I consider it more romance.

40,eric262003,Delightful to Some Extent,7,26 December 2011,"Comedies can be very unpredictable at times. It can manipulate you into a corner where they make out as if it's a great movie. Only to find out it was really dumb. Other times they'll com you into assuming it's repugnant and morally reprehensible only to find out in the end it's subliminally complex. ""Hall Pass"" falls in the latter category. The story is about as simple as screwing on a light bulb. Two middle-aged husbands (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) are granted ""hall passes"" from their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) which mean they are permitted one week freedom from parenthood. The predictable hoopla comes into place including those annoying catcalls to attractive women; morally deplorable juvenile gags, disgusting jokes around the male anatomy; lots of tiresome boozing and alcoholic binges and the overdone finale where our protagonist begs for redemption and usually has to make compromises in which they gladly oblige.But in a mysterious way, ""Hall Pass"" succeeds in offering something original behind the formulaic proceedings. Because not only do the guys get a week of parental liberty, so do their wives, which is a surprising turn of events that develops in this movie. Sure it's not a ground-breaking Oscar caliber movie, but it's still something that the Farrelly Brothers can be proud of as it's one of their best movie since ""Wedding Crashers"" which also starred Wilson and Vince Vaughn. It's not or ever will revolutionize the buddy film spectrum as the repetitive scenarios are all there. However, this film exceeds it's expectations from the comedy genre that most films of it's kind tends to fall flat.For one thing, the casting was very top notch. Owen Wilson's comical chops is in top form, as he soars through every scene he's in and never falls flat. Jason Sudeikis has his share of moments, although his character was at times hit or miss due to poor script work from his character. The wives roles add inspiration towards their performances as comedic legends Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate was a joy to watch and even as emotional traits that are often missing from female characters in comedy movies. Sure Applegate has played several roles like this before, but she shows here she can turn up the volume and show her dramatic side as well. What really sets this film is how it makes a serious undertaking of the trials and tribulations of being middle-aged. These characters aren't young punks placing their cajones in a hot dessert, no these people are career-oriented individuals, people who have matured physically and mentally, dads who have been through it all and who have seen it all.

Will they cheat, or stay faithful to their wives? It's been awhile since the Farrelly brothers have had a successful and genuinely funny film on their hands. I have to say this is their funniest movie since 2000's Me, Myself & Irene. For the last decade it seems the brother have hit an unfunny streak. The 90's were their time to shine and they did, they had classics like Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary. Hall Pass, even though it's not great, is an attempt to go back to their roots. They tried this with their last film The Heartbreak Kid, but that film was a failure. Hall Pass has an absurd premise that can only end with both couple thinking something bad has happened with their spouse and then realizing that nothing has and they love each other. You know this before even going into the film, so why see it if you know the outcome? Well, for one thing you'll want to see how crazy these two guys can get. Secondly it's a starring vehicle for Sudeikis who needs a breakout hit. The end result of Hall Pass is a lot of funny jokes and a lot of unfunny jokes. It's a mixed bag, but one that I appreciate and like better than anything the directors have done in the past decade. Wilson plays his usual self, throws in some funny comments here and there, nothing more. He's the everyday man and Sudeikis is the funny one. He has all the best lines and shines more out of the two. Stephen Merchant on the other hand, who plays one of their best friends is the funniest one in the whole movie. He's only in a handful of scenes, but he's the funniest guy in all of them. The biggest laughs will probably come after the credits roll. Christina Applegate and Jenna Fischer are the wives. They don't get a lot of comedic time, instead they get the roles of the woman who know all the trick the men try and play. They are more empowered here than the men, until the end when one of them fails to be faithful. Both characters are played by funny comedic women, but they are never given the chance to show their talents. This was more of a showcase for the guys.

I just can't relate to guys who are that whipped. It's normal to look at attractive members of the opposite sex, (or the same sex, if you happen to be gay) the problem comes when you are motivated to do more than look, and that impulse stems from repressing the urge to ogle. This applies to both males and females. As the saying goes; there's nothing wrong with looking at the menu, as long as you don't order from it (this is in a monogamous relationship) ... and what married guy feels that embarrassed about masturbating that he takes it outside to the car, away from his wife?! I would have thought the wife would be glad he was taking matters into his own hands (*cough*) since it spares her the onus of being involved that night, if she wasn't in the mood. Yes; I know it's a comedy... but isn't the best comedy where you laugh in recognition of things that have happened to you, or that you know have happened to other people? The Farrelly Brothers have been operating in the territory of 'gimmick comedy' for a while now - they seem content to coast by, using ideas and situations that are too outlandish to make any sense. For all of their gross out and slapstick content, there was a kind of purity in their movies dating back to the likes of ""There's Something About Mary"", because the laughs were rooted in a basic humanity. For the last few films now, all they've been doing is studying caricatures, and that's just absurd, not chucklesome.The few genuine jokes that make it into this movie are tired old puns that would've been dated in the 70's.

While I think one scene in particular will be debated on a lot it has nothing to do with the main premise. So in opinion pretty useless.Below average comedy for me. Give this one a miss!",Hall Pass
46,oneguyrambling,The only thing sadder than 40 y.o. horny teens are those that find this hilarious.,5,23 July 2011,"The Farrelly Brothers rose to prominence in the 90s by deliberately railing against PC sensibilities in the name of comedy.They poked fun at the handicapped (There's something about Mary), showed animals being abused (Me, Myself and Irene – a cow is beaten extensively and refused to die, a chicken is used with such force that death may have been a relief), obesity (Shallow Hal), more handicap issues (Stuck on You) and the good old fashioned punchlines the Amish (Kingpin).Throw in some profanity and a few dick and fluid jokes and you've got yourself a high grossing comedy son.But the 90s ticked over into the 2000s and the PC regime got so powerful that now we can't laugh at that stuff anymore – even if it's funny. So the last decade have seen the Farrelly's lose their 'edge. Sure the dick and fluid jokes remain, and you can curse and flash a tittie for effect, but all that only goes so far and Hall Pass is a prime example.Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) are not handicapped, they aren't unfortunate, they aren't even abnormal. They both hold good white collar jobs, have loving wives – Maggie (Jenna Fisher) and Grace (Christina Applegate). Rick is a good father to two great kids.The guy's only 'crime' is being in their early 40s and feeling perhaps that youth has passed them by. Life has become shameful alone moments and a series of failed marital conquests.After not one. Not Two. But THREE! Wacky coincidences that lead to being overheard or (more pathetically) 'over-seen', cue up the laugh track when the wives decide that they have had enough of the ogling and faux ""If I only had the chance"" misguided machismo and give their husbands the titular 'week off from marriage' with zero strings attached and no repercussions.This leads to an hour or so of the standard 'guys trying to get laid in zany ways' situations with the Farrelly staples of fluids, genitals and potty talk. The guys go to the gym, clubbing and for a 'massage' and are embarrassed and publicly humiliated at every turn.Hall Pass is one of those films where there are 5 or 6 primary characters, and for the week in question it seems that every time Rick or Fred do something silly or potentially embarrassing – which being in a Farrelly film means every seven minutes or so – those same characters are there just in time to witness it and be suitably appalled.Meanwhile the wives have departed for the week to give the guys their space, but they aren't spending the week doing crosswords and drinking tea I laughed out loud twice during Hall Pass, once at the delivery of the word ""Clones"" (you'll have to watch the film for the context) and once when a peripheral character played by Stephen Merchant gets his own fantasy sequence during the credits.That's not to say they didn't try to wring every single chuckle from the premise, it's just most of them were contrived or didn't work so well. The problem is aside from a seedy older 'pick-up svengali' that the guys consult later in the film most of the characters are depressingly one note or worse – just nice.When you take out the middle ground of being able to extract easy jokes from easy targets the Farrelly's only have so much room to move. What is left is a film that is half poop and sex jokes and half middle aged moralling and posturing. That doesn't average out to a good film, merely some 'smut for chuckles' sake' in between boring bits.Oh, and having two guys married to gorgeous 30 something women – who also treat them well – makes it hard (and baffling) for the audience to hope that they head out and tag everything that moves for a week.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Hall Pass is supposed to be hilarious because it has middle aged guys running around like horny teenagers, but this stuff is just funnier and more guilt free when it is left to the 20 something idiots.",Hall Pass
47,napierslogs,A stupid sex comedy that is funny and heartfelt enough to be decent,6,22 June 2011,"""From the directors of There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber."" Right there on the poster they are telling you this is going to be a stupid comedy about sex. But I would go so far as to say that the movie actually deserves more credit than that. Stupid? Yes. Funny? Yes. About sex? More or less, but's it's also about marriage in a very heartfelt way.The plot is as stupid as they get, with grown men acting immature and getting a week off from marriage. I did not want to see it. Earlier this year, ""The Freebie"" took a similar premise but turned it into a very thoughtful drama. ""Hall Pass"" is not thoughtful, but they did take that premise and turn it into something that is funny, heartfelt and almost meaningful.The movie mostly succeeded because the men, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis, were not just sex-obsessed, but also considerate and loving fathers and husbands, or at least Owen Wilson was. There was a charm and a likability factor that I was not expecting. The women weren't as nice but they did develop into more accepting people.""Hall Pass"" isn't hilarious, but it is funny enough. It also isn't intelligent or thoughtful, but it does have warmth and heart. It's a decent foray into the middle-aged, suburban, male sex comedy.",Hall Pass
48,Karl Self,"Finally, a worthy Farrelly Bros movie",7,28 January 2013,"In between the plainly failed ""Heartbreak Kid"" and the so-so ""Three Stooges"", the Farrellys came up with a movie that at least bears their hallmark style, and has its comedic moments. If you like their original work, then ""Hall Pass"" is the kind of movie that you won't regret watching, and it will amuse you. Although Farrelly fans wouldn't have minded finally seeing a movie where the brothers have done one even better than ""There's Something About Mary"" -- and sadly, this isn't it. Ideally, the entire movie would have been in the style and pace of the truly hilarious postquel -- I mean, the short flick with Kathy Gifford during the end title sequence.The movie starts out kinda slow and too cute -- two family men truly love their picture-perfect wives, but they can't help occasionally ogling the odd young chick. Their wives decide to give them a ""hall pass"", i. e. ""one week off from marriage"", where they are free to pursue their sexual aspirations. Then, party time? Of course, the two staid, pot-bellied hubbies are not exactly the carnal predators they were in their college days (or, more to the point, like to imagine themselves to have been), and marital bliss eventually ensues. With a few twists.",Hall Pass

50,Ruskington,"Please retire Owen Wilson, please",2,30 April 2020,"I honestly have no idea why Owen Wilson continues to get roles in movies. Has there ever been a more pathetic actor to feature regularly in Hollywood productions? Aside from having the most punchable face and irritating voice in the world of cinema, he is also one of the least funny actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Jason Sudeikis is not much better- another pound shop Vince Vaughn with an inexplicably long CV.What this films lacks in comedy, it makes up for in sexism. The whole 'useless dependant male' trope has been horribly overcooked in films like this and just needs to be discarded. The toilet humour and cheap sex jokes are also out in force and the delivery is so weak it seems even these dreadful actors are growing tired of it. On top of all this putrid nonsense, we have an incredibly predictable ending that cannot come quickly enough. I write this more in frustration than contempt as I actually like goofy comedy when it is done well. But each year the offerings become increasingly cheap and vulgar, with less ingenuity, less creativity and a painful recycling of the same old frat-pack 'actors'.",Hall Pass
51,Christian_Dimartino,The Farrelly brothers best movie in nearly ten years.,8,4 March 2011,"The Farrelly brothers return to their old form, like with The Heartbreak kid, with Hall pass. Hall pass is a film about the battle of the sexes, and how the women have dominated. Hall pass has gross out humor, like many of their films, but its their funniest since Me, myself and Irene.The films heroes are Rick(Owen Wilson) and Fred(Jason Sudekis), two middle aged married men who haven't been getting a lot of action lately. So, after an embarrassing moment at a party, their wives(Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) are persuaded into giving them 2 weeks off of marriage. Free to do whatever they want, no rules.The idea sounds great to them. But the truth is, both them and their friends are lame dorks who haven't hit on chicks for a while. So, it's kind of a challenge. As for the women, who also decide to do it at the spur of the moment, its easier.Hall pass has some gross moments. I actually screamed in the theater at one point. But most of the time its hilarious. I like The Farrelly Brother's films, most the time. They've done some bad, but mostly good. They directed some of the funniest movies i've ever seen, such as Dumb and dumber and There's something about Mary.I did enjoy their last gross fest, The Heartbreak kid. But this film is funnier. It has a better message, instead of a somewhat grim one. I laughed out loud many times during Hall pass. It's the funniest film i've seen in a while, and its good to have the brothers back.B+",Hall Pass

I must say that the safe room scene was freaking hilarious.It's a lowball flick with Owen Wilson pulling an acceptable performance and Jason Sudeikis playing on par for his style.

56,LloydBayer,Wait for about 30 seconds at the end credits for the funniest scene in the movie.,6,17 June 2011,"There are chick flicks and there are guy flicks. This movie falls heavily into the latter category. Most guys will go through this movie with intermittent chuckles and occasional bouts of hysterics. Women won't. Not only will they find this unfunny, some women may even find this offensive, in that female characters are mostly portrayed as objects of sexual gratification, while others are not given any more importance other than their home-making capacities.From the scripting to the final production, this is a Farrelly Brother's movie, through and through. There used to be a time when a Farrelly Brothers movie was all the rage. Although ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb & Dumber"" were instant hits, these were overly enjoyed by the college going fraternity. When ""Stuck on You"" and ""Shallow Hall"" were released, the Farrellys were already loosing-out to a growing Jud Apataw audience. Apataw perfected the Farelly Brother's slap-stick mechanism while refining sexual humour. As such, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Pineapple Express"" revamped the slap-stick agenda in comedy. But if the Farrellys can help it, as it seems.Rick and Fred are married men in their early forties. But being that men will always be men, they can't help ogling over younger women. While they think they have an excuse for this, their wives Maggie and grace know better. As the story progresses, Rick and Fred's mental fantasies are no match for their wives' increasing annoyance, until the day they are each given a 'Hall Pass'. As the title suggests, and exasperated by their husbands, Maggie and Grace allow their husbands one week of freedom from marriage in the assumption their spouses will be good as new after a week, while rejuvenating their marriage in the bargain. Wrong move. Let me say that before you start getting any ideas.This rest of the movie is side-splitting comedy, for some. The rest will hate it. I, for one, found myself chuckling to the end, and then I had to roll on the floor gasping for breath. While Rick and Fred's adventures begin on the first day of 'freedom', their not so fortunate buddies join in on the fun, which ultimately adds to the laughter factor.From their perspective, Bobby and Peter Farelly have thrown in some comic elements. As such, what really makes the movie lighter than it is are a couple of forty-something men trying to get back in the game, the unnerving clutches of their wives, their foolhardy frat-pack and for good measure, a nympho cougar and the slight case of a psychotic ex-boyfriend. While all these add to the laughter, the undeniable Farelly trademark is etched into the script. For some, this is could be a turn-off, but be prepared for some shocking, albeit, gross-out moments.While umpteen other actors could have played the lead roles, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis do a decent job as men with haunting mojos. Although Wilson is predictable as Fred, Sudeikis is a welcome change and has the better one-liners between the two. Playing their nagging and ever watchful wives are Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate. Comparing the wives, Applegate's Grace has some of the better scenes as Fred's wife. Aside from these four, the film benefits from a huge line-up, including but not limited to Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell, Nicky Whelan and Derek Waters as a psycho with cameos from Alyssa Milano and Richard Jenkins.Hall Pass can be compared to a lot of movies. By saying that, I don't mean this film lacks originality; rather, it is more like American Pie for the older generation or The Hangover for married men. Now, and I say this again, you may find some repulsive moments, but if you take this film at face value, it's all about having a few laughs, which you will find as you go along.As with most comedies these days, wait for about 30 seconds once the end credits roll up for one last but ultra hilarious scene, thanks to Stephen Merchant; the only British character in the movie. If you didn't laugh through the movie, Merchant will do you in.",Hall Pass

58,nickmesafilms,"Hall Pass (2011) - Oh, Farrelly Brothers, What the Hell Were You Thinking?",2,20 December 2011,"The Farrelly Brothers (Peter and Bobby) were once talented comedy directors that made some of the more better comedies from ""There's Something About Mary"" to ""Me, Myself, and Irene"". But now, their newest creation, ""Hall Pass"", is one of those excuses for filmmaking where the audience is left thinking: ""Oh my god, this is ridiculous!"". Were these two brothers hungover, and decided to write a sex comedy? Now, I'm a huge fan of both Jason Sudeikis and Owen Wilson, but I can't believe that these two talented comedians would team up with two talented directors, to create a piece of lazy, unfunny junk. Wilson and Sudeikis play two married men with dreams of sexuality and profanity, and their wives decide to give them a hall pass, letting them do whatever they feel like doing for the whole week, which involves hooking up with other women. Then, they end up in unexpected consequences involving a psycho boyfriend, a sex scene gone wrong, and getting high on the golf course. Who thought that this was funny? Well, there was a few funny moments like the police freaking out while watching Sudeikis masturbate in his car outside. But that does not mean that this movie is funny throughout. The characters are always overreacting on sex, drugs, and profanity that we don't care about these people. This is just painfully silly. Also, the actor that looks embarrassed to be in this mess is Richard Jenkins, playing a professional hustler with ways of hooking up with girls, and knows the perfect one to sleep with. Wow, what a guy! Every moment that tries to make you laugh, only just makes you chuckle or groan. But there are some laughs, only they are surprisingly weird. I can't honestly believe that I had to sit through a movie where two great comedians have to make complete fools out of themselves, and the writing is a super pain to follow. Seriously, It was so painful, I actually wanted my family to talk through it, while watching. From start to finish, ""Hall Pass"" is one of the worst movies of this or any other year.

For one, it is a Farley brothers created; who created Dumb and Dumber. Some of their films were pure gold but others seriously made me question. Hall Pass, on the other hand, was highly promoted and had pointers to be a great film by them. But set all ""expectations"" aside folks, because Hall Pass will surely disappoint. The plot is simplistic and could actually lead out to genuine comedy. This could've been another Hangover IF they didn't decide to make it lame. Lame is hard word to describe stuff... It has to actually mean it to say it, and let me say it again, LAME. The acting shouldn't be commented on much since comedies don't rely on that factor. But the one thing that ruined the film was it's humor. I enjoy humor, and the Farley brothers have some legit comedies. But Hall Pass seriously made me question how they can run down to THIS? There was no memorable scenes or any 'quotable' lines. There wasn't any scenes where you would die of laughter and tell your friend later on. Hall Pass will surely disappoint fans alike.

62,augustian,I saw what was going to happen,2,14 April 2015,"This review may contain SPOILERS. After reading the blurb on the back of the DVD cover, I began to suspect that this film was not going to be so obviously about two married men given liberty for a week, but a subversive attack on women. As the film progressed I began to think that my suspicions were right.Two married men, Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) long for the freedom of their youth. Their wives, Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) reluctantly agree. As the film progresses though, the whole premise is turned on its head. Rick and Fred just cannot be unfaithful to their wives, Rick turns down a near naked Leigh (Nicky Whelan) while Fred even fakes having sex. The women though are a different kettle of fish. From the wives to the doctor to female relatives and even the young babysitter, the women are portrayed as rampant tarts who just cannot get enough. Hollywood really hates women doesn't it? This is a comedy though, so that's all right isn't it? Grace even crashes her car and ends up in hospital after realising what she had done. It must have been a hoot writing that one.I believe it was Oscar Wilde (correct me if I'm wrong) who said something along the lines of, ""Women don't know the danger they are in until it's too late."" Perhaps it should be rewritten as, ""Women don't know how much they are hated until it's too late."" If ever there was a misogynistic movie, then this has to be it.",Hall Pass

Funny movie and very realistic about a couple of men who are married, and their wives invent a hall pass so their men can do whatever they want for a week. For a week they are not married.Without realizing that this is a both way street, two men are starting their week. But everything is different; they are much older than when they were at school. It is not easy to just meet a woman and take her to a motel. For women it is much easier to approach a guy.Owen Wilson is after a woman from the coffee shop. This Nicky Whelan is a very beautiful woman. When she was on screen I did not read the subtitles. Her beauty made her accent less annoying. And yes, Owen Wilson could resist her, even when she showed him her boobs. Yeah right. That was not realistic. The funny moments were with his friend, Jason Sudeikis. This guy came from the one funny scene into the other.I must say, hall pass is not just as funny as Dumb and dumber, but it is a funny movie. The most funny scene is at the closing credits where Stephen Merchant dreams about having a hall pass. I laughed my ass off! That was hilarious! When the makers of this movie would have made a whole movie just like this scene, they would have made the best funny movie ever. Too bad that it was only one scene. But I haven't laughed like this in a long time, thank you guys, thank you Stephen Merchant.Positive points: Great acting,original story, Nicky Whelan, closing credits scene, funny, entertaining.

You can now add Hall Pass to that list.Hall Pass stars Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis as Rich and Fred, married guys who cannot help but notice many attractive women who come within ten feet of them. Maggie and Grace, the wives played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, know how they are in the situations they put themselves through.In the story, their intentions take a turn for the worse as they make fun of the hosts of a party, as well as the private areas of other guests. They are caught on security camera with everyone else watching them make fools out of themselves. They leave the party with their frustrated wives who think that their husbands only think of sex.Maggie and Grace are given advice to give the men ""Hall Passes"", one week off from marriage for them to do whatever they want to. In other words, they can hook up with other girls, no harm, no foul. Maggie starts with Rich immediately and takes their kids away for that week. For Grace, it takes Fred jacking off in his car and being caught by the cops him to get his Hall Pass.As the story continues, Rich and Fred are off their game. At the same time, Maggie and Grace use the hall pass to their advantage to meet other guys. Maggie meets a local baseball coach, and Grace hooks up with a young baseball player.The guys don't get their game on until they meet and old friend named Coakley (played excellently by Richard Jenkins). Rich gets together with a girl named Leigh who works at a local coffee shop. Fred hooks up with the aunt of Rich's babysitter.Now where the story takes a dark turn relates to a guy named Brent who works at the same coffee shop. He thinks that Rich and Fred are both old perverts and that Rich is trying to steal Leigh any chances of Brent being with her. The twists involving him are there, and they are funny, but they are just explained and left alone.The acting of Wilson and Sudeikis is really funny as they are both believable as these married guys who check out other girls. Fischer and Applegate are both wonderful as their pretty wives who roll their eyes at what their husbands do. Jenkins is a laugh riot as the old friend of Wilson and Sudeikis as he knows every trick that the girls in the bar pull off.The Farrelly Brothers do a good job of making a fun story out of a situation that can really happen in today's world. They do great at making the movie continue to stay funny, despite that dark, but temporary turns it takes.",Hall Pass

Owen Wilson was acceptable with his performance, while Sudekis was hilariously funny in number of scenes. The whole cheating scenario would certainly disturb some viewers but the story/theme was meant to be that way.

The movie starts great, it's extremely sweet in it's first 30 minutes, then it goes from nice to average when all we see is these guys suffering misery while their wives are enjoying the good life, suddenly, the movie just chicken's out in the end and gives a glorious HORRIBLE ENDING.The movie fails MISERABLY in the end, because, the whole premise of the movie is to take the sex lightly, sex has nothing to do with true love and should't matter, but then, the Farrelly's throw away the whole concept for a typical romantic comedy with the gold old values of ""marriage is everything"".Please, GIVE ME A BREAK, If I go see a movie about a hall pass, I expect at least these guys to get some fun, not that they suffer through the whole movie to then mysteriously find that they love their wives and they had been wrong from the start.Sex drive is in each one of us, it doesn't go away because of love, nor does the desire to be with other girls/guys, no matter how in love we are and is not BAD because it's part of human nature, again, the movie ""A good old fashioned orgy"" get it right in all it's points while this miserable movie get it all wrong.I do love my wife and I do not think that having desire for other women destroys my marriage and I do think the Farrelly's only seem to be open minded when in the end, they are just seriously stuck on in the last century.The last 10 minutes are not loving, they are horrible and painful.So, if we man desire other women is because we didn't found out that our wives are the best, utterly awesome beings of light that never fails at anything and we should have eyes for her and only for her for the rest of our lives? Talking about a big cliché! I do love my wife but i'm human, realistic love is much more fun and light hearted than this piece of garbage is trying to sell us, but, as always, Hollywood has a tendency to give sermons about morality and concepts like we don't have neurons in our brains.I totally hate movies that pretend to give us fun and in the end, they try to indoctrinate us to the ""real moral values"" that a good society should had.Shame on you Farrelly's brothers!4 out of 10.",Hall Pass

I think it achieved its point because I was watching it together with ten friends. I think seeing it lonely or with girlfriend couldn't be that enjoyable. But that's my opinion.Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are themselves, which means a friendly guys with positive attitudes and sense of humour.

Some look back and envision how things could have played out differently or what it would be like with someone else, due to an uncontrollable obsession that follows a person around and gets the juices flowing again whenever the opposite sex bends over or is noticed with lustful glances across the bar.Fred (Jason Sudeikis) and Rick (Owen Wilson) have wives that know what's cookin' in their spouse's loins and what secret conversations they attempt to conceal--and they're tired of it. The two men are granted permission to have a week of fun and best of all no questions asked while the wives take a leave of absence on their own. The husbands don't know whether it's too good to be true or just a cleaver trick. Yet, their friends hear the news and want to tag along and see these sex-on-their-mind hall pass holders work their supposed magic they're always on about. Except these accountant, Hardy Boy looking urbanites are terrible at it, out of practice and not hip in the slightest. Their perception of women is that they are naive and can be scooped up and used as easy as salt shakers with nothing but their manly presence and a pick up line to draw them to their salivating plate. Meanwhile they have no idea that the pass works as a two way street while their wives talk it up with some newly met baseball studs who think they have a couple of cougars on their hands.This is ""Beavis and Butthead"" mixed with ""Hangover"" antics. You're gonna get more sex jokes and newly invented lingo than you can't count, not to mention male and female nudity and gross out humor. This is more of a shock gag movie that plays on taboos and awkwardness. Sounds like a recipe for simple fun to loosen up from the day-to-day grind and at times it produces unexpected laughs, though at others it feels up and down by either over or under playing the comedic timing. Not to mention the chemistry between the cast didn't always feel authentic and kinetic, such as Brent (Derek Waters): the cut and pasted antagonist who overreaches and feels forced due to having no range other than to hamper Rick's (Wilson) plans. Both Fred and Rick strike out continuously and then random characters and settings are thrown in the mix so that things ""coincidentally"" fall into place at the same time for more of a topsy turvy climax.This isn't going to be another ""Dumb & Dumber,"" ""Kingpin"" or ""There's Something About Mary"" where the replay value and jokes can be relived over and over again due not only to the odd and crude though workable humor but characters that breathed and ultimately became the part through and through. ""Hall Pass"" has its moments here and there, is easy entertainment and includes some messages about if what you're feeling is real or just a fantasy, or if the person you have is just enough. Though this doesn't stand as tall or generate as much hearty laughter that can draw up lasting memories as one would except coming from a movie with the Farrelly brothers' name on it.

72,EmDee-427-469344,Typical Farrelly fare.,1,31 October 2013,"I can't believe these brothers are wealthy purely based on toilet humor and breasts (possessed by girls who look like models while the male leads look like old men) - yeah realistic...NOT! This movie was once again aimed at men who don't need a realistic plot. Just cheap laughs, stick material and an excuse to use next time they want to stray...""Yeah Honey, I need a Hall Pass for a week. It's the done thing nowadays, a movie said so"". Then at the end the guys are made out to be loving husbands while one wife is made out to be a slut - after her husband was (as he said) kissing another woman's genitals and in the middle of masturbating her when told his wife was in a car accident. Yeah the only reason he stopped is because his friend turned up to tell him his wife was in an accident- yet men are still on here calling his wife a slut (that's rich).You better believe men will think it's OK to use words such as ""faux job"" etc and giggle like girls and ask for hall passes because once again the Farrelly brothers have told them they can get a hot Australian girl - just because they looked at her in a creepy way and got a ""Week off"".",Hall Pass
73,treeskier802,"Good Idea, Poor Execution",4,12 December 2011,"As with most comedies, my expectations for Hall Pass wasn't high. Don't get me wrong, comedies are one of my favorite genres, but let's face it these movies are escapism at the very best. All a comedy needs to do is have an interesting premise and then make you laugh. If it does more than that, then that's great. Hall Pass succeeded in that the idea was fresh--a couple 40-something buddies get Hall Passes from their wives, allowing them to do anything they want, without question, for one week. Great idea. However, the jokes were not all that good, the performances were dialed in, and the story didn't really progress fast enough or hit upon the jokes that really could have made it a classic comedy. Since it is a comedy, I'd like someone from Hollywood to take another crack at the subject matter. If you can watch the movie on cable for free, go ahead and see what you think. If you're looking for something to rent, it may be a waste of your time and your $5 bucks. Rating 4 of 10 stars.",Hall Pass

75,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Hall Pass,5,20 March 2011,"The premise for this movie is an interesting one and brought with it the chance to lay down some solid comedy. With the Farrelly brothers producing the likes of Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, hopes were higher than usual for this type of film. Rick (Owen Wilson) is married along with all his closest friends but this doesn't stop him and his mates sharing a jovial joke or two about what they would be getting up to if they weren't with the other half. In fact the first half an hour of the movie you will spend wondering whether you have happened upon sex crazed teenagers trapped adult bodies given how horny they all seem to be.Rick and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) believe that they have honed their abilities to leer at women with extreme subtlety and are sure that they are never caught in the act. Their spouses however are well aware of their antics and on most occasions spot or overhear their husbands. After going just that bit too far both Rick and Fred are granted a 'hall pass' from their wives. An entire week to spend doing whatever or whomever they want.The movie is broken down into the 7 days that they have and the mischief that they get up to. For the first few days Rick and Fred are joined by their mates who watch as they talk the talk but don't walk the walk. Even after copious amounts of alcohol and a quick read up on the latest internet chat-up lines neither one is bringing their A-game to the table. Parallel to this however are the wives who both go to Cape Cod for the week and being spouse free themselves find that male attention is quite easy to come by. Rick and Fred's friends who include Stephen Merchant (am not sure how they managed to get him in this but he should probably have given it a wide berth) are not engaging and except for a golf scene involving brownies laced with weed they don't contribute to either the plot line or the comedy.The Farrelly brothers have gone the way of lude and crude and for some that will cater to their comedy needs. 'Over the top' and 'gross-out comedy' have been muttered when talking about this movie and I would agree wholeheartedly. For me though there is only so much laddish humour I can take before it starts to become a bit repetitive. There are some good moments hidden away in a sea of average especially towards the end but they are fewer and farther inbetween than I would have liked.It's a shame the movie didn't begin half way through because this is when I felt it started to stutter into life and even after the credits started rolling there was still some laughing to be had. Hall Pass has set itself up to cater for a certain type of viewer and it will be one of these movies that you either end up loving or hating. I'm usually a fan of toilet humour and a bit of banter but this just didn't quite cut it.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Hall Pass
76,apb216,Not a bad watch,6,12 June 2013,"I actually didn't have any expectations for this movie so I wasn't disappointed by it. Did I love it? No, but I didn't dislike it. It was a great movie for a nice rainy day with nothing to do but catch up on movies, so when it came on HBO I watched it because there wasn't much else to watch and I enjoyed it. I laughed at some parts and there were some good heart warming moments too. I'm not a big Owen Wilson fan (because it drives me crazy that an actor who must have a decent amount of money doesn't use it to FIX HIS BROKEN NOSE! ARE YOU READING THIS OWEN?!), his voice is a bit monochromatic for me, but he has been in great movies so I don't dislike him either. This is about two guys who tend to not try and hide the fact that they notice a lot of women and their wives grow tired of it, so they take the advice of an older friend and give their husbands a 'hall pass' from marriage. They take a week off of marriage and whatever happens stays between the two of them. At first Owen is reluctant but his friend is excited and talks him into it. They round up their guy friends and go on adventures only to slowly discover their age has caught up with them. The women retreat to a vacation home and end up having some adventures of their own. In conclusion, it's a decent watch with some life lessons and funny moments and would make a great addition for a casual movie night.",Hall Pass
77,scrapmetal7,I can't believe this was from the Farrelly Brothers.,3,22 April 2011,"There used to be certain elements one could count on in the Farrelly Brothers' films. Of course, everybody knows about their gross-out moments, but their films were also genuinely funny and also had a lot of heart, they were able to get a lot out of their stars, and use unusual locations to great effect. Best of all, they had a kind of daring to create a slapstick comedy environment and then take it into a meaningful direction (KINGPIN being my favorite example). Judd Apatow movies do this now, but I still expect the Farrellys to continue making the kind of comedies they pioneered. THE HEARTBREAK KID had given me a lot of hope that they still have the touch, but in the case of HALL PASS, my expectations are definitely not met.HALL PASS is lacking entirely in the qualities that made the Farrellys respectable. I had no idea this was even a Farrelly Brothers movie, because it doesn't have their way about it. Even when I saw Rob Moran show up, my only thought was ""Hey, that guy's usually in the Farrelly Brothers' movies"".There's nothing about it that stands out from any of the other plastic comedic efforts of the past couple of years, like COUPLES RETREAT or FOUR CHRISTMASES or whatever other rom-coms you can think of. The plot is not unusual, the settings are entirely cobbled together from product placement deals (Applebees, Dave and Busters, ""All that talk about arches makes me want to eat AHEM McDonalds!"") The movie has a great cast of talented actors we all know and like, but they're given nothing interesting to do or say.The script needed a lot of help. The jokes just aren't there. The interesting settings aren't there. The heart isn't there. There are some gross out surprises, but that's it. People who didn't get the Farrellys used to focus only on their gross-out humor, but this time, those people would be right because there isn't anything else to this movie.",Hall Pass

81,MarcoLara,"Light, simple comedy which runs a bit longer than it should",7,7 June 2020,"Call me simpleton but I enjoyed this movie. It got me laughing almost from the get go, and while at first I felt the actors were almost reading lines the whole thing got eventually better.It is, overall, not a bad movie, but it does run a bit longer than it should. 20 minutes shorter would have made it not perfect, but somehow better.Naturally this is comedy, it is not the real world, and sometimes the characters react to situations in a way I do not believe any man alive would. This, and the lack of utilization of the rest of the cast, with very capable comedians such as J.B. Smoove doing his ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" character, or Steve Merchant (The Ricky Gervais Show), made this move lose a better chance of success.But it is entertaining, and there is some truth to it.

82,jgregg42,"Go Get Your ""Hall Pass""",8,25 February 2011,"Have you ever wondered what happened to the crew of guys from the first ""American Pie"" movie? After they lost ""it"" I often wonder what happened after they got married and had kids and moved out to the suburbs. What happened 20 years later when they were no longer the ""Big Men on Campus""? Thanks to the new release by the Farrelly brothers (Bobby and Peter who also brought us ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"") we are now able to see the rest of the story. ""Hall Pass"" is by no means a sequel in the ""American Pie"" series but both films did remind me of how most men are wired for sexual conquests from puberty onward. ""Hall Pass"" captured America's well known character - the middle age suburbanite male and gave him a hall pass. A hall pass is a weeklong excuse for married men to behave badly, drink to excess and sleep with whomever. We start the movie with Rick (played by Owen Wilson) and Fred (played by Jason Sudeikis) attending an award banquet with their wives. They think they have the ""scoping-chicks-out-in-secret"" scheme down perfectly while their wives know what dogs they really have become over the years. It's not that Rick and Fred are totally miserable in their marriages but they think that they could be getting some serious action if they weren't tied down. Fred has even resorted to finding a way to relieve some of his sexual tensions in his car. Their wives, Maggie (played by Jenna Fischer) and Grace (played by Christina Applegate), speak with a psychiatrist friend of theirs who gives them the idea of letting their husbands have a week off of their marriage so that they can carouse and let some of their male tendencies rule. At the end of the week they come back and have stronger marriages because of the freedom. Hey, I am sure it works in theory. Once the guys are loose, they have some troubles getting back in the game. They are like two disoriented bulls in a china shop; they neither have any idea how they got there nor how to move around with any tact. The week moves quickly with the guys bar hopping at family restaurants. They embark on a hilarious golf outing after eating some brownies laced with pot. By the third night they are called out on their manhood by their friends. Rick and Fred, like a lot of guys, talk a big game but have very little action to back up their smack talk. While the boys are trying their hardest using tasteless pick-up lines and getting drunk to build their confidence, the wives are being themselves and living it up with a minor league baseball team in Cape Cod. As an indirect result to allowing the husbands go out, the wives are also permitted a hall pass. However, the wives aren't as shameless about their newfound freedom. The movie moves on with many quotable one liners and quite a few shock moments. But, it wouldn't be a true Farrelly brothers' movie without one or two shock moments. Remember the hair gel scene in ""There's Something About Mary?"" The same goes with ""Hall Pass,"" with a lot of big risks comes a lot of big rewards for the audience. Should you see this movie? Yes. The actors played off of each with ease. Along with a well-written script, it all came together for several big laughs. However, if you are not comfortable with sexual references or outlandish sight gags, this might not be the film for you. If you are the type to laugh at ""American Pie,"" ""Superbad,"" ""Step Brothers"" or any other over the top comedy then this would definitely be a pick for you.",Hall Pass
83,dsalouk,Its own worst enemy,3,12 February 2017,"Hall Pass is first and foremost meant to be a comedy, and that is exactly where it fails. With little to no moments of true genuinely funny moments, it attempts to provide comedic commentary on the married lifestyle and accepted adultery. It however loses itself in this message by getting lost with who in fact wants the pass, the real motif behind it, and in the end, glosses over Applegate's terrible character. The movie has few redeemable features, glossing over unfunny crude moments, blending a cliché trope of characters, and an embarrassment for the key actors. Hall Pass can be easily passed over for anything better.",Hall Pass

A Hall Pass, to be released from all obligation of marriage, the freedom to do whatever you want for 1 week. Rick and Fred soon realize that having a pass to be in the halls is not as important then being in their home room with their wives. Gut busting funny comedy that all couples can relate to.

85,donjeffries,"Yet Another Putrid ""Comedy""",1,1 April 2013,"I must sound like a broken record, but once again this horrid film proves that Hollywood simply cannot make a decent comedy anymore. This one has the same things they all do now- tons of juvenile potty humor, gratuitous male nudity (and in a rarity, a brief topless female), and a predictable, disastrous message. The male nudity, by the way, includes a close up view of a male's penis. As usual, the males in the film are made out to be the bad guys. Two hapless husbands, who are guilty of nothing more than ogling women here and there, are granted a ""hall pass"" by their wives. This idea comes from their friend, played by the odious Joy Behar, who is no actress and can barely recite her lines. The men are told that for one week, they can do whatever they want, and pretend they aren't married, while the wives take the kids out of town. In an utterly foreseen twist, the guys turn out to not even be capable of talking to girls, let alone sleeping with them, while their wives are partying up a storm with hot younger athletes. Meanwhile, we are treated to a running gag that could have been penned by most third graders, of the guys' fat friend constantly uttering ""I have to poo."" In a truly artistic scene, we are treated to this man's fat bare bottom taking a dump in a sand trap on a golf course. Talk about hilarious! Owen Wilson eventually turns down the hot 21 year old who had been his children's babysitter, her hot 40 something aunt, and the gorgeous blonde Australian chick who had been the object of his fantasies. He doesn't even get to kiss any of them. His hapless friend is similarly unlucky. Meanwhile, Christina Appelegate, as the other husband's wife, does sleep with a younger guy. Afterwards, she says ""this can't happen again- I love my husband."" This is the message that has been coming out of Hollywood for some time now- a wife can have an extramarital affair, but the husband cannot, or at least if he does, the marriage is over. We saw this even in Family Guy, when Lois slept with Bill Clinton, but Peter inexplicably backed out of sleeping with his date, so the writers solved that by having Peter sleep with Bill Clinton, too. Ugh. When the hapless other husband reunites with Christina Applegate, he gets down on his knees and apologizes. ""For what?"" the audience might ask. He didn't really do anything wrong. But his wife sure did. And does she admit this, or apologize herself? Nope. Guess again- she accepts his ridiculous apology with a canary-that-ate-the-kitten smile. Nice message there for everyone. This movie was not as awful as the Judd Apatow stuff, or quite as unfunny as most of Adam Sandler's and Will Ferrell's ""gems,"" but it is still thoroughly offensive.",Hall Pass
86,ChipperX,You WILL Laugh - Even after the Credits Roll.,10,27 February 2011,"""Hall Pass"", the latest movie from the Farrelly brothers starring Owen Wilson (Rick) and Jason Sudeikis (Fred), is a raunchy comedy that serves up ""distasteful"" humor. The movie has an intended audience: People (male and female) who enjoy raunchy, racy, ""dirty"" comedy. If you laughed until you cried while watching ""There's Something About Mary"", then you will most likely appreciate this flick. If you thought ""Dumb And Dumber"" was just plain stupid, then you will probably not enjoy ""Hall Pass"".The Premise: Two married, middle-aged men, Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis) are in loving but sexually-unexciting marriages. They portray the typical horny male with sex on the brain who ogles women frequently.They believe their wandering eyes are clandestine, but unfortunately they are caught scoping chicks by their wives, played by Jenna Fischer (Maggie) and Christina Applegate (Grace). After the wives witness a few cringe-worthy scenes of male libido gone wild within their husbands, they are encouraged by their friend, a therapist, to allow the men a ""week off"" from marriage to cure their wanderlust. The Execution: ""Hall Pass"" is not an Oscar-worthy movie - nor is it incredibly original. The stars do not deliver Shakespearean-level performances. What you get is exactly what the trailers promise: A desperately funny, sad, tragic and raunchy comedy that both entertains and enlightens. The opening scenes which set up the movie's premise are fresh and raucous - look for the scene involving the ""Stepford"" family and their safe-room video cameras. I actually learned a new lexicon which, I am sure, will become popular amongst my Facebook friends: ""Big Mouth Vagina"", ""Fake Chow,"" and ""Oversexed Bobble-head"". Also, witness the quiet desperation of Wilson (Rick) and Sudeikis (Fred) as they ogle the coffee house barrista. The second act of the movie is pretty dirty - and quite laughable. I will not give anything away, here - not every joke in the movie is razor sharp or fresh, and some of it is a bit stale. However, you certainly get what you paid for - a few moments of diamond-hard nastiness so crude you might never have imagined it yourself. Whether it was intentional or not, the movie succeeds and / or fails in the over-the-hill physical presentation of the couples. Wilson and Sudeikis looked slightly old and fat, while Fischer and Applegate looked slightly pale and fine-line wrinkly. I understand that the movie's premise revolves around middle-aged couples, but I did not really enjoy the stars' tired-looking appearance - why could they not have been portrayed as older-but-still-sexy? Applegate as Grace is really the only married character who looked like she still kept herself up. This, of course, is only a minor quibble - the directors obviously felt that a bit of paunch and wrinkle was necessary to make the characters more believable.The third act of ""Hall Pass"" offers a satisfactory conclusion to this cautionary tale. Rick and Fred are able to rejoin Maggie and Grace after realizing that they did indeed already have everything they needed to enjoy happy unions with their spouses. Pay close attention, here: There are a few unpredictable, surprising moments which make the movie well-worth seeing and definitely elevate the film within its shock-humor genre. Is this a bit of a ""Hollywood"" ending? You bet it is - but in this age of common infidelity and skyrocketing divorce, I feel the conclusory message of the movie is quite poignant, and yes - uplifting. The characters each learn ""hard"" lessons which will hopefully strengthen their unions for years to come (pun intended). Final Credits Scene Alert: Many people, after viewing the movie in the theater, will rise from their seats and hurry out to continue their lives as the credits begin to roll. STOP! Don't do it! One hilarious scene and one humorous out-take remains - much like the final scene in ""The Hangover"". Do yourself a favor and stay until the credits have COMPLETELY finished. This is becoming more and more common in movies - pivotal sequel clues and codas are now frequently left in the final credits. I don't mind this at all - for me, the movie is not finished until the credits have stopped rolling.Final Recommendation: While some people may feel that the humor in ""Hall Pass"" is over the top, I must respectfully disagree. You go into a movie of this type with your eyes wide open, and the trailers all point to one thing - one heck of a ""dirty"" movie. There shouldn't be anyone who knows anything about the premise of this movie who feels cheated because you get exactly what you pay for: Hilariously concocted set-piece after set-piece of trashy, low-brow hi-jinx. With respect to execution of raunchy comedy, the Farrelly brothers deliver in high, grotesque style. Anyone seeing a movie at the theater can expect some level of predictability. The really good movies deliver unexpected surprises and plot twists that leave you talking for a few days. ""Hall Pass"", in my humble opinion, is that type of movie.""Hall Pass"" delivers a splendid menu of delicious depravity for the audience to digest. If you do not like this type of sexual comedy, then please wait for your friends to see it instead, and get the story second-hand from them - but I am sure that they will summarize the movie with knowing, private smiles on their faces and wicked gleams in their eyes.Concept: 10 out of 10 Stars. Execution: 9 out of 10 Stars. Overall Rating: 10 out of 10 Stars.Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.",Hall Pass

To me, it's like Wedding Crashers, Bridesmaids (which to me wasn't as funny as this except for Melissa McCarthy), etc. Get off your high horses and just laugh! Wilson & Sadeikis are really good.

Lazy, easy watching, no need to engage brain and laugh out loud at a couple of unexpected crass moments. Its what the Farrelly's do best and this does not disappoint in that regard. It also seems to try deliver a moral to the story...that bored husbands soon realise that they can't deliver a week of debauchery without feeling guilty and missing their loved ones. The plot did deliver some unexpected twists which keeps you entertained. There's also plenty of eye candy for both sexes to drool over.

So I'd recommend it for easy going/funny night when you don't have to pay too much attention to the screen of the TV. Few stereotypes are put into perspective here (across the lines) which always annoys me (I would prefer to be ""out of the box"" thinker instead of seeing stupid messages poking my eyes from low budgeted films as this one.So in a nutshell - nothing special, good for wasting time with friends/family/girl/boy-friend but don't expect to remember this film weeks after you've seen it.",Hall Pass

They don't even have a enough time to develop a relationship. I am so glad to see that the sense of commitment to marriage is alive and well in Hollywood. Apparently, the point of the movie is to show that people don't really want to be married. Casual sexual or childish teenage infatuation are more compelling than a committed marriage where the wife and husband have remained faithful to each other. If a husband is so immature that he goes around like a teenager dreaming about sleeping with younger women, then he should never have gotten married in the first place.

113,staff-577-378882,Review: Hall Pass,2,25 February 2011,"Hall Pass is the latest ""boys never grow up"" comedy to come out of the Ferrelly Brothers. Being the creative minds behind Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, one can expect a riotous situational comedy with a dash of lewd exposure all while managing to keep a heartwarming undertone that makes it all worth it. Unfortunately, Hall Pass keeps the lewd with a dash of comical instances of brilliance while managing to keep the audience wondering when the movie will finally just... stop playing.Rick (Owen Wilson, the blonde one who's not Luke Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis of SNL fame) are best buds happily married to wonderful women Maggie (Jenna Fischer of The Office) and Grace (Christina Applegate of Anchorman, Married with Children). But things have gotten a little stale in the bedroom and the guys are helpless but to gawk at all the young ""talent"" that surrounds them. Darn it, if only they weren't married! The wives take note of this behavior and after a lengthy dialogue with a minor character literally detailing the title of the film, they pave the way for a wild week of orgies and freedom by issuing their husbands a ""hall pass"" a.k.a. a week free from marriage in which they can sow their wild oats. The boys are instantly excited and embrace the idea without any concern for how bad things must be in their marriage to have brought their wives to this point, but never mind. Free sex! Except they find that it isn't as easy as they remember to meet women leading to failed attempt after attempt to not only fulfill their fantasies, but to even function without the guidance of their wives. Reminiscent of moving out of the house for the first time and instead of mom's meatloaf, you're eating Cup o' Noodles for 3 weeks straight. The ladies, on the other hand, go Maggie's father's summer home for the week and party with a visiting Minor League baseball team and play volley ball and shotgun beer and are flirted with constantly and... well, you get the point.Ultimately, the film slumps along from one scene to the next, segmented together in a shrewd manner. The film's crippling weakness isn't that a majority of the jokes are asinine for even a Farrelly Brother film or that the plot is overly contrived but that the characters we're meant to invest in just aren't interesting or agreeable or worth a $10 admission. Being a fan of Wilson and especially of Sudeikis, the characters they played were severely underwritten for their talents. They didn't seem to capture the bumbling 40-year-old thinking he could still be a 20-year-old effect and just came across as bumbling 40-year- olds pretending to be 60-year-olds thinking they could be 20-year-olds. Fischer and Applegate were also underwritten and thus made it hard to really invest in their characters as well.While there are a few memorable moments involving a hipster troll working at a coffee shop and Stephen Merchant being Stephen Merchant for 5 minutes, Hall Pass just does not deserve to be excused from its poor execution.1.5 Hawaiian shirts out of 5-MovieFloss.com",Hall Pass
114,gwynjones2001,a romantic comedy... with little in the way of romance or comedy,3,19 April 2011,"6.1? IMDb, you must be kiddin' me!I dropped off my motorcycle to get the tyre changed, and they said come back in 2 and a half hours. So I walked to the mall, and grabbed a ticket for the movie starting right now. Which was, of course, Hall Pass. As a method of picking movies, I suggest you avoid this.As for the movie, I wished I'd walked home instead. Or walked around the mall ogling shop assistants. Or sat at a cafe and drank 6 coffees. Or stayed at the motorcycle shop and watched the mechanic change the tyre. Probably all these options would have been better.The plot is stupid, but I'm too fed up to try to summarize it.Instead, let me say that the movie is only just over 1 and a half hours long. And it seemed too long. And I barely laughed all the way through, and probably not at all for the first hour or so. I can't remember what I found amusing, but I know it was a mild titter rather than a heartfelt guffaw of merriment.As for the two couples, they didn't have much chemistry, and precious little romance.Something About Mary was the high water mark of the Farrelly brothers oeuvre. I haven't seen all their other masterpieces, but I'm guessing that Hall Pass is somewhere around the low water mark... and the tide's way out. SAM was really, really funny. HP isn't. SAM had some outrageous gross-out humor. HP doesn't. It has a few lame attempts, but they fail miserably. SAM even had a bit of romance, and probably qualified as a romantic comedy. HP has almost zero romance, and very little comedy. It's a romantic comedy without either romance or comedy.It's a joke-free end to the Farrelly Brothers' long and illustrious career. Don't let the door slam on ya, on the way out boys. Don't pay real money to see this movie. There are many other fine ways of spending that money, which will result in more laughter and pleasure than Hall Pass.Oh, while I'm carping, two Office regulars (Jenna Fischer, USA version and Stephen Merchant, UK version) totally wasted. Owen Wilson looked really old.PS I paid $4.50 for my ticket. And that was $4.50 too much.",Hall Pass
115,Joshsports60,Very mediocre,4,14 March 2011,"Look, with a storyline like the one they had, this could've been an epic movie. But it wasn't anywhere near that.The Farrelly Brothers flat out didn't deliver. The script was fairly bland and crude, but not all that funny. If a comedy isn't that funny, then the movie is pretty much dead.It was just boring. From Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis' haircuts to the week they had off from marriage, I was more enthusiastic about their wive's week off then the husbands.I felt like they could've incorporated 2 or 3 more characters into the plot to liven it up. It's unfair to have the two characters try to carry the movie by themselves for most of it.It took way too long to transition to the actual plot, around a half hour in fact that could've been cut down 15 minutes.If I had been directing this film, I would remake it totally different. For sake of not giving anything away, you decide for yourself if you would've made it wilder.If you're going to see this movie, expect lots of vulgarity and a teensy bit of nudity towards the end. This movie wasn't terrible, but could've been so much better if the dialogue was more crisp, wilder adventures, and much more boldness.",Hall Pass

118,ArtificialLuddite,Pass Pass.,3,11 December 2011,"During the illustrious decade that was the Nineties, the Farrelly Brothers released a spate of defining comedies – now considered classics – inspiring fledgling directors and prompting a myriad of shallow imitations. However, in hindsight it could be argued that the American duo, now both in their late-fifties, have only ever made three great movies: Dumb & Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary, and that everything that followed has been a shameful exercise in film-making, and a sad display of two men feebly trying to recapture some magic by repeating their tired and worn tricks.Hall Pass is the latest in a decade's worth of misguided blunders, and essentially encapsulates everything that is wrong with a Farrelly Brothers film, and a comedic style that became outdated in 2000 alongside the release of Me, Myself and Irene.Owen Wilson plays Rick, a frustratingly bland business drone who is granted a week to essentially seduce someone who isn't his wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer). There is no chemistry between the barely-conscious Wilson and his timid wife. His wing-man, Jason Sudeikis, is supposed to be vulgar, yet lovable – he is simply obnoxious. The writing is just terrible – there is a token fat-friend whose repeated punchline is ""I gotta go home and poo,"" and a token black-friend whose lines are so lazily written, they must surely be considered racist.As the weak storyline follows every predictable turn and cliché imaginable, one cannot help but feel insulted by this low standard of writing, which is ultimately the source of the film's infinite problems. We must pray that once Peter and Bobby Farrelly turn 60, they will finally feel so ashamed by their 'artistic' output that they never touch a camera again, and risk further tainting of the legacies of Roy Munson, Lloyd Christmas and Pat Healy.",Hall Pass

We didn't plan on going to this flick but the one we wanted to go to was sold out so we got stuck with this. I like a good comedy, and I enjoyed the other Farrelly films so I figured how bad can it be? I was pleasantly surprised. This is definitely not a movie you'd take your mother to. There are surprises throughout the movie and some blatant sight gags and the usual 'guy' humor , but it actually wasn't that bad! The chemistry between the 2 guys is spot on. I'm not a huge Owen Wilson fan but I do like Jason Sudakis. They were great together. This movie moves along pretty quickly and keeps the energy throughout the film. It does have a message that comes to fruition by the end of he film and for me , this all worked. The other guy friends seem to disappear after a while and I think could have lasted until the end. The storyline is good, the chemistry is good, the humor (while at times is the typical gag humor) made me laugh out loud and the message is good. As a Boston Red Sox fan, it was fun to see Dwight Evans in a role here. It's not the worst thing to spend a movie ticket on and is good entertainment if you like this kind of thing.

Though I loved the cast for the most part, if I were an investor OR an actor in the film, I would have been pretty angry at the final cut as it sure limits the audience who would enjoy it (thus the profits as well as the exposure for the cast).

I could tell that the whole thing was going to be obviously more advantageous for the wives as it happened since the guys had to stay in town while the richie-rich's went to a resort town. It's sort of expected the women will have the best time. I guess the guys couldn't go to Vegas as that makes sense, has been done, and then it might be harder to put in the cliché ending where everyone figures out they were better off as they were.

The films builds amiably and enjoyably enough, mining a rich thread of observational humour in the behaviour of married couples, but it does lose its way slightly in the last reel where the script attempts to ratchet up the tone of hysteria. But what makes this one good fun overall are a couple of memorable scatological and sexual jokes, and an after the credits vignette featuring Stephen Merchant, which provides some of the biggest laughs of the movie. If you can't find something to laugh at in this movie, then the world must be a very grim place for you. It is not their best work, but it is still a solid effort, and very enjoyable.

The piece in the main is a female revenge fantasy - the male characters are depicted as stupid and insensitive enough to ask for a license to cheat, the women with complete unrealism grant it, and in turn the women are successful and the men are spectactularly unsuccessfully. Perhaps he Farelly slobs and their friends are like that, but even if so they shouldn't tar all men that way.Unsatisfied with vicious sexism against men, they also have to include a scene in graphic detail that states black men have large penises and white men tiny ones, and thus extend to the worst kind of racism. Most likely the Farrelly slobs have a complex about their tiny penises, but that's no reason to inflict this on the public.To summarize, a disgusting piece of sexism and racism.

The one particular scene that I never in my whole life would have thought I would see passed of as entertainment was the Jacuzzi scene. This is where two naked men black and white rush in to save Owen Wilson who'd fallen asleep in the tub. The gratuitous close up of the black fellers penis -which looked partially erect, made me feel saddened and sick that this stuff now gets past the censors without batting an eyelid.I mean how can you watch this filth with your kids or parents . I have no doubt as witnessed by the Glenn Beck radio interview with Ben Shapirowho is an author of a new book about the left liberal strangle hold on Hollywood and this film clearly shows that.Let me elaborate: Ben Shapiro talks about the director of desperate housewives making same sex neighbours the norm. We have the same in England where the BBC is dominated by left, liberal self interest groups. I'm convinced that members of the production team or the director have an agenda to make pornography acceptable everywhere in our society. The Farrelly brothers should be absolutely ashamed of their contribution to the breakdown of the moral glue of our society.

139,GarrettDareson,Better than Expected,8,28 June 2011,"Reading some reviews of this movie shortly before watching it, I can say I wasn't expecting what I saw. To me, the comedy in this movie was spot on, along the same caliber as Hot Tub Time Machine.The choice of actors were perfect for the movie. Jason Sudeikis is one of my favorite people from Saturday Night Live and other movies, and Owen Wilson is one I really like, too, from movies such as Wedding Crashers.The movie was a little raunchy at times, but for the movie, it suited well with it. And it wasn't overboard on the R-rated stuff, either, just enough to get the message across.What really brought this movie in was the comedic timing. In many parts of the movie, simply to editing and timing was enough to make me laugh out loud, even if the part wasn't intended to be funny.In all reality, comedies are never going to win because everyone sees them different. Everyone has their own opinions and tastes on comedy, so you just have to stick to your guns and watch what you like.Still, I recommend this movie.» Garrett Dareson",Hall Pass
140,slipskinny,Dumpster fire of a movie,2,22 January 2021,I watched about half this movie and it was terrible. The humor had no punchlines. All the characters were devoid of any personality and fictitious. I understand the premise but the movie didn't continuously try to set a premise and didn't flow. The dialogue was too straight forward to get a sense of any anticipation. It plot was too predictable the only things that couldn't be predicted was the introduction of characters.,Hall Pass

But there are just too many BK's on this review board. This film is one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years. Jason Sudeikis gives a breakout performance. There is multiple scenes with him that will either have you on the floor or soaking your trousers. Owen Wilson is a perfect fit for this film(Kudos to the person who did the casting). While there are some holes in the plot, Wilson certainly patches it up with his acting and persona. Like Sudeikis, Owen Wilson will put you on the floor with laughter.Why the 6.0 rating?

Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis have some funny moments, but besides that, the male nudity and masturbating scene are nothing original and really not all that funny. There are a couple of other scenes like that, so you get the idea. The standard sexual comments and jokes are around, too. To me, this is just rehashed garbage that's been done a million times over in better movies than this one. These two guys try to have sex with women, but in the end it turns increasing stupid, and a little disgusting more than it was funny as they go on their quest.

146,RockDew,Does what it is supposed to do... and more,7,6 April 2011,"The 'more'? Let's just say that Hall Pass contains arguably one of the greatest visual gags of all time. Admittedly it is a joke of the 'gross out' variety, but so shockingly funny that any possible notions of disgust completely fail to register. To say more would be to spoil it, however. It truly must be seen to be believed.Aside from this, Hall Pass is a solid comedic effort that far surpassed my initial expectations (based on reviews and IMDb/rotten tomato ratings). I expected that it would make me laugh, but little more. Instead I left the cinema with a spring in my step - even after the pain of creasing up with laughter for, at one point, ten straight minutes. I forgot about the great skill of the Farrelly brothers to balance heartfelt moments with pure comedy gold, creating characters that you truly care about yet are happy to have fall victim to all sorts of embarrassing antics.There was also a danger that this film could have been too 'high concept' - focusing purely on how many comedic set pieces one can fit into the 'week off from marriage' that the main characters are presented with. Instead, some days fly by in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Nevertheless by the end of the week those early days seem a distant memory, the audience having taken the same eventful, hilarious, yet also emotional journey as experienced by the characters.Don't let the critics guide you away from this one.

Nothing more than another in a long line of mass produced, dopey, incredulous 'comedy' produced for the lowest common denominator. if this is the future of what our comedies are, no thanks. Take my advice;skip this movie. Walk past it on store shelves. If it's Telly, unplug the set and go out for a pint. It's not funny. Not even remotely. It's groan inducing. If you like other brainless rot like Napoleon Dynamite, Mama's Boy, Or anything of that 'style' , a term which I use in the loosest conceivable terms, you may get something out of this.

The title for me, being from the UK, was misleading, the premise is woeful and the characters despicable. The only thing worse is the human, no cretin, who dreamt up this schizophrenic abomination.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be on an epic level. On one hand it's an ""American Pie"" type comedy, where you're laughing at how bad the situation has become for a character, and then it's attempting to be all grown up, emitting a deep emotive, heartfelt message about life, love and loss. It simply doesn't work.I would say it was aimed at teenagers, but what teen wants to watch middle aged guys hitting on young girls? It's cringe worthy beyond the extreme. I'm sad that I've watched this film and have found a new all time worst movie ever.",Hall Pass

This movie starts in a good way, few laughs, smooth jokes but oh boy, it goes down south after just about the first 30 minutes. Cheesy acting, sloppy screen writing, poor characters development and silly silly story. It feels really bad when a movie, like this one, had the potentials to be a decent film but they just screw everything up! And by the way, someone should pay Owen Wilson to STOP ACTING.I have one and only one advice for you about this movie.. DON'T WATCH IT!",Hall Pass

152,charleforum,Worthless puritan garbage featuring man childs and fart jokes,1,2 December 2017,"This film, i mean this thing, is a total wreck. It has something to disappoint everyone. Picturing two marriages that are so lame they will make you hate marriage, two love story that are so childish you will hate love stories, humour so stupid they must have hired a retarded teenager to write the lines, and sexual situations so unsexy you might take a dislike in sex. As with many Hollywood product, the more it talks about sex, the less it actually is about it. All the sex consist in jokes about bushes and a pair of double F, with a bit of masturbation noise (thanksfully not in a pie this time) for good measure. The take home morale is off course that there is absolutely nothing beyond a good family home-life, if possible buried in nappies, and that desiring a healthy sexual relationship with your other half means you are a weirdo. It seems you can only wish to be on the coach grooming the Labrador, or masturbating in your car. In true Hollywood puritan tradition, after having been given this Hall pass, they make nothing of it, make asses of themselves, weep like kids, and go home with their tail between their legs, as two good doggies. Not even a single real kiss in the movie. The idea could have led somewhere. They could have lived that opportunity, really experience things, really understand what they have in their lives, and really build something from it. Instead they live nothing, go nowhere, they might just has well have stayed in the basement, meet no one, and everything ends in a big I-miss- you-so-much situation. Everyone ends up in their own coach, and thankfully, oh thankfully, not at any point in a stranger bed. Morale is saved. Vows are preserved.

153,fortwenty,The same old jokes we have been seeing for the past few years,1,25 May 2011,I really would not waste any money on this movie. I wish I had not watched the movie because I will never get the time I spent watching this garbage back and should sue the idiot directors This is a non stop penis joke and awkwardly explicit male nudity type of movie that fails to deliver anything original tries to force its jokes to happen.This movie is pretty much for females and bi/gay males as with many comedy that have been coming out in the last decade and a half. Its a cop-out to producing anything of substance just to flip a quick buck. The entertainment industry knows that if they make movies for the girls their boyfriends will pay for it even if they do not care to see the movie because of the roles society has in place for men. However if they make movies with lots of female nudity and vagina jokes the movie will flop because women flip out and call men disgusting perverts for wanting to see the movie. Got to love double standards.A trendy flop of a bad time. This movie was terrible. Watch if you are masochistic.,Hall Pass
154,psgalvanek,Hollywood blows it again.,4,3 September 2011,"How could this movie not be funny, right? One might be tempted to think this if they forget that Hollywood can't seem to make anything these days, especially comedies, that isn't tainted by their biases and agendas.Yes Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis offer up some funny moments and because of it the movie is just bearable but they're wrapped up in Hollywood's typical Bizarro World of life in middle America, marriage, men and women and how they relate.In Hollywood's twisted alternate reality women are all gorgeous, thin, intelligent, articulate, progressive, long suffering, deeply introspective creatures held back by their stupid, wing/rib gobbling, beer swilling, farting, slob husbands whose entire scope of knowledge and life experience consists of sports and internet porn. In this Hollyworld whether a woman is a scrawny, bleach blonde 40 year old with ""wings"" developing under arms and enough pancake to feed a third world country hiding her neck wrinkles (Chrinstina Applegate) or a 38 year old with three kids including one on her hip (Jenna Fischer) they're all beauties that stud guys of all ages are desperate to be intimate with and could be were they not burdened by their moron husbands and their superior sense of morality.Only Hollywood could create a story in this fictional world and manage to take the one person who violates her marriage vows out of group of people flirting with attempting to do so and make her the sympathetic character.Summary: a few minutes of funny gags buried in the Hollywood template of men = bad women = perfect marriage = misery.",Hall Pass

Debates concerning a wealthy friend's family portrait; an other buddy who's suppose to be a dating guru teaching them how to judge 10's when amongst other women were some of the things to look forward to.

All in all I found this movie funnier than ""The Hangover"" by a mile. I did not find anything shocking or out of line since by now the audience should have accepted the ""awkward"" scenes and Farrelly Brothers' humor as normal.It's a comedy after all and that is the only reason i gave it a 7 instead of 10.

Well worth your time.The film is well cast - the actors play their roles with relish and most are believable and likable.

158,mcorporaladams,"The trailer makes it seem great, but disappointing in the end!",5,27 February 2011,"When the trailer came out around Sept 2010 for this movie, I thought to myself ""I have to go see this movie!"". I was wrong, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer, and unless you want to see the main characters do just about nothing for the whole movie, then go watch it.At the beginning, they just keep checking women out and getting into trouble with their wives. Their wives are convinced into giving the two a ""Hall Pass"" by this doctor they knew. The women at first didn't like the idea of the Hall Pass, and asked the doctor to try it out for herself. The doctor told them she had already tried it.As days went on, the men finally achieved their goal, and obtained the Hall Pass.They have a kind of ""Law & Order"" theme when they switch days, the whole screen will go black and have ""DAY 1, and so on"" in the middle, as the start of their Hall Pass. The days went by quicker then I thought, for an hour and forty five minute movie, I thought the days would be more spaced out. The ""days"" in the movie went by so quick, I think in 10 minutes they already went by 3 days!The women go to the beach and hang out with college kids for the week, as the men get hurt, beaten, and angry while trying to have sex with numerous women.In the end, Rick gets his dream girl but denies her because he feels guilty. Fred is ""Fake chowing"" with Rick's babysitters aunt, thinking that Fred is Rick. Rick busts into the hotel room that they got because they didn't want to have sex with women in their home. Grace has sex with a college kid, and finds out he used her for sex, and Maggie finds out that the ""Hall Pass"" isn't for the guys, it's for the women!Overall, I'd give the movie a 5/10, it just wasn't that funny. There were some awkward scenes they put in, when Rick was in the hot tub, fell asleep and two naked guys came to help him. That scene was unnecessary. The movie went by really fast, with almost little to no detail of what happened.",Hall Pass

My mom took us to this movie thinking it was gonna be good,none of us could decide what to see, and to our disappointment, SuckerPunch was not out. So we are watching the movie, laughing at an over hot-tubed Rick flopping around screaming for help as he drowns of over heating, when suddenly two men run out of the sauna, butt naked. I mean, full on! No shirt,shoes,pants,underwear,or even a towel! So out come these two men asking whats going on, when the camera zooms in on there parts. By now, my friend and i are screeching and covering our eyes. Five seconds later we are looking back up, expecting to be rewarded with sunshine, to see an ongoing struggle between two naked men, and a blonde, screaming fish.Within 20 seconds this is all over, and the light of day shines again. So, to say the least, this movie is not without nudity. But, it is very worth your time, and money! I suggest a night out on the town with girl friends or a dinner and a movie would be the right time for this. No kids, and no elderly woman. They may have a heart attack.I say go see it.

161,saml-smith,It passed the test.,6,2 April 2012,"Ever since this film came out, I have heard numerous, tumultuous cries of hate for this movie. I watched it myself, waiting with baited breath for an hour and a half of pure slap-stick comedy. I never found it.I might have a different sense of humour to all of those who despised it, but the first half of the film is extremely funny. Unfortunately, the funniest character is the one played by Stephen Merchant, who is essentially a posh limey trying to be one of the lads. That paradoxical idea is funny in itself.I usually loath Jason Sudeikis. In Horrible Bosses, I found him to be a poor man's Zac Galifinakis. The character who has to have all the outrageous lines. He's the same here, but the lines are a little more human - you can imagine your best mate saying these things. Sudeikis needs lines like this or he will be found annoying.The second half of the film takes a serious dip into the mawkish, and you don't really want that in a comedy. In a comedy you want a number of memorable quotes (like Sudeikis' chat up lines), and you want to stay away from over-sentimentality. I mean, these actors aren't built for tugging at your heart-strings; they're for tickling you.That really is a tiny problem. Another is the disappearance of Stephen Merchant. The humour did take a sudden attrition to this, but I was still belly-laughing.Overall, people have been extremely draconian about this flick and that's wrong. Comedies don't need to be artsy-fartsy, they need to make you spew milk through your nose and give you some unforgettable moments. This film isn't perfect, but it's funny and that's all that matters.",Hall Pass

This information had NEVER come up on my radar and thus the fact that this was pointed out several times in this movie was absolutely hysterical! I'm so glad that JB Smoove & Stephen Merchant found time away from those AWFUL television projects that they're involved in! I just don't understand why Larry David & Ricky Gervais continue to hold these guys back! They should totally continue down this road where they FINALLY have some good writing behind their performances! This this the best Farrelly brothers movie since Stuck on You!!!!!!!!!,Hall Pass
176,hhhalstead-57561,Hall Pass is a national treasure,10,29 November 2019,"A modern-day classic! The performances by Jenkins, Wilson, and Sudeikis are career heights. Only the uneducated will bash a legendary film such as this. Coakley taught me everything I know. Bring a girl or don't come!",Hall Pass
177,belibtissam,"Too predictable but good, that's all i can say.",6,6 July 2019,"I did like this movie, it had a lot of good jokes and a good timing in them, Owen and Jason did a good job in their roles, they were basically being themselves lol.
But the thing that i didn't like is the fact that everything was too predictable, i almost predicted every thing that was going to happen since i read the plot. Overall it was a good movie but for a one time watch.",Hall Pass
178,brookebirch,Joy Behar...ew.,6,20 October 2021,"Some good laughs in this film...just not when Joy Behar cackles in it. It's definitely something you can watch with your significant other, probably not with your kids, in-laws or parents.",Hall Pass
179,akreca,Why,1,24 February 2020,Why are married men always portrayed as apes and married women as superheroes? Very irritating.,Hall Pass
