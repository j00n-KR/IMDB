0,TheLittleSongbird,Not the final chapter but should have been,6,7 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of.Liked the first two 'Friday the 13th' films, despite not exactly considering them great. Had mixed feelings on the third film, but it is one of the more watchable follow-ups. This fourth instalment for me is the second best of the sequels, and although one knows that it was not the 'Final Chapter', the general consensus is that it should have been and that there was no need for the rest. Have to completely agree with this, to me 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' was the last average and above of the series. It may not be a great film, neither were the previous three. The story is paper thin and there is not much new. Again, while actually the best acted film of the whole series, some of the acting is far from what one would call good. The dialogue, as can be expected (the 'Friday the 13th' films are not to be seen for the script), is awfully crude, cheesy and simplistic, and most of the characters are as dim-witted and underdeveloped as ever (though other sequels did this aspect far worse). There is some unintentional humour here and there that dissipates at times the generally very well done atmosphere.However, there are three performances that are actually the best of the whole series. Corey Feldman in his prime is appealing, showing that it was a shame that his personal life went as down the toilet in the way that it did since. Crispin Glover is lots of fun in his role and Ted White is one of the scariest Jasons.Visually, 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' has grit and professionalism and the effects and make-up are simply terrific and steal the show even more than Jason. There is plenty of suspense and tension that was missing in the third film, with a return to deaths and moments that are creative and unsettling. The film contains the best ending of the series, certainly of the sequels, truly nightmarish. There is far less padding too. Overall, decent, one of the series' best and the last one to be average or above. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
1,Leofwine_draca,Shame the BBFC got their hands on it...,7,19 July 2016,"This routine instalment in the saga has its fair share of shocks, suspense and gory deaths, but the impact is lessened here by the BBFC's decision to butcher just about every death in the film. Instead of some true in-your-face blood and guts to enjoy, the death scenes are all brief and very obviously cut. This ruins the overall nature of the film, as without the gore there's not much point in it - it's like watching THE SOUND OF MUSIC with all the dancing cut out.So, aside from the brief glimpses of gore we're allowed to see, what is there to recommend this film? The acting is of the same standard as the previous entries in this film, so the less said about it the better. Some mild amusement comes from watching Crispin Glover practice some ""crazy"" dance moves and make a fool of himself, and the introduction of Corey Feldman is at least a new addition to the formula.On the plus side, there's a creepy freeze-frame ending and a wonderfully hideous Jason visage when the unmasking occurs at the end. Somehow the producers also managed to coax Tom Savini back into the series, convincing him that this was indeed the final film (yeah, right) so the gore looks more realistic than before. This would have been a good place to end the series; but it somehow made money, and the rest is history...Recap:I've recently had the joy of watching an uncut, high definition print of this film and I enjoyed it considerably more than I did 20-odd years ago. It looks great, and the template is essentially one suspense set-piece after the next; I found this less repetitive and more involving than something more modern and torture-porn focused. Finally, Savini's gore effects are notably imaginative and realistic, particularly that incredible ending. THE FINAL CHAPTER has now jumped to being my second favourite in the series; amazing what can happen without BBFC interference.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
2,SnoopyStyle,Good production value,5,15 October 2013,"Following the events of Part III, Jason Voorhees is thought to be dead and brought to the hospital morgue. There he resurrects and starts killing all over again. He returns to find another group of young partying kids. Next to the kids live a family with little boy Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman). The other future star Crispin Glover plays one of the college kids.Despite having a small budget, the production value is probably the highest of the franchise to that date. It helps to have better actors around. Corey Feldman was actually great. In a world of throwaway victims, he needed to be bigger and he was.The story is still the same. College kids come to party. Jason comes to kill them. It's not anything unexpected. The shower scene is especially good comparable to the greatest shower scene ever from Psycho. However it's still Friday the 13th with the weak dialog, and predictable story.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Poor Quality Movie Where Everything Fits: Bad Acting, Ridiculous Dialogs and Cheesy Screenplay",3,22 January 2004,"The fourth part of Friday 13th, called `The Final Chapter', is amazingly bad: ham actors and actresses, ridiculous dialogs and situations and a cheesy screenplay. The special effects are very poor, and the performance and direction are very amateurish. It looks like a movie made by a class of students of cinema. The first three parts of this series were reasonable, but this one is a trash. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): `Sexta-Feira 13  Capítulo Final' (`Friday 13th  Final Chapter')",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
4,kosmasp,Coming full circle,7,8 November 2020,"Well sort of - you don't get the original director but they called Tom Savinin back! Of course Manfredinin was there from the start and continued to be - his legendary ""Jason sound"" is just that: Legendary and iconic as much as the hockey mask. Even though the latter came later into the play. But also full circle because the movie states this is the final chapter ... for the first time in the series! Not the only first, we get another Jason as well (again).This has probably the best opening of any Friday movies. It continues directly where the last one ended, but with a long shot, that ends on something especially eerie - uneasy to watch, when there's not even that much blood involved. Having said that, unfortunately for everyone here to see a lot of cool deaths (it's a movie, so don't freak out - although I reckon you are supposed to a little bit) ... the movie is censored or rather cut, because ... ratings. And because the MPAA needed a scapegoat. A lot of things would seem at least normal in todays landscape, but back then not so much.So it seems or at least the title suggests we are putting the final nail in Jasons coffin ... is that really the case? No matter what Paramount might have thought of the franchise, even back then, it was quite the cash cow for them ... so let's see what Final Chapter actually means, right? You may be surpised .. or not. Technically this is really fun and it also has the occasional humor ... not to mention Corey Feldman in one of his first roles ...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
5,gavin6942,The Point Where the Series Started Getting Watchable,6,23 April 2007,"How many times do you have to stab Jason Voorhees before he dies? Apparently many times, because he returns yet again. This time a family (mother, son, daughter), a house full of teenagers, and a hunter (who happens to be the brother of a prior Jason victim) are the unfortunate ones to be in Jason's path. Is this, as the title suggests, the ""final chapter""? Many people give this film a low rating, and maybe they're looking at it differently than I do. To me, you can make only so many movies of a guy hacking up teenagers before the idea gets a little stale. Part four (this film) is when the crew realized you could break up the monotony with a little humor. So now in part four you have a fair amount of laughs, some improved gore (compared to the first few films) and the same old formula of killing kids.You also have two key guest stars: Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover. You cannot play down the Feldman power here. Sure, he's young. But he really steals the show and watch his expressions when he finds some neighbors doing something naughty. Feldman's absence from this film would likely have lead to dullness and the premature death of the series.Glover, meanwhile, is the humorous aspect. Well, okay, not just Glover -- the whole opening scene with Axel the Coroner is morbidly amusing (and really anticipates part nine's coroner). But Crispin Glover is fun to watch, and his ""white boy dance"" is pretty amusing.The inclusion of character Rob Dier (brother of part two's Sandra Dier) is a good move, adding some continuity to the movie, further connecting it to the previous films. And for horror fanboys who like nudity (and you know you do), this is the episode that contains by far the most nudity in the series. For some people, that's all it takes to sell a picture.So I understand if people rank this film lower because they think it's getting stale or if the humor makes them think the creators aren't taking the series seriously anymore. As for me, that's what makes this one of my favorite episodes in the series (probably in my top three out of eleven films). We have a crew that just wants to have fun, and if we go along for the ride we have a little fun ourselves. Seems fair.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
6,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,4,9 September 2015,"The first film was good, but it was the famous killer's mother who was the villain, the second film was okay, when he was alive and grown up, and the third film was okay, and he gained his iconic hockey mask, this fourth film just continues proceedings where the last left off. Basically the paramedics are taking the body of Jason Voorhees (Ted White) to the county morgue, but he is still alive and escapes to return to Camp Crystal Lake and continue his vengeance for the death of his mother. A new group of teenagers: Paul (Clyde / Alan Hayes), his girlfriend Samantha ""Sam"" (Judie Aronson), Sara (Barbara Howard), her crush Doug (Peter Barton), Jimmy Mortimer (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover) and Ted (Lawrence Monoson) have rented a cabin for the weekend, their neighbours are Trish Jarvis (Kimberly Beck) and her younger brother Tommy (The Goonies' Corey Feldman) and their dog Gordon, and there are also local twin girls Tina (Camilla More) and Terri (Carey More), and Rob (Erich Anderson). Jason soon shows up while many of the sex-obsessed teenagers are getting kinky, his kill methods include a cleaver into a face, stabbing someone's back skull, crushing a skull, a double-bit axe into the chest and many more. It is young Tommy, who for some reason shaves his hair off to appear like a picture of young Jason, that takes Jason's machete, stabs it through the side of the killer's head, and attacks his body screaming ""Die! Die!"", Trish is terrified, he is dead, for now. Also starring Tom Everett as Flashlight Man, Joan Freeman as Mrs. Jarvis, Lisa Freeman as Nurse Morgan and Thad Geer as Running Man. It is good to see Jason now fully embracing his iconic image and killing pretty much anyone in sight, and some of the bloody deaths make good viewing, but there is no storyline or other stuff going on, it is very predictable and almost pointless, the title ""the final chapter"" should be ignored also, a slightly disappointing horror. Okay!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
7,Woodyanders,Superior entry in the popular slasher series,8,10 September 2011,"Widely hailed as one of the best sequels in this immensely successful series, this one lives up to its sterling reputation quite well. For starters, director Joseph Zito, fresh off his previous fierce slice'n'dice effort ""The Prowler,"" brings an extremely harsh, nasty, and sleazy sensibility to the familiar proceedings: The tone is much darker than usual, there's a strong atmosphere of gloomy dread, the murder set pieces are truly gory, brutal, and intense, and Ted White's Jason sizes up as one remarkably scary, relentless, and ferocious death-dealing machine. Moreover, the brisk pace rarely flags and the considerable tension culminates in a positively startling conclusion. This movie scores extra points for a pre-stardom Cory Feldman's appealing performance as precocious young fright film fan Tommy Jarvis, who makes for a welcome and refreshing departure from the usual plucky final girl. The competent acting from an unusually able cast rates as another substantial asset: the incredibly fetching Kimberly Beck impresses as Tommy's sweet and personable sister Tirsh, the ever-quirky Crispin Glover almost steals the whole show with his fabulously flaky portrayal of engaging goofball Jimmy (Glover's legendary spastic dance sequence is simply priceless!), and Lawrence Monoson is hilariously obnoxious as Jimmy's smarmy pal Ted, plus there are neat contributions from Peter Barton as hunky nice guy Doug, Erich Anderson as likable drifter Rob Dyer, the foxy Barbara Howard as the shy and virginal goody-goody two shoes Sara, and Bruce Mahler as sarcastic coroner Axel. Of course, this flick doesn't skimp on the tasty gratuitous female nudity: The super hot Judie Aronson as the slutty Samantha goes for an ill-advised late night skinny dip while gorgeous twins Camilla and Carey More offer double the fun, pleasure, and sexiness as the ultra enticing pair Tina and Terri. Tom Savini's stand-out ghastly make-up f/x come through with the grisly good stuff; an early head-twisting and Jason being run through the noggin with a machete are perhaps the gruesome highlights. Joao Fernandes' sharp cinematography makes nifty use of a smoothly prowling Steadicam and provides a pleasing polished look. Harry Manfredini's spirited shivery score hits the spine-tingling spot. One of the crowning achievements in this famous franchise.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
8,Tweekums,More gore at Crystal Lake,7,6 January 2019,"Jason Voorhees may have died at the end of the third instalment of this series but you can't keep a good murderous psychopath down. He awakens in the morgue and kills a couple of mortuary staff before heading back to his old stomping ground. Here he will cross paths with a local family, a camper who is the brother of a previous victim and the mandatory group of twenty somethings out holidaying by the lake. Of course he doesn't attack them too soon; there has to be time for the young people to go skinny dripping, have a bit of a dance and have some sex before he starts picking them off in the expected ways.What you think of this film will largely be down to what you thought of the earlier instalments as it is effectively just more of the same. There is a touch more humour and a lot more gratuitous nudity... including a pair of nubile twins. The comedy moments may have been a bit cheesy but didn't feel out of place in the film. There are plenty of decent scares; these include the usual false scares, jump scares and gory deaths. The deaths all involve items that make sense rather than being inventive for the sake of being inventive. The physical effects are all pretty impressive. The acting isn't the greatest but it was solid enough given the genre. The most notable cast members are young Corey Feldmen and Crispin Glover in early roles. There are a few mild surprises and a somewhat disturbing 'final death'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the first three films; if you didn't enjoy those it is unlikely this will get you into the series.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
9,BA_Harrison,One of the better F13th movies.,7,7 April 2007,"Having already proved his stalk 'n' slash credentials with gory horror The Prowler, director Joseph Zito decided to have another stab at the genre with the fourth in the Friday the 13th franchise, entitled The Final Chapter (shyeah right!). What he delivers is an enjoyable 'by the numbers' slasher, which ticks all of the boxes: naked babes, annoying jocks, pretty heroine, POV shots, and bloody FX by Tom Savini.In this one, which picks up right where Pt.3 left off, Jason's body is taken to the morgue, where he immediately wakes up to continue his killing spree. After offing a couple of hospital staff, he heads back to his old stomping ground near Crystal Lake to take care of a load of teenagers who have just arrived for a vacation.Zito, obviously realising from the get-go that this was never going to be anything other than a money-making exercise, has fun packing in as many naked nubile females (including a couple of sexy twins) and mechanical scares as he canwhich is fine by me; The Final Chapter is a great fun popcorn horror that doesn't disappoint.Watch out for star-turns from a young Crispin Glover (who does some hilarious crazy dancing and gets to bed one of the twins) and an even younger Corey Feldman, who shaves his head for the final showdown with Jason.By today's standards, this movie might not be considered all that bloody, but Savini's effects, although brief, are pretty effective; however, a final 'machete-in-the-head' gag at the end of the film is a real showstopper (a rewind-and-play-again moment, if ever there was one!).",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
10,Quinoa1984,One of the lesser ones,7,8 October 2000,"I don't mean lesser ones by of the series of of horror films, I mean this is one of the lesser efforts in film history.  While the makeup is pretty good (courtesy of mastermind Tom Savini), and the beggining flashback is entrancing, this film shouldn't have needed to be made, especially because it swings the door open to another sequel!  C-",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
11,BandSAboutMovies,It never ends.,6,13 April 2018,"Paramount - and producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. - were both aware that people were growing tired of slashers. In fact, Mancuso, Jr. began to hate the series because no one respected him for making the films, despite how much money they made. So the order was made: let's kill Jason.Directed by Joseph Zito, who also made the slasher classic The Prowler (a much bloodier, much more interesting move than this), an interesting attempt was made to get you to actually care about some of the characters. But not all, of course. There's always going to be cannon fodder in these films.The evening after the last film, Jason comes back to life and kills a coroner and a nurse before making his way back to Crystal Lake. And, de rigueur, more teenagers show up - Paul, Sara, Sam (Judie Aronson, American Ninja), Jimmy (Crispin Glover!), Doug (Peter Barton, Hell Night and TV's The Powers of Matthew Star) and Ted. They even pass Pamela Vorhees tombstone along the way.Oh yeah - then there's Trish (Kimberly Beck, Marnie), Tommy (Corey Feldman!), their mom (Joan Freeman, Panic in the Year Zero!) and their dog Gordon. And there are the skinny dipping teens, Tina and Terri. Oh yeah - and a young drifter named Rob with a secret.Tommy's family are the sympathetic characters mentioned earlier, with the kid being a stand-in for the beloved Tom Savini. He shows off his collection of special FX early and often.Of course, those teenagers all do drugs, have sex and die horribly. We're used to those things. But the murder of Tommy's mom has some emotion. And then we learn that Rob is the brother of Sandra from Friday the 13th Part 2 and has been obsessed with finding and killing Jason. Oh, he finds him, and dies like a complete fool, screaming ""He's killing me!""The close, where Trish cuts off Jason's mask to reveal his face and Tommy has to flip out to hack Jason to death, was the stuff of legend in my pre-teen days, oft-discussed at lunches and study halls.Tom Savini returned here for the chance to kill off Jason, but come on, everyone. We all knew what was coming next.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
12,Coventry,Certainly not Jason's worst episode.,5,20 September 2003,"This fourth installment in the incredibly popular slasher series Friday the 13th was widely announced as the final chapter. Well, I think every person with a bit of logical intellect soon knew that this wouldn't be the end of Jason Vorhees. He shall return and maybe even soon than most people thought...At the time I'm writing this review, the 11th Jason story is being shown in the theaters. In this one, he fights the other famous killer, Freddy Krueger.Anyway, back to Part 4...which surely is one of the better efforts in the whole series. And I'm not saying it's a good movie with fascinating plot twists or outstanding acting, because it's not. But it delivers what you except and it keeps you entertained for a good hour and a half. The good old formula is respected. A bunch of horny teenagers with a lack of intelligence are about to spend a vacation close to Crystal Lake. The all have such annoying personalities that you can't wait for Jason to slash them violently. And I must say our Jason uses very creative methods in this movie. I guess that's why I liked this part better than number 3. Crispin Glover is pretty good in this one too, he contributes in making this movie highly enjoyable. F13 part 4 even has a few surprising moments. When watching this film, you might start thinking some characters will survive it ( the sensitive boy, the sweet virgin girl...) Well, Jason doesn't care much for teenagers in love. The climax is very very dumb and almost spoils the entire movie. I wish they didn't do that. If it would have been the real FINAL CHAPTER, this would be terrible way to end it. Overall a good 'sit back and enjoy' slasher with several lovely disgusting scenes. We have Tom Savini himself to thank for that by the way...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
13,michaelRokeefe,The Final Chapter...are you sure,7,30 December 2019,"Right when you think you can't sit through another one; think again. Strap yourself in for some good slashing and dicing. Psychopathic killer Jason Voorhees (Ted White) is hauled to the morgue finally believed dead. Signs of life and breathing go unnoticed. Jason escapes the morgue leaving behind blood and guts. Meanwhile a group of teens have rented a cabin for the weekend. They know little of nothing about Camp Crystal Lake, where Jason goes back home to rehab. You know the rest. Not wanting to spoil it; but talk about some harsh and horrific killing of young people. This is one of the best of the franchise.The cast also features: Erich Anderson, Kimberly Beck, Crispin Glover, Corey Feldman, Judie Aronson, Lawrence Monoson and Peter Barton.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

15,hitchcockthelegend,You got the curse?,5,27 August 2016,"Well we all thought Jason was dead, as he is here taken to the morgue after being mortally killed... But of course he revives and sets about establishing that he is in fact an indestructible killing machine. I wouldn't want to be living near Camp Crystal Lake right now...In truth it's a good old 1980s slasher pic, but that doesn't necessarily make it worthy to anyone outside of the hardiest of hardest Friday13th franchise fans. The kills and gore quotient are high, bloody and gooey, with the kills not lacking for invention, but plot formula is tired and weary. Crispin Glover makes for something of a curio appearance in the piece, whilst a young Corey Feldman rocks up for a bit of Damien Thorn channelling.Some series fans love it whilst others abhor it. Question is? We know it wasn't to be the final chapter after all, so how does it hold up against the others that would follow it down the bloody intestine strewn path? 5/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
16,Hey_Sweden,"Never trust those in the horror genre when they use the word ""final"".",8,16 June 2012,"With a number of long running film franchises, there's often that one entry in which a fan can say that the formula was perfected. Such was the case with this brutal and creepy ""final"" entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" series.All the things we come to expect are trotted out, and then some, with director Joseph Zito injecting some different elements into the formula, including some sexy twins and a preteen, Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman), skilled at making masks and props. Tommy is just one of the people imperilled when good ol' Jason Voorhees (played without credit by stuntman Ted White) is taken to the morgue after his last escapade. He soon revives and slaughters everybody in his way. Tommys' family and a houseful of party hearty young adults will be on the killing list, but hoping to stop the hockey masked ones' rampage is Rob (E. Erich Anderson), who hopes to get some revenge for the death of a previous victim.To start with, it's great how Parts II, III, and IV in this franchise flow together, with this sequel beginning hours after the massacre in Part III has ended. Zito and company don't waste time in getting to the good stuff, with Tom Savini returning to the role of makeup effects supervisor for the chance to kill off a memorable character that he'd created. And the gore is fantastic - head twisted around, corkscrew to the hand, cleaver to the face, face smushed, spear to the groin, and the usual stabbings. That's not to mention Jasons' ""demise"" this time around, which is a true show stopper. Harry Manfredinis' score is good and familiar.The cast mostly plays standard issue characters, but standing out, obviously, is the one and only Crispin Glover, amusing as always in the role of the lonely and horny Jimbo. Kimberly Beck makes for a sexy and feisty ""final girl"", and Judie Aronson, Lisa Freeman, Barbara Howard, and Camilla and Carey More as those aforementioned twins add other well appreciated eye candy. Contributing funny if obnoxious comedy relief are Bruce Mahler as sleazy morgue attendant Axel and Lawrence Monoson as Ted, the man whose computer don't lie. Glover has one of his most well remembered movie scenes ever as he busts out some amazing dance moves to the tune of Lions' ""Love is a Lie"". White is an absolute beast as Jason, delivering a performance of incredible relentlessness and brutality. And Feldman is good as Jarvis, the young man who would become a recurring character through the next two sequels.Atmosphere is strong, and the movie moves along quite well. It's always fun and never, ever boring. It's got a sense of humour, but still takes its gory bits of business seriously. The big finale is particularly exciting.All in all, ""The Final Chapter"" sizes up as one of the best entries in the spectacularly popular and successful F13 franchise.Eight out of 10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
17,preppy-3,The Final (HA) Chapter,3,31 July 2006,"This starts off great with a replay of parts 1-3 then picks up where part 3 ended with Jason supposedly dead. He's carted off to the morgue where he quickly comes to life, kills a few people and is off to Crystal Lake to kill more. I'm not sure it's Crystal Lake--it's never made clear. Also WHY is he killing these people? Anyways, there's a family living there now--Mrs. Jarvis (Joan Freeman), daughter Trish (Kimberly Beck) and son Tommy (Corey Feldman). The house next to them is being rented by a bunch of brainless teenagers. You can pretty much figure out what happens next.Some of the negative things about this pic: The body count has been upped--6 guys and 6 girls and (in a hysterically fake scene) 1 dog; as in part 3, characters are just introduced to be killed (the hitch hiker and the twins); there's a skinny dipping scene which gives us female AND male nudity and Jason seems to know exactly where everyone will be so he can kill them (I love it when he happens to be outside the house, standing on a ledge to kill someone!) Also people scream bloody murder while being killed--and no one hears a thing. Terrible dialogue and acting too (as usual).There are some good things about the film...Tom Savini's special effects are very realistic; Joan Freeman, Peter Barton and Kimberly Beck aren't bad (I LOVE how Beck fights Jason back at the end); Feldman is OK too; the last 20 minutes or so are good (that's why I'm giving this a 3) with some real gruesome stuff when Jason is killed. I'm surprised the MPAA let some of the stuff in the picture...but I guess they thought this was it so they let it pass.There are two truly bad mistakes in the film--When Jason kills the dog notice the dog's ""corpse"" is wagging its tail as it's thrown out the window! Joan Freeman's character disappears completely from the movie--we're left to assume she's dead. They did film a scene where Beck discovers her corpse but it was cut out--director Joe Zito figures everyone knew she was dead so why bother keeping it in. (??????) This was supposed to be it for the series but it made plenty of money so Paramount continued it. For this series this isn't bad--but that's not saying much. I give it a 3.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
18,poolandrews,The perfect 80's slasher film? Maybe...,8,18 May 2006,"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter starts as the authorities are cleaning up the dead bodies left by murderer Jason Voorhees (Ted White), he himself was supposedly killed & his body is taken to Wessex County Medical Center. Everyone thinks Jason is dead but they are wrong & it's not long before he has killed yet again & is on the loose looking for more victims. Six teenage friends, lovers Paul (Clyde Hayes) & Samantha (Judie Aronson), Doug (Peter Barton) & Sara (Barbara Howard) plus Ted (Lawrence Monoson) & Jimmy (Crispin Glover) have hired a log cabin out for the weekend in the Crystal Lake area & become prime targets for the hockey mask wearing homicidal maniac Jason Voorhees who has no intention of stopping his killing spree...Directed by Joseph Zito this was the fourth instalment of the highly successful Friday the 13th series of slasher films & there's a strong case to say that it could be the best one of them all. The script by Barney Cohen follows the same simplistic pattern as before but Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter manages to be a lot darker in tone & a lot more brutal than a lot of slashers before or since. The kills come thick & fast, there's never too long to wait before the next victim & the kills are nice & brutal. There's enough nudity to satisfy including a couple of cute twins, the teenage character's aren't that annoying for a change & as a whole the film works very well within the context of what it sets out to achieve. I really like the Friday the 13th series as a whole & this is definitely among the best of them if not the best outright. I liked it, a lot.Director Zito does a pretty good job, he keeps things moving along & manages to inject some tension & atmosphere to the film. The infamous hockey mask barely features in this one as Jason is kept as a killing machine & nothing more, he has no real character or likability in this one. The gore is strong in this one unlike other entries in the series which were cut to shreds, Jason hacksaws someones throat, people are stabbed, have meat cleavers stuck in their heads, people are impaled on various objects, someone has a knife plunged into the back of their head while someone else has a knife stuck through their throat & Jasons death in this one is great thanks to some top special effects by Tom Savini.With a supposed budget of about $1,800,000 Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter apparently made over $11,000,000 on it's opening weekend, now you know the reason why this wasn't the final chapter. Generally speaking it's well made & competent throughout. The acting is pretty good all round & better than one might expect from a film of this nature, even Cory Feldman didn't annoy me.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter isn't art, it isn't going to win any awards & it's not going to change your outlook on life but it is just about the perfect slasher. An absolute must for Friday the 13th fans & those interested in the horror genre.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
19,Bunuel1976,"Friday THE 13TH - THE FINAL CHAPTER (Joseph Zito, 1984) BOMB",1,22 October 2006,"This one's considered by many fans to be among the best in the ""Jason"" series (huh?!): actually, it's the worst I've watched so far. All I can say is that I wasn't involved for a minute in any of it - my pet cat's antics, which was in the room with me while I was watching this, were far more enthralling. Anyhow, the best part of it was the opening montage of the various death scenes from the earlier instalments and the climactic rampage in which Jason meets his doom.But seriously, how are we supposed to fear for the characters' lives when they're so dumb (from the would-be stud morgue attendant at the beginning to the comic relief loser who finds ancient skinflicks a reason for mirth)? What's even worse, the teenagers here seem to take much more screen time than ever before, making the film all the more excruciating to watch than it already is! Conversely, how can we even root for Jason when he's an emotionless killing machine with - when we finally get to see it - a ludicrous train wreck of a face, who's unstoppable merely for the sake of the greedy film-makers not ready to put a 'good' monster down and part with a 'cash cow' formula? The finale, then, with the incredibly resourceful boy (a young Corey Feldman) apparently possessed by the spirit of the dead(?) Jason unfortunately put paid to the idea that this could really be the last chapter in the neverending, undistinguished and interchangeable saga!! Man, I've still got six more of these turds to go through - I don't know how I'll be able to stand it...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
20,utgard14,"""You do it with EVERYONE.""",7,12 April 2014,"The fourth Friday the 13th movie is also a contender for best of the lot. It's certainly the best of the sequels. What helps make it so good is the cast, which is a step above the norm for the series. Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover are probably the most well-known. Feldman's character Tommy would appear a couple of more times in the series played by other actors. He plays an important part in this film and its memorable ending. The rest of the cast is good too. The women are possibly the prettiest of the whole series. One of my '80s crushes, Judie Aronson, is a standout for reasons that will become obvious when you watch. There's even a couple of sexy British twins. Well-directed by Joseph Zito with good jump scares, a great finale, and some nice effects by Tom Savini & co. A really fun slasher flick that was laughably meant to be the end of the series...for about five minutes.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
21,Boba_Fett1138,A great final chapter...if it weren't for the 7 other sequels they made after this one.,7,30 October 2009,"This was a real surprisingly great entry into the Friday the 13th series. It perhaps is even better than the first and it's definitely better than any of the previous sequels to the franchise. Calling this the final chapter might seem like an odd thing though, considering that 7 more sequels got made after this one.I don't even think they ever intended to make this the final entry into the Friday the 13th series, as its ending suggests. Seems like just another publicity trick to get people to the cinemas to see Jason in action for the 'last time'.I have to say that this is probably one of the finest entries into the series. For it's genre it's simply a great and effective movie. It helps that the writers did more of a better job this time and didn't made this movie as simple as the previous 3 entries, that were all more or less the same story-wise.As an horror movie it's a real good one, that knows to create the right atmosphere and tension for the movie. Jason again works out as a great horror character and he continues his horrible killing spree in this movie again with some nicely done graphic killings. For this movie Tom Savini was on board again, who also worked on the first movie from 1980 as the special makeup effects artist. The killings within this movie are more bloody and graphic again than was the case with the previous sequels.Of course acting-wise the movie doesn't impress much. As was the case with most of the Friday the 13th movies, the movie has a real B-movie look and feel over it but it benefits from its cheap look and feel.A greatly under-appreciated sequel!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"I'd be going crazy too, with dialog *that* lousy",5,19 January 2011,"Immediately following the third(and opening with a recap of the first three, at least re-edited to a sort of Greatest Hits montage this time), this has young people(hot girls(that look exactly alike, you'd think they were clones or something) that get naked... seriously, there is more nudity in this than any of the others(do note that it's of both genders), and guys who have short names that are easy to scream) moving to the woods, you-know-where. Jason(who again doesn't mind going against the title as far as the date for slaughterin' goes) decides that now's the time to start killing people there(since some of them had lived there for a while). The characters are bad and poorly acted, including Tommy, a kid who does make-up(no, it *doesn't* make sense) and whose family is annoying, Teddy who thinks he's a gift to women, and Rob, clearly hunting our unlucky number beast of a man, and yet who is fairly useless when it comes right down to it(can you say ""wasted potential""?). Well, the one exception is Crispin Glover, who's hilarious, so much fun to watch(some will love this just for seeing him dance). There are a few creative death scenes(not many considering the body-count, heightened by there being extras in this purely for the sake of them dying), if the lack of suspense other than at the so-so climax(it doesn't reach the level of the one directly prior to this, not even remotely... we see Jason in it a bit, and the performance is OK, if also silly at points; and this has the lamest ending thus far in the series) means that you usually don't get to be scared(the fake-outs are plentiful but always obvious, you can tell if something will happen or not in this), if the butchering is drawn out to several seconds most of the time. No real stalking, hardly any build-up. The filming and editing is average to subpar. FX aren't bad. As you already know, this is *not* the final chapter. There is blood, gore, violence and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the franchise. 5/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
23,view_and_review,Jason Needs a Hip-Hop Album,5,16 July 2019,"Why these hyper-sexed teens keep going anywhere near Crystal Lake is beyond me. But here it is again, more sheep for the slaughter go to Camp Blood area for skinny dipping and sex.As a side note: I have no idea what's with lakes in the woods that makes pretty, young women want to take their clothes off.Back to Jason because that's what Friday the 13th is all about. We need to recap Jason's invincibility because that's what he'd have to be to make a third movie (I say third because the first movie was his mother doing the killing).Part two: Jason gets hacked with a machete so hard it's a wonder his arm wasn't dangling off. It would've taken a team of surgeons to make him whole.Part three: he gets stabbed through his left hand, stabbed through his right leg right above the knee, smacked in the head full board with a shovel. Those were all superficial wounds. But for the more fatal stuff: he was hanged executioner style which should've broke his neck, and for the coup de grace he was hacked in the head with an axe.Got all that? Arm, hand, leg, hanging, axe to head. Jason should come out with his own hip-hop album. Tupac was shot five times, became a hit. 50 cent was shot nine times, became a hit. So, what about being stabbed, hanged, and hacked? That's multi-platinum for life. His album should continue selling until he has grandkids.I think part four offered more sex which of course means more kills. The more sex didn't make the movie any better, it just made it more insufferable. It also helped further establish the trope of sex = death in a horror movie.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
24,evanston_dad,If Only the Title Were True,4,14 March 2006,"Maybe to save themselves the embarrassment of admitting just how many of these stinkers they sunk money into, the studio dropped the ""4"" from this sequel and gave it the cryptic subtitle ""The Final Chapter."" Yeah, right. Like anybody believed that, even at the time.Someone once told me that all of the even ""Star Trek"" movies were good and all of the odd ones were sucky. Since I've only seen two of them (both even by the way), I can't comment. But that rule seems to apply to this series. Parts 1 and 3 were beyond atrocious; parts 2 and 4 aren't that bad, as these kinds of movies go.This movie freshens up the tired formula somewhat by adding a plot strand that features Corey Feldman and continues through the next couple of films in the series. And this one has a more unique style to it. I liked the murder that took place in silhouette, a shadow thrown on to a wall during a flash of lightning. The makeup effects were also much more accomplished, and there was some catharsis in seeing Jason get his head split open with a machete (though why does he look like a product of radioactive fallout? Didn't he drown originally?) This movie will still lower your I.Q. by a few points, but you'll be able to respect yourself in the morning.Grade: C (compared to parts 1 and 3.

Unfortunately, Jason doesn't die very easily and after killing a couple of hospital employees heads back to his old stomping grounds where, as luck would have it, some young men and women have decided to camp out for awhile. Needless to say, this is exactly the scenario that Jason so desperately craves and he resumes his killing spree in no time at all. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-despite the movie title-this is not the ""Final Chapter"" in any way as there are several other sequels which follow. Not that it really matters as those of us who enjoy films of this sort will certainly not complain. Be that as it may, I thought that this was a fairly solid sequel which benefited from the somewhat bizarre ending and I have rated it accordingly.

26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Among the best sequels in the series,10,27 September 2012,"After moving into a new house on Crystal Lake, a family finds the teens next door have attracted maniacal killer Jason Voorhees to the area and must band together to save each before falling victim to the masked killer.This one turned out to be among the better entries in the series and is probably the series' best. This one has a lot right, starting with a great smattering of suspense in some creepy, chilling stalking and set-up scenes from the big body count that gets wiped out here, as there's the opening ambush in the morgue, the attack on the hitchhiker and the chilling stalking at the lake with the skinny-dippers there with the freezing winds, rolling fog and truly isolated feels makes it a great scene along with the brutal deaths here. Likewise, the massacre through the house are much more fun here as he manages to wind through the group with absolutely ruthless efficiency going through the upstairs bedrooms, down into the kitchen and finally through the shower wiping everyone out here as there's plenty of great action and suspense throughout this here which all sets up the absolutely greatest part here with what is perhaps the greatest final chase in a series known for having good ones. This here is quite simply one of the best of the entire series as there's a ton to absolutely love here in this chase, with tons of sprawling action here as the lengthy piece runs through several houses and up throughout varying floors on each location along with the constant barricades he has to smash through, chilling suspense in the fact that a child is frequently in the middle of the action that has to be protected along with herself, psychological tactics here with the attempt to mess with his head that comes off quite logically and even some jumps here with the constant bodies thrown through windows and Jason crashing through doors to get at them, culminating in one of the most notorious gore gags in the genre as a brilliant ending to such an excellent series of events. As well, there's a huge amount of blood and gore on display in pretty fun, graphic manners with some of the most brutal kills here as there's such intensity here that gives this an additional measure of fun here with the fact that Jason here is one of the most imposing figures in the genre as he is throughout here. These here all give this plenty of eerie chills and creepiness here as this one really makes for an exciting series of scenes which gives this such a spectacular pace here that it never becomes too dull or boring as something's always happening in this one. Added together alongside some truly hilarious moments both intentional and not and a huge heaping of nudity, this one gets a lot of stuff right as a slasher. There's still a few flaws here, mainly in the continued stupidity by the characters to want to invite themselves to a place that harbored a mass murder rampage the last few days before, considering each of these films takes place the following day, and there's no reason why that should be. As well, many of the supposedly funny character traits are just plain irritating, making that section of the film a little tough to get through when it's supposed to be funny but clearly isn't. These aren't anywhere near enough to knock this down from among the better slasher entries.Rated R: Continued Full Nudity, Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, a few sex scenes and drug use.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
27,AaronCapenBanner,"""Final"" Did You Say?",2,13 September 2013,"Part IV begins right where Part III ended, as police are collecting bodies(including Jason's) and trying to make sense out of all the senseless deaths. However, despite having an ax in his head, Jason is somehow still alive, and after leaving the hospital(with bodies in his wake) proceeds to return to Camp Crystal Lake, where a visiting group of teenagers(who of course are oblivious to the recent killings) are staying near another family in their cabin. When the killings start again, only the monster-loving boy named Tommy Jarvis can stop Jason once and for all...By any objective critical standards, this film is(as critic Roger Ebert pointed out in 1984)appalling trash, graphically and brutally killing perfectly healthy teenagers in horrible fashion. Sure, that's a given, but that is also what fans wanted, and what this film delivers, since there is no plot to speak of.Despite the title, this was a huge hit, so of course there had to be another one...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Soon Jason finds his way there, and slaughter all who get in his way, but not for long. There are two survivors left, a girl and her little brother, Tommy Jarvis............This was the last Friday film featuring Jason that was semi-serious, and before the advent of tongue in cheek horror, the makers must have thought that the franchise was running out of ideas, despite the huge revenue that the films took.So here it's business as usual at Camp, acting is poor, despite the fact that Crispin Glover is part of Jason's haul, and you can tell who is going to get it just by the poor delivery of lines.But even though it's an R/18 rated movie, the. Akers know that the fan base for these movies are teenage boys, so they go heavy on the nudity and gore, which to be honest, is what these films are all about, nothing to do with coherency or good narrative.Feldman though steals the film as troubled Tommy, really bringing life to Jason's Death, and the ending is pretty tense, despite being as predictable as a loaf of bread.So all in all, if your a fan of the film, it's a fitting end to the straight story, after this, things got silly, but still fun...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

30,Wuchakk,"Another entertaining sequel, better than ""Part III""",6,3 August 2014,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer — who increasingly becomes an infernal monster — just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with ""Part III"", which pretty much plagues the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Released in 1984, ""Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter"" thankfully omits the cartoonish elements of ""Part III"" and serves up another take on the same basic story. This time several youths go out to one of their parents' vacation home on Crystal Lake to party where they meet the sister and brother from a nearby house, Trish & Tommy Jarvis (Kimberly Beck and Corey Feldman). Then Jason attacks! Like ""Part III,"" this film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Topanga Canyon, which is 30 minutes south of Santa Clarita. The geography is obviously dryer than the first two films, but this won't make much of an impact on most viewers.As usual, the film features a nice assortment of women. This time out there are no ""minorities"" like the previous film; the ladies consist of five white girls and a good-looking mother. Trish is easily my favorite -- the best heroine yet (until the next film, that is) -- but they all have their points of interest.Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but — with the exception of the 2009 reboot — I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE: Despite it's title, ""Part IV"" is far from the ""Final Chapter."" There would be four more sequels before the 80s even ran out! In any case, ""Part IV"" is another entertaining segment in the series with a new assortment of characters and a new female protagonist. This sequel is notable for introducing the character of Tommy Jarvis and hinting at the lingering diabolic Voorhees spirit. Like its predecessor, ""Part IV"" was shot in dry Southern California and Jason, with his iconic mask, is bigger and more imposing than in ""Part II."" While the movie is a step up from ""Part III"" it's not as effective as the first two films, largely because of the uneventful mid-section and the lame portrayal of Jason in the last act, although his unmasked face is great.The film runs 9l minutes and the uncut version 97 minutes.GRADE: B-",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
31,trashgang,great ending,6,20 January 2011,"Again I am still wondered how it was possible that the Friday the 13th franchise got so many fans. Look, the reviews don't give more then 5 or 6 which isn't that good. This last in the series, as they told us then, was directed by Joseph Zito. He just delivered us The Prowler (1981) together with effects from Tom Savini. He was asked to direct part 4 and he asked Tom back again. The Prowler was released in the UK under the alternative title of Rosemary's Killer and suffered various cuts including ""a pitchfork into the stomach, a carving knife plunged through the top of a man's head and then slowly withdrawn, and a woman's throat being sawn with a knife in a swimming pool"". Another famous shot was the fingers being cut by the killer. Savini still says that this was his best work. So again, i thought, well, they combine again so it will be worth watching. But on that point it failed again. Again, it starts with flashbacks taken from earlier parts. The killings itself aren't that gory as in The Prowler but you can see that Savini enjoyed his work here. The reason he agreed to do Friday part 4 was that he created Jason and thought that it would be fine to end the circle and kill him. Those parts were Jason is killed are well done and gory. The machete in Jason's hand and the machete in his head, well, that's what I call horror. again, it takes a while before things happen, okay, from the beginning you have some killings, the most famous one the banana and the hitch hiker but then again, it's a lot of talking and getting to know the characters. So far it's also the part with the most gratuitous nudity. Acting is okay but one person do pops up, Corey Feldman. he was just a child then but his performance is excellent. He even had a shaved head and the look at the end in his eyes is sublime. It's always creepy to see a child with a machete walking around. Be sure to pick up the Deluxe edition. It has some nice dailies sadly without sound but you can see, and hear Zito, talk about those outtakes why they didn't use it, even as they are more gory. There is even an alternative ending, again without sound but with the director telling why it was cut out. It's nice to see it, the best one so far due the last 25 minutes. That's the reason why I gave it a 6.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

How many times can Jason live.  This gets pretty ridiculous.  I was hoping Corey Feldman's character gets it but no such luck.  The teenagers were nothing but cannon fodder.

33,HumanoidOfFlesh,Great slasher flick.**Spoilers**,10,19 October 2000,"""Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter"" is a poorly underrated horror film and I find it to be the most neglected installment by fans of the ""Friday the 13th"" films.It is definitely one of the best in the series.The film begins with Jason's escape from the morgue and subsequent return to Crystal Lake,where a new group of partying teens has rented a house.Young Corey Feldman plays a monster-obsessed boy named Tommy.As for the plot it is mainly an excuse for a series of graphic murders.Knives,scalpels,hacksaws,spears,corkscrews,axes and garden harrows are utilized along with the customary machete.This is probably the best of the early sequels and definitely better than any of the subsequent sequels that followed.Whilst part 2 was arguably better because it had a tendency to make you jump more often,I enjoyed part 4 because it was faster paced and the killings were more gory and shocking.After extremely bloody ""The Prowler"" Joseph Zito manages to create another excellent slasher flick.Highly recommended.Check out especially the scene when Jason grabs the surgical hacksaw and saws off the head of the chief mortician.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
34,StevePulaski,Adheres to convention in arguably the best possible way,7,31 October 2014,"Sometimes when convention manages to be crafty and effective to the point of achieving the kind of satisfaction you wanted out of a particular film or its genre, you need to give it credit and reward it accordingly. That, in a nutshell, is why Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter gets a favorable review alongside its abnormally high rating. If one looks at the film with respect to its genre and time period, a time when the film market was dense with slasher films, coming from no-name studios to reputable ones, and the market was overblown with innovative works and miserably copycats. The Final Chapter doesn't subvert its genre in any way, nor does it really achieve much more than being standard fare for it either. However, the film is, above all, entertaining and effective in what it wants to do - show young, attractive people being killed and mauled by an unstoppable force.The film is actually one of the few Friday the 13th sequels that I can immediately recall taking a more lax, slowburn approach to its material which, given its short runtime, is kind of admirable. We meet two different groups, one a mother and her teenage daughter and young son, and the other a group of sex-rattled, hormonal teenagers anxious for some campground fun over the weekend. Of course, convention and all intelligent assumptions would lead to Jason Voorhees showing up at the campground, killing everyone in his path with his machete. For ninety-one minutes, we watch this gaggle of teenagers go from horny and energetic to nothing more than carcasses in true slasher film fashion.The gaggle of teenagers we focus on are at least mildly interesting, compared to the onslaught of caricatures we see in other horror films. For one, there's Crispin Glover, who is being teased by his other pal, played by Lawrence Monoson, for being a ""dead-f***"" after his girlfriend, nicknamed ""BJ"" Betty, breaks up with him on the fly. We get that humorous banter, in addition to a hilarious dance scene involving Glover, along with some fun scenes involving plucky tyke Corey Feldman exploring things that aren't simply the worlds in his video games.With this, writer Barney Cohen creates an environment and a roster of characters that are marginally fun to watch because they actually seem to have life and are payed by actors evidently having fun with their roles. Everyone in the film looks like they're simply excited and happy to be in a slasher film and are trying to pull it off the best they can. When Jason finally shows up, The Final Chapter kicks formula into high gear, by going all out and completely bathing itself in blood and murderous fun, which is when the film adheres to its formula effectively.Why do we go see horror films in the first place? To be given a good jolt, for one. To be entertained is another valid reason. Then there's the reason few like to openly admit, which is to witness numerous people simply be given the literal axe, contributing to an often heavy and bloody body-count when it's all done. All three of those things are present in The Final Chapter, and the unexpected inclusion of fun characters makes the film that much more watchable. The slowburn pacing of the film is often difficult to execute with early slasher films, given their often briskly-paced, graphic nature, but Cohen and director Joseph Zito find a common ground to function on, giving viewers a film that adheres to suspense but also operates as a film with a body count, merging two styles together effectively.There's nothing in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter that won't be remembered on a long-term basis, given the amount of slasher sequels, remakes, and prequels, but there are a lot more specific scenes to remember than other films of its genre, making the affair just pleasantly different enough to recommend on a level that doesn't already comment on its effective use of convention.Starring: Kimberly Beck, Peter Barton, Crispin Glover, and Corey Feldman.

The last three sequels have been pretty fun and exciting to watch, but I guess you can't win them all which each sequel, right? I love the title, because it says ""The Final Chapter"", I mean, it's awesome that I still have like 6 more movies to watch, right? I'm trying to figure out what is the big deal with Jason Vorhees, what makes him so scary? I guess since he's just a big guy with a machete, yeah, it's a bit intimidating. I just love how we see little Corey Feldman, this was one of his first films, he's just so cute. Well the Final Chapter brings us sex, bad acting, drugs, and all the gore we could possibly want.Timmy has witnessed a horrible death and when he is sent to the hospital, Jason has escaped from the morgue killing everyone in sight. But when a group of kids, including Timmy and his older sister, Jason follows. Of course their bad behavior ensues, and Jason is going to teach them a lesson he'll never forget, but I think he'll wanna reconsider when he meets Tommy, a possible match he'll never realize existed.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is the worst of the sequels I've seen so far, which is a disappointment, I thought this would've been fun with Corey Feldman being in it, but oh, well. I still have like 6 more movies to watch on top of this sequel. Jason is still badder than ever though which is a point for my standing, but the guy does need a little personality like Freddy Krugger, he'd just be more fun that way, otherwise he's just a mama's boy.2/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

But, there is also a smattering of suspense and psychological thrills as Tommy Jarvis, sick and tired of Jason's threat, sets up an enthralling mission to take down the psychopath killer.While one of the better Friday the 13th movies, I never understood why the kids always return to Camp Crystal Lake in each movie, where it has always been a major crime scene. I would have preferred that the film be set someplace else that is less obvious for a homicide maniac to roam about. There are also a few campy dialog here and there, but otherwise, it's not a bad horror/slasher movie overall.Grade B-",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
39,thesar-2,George McFly and a Lost Boy,1,16 January 2009,"Premarital sex. Dudes making fun of what they consider less fortunate dudes. Naked bodies (yes, both sexes) and skinny dipping. People (and, uh, a dog) leaping from windows. And an unstoppable killer whose fetish is to stab from the back to the front, as if knifing someone from the front is so passé. There, that's the review people want to read. But, even for fans of horror, especially 80's psycho franchise thrillers, as I am, should be disappointed in this absolute crap. I have disliked, or even hated a few films, but rarely will one simply irritate me as 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' did. Obviously, it's not the last, but it could have very well been. Whereas parts 1-2 had (for the most part) realism, originality, hope for horror and completion and part III, well, III had, okay just hokey 3-D and the birth of the hockey mask, 'Final Chapter' has zero redeemable qualities. Incoherent scenes (Jason escapes a morgue locker that's only open ajar and makes no noise about it, a dog jumps through a window because, uh, I suspect no other reason than he read the script), shallow and useless characters that you actually want to see die, people doing incredibly stupid stuff  just fueling the 'Scream' movies years later and a kid whose big plan is to shave his head to confuse Jason, but has no exit strategy (see the ending of Part 2 for a better scene this ripped off.) Listen: I grew up on the series, I found Jason frightening, but any project, horror, Jason or whatever that is basely solely on dollars over substance, it's a disappointment. 'Final' note: I love the irony of one character laughing at a B&W soft-porn film, just as I was laughing at this soft-porn film.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
40,bensonmum2,"""Jason's body has disappeared from the morgue.""",6,14 May 2006,"I know there are fans out there that feel the fourth installment in the Friday the 13th series is the best. I don't happen to agree. While the first three movies weren't necessarily groundbreaking in their innovation, there were moments in each that we had not seen before – at least in a Friday the 13th movie. By the time Paramount rolled out Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter in 1984, the 80s slasher-boom was in full swing. It was all but impossible to do anything new. Chapter 4 is one big cliché of the slasher genre and a rehash of everything that came before. This one follows the standard formula to a T - A group of idiotic kids go to the woods and for the first 2/3 of the film, we watch them behave like complete morons. Suddenly, and with very little build-up or suspense, Jason shows up and kills everyone in sight. In the end, the one person who seems most incapable of doing so ""kills"" Jason. The End. I think I wrote something just like this for the other Friday the 13th movies I've written about.So far, all I've done is blast Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. To be fair, it's actually not that bad as far as these films go. Most of the credit for this should go to Tom Savini. His special effects are top notch and worth the price of admission. One of my favorite kill scenes in the movie occurs early on with the hospital attendant in the morgue. That head snap is nicely done.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

The characters are dumber-than-usual, the acting far below average and the dialogue is so ludicrous (A: ""You have no computer"", B: ""And you have no Betty"") that you can barely stand listening to it. Even the gory scenes are poorly lit and too quick, presented in a way that should disappoint every gore fan. But horror fans will also be disappointed, because the film isn't scary at all and its anonymous, irritating characters are impossible to care about.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
42,Robert_duder,The Final Chapter...JUST KIDDING...but it does represent a turning point,7,18 August 2011,"Friday the 13th 4: The Final Chapter represents a lot of really important things to the entire series. While of course its not actually the final chapter by any means it does sort of tie up the first segment of the series, and begin a new turn in Jason Voorhees. It also enters the first character to become a regular in the series, a nemesis of Jason's in the form of Tommy Jarvis. Jarvis continues on in character through the next two films and personally I love a slasher series that uses a re-occurring hero as much as a villain. I thoroughly enjoyed how they opened this instalment with Jason being brought to the morgue after being apparently killed at the very end of Part 3. Its very true that if you nit pick the inconsistencies in story and characters from one film to the next you will find plenty but I also think they work very hard for a low budget horror flick series to keep continuity alive and not leave things behind. Some key performances in this one make it that much better because usually despite some okay performances the cast is sort of just casualties for Jason or a means to an end of the particular film.80's Master Corey Feldman brings the character of Tommy Jarvis to life. Feldman is terrific as the youngster who finds himself in the middle of the slaughter. He is really the first kid to be involved in the Friday franchise other than Jason himself. He brings a certain spark to the cast and is terrific. I wish he had came back for future Friday films other than small flashbacks. Quirky and eccentric actor Crispin Glover is great as Jimmy. He has this inane knack of making awkward funny and adorable and he has a charisma on screen. Kimberly Beck plays Feldman's older sister and while it might seem that she is meant to be the scream queen of this instalment she really isn't. She has a small role and doesn't get a lot of character development like Feldman does. Veteran actress Joan Freeman has a similar role as Beck as Mrs. Jarvis, Feldman and Beck's mother. Her role is significant and yet at the same time she doesn't get a ton of screen time. Camilla and Carey Moore are the eye-candy twins of the film and they fill their role appropriately. Ted White picks up the role of Jason Voorhees and I think he gives the best Jason performance to date. There is something truly ominous, angry and powerful about White's Voorhees.Exploitation, B-Movie director Joseph Zito helms this instalment and given his experience with exploitation films I'm surprised Part 4 wasn't more violent disturbing and nudity filled. I mean it probably has your typical Friday the 13th amount, although IMDb states that this film had the most nudity but I don't think that's true. What's great about The Final Chapter is they really do try to bring everything full circle. With the character of Rob Dier, they tie it together by making the brother of Sandra Dier from Part 2, they show plenty of flash backs, and clips bringing the whole together, and of course giving him a foe in Tommy Jarvis. I feel like this one could have been truly outstanding though. They could have used the Jarvis vs Voorhees angle so much better, and the kills were a little stale compared to previous entries. Still this is a great wrap up to the first part of the series before it essentially gets a little kick start into the future. Keep reading my reviews as I review every single one of the films in order and you'll see what I mean. 7/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
43,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Came with the opportunity to do something different; instead, it just did the exact same thing but worse.",3,13 April 2018,"'Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)' came with the opportunity to actually come up with some semblance of a plot, picking up with a seemingly dead serial-killer on the set of 'Part III', but instead just resurrects its villain and sticks him in the exact same story we've seen three times before. This time, it has the least connection to the canon and arguably the least competent screenplay, to boot. It's frustrating, too, because this had the potential to be something different. Being billed as the 'final chapter' gives it the perfect opportunity to subvert audience expectation and perhaps provide a more powerful ending that maybe even explains some of the unanswered questions from 'Friday's past. There are flashes of uniqueness in the form of a few characters who don't quite fit the preconceived stereotypes, but all of these slot into the same cut-and-paste formula from before and, as such, offer no relief from it. The fact that it's all so poorly done, even the violence which is more overt but now has an odd leer to it, just makes it an incredibly boring watch even when the long promised 'finale' finally happens just under halfway through the series. 3/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
44,bowmanblue,How do they keep it so fresh?,6,6 August 2014,"Basically... if you're thinking of watching 'Friday 13th: The Final Chapter' (which you probably already know ISN'T the final chapter by a long shot) the only thing you need to know is that it's pretty much the same as the three before it. So, if you liked them, then you'll probably like this one, too.Part 4 of any franchise is probably not a great place to start. Although, you probably won't need to know much back story to 'get' what's going on. As with the previous three instalments... a group of over-sexed teens go into the woods, only to be slaughtered by a masked killer.Yes, Part 4 introduces a 'child' into the mix, but that's about as different as we get here. In summary, if you're new to the franchise, start with Part 1 and, if you like that, carry on. Part 4 is the same thing.Although... it may be worth giving this film an extra star (taking it up to four) based on Crispen Glover's dance moves – seriously... it has to be seen to be believed.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
45,ericstevenson,You're not missing anything,3,6 October 2017,"In the fourth ""Friday The 13th"" movie Jason comes back to kill everyone after seemingly being killed in the last movie. Hey, isn't this the plot of all the other movies? You're absolutely right! I saw most of Siskel and Ebert's review of this film where they said it was nihilistic and a bad influence for young people. I hate this movie but I wouldn't go so far as to say it corrupted the minds of the youth. This movie introduces us to the most frequently appearing character besides Jason, Tommy Jarvis. He gets attacked by Jason even though two movies later clearly establishes that he doesn't kill children.Jason's beaten when Tommy shaves his head which I guess tricks Jason into thinking he's a younger version of himself? I don't know how this works. The whole movie is just teenagers talking with them quickly dying. These scenes are pointless because these characters are pointless. Not only did they lie about this movie being the final chapter, but they lied again in ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"". This guy's harder to kill than the Joker! I know a fair number of people like these movies and more power to you if you're one of them. *1/2",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Even with the ""star power"" of Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover, you don't really know who these people are, where they are, why they're there, or why we should care about any of them. The ""plot"" is merely filler in between each gruesome kill. I have no idea why this franchise keeps coming back to life.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
47,CuriosityKilledShawn,There's not a word of truth in the title,4,17 April 1999,"Assuming that Part II began on a Friday the 13th, and I don't recall that it did, then this movie opens on Sunday the 15th, the rest of the film takes place on Monday the 16th, with Tuesday the 17th. It's also, by far, not the final chapter, so title fails to deliver on any promise.Beginning right after the massacre at Higgin's Haven (why they waited many hours until dark to remove the bodies is beyond me) the ""dead"" body of Jason is taken to the local morgue where he promptly regains consciousness and begins his massacre anew.Just to be clear, Part II is not set at Camp Crystal Lake, but at Camp Packanack which is nearby. After Ginny invades Jason's wilderness shack he moves on to the edges of the town of Crystal Lake and heads off to Higgin's Haven, a different location. Once he's up and around this time he wanders to a new lake house at a different lake. It's supposed to be set in rural New Jersey, where there are plenty of lakes to skinny dip. Though it is shot entirely in Los Angeles, in Topanga Canyon, to be precise.This particular lake house is the new home of the Jarvis family, who enjoy the peace and safety of the country. A group of horny teens move into the house opposite and quickly make friends with the Jarvis kids. A couple of beautiful twins soon show up too, and Jason is spoiled for choice when it comes to practicing his butchery skills.The older brother of Sandra from Part II is also in the woods, hunting for Jason like he's been planning it for years instead of having just a couple of days to figure out everything that the cops and Feds were unable to do.Directed by acclaimed master of schlock Joseph Zito, there is a noticeable change in tone from Part III. Gone is the sense of fun and adventure, giving the movie a rather lurid and unpleasant feel. For some reason he chooses to cut around Jason instead of keeping the star of the show front and centre. There is a 30-minute segment near the beginning where Jason just disappears, then when the massacre starts he's kept in the shadows and off-screen. This is particularly frustrating during most kills, but especially during the death of Sarah, who is axed in the chest through a closed door. I'm not sure of the physics of this one but it's so badly shot too that it's just confusing instead shocking.For some reason Richard Brooker was not asked back to play the part, instead it was given to 58-year-old Ted White, who was a lifetime veteran of action movies and westerns as a stunt performer, doubling for Clark Gable in the early days of his career. That's right, kiddies, Ted White bridges the gap between Rhett Butler and Jason Voorhees, and we're grateful for it. White has a distinctly different gate from Brooker, giving Jason a tough, cowboy swagger. He had nothing but disdain for the movie and series, though he seems to have warmed to it in recent years, much like the mainstream in general.The Friday the 13th series has never won over critics, and The Final Chapter does nothing to help that with its sleazy, exploitative edge that it doesn't have the moxie to fully embrace. I can understand it's status as an iconic horror, especially the famous poster art, but it's just not very good.It's not all in poor taste, though. Kid Corey Feldman and young Crispin Glover are genuinely good, and Harry Manfredini's score has some epic moments. I'm glad this wasn't the true end of Jason as there was plenty of fun left to be had in his zombie days.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

49,ironhorse_iv,"To put it kindly, Friday the 13th: Part IV: The Final Chapter wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. While, it was somewhat entertaining, it was also kinda blunted.",5,13 May 2016,"Let me cut to the chase, and get to the point, 1984's 'Friday the 13th: Part IV: The Final Chapter' was not a good movie. It was kinda dumb. Directed by Joseph Zito, the movie starts right after the events of 1982's 'Friday the 13th: Part III', with Higgins Haven crawling with police and paramedics. The bodies are taken to the morgue, with the not quite dead, killer Jason Voorhees (Ted White) among them. Jason escape and embarks on a new killing spree, as he makes his way back home at Camp Crystal Lake. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie isn't the one, I been screaming for, even when, I was a kid of the 1990s. I didn't find it, to be that scary. I found it, to be very generic and tiresome at parts, even back then. After all, the movie is pretty much, just recycling the same plot of Part II and Part III. It just added more gimmicky nudity and gore to the mix that certain scenes had to be delete, so it didn't get an X-Rating. Don't get me wrong, make-up artist, Tom Savini was at the top of his game with the gore, and the women actress were hot in the buff, but I was really hoping for more of story or a backstory, than what we got. I just think, it would awesome if they fit more of the original Friday the 13th superstitions in the film. I know the TV series dealt with the bad luck and curses, but the film series should had too. It could had been more fun. Sadly, this movie didn't give, anything new. Stylistically, Friday the 13th: Final Chapter had a lot of the same elements that made the original Friday the 13th a sleeper hit in 1980, such as first-person camera perspectives, gory stalk-and-slash scenes with the same eerily music. One of the biggest problems of the film is trying to connect this to the previous film. The movie took forever to recap the last few films. Another problem with this film and the first two films is the lack of suspense. You know, whom the killer is, so it's predictable as hell. Despite that, Ted White does a good job as Jason. I know that he hated the job and almost quit, because how the director was mistreating the other actors, by ordering them to do, dangerous stunts, but I glad, he stayed. He's one of the best. However, unlike the other movies, there wasn't anybody else to root for. Nobody in this film, were that likable to me. Nor was, anybody acting, great. I found the new group of over the age actors, acting like teenagers, to be very obnoxious and the actors playing the Jarvis family that lived next door to be very bratty. Another thing, all of their characters were very stupid. Honestly, who wise idea, was it, to stay or go near Camp Crystal Lake, after the events of five years ago, 1980's 'Friday the 13th' and what happen, within the last few days of this movie's timeline? I get that, there is contradictions in the timeline present in the films, but gees, people should know, by now, that there is a killer loose near or at Camp Crystal Lake. There is no reason, why the locations is still, having teenagers flocking to party, there. However, I did like the odd little dance that Jimmy (Crispin Glover) does in the middle of the film to the song by Lion's ""Love Is a Lie"". I found it to be, very funny. No wonder, why that film clip became, such a huge internet meme in later years. Other odd things, I found weird, about this film, is the fact that Jason is still, randomly killing people on dates, that isn't Friday the 13th nor does it have nothing to do, with his mom's murder, nor his supposedly death. Also, I know, it's a bit nitpicking, but how in the hell, does Jason travel around, so fast and knows where everybody is? Does he have teleporting powers, now? Another thing, that was jarring, is that none of the previous cast, survivors, returned for this film. Honestly, how nice, would it be, to see, what happen to Chrissy Higgins (Dana Kimmell) or Ginny Field (Amy Steel)? It would make me, want to watch it. Yes, technically, Chris Higgins briefly appears in the hospital where Jason's body is sent to, along with her parents, but since she view, from her back, we never get to know, if that was truly her or not. Its sucks that this movie lacks a strong ""it girl"". I was really hoping for a strong female protagonist. As per the title, the film was supposed to be the Grand finale to the series, but less than a year later, another sequel was released, due to the popularity of this film. Without spoiling the ending to this film, too much, I have to say, it was really dumb with Jason retaken somebody else for him. It's just as dumb as the ending to Part II. Also, they really took a misstep with how Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) was going to lead, a new series of 'Jason' films after the fourth. The ending of 1985's 'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning', whom leads up to this, although due to the negative reaction to that film, the idea was soon dropped, and never pick up, again. Overall: This movie isn't an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash like critic, Roger Ebert says it is. On the other hand, it's not good as well. It's just mediocre, at best. It's no movie to die for.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

By now we all know Jason's mother was the actual killer in the first film, and the reason she killed the youngsters, is because her son, Jason, drowned when they were supposed to be watching him. The first film was essentially a vengeance movie.From the time Jason started killing campers from the second installment, it was no more about vengeance. Instead, it simply became a killing spree for the sake of a body count. The reason for Jason killing people, I suppose, is to avenge his mother's death, having been killed by campers.'Part 4' follows directly on 'Part 3', in the aftermath of the killings. I keep asking myself ""Just why?"" Why all the unnecessary killings? Why are these films hits? Why do we keep watching them? There is no substance to these sequels.

53,tomgillespie2002,"Stands out in the series, but still lacking tension or originality",5,21 January 2013,"Contrary to the film's title, this is, of course, not the final chapter in the Jason Voorhees franchise, which has up to now reached ten movies, as well as a re-make and a spin-off. But the huge success of the series meant that production company Paramount Pictures could not turn down such an easy money-spinner, given the movies cost around a mere $1.5 million to make and usually grossed $20-30 million. Although the movies generally range from bad to awful, it is easy to see why they were a huge success - simple plots, lots of t**s, plenty of gore, and a truly memorable killer in Jason. The Final Chapter is widely considered the best of the series by fans, deviating slightly from the repetitive plots of the preceding movies, and giving the film a recurring hero in Tommy Jarvis (here played by Corey Feldman).Picking up straight after the third instalment, Jason (Ted White) is believed dead and is taken to a nearby morgue, where a doctor and a nurse are having a sneaky fumble. Naturally, Jason miraculously awakens and butchers them. Meanwhile, a group of horny college kids (where would this franchise be without them?) are making their way to a rented lodge on Crystal Lake, which is located next to the home of the Jarvis family. After daughter Trish Jarvis (Kimberly Beck) breaks down, she is helped by mysterious hitch-hiker Rob (Erich Anderson), who has rather secretive reasons to be in the area. As the college kids start to party and try to rub up against each other, Jason begins his slaughter.Having up to this point only seen up to this movie, I can categorically state that this is the best so far, and although it's still pretty basic by normal standards, it certainly elevates the sheer mundanity of the previous instalments. Tom Savini, back for his second and last job on the series, creates some memorable moments of gore, including a cork- screw to the hand and special mention must also go to the craziest actor since Klaus Kinski, Crispin Glover, for his spectacular dance scene - it is one of the most bizarre moments I've ever seen on film. Yet the film only really seems so good when compared to the rest of the series, and, ultimately, is still a formulaic slasher film with no real moments of tension or originality, blandly directed by Chuck Norries-frequenter Joseph Zito.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Jason; however, gets remarkable healing and then practices his brand of terminal medicine on a pair of staff workers who naturally have had time to disrobe and at least think about having sex. Well, two houses in the woods on Crystal Lake are the focal point of the film. One house has a mother and her two children, grown-up, attractive daughter and nerdy, pre-adolescent Corey Feldman whose hobby is making horror paraphernalia(particularly masks) better than the average FX guy. In fact the masks and the special effects are courtesy of Tom Savini who decidedly does have talent.

We even get what has now become the obligatory kill em in the shower and kill em in the bed after they have done the deed scenes. Savini at least does a better job here than those FX guys on the series's films he did not work on, but hey! this is some old, tired stuff even by the fourth installment. Acting honors go to no one(one must be able to act!) Yet, a young Crispin Glover shows signs he might be around after the rap party.

There are also scenes from the original Friday the 13th. to refresh the audience's mind.After the footage and opening credits, the movie starts where part 3 ended. The opening sequence deserves recognition for continuity in the series by filming in the same location where the ending of part 3 took place (the barn). I learned about it on IMDb Trvia for this movie.Police credits Jason as the responsible for the murders of Camp Crystal Lake and Higgins Haven. They pick up the ax that was used to ""kill"" Jason and take him to the morgue. It was just a matter of time before Jason escaped from the morgue in order to continue his killing spree.Jason kills Axel and Nurse Morgan in the morgue and a female hitch-hiker before arriving to his territory, Camp Crystal Lake. Also he comes to visit his mother's grave. Creepy. We meet the Jarvis' family members Tommy, Trish, and their mother. The Jarvis are a happy family that lives a normal life deep in the woods. One day after Jason escaped from the morgue, a group of 6 teens (Paul, Sam, Doug, Sara, Jimbo, Ted, and Jimbo) arrive at night to the house they rent, coincidentally next to the Jarvis'. Probably these teens didn't know about the killer on the loose near the area, or even worse, about the killer's escape from the morgue.The teenagers arrive at night and immediately meet Tommy and Trish. The next day these teens meet two slutty twin sisters while exploring the woods and then go the Crystal Lake for skinny dipping. Those are pretty much their ""activities"" before getting murdered. On their way back to their home while fixing their car, Trish and Tommy meet Rob, a tall and muscular camper that is on his way to Camp Crystal Lake. The brothers give Rob a lift and invite him to their home. Tommy impresses Rob with his talent in creating monster masks and his love for horror characters. Soon before night, Rob leaves the Jarvis home heading to the woods for unknown reasons. Night comes and the 6 teens and the twin sisters get drunk and dance before having sex. Jimbo's dancing deserves special mention for being the weirdest thing about the movie. Sam goes to the lake and takes off all her clothes before swimming. The girl has a weird idea of fun; who swims nude at midnight when it's too cold? Jason kills her while she's over a rubber boat and the killing starts. Paul goes in search of Sam only to find her dead body inside the boat, terrified, he swims the fast as he can and when he is about to climb on the dock, Jason harpoons him near his ""member"". Jason heads to houses on his territory and he's surely very mad. On his way, Jason throws his bloody harpoon inside of Rob's tent just to give him the creeps. Rob finds his tent is messed and watches Jason heading to an unknown destiny. Jason kills Mrs. Jarvis outside her house off screen and heads to the teens house. Outside the teens house he impales one of the twin sisters, then gets inside the house, sneaks into the kitchen and stabs Jimbo's hand with a corkscrew, then stabs him in the face with his old machete. After killing Jimbo, he throws Tina (the other twin) from the window making her fall over the van, machetes Teddy's head from behind, sticks his fingers on Doug's face while he's on the shower and then smashes his skull. And last but not least he axes the beautiful and innocent Sara in the stomach. Jason looks very, very angry. On the other house, Trish and Tommy realize that their mother is missing, so Trish decides to look for her in the woods, leaving Tommy alone in the house in case their mother returns. As this is a slasher movie, heavy raining starts and as Trish walks in the woods the audience believes Jason could appear in any moment and kill her. Luckily for her, she finds Rob and have a brief conversation about Jason. It happens that Rob is in the hunt for Jason since he killed his sister, Sara (the girl that gets impaled when having sex with her boyfriend in part 2, on of the most infamous scenes in slasher movies). Rob shows Trish the newspapers about Jason he has collected, and tells her that Jason escaped from the morgue. Worrying for Tommy, Trish and Tommy immediately return to her home. Trish and Tommy tell Tommy about the situation and head to the teens house to see if everything is all right. Tommy stays alone again and reads Rob's newspapers about Jason. While Rob explores the basement of the teens house, Trish goes upstairs and finds Doug's dead body in the bathroom and believes everyone is dead. She screams in panic and tells Rob that the killer ""was here"", when they are about to leave the basement Rob returns down there to get a knife. As there's no light there, Rob doesn't see Jason coming from the shadows, Jason hits him repeatedly on his chest and head with a wrench and other tools. Jason didn't even break a sweat and kills him easily. Rob only screamed and yelled ""he's killing me! go Trish go!"". Trish returns to her home and tells Tommy that they have to leave, when suddenly Jason throws Rob's dead body to a big window of the house. Jason breaks with his hands another window and gets Tommy, trying to choke him. Trish hits Jason with a hammer several times in the mask, and then stabs it on his neck. Tommy barely escapes from Jason's hands and he and Trish run upstairs to hide. That's when the nightmare starts for the Jarvis brothers.While Jason chases Trish inside both houses, Tommy cuts his hair and clothes to copy Jason's look when he drowned at 11 on Crystal Lake. When Jason is about to kill Trish, Tommy faces Jason who apparently thinks Tommy is him as a child, and when gets closer to him with unknown reasons but apparently shocked, Trish hits him in the face with the machete only to remove his mask and reveal his deformed and evil face. Trish shocks and starts crying as Jason walks slowly to her, Tommy lifts the machete and stabs Jason in the face with it. Jason, with the machete impaled in the face falls down on his knees and then falls to the floor as the machete slices his skull and gets through his eye. Tommy and Trish hug believing Jason finally died when Tommy watches Jason's fingers moving. Tommy pushes Trish, picks up the machete and hits Jason repeatedly with it and yelling ""die! die! die!"". The nightmare is over and Jason is dead. END.""The Final Chapter"" is a great example of how to make an effective and good slasher movie in the 80's. There's an identified killed that wears a mask, he's mean, angry, and apparently immortal. There's plenty of gore backed with excellent make-up (of course, by Tom Savini), the score is good, and you get sex scenes as a bonus. Not the best in the series but a very decent and strong sequel in the series. The movie hasn't any pretensions; it doesn't tries to explain about Jason's past or motives, or tries to be scary. It's a straight slash and goes directly to the point in fast speed. Jason appears only about for 15 mins., something that works good for me. Great deaths, good score, excellent make up, and a dark and effective direction by Joseph Zito. Jimbo's death is my favorite.The acting is not that bad, Corey Feldman (Tommy) delivers and his performance is a classic in the genre. The other actors seemed to have a good time, especially Jimbo and Ted (who keeps calling his friend a ""dead f**k"" all the time). Funny pair of geeks. I liked Sara's character (Barbara Howard) for having the typical innocent girl look but inside the bedroom she's a tomcat. By the way she's very sexy and cute. Overall ""The Final Chapter"" is one of the best slasher movies of the 80's for having all of the elements of the genre put together correctly. Jason's death is extremely gory and also a classic in the genre.6/10. In The Friday the 13th scale: 8/10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
60,Anonymous_Maxine,The most star-studded one so far!,6,10 February 2004,"The above statement is relative, of course, but whenever I watch old movies like these, I always watch for actors who later went on to more visible careers. I guess it would be more accurate to call this the most star-studded Friday since part 1, since Kevin Bacon's later career probably overshadows all of the semi-famous actors in this movie combined. There are some interesting connections, however. Watch for Judie Aronson, for example, who later became hugely famous for her role as Hilly in Weird Science (in which she plays the girlfriend of Robert Rusler, who you might remember getting slashed up by Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street 2), Corey Feldman also has a pretty significant part in this film, although he looks about half the size as he did in The Goonies, which was released the year after this movie. And of course, my favorite, Crispin Glover, who later went on to costar in the massive Back to the Future trilogy, as well as the only interesting role in either of the Charlie's Angels movies. I loved his role in this movie because it fits his later iconography so well (maybe it even caused it)  he's kind of the geeky guy who gets shunned by the girls and, in one of the greatest scenes in the movie, demonstrates the reason for that when he dances. WOW.At this point in the series it begins to become increasingly clear that each movie is something of a rehash of the same plot and ideas (not that you would expect anything hugely different from a series like this), especially because the movie starts off with ten minutes or so of review from the last movies, as one of the characters from Part 2 tells a story around a campfire to the latest group of Jason fodder about what happened in the last three movies. Basically you see all of the grisly murders as this guy describes them, reminding returning fans of what happened in the last three movies and informing people who jumped right to the final chapter of what Jason's all about. Sort of catches you all up without even having to watch the other three movies. It's an interesting setup this time, with a lot of kids renting out a cabin next door to a family who lives there permanently (Feldman plays the young son in this family, fascinated by the promiscuous antics of the new college kids next door). The basic message of each film having a lot of teenagers making out and getting naked and subsequently getting killed seems to take on a little bit more meaning in this movie as little Tommy (Feldman) gawks intently and wide-eyed at a girl undressing in the other house until his mother comes in and closes the curtains. Even though it's still pretty muted by the abundant killing and gore, it seems that the teens who have sex and go skinny dipping and whatnot are getting killed not only because Jason originally drowned because the people who were supposed to be watching him were making out at the time, but also because of the effect that their carelessness could have on kids like Tommy. Could it be that the Friday the 13th movies actually have a positive message?It seems even more apparent that that might be the case when you examine the target audience. I wasn't watching movies like this when they originally were released (since I was 5 years old at the time), but they're clearly geared toward teenagers much like the ones in the movies, out to have a good time with all their friends on a Friday night, and what better way than for everyone to go to a scary movie so the girls get scared and cling onto the guys? That's a pretty big goal for just about every teenage guy, to get girls to cling to him, and while I doubt the movies had much of an effect in getting them to say `You know, maybe we should wait until we're married' or something, it's still a pretty cleverly subtle message.
On a aesthetic level, the film has made a huge jump from part 3. I think that for the rest of the series, there is never again as sudden and significant an improvement on the actual film quality, which seems to have been shot on genuine film, while the earlier films look like they were recorded almost with videotape on a home movie camera. The quality of the picture is much better, and there is even an extension on Jason's personality, even though I think in the end it works against the effect of the movie as a whole.In this installment, Jason does a lot of things to reveal his murders and scare his future victims at the same time. One of the bodies is nailed to a doorway (leading to the gut wrenching necessity of it later being ripped off), throws a girl through a window like a baseball, plants a body in a closet so that it will tip out when one of the kids opens it, etc. It's actually pretty amusing to picture Jason doing this, and the fact that he actually breaks into a run in this movie increases the level of campiness almost to the breaking point. There's plenty of unnecessary nudity to keep the guys happy (even some male nudity thrown in there for the girls) and lots of brutal killings in keeping with what the movies are all about. I was actually pretty impressed with this installment, but mostly for things like that actual aesthetic quality of the film itself, the performances from so many actors that I recognized from later movies, the difference in the way that Jason acted (even though the actor playing Jason, Ted White, had his name removed from the film because he wasn't proud of his performance), and the fact that the movie actually had some originality thrown in for good measure rather than just having a lot of teens go up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed. The addition of a neighboring family with a young son (who ended up playing such a significant role that he stays on even for a couple more movies) was a nice touch, and while the killings were pretty much going through the motions, the movie marks a turn away from the rather rigid plotline seen in various forms the first three movies. Not a classic, and certainly not the final chapter, but this is one of the more entertaining and clever of the Friday the 13th movies.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
61,videorama-759-859391,"Just another Friday, going through the motions",4,26 February 2014,"Is it the final chapter? Really? The invincible Jason, pretty badly attacked, survives, providing excuse for another Friday, where we go through the motions once again, where our batch of youngsters come down to Crystal Lake, all again, being wiped off the face of the earth by our avenging psycho. Beck and her mother are running Camp Crystal Lake, with little brother Feldman and dog. Jason escaping from the hospital, taking some orderlies down, is heading back to his old stomping ground, so the scene is set for more carnage, in a less than impressive 4th outing. Amongst the batch of youngies is Crispin Glover in his most sanest role, who's friend, looking much like the guy out of The Last American Virgin keeps ridiculing him, referring to him as a d..d fu.k. But who's the one who ends up with one of the hot twins, and the other bails. There's nothing new here in this one. We just wait for each victim to be killed off, without caring about any of them, but just wondering how gory their death will be, and the shock violence factor is no more than usual. Beck is likable while Feldman is a hoot, the much watchable actor in the flick, if the best, though I did like Glover's performance also. The hot strip window scene, that has Feldman spying on our beauty, while getting his pre orgasmic jollies, where the little squirt can't get enough is the film's highpoint, which this flick doesn't have many. Friday fans will like it though.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Soon, Trish Jarvis (Beck), her mother and brother, Tommy (Feldman) stay at a cabin near Crystal Lake along with a group of friends staying next door. After Jason dispatches the teens, Trish and Tommy become the only survivors who face off against him. Glover (Back to the Future) plays Jim, one of the teens who is killed with a corkscrew and meat cleaver to the face.

63,GOWBTW,One of my favorites,7,23 December 2004,"This is one of my favorites sequels to Friday the 13th. There was quite a few parts that was not surprising to me. I liked the part where the two guys hook up with one of the twins, and the kids who was the special effects whiz really take charge of things when Jason made the kill. Especially when he orphaned the siblings. Jason's bloody reign of terror was not all that surprising. He killed with many methods: Hacksaw Toss out the window Shadow stab Cranial Compression Eviseration Etc. You name it, he'll do it. The one undisturbed scene is when one of the girlfriends was changing clothes and the sensual matter was really played out well. That's the one scene that will be never forgotten. The movie was great though there was a little humor to it. It is indeed one of my favorites of the sequel. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

But it was not to be. The series dragged on and on. Happily for me and the rest of the audience, the M.P.A.A. let a few things slide in this one. The gore content was surprisingly high in this film (I guess they thought this would be the last one so they let Jason go out like a hardcore G). The movie itself is pretty mundane except the final act. The only film from the series that came from the theatrical releases, the only one that I enjoyed. Sadly, the producers didn't keep their promise. Pretty soon the maniac was back for six more films.Tom Savini puts some juice in this fourth installment!!!

It has both Crispin Glover and Corey Feldman, and although Glover doesn't do much worth writing home about Feldman steals the show as a brainy, horny kid.This one is exceptionally violent and has more nudity than all the others as far as I know. It's hard to fill up ten lines with one of these movies. Everyone knows they're virtually all the same. The beginning and middle are derivative, but as I said, it's the ending that distinguishes it, with Feldman disguising himself as Jason to fool the apparently retarded slasher.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

In this story Jason returns from the morgue to a new group of campers and a family with a unique son.

It stars legends Corey Feldman (Gremlins), Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Judie Arson (Weird Science), Peter Barton (Hell Night) and Kimberly Beck (Independence Day. The storyline for this one was so fun. Adding the spooky kid who loved horror films and horror props that could carry the torche was a great direction. Kill scenes, specifically the hacksaw and throw out the window scenes, were awesome kills to add to the slasher museum. Strongly recommend this movie. The rewatch value is tremendous.

This time we shake up the formula a bit, introducing a relatively innocent single-parent family to the mix, though the vacationing kids across the street are more than happy to continue with the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll that's so familiar. It's a grab bag, really, a bunch of randomly-associated (or, often, not associated whatsoever) snippets that float around in the wash and occasionally bump into one another. I found it curious to spot a few name actors in the crowd this time: Crispin Glover is his usual awkward self and Corey Feldman plays the same mouthy, bratty kid you might expect given his early '80s stardom. Kevin Bacon's appearance in the first film may have set this stage, but it's still a little strange to see recognizable faces in the midst of such a transparent, genre-specific story, especially when one of them suddenly catches a grievous head wound near the climax. Every bit as indulgently gore-soaked, under-written and simple-minded as the previous chapter, with an even looser grasp on reality.

70,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""What are you trying to do, kill me?!"" Oh they only made six more!",7,13 April 2018,"It definitely wasn't the final one but I find this to be a fun enough chapter in Jason's bloody saga of tense stalking, ambushed and creepy forest death, for me it gets a bit thin and draggy in the middle and some of the cast members are a little more grating than they should be, but it certainly gets off to a very good strong start, beginning right on the aftermath of Part 3 with Jason even being in the same position that we left him in. I think one of the most genuinely eerie moments in the whole series comes at the end of that opening sequence as all the noise and lights at the site of the previous massacre disappear and leave everything in lonely darkness... I also love the whole following scene at the hospital which was always very memorable to me because hospitals are already plenty spooky on their own, and a goofy mortician gets his head twisted off while watching freaky 80s aerobics porn! Something that annoys me big time about this one is several of the 'teen' victims, to each their own but I really don't get what's supposed to be so super relatable and fleshed-out about them, I think they're mostly just very stupid and annoying, their whole chunk of the movie is a bit too obnoxious for me to get all that into. I did like Crispin Glover's character though, because even in this early role the guy knew how to stand out in a crowd and be interesting just by being himself and this is no exception, he's great as an awkward complete dork who still manages to score with a hot twin even though his friend kept teasing him about how much he couldn't and calling him that dumb name! He was hilarious cute and charming...that dance though.. I think a big part of what makes for a good slasher is simple consistent scary atmosphere, a good hook, and definitely having one or two characters that you actually do care about amid the faceless whack-a-mole ones, and it seemed especially cruel and unfair to me how the mother of Tommy and Trish Jarvis was killed off, because for her few scenes before she vanishes from the movie, the woman did a good job of establishing herself as a loving mother and a very sympathetic character. I really wish they'd have chosen to conclude the movie with the nightmare that Trish has where she finds her mother's ghostly body in the bathtub instead of closing it with the off-putting image of Corey Feldman's weird ugly bald head and how he gives the camera that completely unnecessary ominous look that really just raises more questions instead of offering any kind of finality. In any case though it really was the final chapter of the still fairly mortal but not too much less deadly at all Jason, after he was brought back he was basically the same but in terms of vulnerability and threat level zombie Jason was considerably different. The look and movements of this particular Jason are fine, but what really jumps out at me is the viciousness of his attacks, especially against the poor guy who he harpoons right square in the dick, hoists him into the air with it and then pulls the trigger! And despite having a rather lumbering gait he sure was a sprightly Jason, willing to swim out to a dinghy and even scale the outside of a house to get his victims! The gore effects are terrific without being over the top, Tom Savini's manufactured wounds have a certain distinctive realness to them that is very much his own style and his work holds up. I think my favourite part of this movie may be the final act and run through the house of horrors and confrontation, Kimberly Beck really comes into her own like many Friday final girls before and after her and it's just a very well shot and thrilling and suspenseful sequence. So while this movie is not one of my favourites amongst the Jason pictures, like the rest of them apart from Part 9, I find the overall viewing experience to be one that's very charming and entertaining, these flicks were never meant to be high art, at a guess I'd say they never had any major aspirations beyond hopefully giving the viewer a scary fun time, something which to me most of them succeeded at fantastically. A colurful and fun solid chapter that's not perfect but is, if you have a liking for this particular brand of harmless and awesome popcorn horror junk, a very winning simple formula that's makes for yet another suspenseful classic macabre watch.

71,lukem-52760,ONE OF THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE.A DARKER GRITTIER FRIDAY.,8,17 March 2019,"The final chapter is fantastic in my opinion, easily one of the best Friday the 13th movies in the excellent classic franchise.
I love this franchise to death & i love the Halloween franchise too & grew up watching these fun films.The Final chapter is a true 80's Horror classic it has a much more serious most of time feel to it & a much more darker violent tone with the best moody,creepy & grainy cinematography out of the franchise in my eyes!!! A Deeper & Darker film.
Jason Voorhees here is the most frightening & brutally savage in the whole series, he's fast & ferocious & scary as hell,probably the best he's looked too or on par with the version in Jason goes to hell.The group of horny teens are a great little cast who all put in good performances & are a nice gang who you want to survive as none are annoying but actually a cool little group.
The music again is done excellently with suspense & menace by Friday composer regular Harry Manfredini & we have an excellent performance from who would become an 80's icon Corey Feldman as our young hero Tommy Jarvis & he really is great here & you can see why he became that go to kid for CLASSIC 80's movies!!!
The whole feel & tone is took much more serious & scarier with a more brutal savage Jason Voorhees & even the big woods is darker with a foreboding atmosphere complete with eerie fog around this has that complete ""Classic Horror"" feel.
The 80's truly was the greatest decade for Horror films & this film is one of the greatest made in that era & should be known as the ""ultimate Friday film""
As all the elements are there but done better & more raw,gritty & scarier.
Also the make-up fx are beautiful.
I adore this franchise & i as a huge fan love this movie the best of the lot as it's the most serious & scary of the series but Jason takes Manhattan is probably the most cheesy fun of the lot?
It's a tough one picking your favourite films out of such a great Franchise like the Friday the 13th Series.
My top 3 would be:
The Final Friday
Jason Lives
Jason goes to hell &
Then coming into my top 5 is the extremely underrated, but great fun Jason takes Manhattan.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
72,drownnnsoda,"Not Exactly The ""Final Chapter"", But A Good Entry.",7,18 July 2006,"""Friday the 13th, Part IV: The Final Chapter"", is another run-of-the-mill ""Friday the 13th"" slasher film, but in terms of this particular series, it is actually a pretty decent sequel. The film starts off with Jason being revived at the morgue, and offing some hospital staff. He heads off into the woods near Camp Crystal Lake, and sets his attention of the Jarvis family and some teens spending the weekend in the woods in a nearby area. As the body count begins to rise, young Tommy Jarvis (who is a horror buff himself) and his older sister must fight against the maniacal killer before he takes their lives too. Has Jason met his match? Or will the Jarvis family just become more of his victims?Despite the fact that this is essentially your basic, routine slasher movie, I have to admit that it was actually surprisingly pretty well-done. The ""Friday the 13th"" sequels are notorious for being senseless and following the same pattern every time, and while this one isn't much of an exception, I thought that out of the unbelievable amount of sequels, this was surely one of the better. The storyline is pretty much as generic as the rest of the sequels, but this film manages to pack a decent amount of tension and a smidge of suspense as well. While the amount of tension/suspense and atmosphere is fairly minimal, I have to give this some credit because most of these movies lack anything of the sort.This movie is a gore-packed sequel for sure, and our friend Jason manages to kill people in some of the nastiest, most inventive ways. The victims are continuous, and it seems like someone is dying in every other scene (another thing that the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels are known for). But, this does give effects-created Tom Savini to show off his talents, and he does an excellent job here creating them. Compared to some of the other effects displayed in other films, the work here is excellent. The acting is mediocre and for the most part unbelievable, but a young Corey Feldman carries the movie as our leading hero kid and he did a good job here. You also may recognize a young Crispin Glover too, as a doomed teenager, which was a bit of surprise.Overall, if you like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, I can say that this is one of the better installments in the series. Is it anything award-worthy? Of course not. But as far as these ""Friday the 13th"" movies go, ""The Final Chapter"" (which wasn't really the final, but who would have known?) is a good one. I'd recommend it if you just want to watch Jason do his thing (kill people, that is). 7/10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Now pretending to be dead, he has killed two hospital employees and he has escaped. Finding another area in the woods, Jason is slowly stalking his way with the vacationers but an young talented make-up artist named Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) has meet his match with this psychotic killer.Directed by Joseph Zito (Missing in Action) made an strong, brutal horror film with a few memorable moments of suspense and shocking moments. Which was supposed to be the final ""Friday the 13th"" movie but sadly in a way, it wasn't. This one is notable for some pleasing supporting performances by Crispin Glover as a would-be stud, Lawrence Monoson as his horny rude buddy and Feldman as Jarvis. White is appropriately scary and intense as Jason. This one is also noteworthy for Tom Savini's excellent make-up effects and the knock-out conclusion. Savini's make-up on Jason is certainly closer to the original design work he did on the first one, compare to Jason's look on Part 2 and Part 3.This has plenty of interesting characters, although the movie was cut for time. Which studio ""Paramount"" probably forced director:Zito cut a lot of character development to make the picture in a 90 minute format. Some of Savini's effects work were trimmed for R-Rating. Like the sequels, this one has a few plot holes. Good example would be Tommy Jarvis' mother (Played by Joan Freeman), she killed by Jason off-screen but we never knew what happen to her body. Which her body was found by Jarvis' sister (Played by Kimberly Peck) but it was cut in the final version. It was probably cut for time or make-up effect work sequence didn't quite look right.DVD has an fine but grainy anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. A couple of sound effects are missing on this DVD for some reason. DVD's only extra is the original theatrical trailer. The Box Set of ""Friday the 13th"" series has interviews with the cast & filmmakers and deleted scenes. The latest DVD edition, DVD has an digitally remastered anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an new Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes two commentary tracks. Commentary One is by the director, Screenwriter:Barney Cohen and editor:Joel Goodman. Commentary two is fan of the movie by Adam Green (Hatchet) and Joe Lynch (Wrong Turn 2). DVD also includes an featurette, slashed scenes, original intended ending and more. This one was supposed to be the last one of the series and this one concluded very well but of course, this one did well at the Box Office and another film came out after this one with a clever title ""A New Beginning"". This is one of the best ""Friday the 13th"" sequels and it is also well made with an clever use of earlier footage from the previous movies at the opening sequence.

74,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) ***,7,27 January 2011,"The fourth, and in the running for one of the best, in this ongoing slasher series. After being ""killed"" with an ax through the head at the close of Part 3, hockey-masked Jason is carted off to the town morgue. But you can't keep a crazed madman down for very long, and Jason ultimately is back on the war path, returning to the woods to stalk and chop up a new group of vacationing teens who've rented a small house across from the home of a single mom and her two kids.If this sounds like more of the same old stuff, sure it is -- but this time what stands out begins with the exceptional direction by Joseph Zito, who really tries hard to make things work. Part 4 also benefits from a better group of young actors playing the doomed teenagers, with names like Crispin Glover (who'd become famous with BACK TO THE FUTURE), Lawrence Monoson (from ""The Last American Virgin""), Corey Feldman, and Peter Barton. The characterizations are nicely drawn, so we can like some of these people, and feel more dread for them when they meet their untimely deaths. Stuntman Ted White - who chose to go uncredited at the time of the film's release but recently has grown to appreciate the fans and his experience -- made for an intensely formidable Jason. Also, makeup guru Tom Savini returned for the first time since the original film to ""kill off the monster he created"". Some of the death scenes staged herein are among the best of the entire franchise.If you didn't catch this entry in the theaters in 1984, you missed a very high-energy ride with complete audience participation. Yes, at the time of release it really was meant to be ""THE FINAL CHAPTER,"" which put a true end to Jason Voorhess once and forever. However, it made so much money at the box office that the franchise continued the very next year... and for some 25 years after that! *** out of ****",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
75,fertilecelluloid,Some genuine suspense and elevated nudity levels,6,5 December 2005,"Joseph Zito, the director hauled in to oversee this fourth installment, previously directed the wretched ""The Prowler"", the wooly but entertaining ""Invasion USA"", and would go on to direct the shot-in-South Africa ""Red Scorpion"" (with Dolph Lungren). Since ""The Prowler"" was such a stinker, it's hard to see how Zito got the job. Maybe he was a master romancer and could talk actresses out of clothes because this episode in the ""Friday"" franchise has more nubile nudity and panty shots than any previous entry. It is also the goriest since the original with Savini returning as the effects adviser.Jason is resurrected from gory pieces and returns to his old ways after a stint on a slab. He has a grudge for a particular family and must tangle with resourceful horror fan and pint-sized weirdo Tommy (Corey Feldman).Just as the nudity and short shorts levels are elevated, so is the suspense. Using ""The Prowler"" as a guide on not what to do in a slasher, Zito creates some genuine unease and keeps things moving at a fast and bloody clip. The Euro version of this film, which is the one I have, is gorier than the US version and sexier, too.The next installment proved to be one of the worst; so if you're going to subject yourself to one ""Friday"" sequel, choose this.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
76,Witchfinder-General-666,"Not Jason's Final Chapter, But one of his More Worthwhile Ones",5,30 July 2009,"I am not a big fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series, in fact while they all have a silly premise, some of them are also pretty damn boring. That being said, the fourth part, ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" (yeah, right) of 1984 is, in my opinion, certainly one of the most worthwhile entries to this generally overrated series. This episode may be even more stupid than its predecessors, but at least it's good entertainment, as it improves on all the aspects one would watch any ""Friday"" film for - some suspense, a fast pace, pretty girls who occasionally bare it, and, most importantly, gruesome murders and nice gore effects. Jason definitely looks creepier and more menacing here than in parts 2 and 3, and, as opposed to most other parts, not all of the victimized teens are annoying (some of them are, though).One might wonder why people do still bother to spend their holidays around Crystal lake, when, after three films, the news should clearly have been spread by now that everybody around tends to get massacred by a masked psycho. Anyhow, logic never was the strongest point of the ""Friday"" series, and we are therefore introduced to a bunch of teens, as well as a family (an attractive mother, a hot teenage daughter and a very weird little boy who makes very cool Horror masks) who have occupied two houses in Jason's hunting grounds. Jason was supposed to be dead, but, ***SURPISE!***, he walked out of the morgue (not before butchering a few folks). One strong point is the gore here, the murders are pretty gruesome (one guy gets his head cut off with a hand saw, another gets a machete slammed in his face, etc.) and shown in explicit detail. The female cast members are entirely yummy, and blessed with exhibitionist tendencies. Then again, it seems that annoying characters can't be left out of any Friday film, and it is the same here. I couldn't wait for Jason to butcher the idiot called Ted and his idiot friend called Jimmy. Furthermore, the assumption that a 12-year-old boy would think of complex psychological strategies when being stalked by an insane serial killer is ridiculous beyond belief. Yet, this fourth part is easily one of the most entertaining entries to the Friday series. I couldn't say it's highly recommendable, but it's definitely one of Jason's more worthwhile escapades.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
77,caspian1978,For Feldman Fans,7,13 October 2004,"The Final Chapter.....yeah right! Although we thought it was all over after Part 3, we return to Camp Crystal Lake to find Jason as angry as ever. Even Tom Savini joined the crew to give Jason his final death. Little that he knew, this was far from the last we would see of Jason. For Corey Feldman fans, this is a nice treat. Feldman does a great job as the ""hero"" to this horror movie. The special effects are great and the gore is terrific. This should have been and could have been the last of the Friday the 13th movies, but people in Hollywood were greedy and wanted more money. A great kill scene for Jason, the special effects by Tom Savini is some of his best work. For the special effects alone, this is a movie worth seeing.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
78,Jonny_Numb,amazing...this is even worse than Part 3,1,1 October 2003,"Oh boy.  The ""Friday the 13th"" films are not known for their well-developed characters or fiercely original plotlines, but this one is just pathetically, infuriatingly bad; it's quite a feat to eclipse the sheer awfulness of part 3, but this so-called ""Final Chapter"" succeeds.  As if the filmmakers believed the promise of the title bestowed upon them by the producers, there's even less character development, less logic, and just less going on than usual--this is a rock-stupid slasher where all the teenage characters are fixated on getting laid, the suspense is non-existent, and, as a result, there are about ZERO scares (not even those annoying fake-out scares)--credit that to director Joseph Zito, who keeps Mr. Hockey Mask out of sight for most of the film's running time.  Not that things get better when he shows up--Tom Savini's effects this time around are so sloppy, unconvincing, and the kills so rapidly-edited that it doesn't even lift this movie above the abysmal standards of the rip-offs it inspired.  As I go through this series, one film at a time, right now I have to say this is easily the worst of the bunch--but the climax, as lamely as it's executed, merits a score of ""1"" in my book.1/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
79,aidanratesmovies,The So-called 'Final Chapter',4,26 June 2020,"Although it's not as forgettable as the entry before it, Friday the 13th Part IV has little to offer the franchise. It does have a bit of a different setup than the previous films, ditching the camp/cabin scenario somewhat and going on a little different side-run with the family across the street. The family, played by Corey Feldman from The Goonies, Kimberly Beck, and Joan Freeman- make for an interesting counter view to the usual franchise tropes. Unfortunately it doesn't do too much to help the film in regard of its horrible awkward writing, but it does provide for a little relief from the more unbearable moments. The cast of kids in the cabin have seriously some of the worst dialogue I have seen in a while, and it's quite painful to watch their conversations play out slowly while we place ourselves until they are killed off (not a spoiler, you now some of them are gonna get killed). It's kills, when they finally come, are somewhat suspenseful which is a nice change of pace from the last entry, or even last two, but there is nothing to truly capture the attention of any higher class material seekers- and honestly feels like the whole idea is getting kinda stale. In the end, Friday the 13th Part IV is not a horrible film. It improves on the last entry, but doesn't do much to redeem itself as anything but another mediocre entry in an ever expanding franchise.My Rating: 3.9/10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
80,a_chinn,"Best of the first four films, but that's not saying a lot",5,28 May 2017,"Though not the final film or even close to it, this was the best of the Friday the 13th films so far, though that's a pretty low bar. What this film has going for it is some very gory special effects by Tom Savini, Jason wearing his mask the entire film, and some funny casting that includes Crispin Glover in a straight part (though he still manages to be weird), and a you Corey Feldman (before he got weird) playing a young boy fascinated by murder. Harry Manfredini again provides the score and Joseph Zito directed the film with more competence and suspense than any of the prior films, but as I've said before, that's not saying a lot for a pretty weak horror franchise. Also, a home video game version of Zaxxon makes an appearance in the film.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

82,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Another Solid Installment,8,16 January 2020,"Now this was one of the Friday the 13th films I saw a lot growing up. This one always seemed to be on the movie channels and when this started, I settled right in like putting on a familiar outfit for sure. The synopsis is after being mortally wounded and taken to the morgue, murderer Jason Voorhees (Ted White and Tom Savini) spontaneously revives and embarks on a killing spree as he makes his way back to his home at Camp Crystal Lake.We start this right where the previous film ended. Jason is dead in the barn and he's loaded into an ambulance and taken to the hospital. There we get to meet a nurse and the morgue attendant, Axel (Bruce Mahler). The two of them have been sleeping together, but she's getting fed up with him. Morgan (Lisa Freeman) is the nurse and she gets spooked when Jason's hand falls off the table and touches her. These become his first two victims here as he wakes up and makes his way back to his home.It then introduces us to our cast for this film. There's a family where the mother is going through a divorce. She is Mrs. Jarvis (Joan Freeman). Her daughter is Trish (Kimberly Beck) and son is Tommy (Corey Feldman). Coming to stay for the weekend is a group of 6 people. There's Samantha (Judie Aronson) who is seeing Paul (Clyde Hayes). There's also Doug (Peter Barton) who is seeing Sara (Barbara Howard). Then finally we have Ted (Lawrence Monoson) and Jimmy Mortimer (Crispin Glover). These two guys are single and end up meeting twins on the way to the lake, Tina (Camilla More) and Terri (Carey More). Trish and Tommy meet Rob (Erich Anderson) who helps them with their car trouble and tells them he's there to hunt bears. Trish takes a liking to him as does Tommy.That night is starts to rain as Jason picks them off one by one. In typical slasher fashion, they don't realize it as they go off for various different reasons and Rob might be there for something more than what he's letting on.As I said, I really have a found spot for this one as it seemed that this one and the next part of what is now dubbed the Jarvis Trilogy. Trying to temper my nostalgia a bit, I came into this with a critical eye and can say that I still dig it. We get an interesting group of characters that are diverse and I actually feel connections with them before they start to get picked off if I'm going to be perfectly honest. If you can do that, you have me on board, especially in a slasher.I love that this one picks up where the last one left off. I don't think that it really violates any continuity here from what we got in the past so that's something else that I like. As a story guy, I want to you continue on. This one also did give us a good point where we've killed off the human form of Jason if they wanted to end it here. This shouldn't come as a spoiler though that it isn't in that we've gotten 7 more from this as well as a remake.I think that the pacing of it is really good as well. It doesn't waste any time establishing that this starts right after the other. I do find it interesting that it takes a couple days for Jason to get back to his home so this doesn't take place on a Friday the 13th. To be honest, if my memory serves, only the first one does as these are all within like 3 month period. After the death starts, I think it goes into a solid slasher where we periodically get more kills and the tension builds as the survivors realize that everyone is being picked off. I was down for how this ends as well.From here I want to shift to the acting, which I think is pretty strong for the most part. I think a lot of this is from the character development though. Feldman is interesting as I don't feel he's the main character until near the end. I like that they establish he's into making monster masks as it fits for what he does at the end in defeating Jason. I also like Anderson's reveal as things progress. It is an interesting aspect to the film for sure. I like that we get the opposite characters in Aronson and Howard, with one has a reputation and the other is a prude. Glover has low self-esteem as his girlfriend recently broke up with him and his best friend Monoson is over confident. I think they do really well in establishing all of this. There's some overacting, but it's also a slasher so I'm not looking for Oscar worthy performances.That will take me next to the effects, which I knew that Savini came back to kill off Jason. He was infamously known that he thought the original was going to be a one off and didn't understand how Jason could be the killer. We get some great kills that look real with how good he is at practical effects. I love the staging of the bodies as well that are done after they're dead. The cinematography is well done in my opinion and I have no issues there.The final thing to cover is the soundtrack. Harry Manfredini is back to do the score and although, this isn't my favorite in the series, it is still really good. We get a lot of the iconic theme song that we hear in a lot of them to build tension. He does that really well here and it really fits for what was needed.Now with that said, I understand that this has some flaws. This is really one of my favorites though in the series if I'm going to be honest. Part of that comes from the nostalgia, but I think we get some really distinct characters that I feel bad for as Jason is picking them off. We get good kills, it is paced in a way where it does waste time and gets tense as we go. The effects look great from Savini and although not the best soundtrack in series, I think it really still is solid. This could have ended the series, but I don't blame them for continuing from here to start the Jarvis trilogy. I find this to be good movie for sure.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
83,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Remains to see improvement since Part III,4,13 November 2015,"Horror icons are just hard to kill plain and simple. Hollywood studios has shown its viewers many a time that if an audience so desires to see one type of formula repeated and repeated and repeated, the amount of people it will appeal to will split. At some point viewers who will recognize the formula will get tired and want to experience something relatively new. Meanwhile, the viewers who enjoy ingesting the same material day-in and day-out will continue to watch what they find entertaining. A great contemporary example of that is Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) franchise. By the fourth entry, many of the fans from the first were not attending the screenings because the formula became so repetitive. The same can be said for the Friday the 13th (1980) franchise. What started out with a premise that caught many peoples attention, soon grew into a series of copies of itself almost on an annual basis with declining quality. Now although this entry isn't worse than Friday the 13th Part III (1982), it's showing no improvement.After proving himself worthy of heading a horror movie with his own The Prowler (1981), director Joseph Zito was hired. According to sources however he was also expected to write, but instead hired Barney Cohen to do it for him. Before this film, Cohen had only written for a couple films in the late 1970s and some TV episodes; all of which were not in the horror genre. Is also probably safe to assume he did not view any of the other films before this entry because there is absolutely no originality in this screenplay whatsoever. With a beginning to this movie looking like how writer Alan B. McElroy got his idea on how to open Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), familiar viewers who are hoping for something new to happen in the plot will be disappointed. There is no story being told really. A bunch of sexually active teenagers (of which resemble the same set of personalities from the last three films prior) stay out in a rental home next to another family near Camp Crystal Lake. Once that's set up, Jason is all that is needed to complete the film.Aside from one character named Rob (Erich Anderson) having a motive to why he's roaming around the same area, no other character is interesting. Anderson's character is related to a victim from one of the previous films, but the continuity is even less elaborated on than the continuity from Friday the 13th Part III (1982) had to Friday the 13th Part II (1981). No other character receives any kind of development other than who's going to sleep with one another in bed. Sure, everyone has a libido but it seems as if that's all this film has. A viewer who wants to be invested in a character can not react properly if they don't learn any kind of lesson. With that said, much of the characters on screen are just boring and make the pacing slow down. If anything, if viewers want to see what some actors looked like before they were well known this series seems to be good at doing that. There's appearances by Judie Aronson, Kimberly Beck, Crispin Glover and Corey Feldman.Playing Jason Vorhees for this entry is actor Ted White. Mostly for doing a lot of unknown parts to other films like Tron (1982) and Starman (1984), he is able to fit the look of what people know Jason to look like. As for the actual part that Jason plays in, it feels almost wasted. For anyone who has kept up with the series thus far, why must the movie project its main villain as a mysterious character? Anytime the camera scans various characters as if they are being watched, an experienced viewer knows its Jason. So why even conceal it? There's nothing about it that could get someone thinking to themselves ""Could that be him?"". Sadly even the kill scenes are mediocre even with the beloved help of Tom Savini's practical gore effects. Although Friday the 13th Part III (1982) was more gimmicky than anything else trying to sell the 3D aspect, the kills were at least unique in the sense of trying to be three dimensional. Here, only small bits of the violence seemed inventive.Finally is camera-work and music. João Fernandes took on the role as cinematographer. For Fernandes, the camera remains steady, which is good. Anything resembling that of Jason's point of view shots remain acceptable. Is it anything to be impressed with? No but it's not bad either, it's just standard. The same would/could be said for Harry Manfredini returning to compose his signature score once more. The only problem is that sometimes even for this entry the music felt unnecessary in some scenes. With the main theme of various string progressions that gives the scene a sense of uncertainty, it occasionally feels too over dramatic. This is especially obvious when some viewers know Jason is not around. Plus, there's even jump scares for scenes that aren't even the list bit scary. It's difficult to say whether Manfredini was just on autopilot or was still trying to make the film scary. Either way, it wasn't the most effective as it could've been.For a series with such a devoted fan base, it is amazing to how dull this series is getting. Jason Vorhees will always be a menacing character but so far, he's been surrounded by uninteresting characters and has had barely a plot about himself. The music is kept the same but is beginning to miss too. Not even his kill scenes were as memorable. The only things that may be worth someone's time is seeing various actors when they were younger, steady camera-work and some of the traditional practical effects.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Yes, there's a recap of the first three movies in the prologue. But what happens next is pretty good. The success of this movie convinced Paramount to make more of them, starting with A New Beginning in 1985 and continuing with Jason Lives in 1986 until when he takes Manhattan in 1989 when the series started to lose a bit steam before New Line acquired the rights to use Jason in an ill fated sequel as well as one in outer space before bringing him back to life fighting New Line's other famous killer, Freddy, in the highest grossing installment of their careers.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
85,PredragReviews,"""Ted... where the hell is the corkscrew??""",7,11 August 2016,"In ""Friday the 13th-The Final Chapter"" there really isn't much more to add if you've seen the first 3 films. You know Jason is going to rise from the grave and kill some teenagers (or rather people in their mid 20's playing teenagers), and you know there is going to be a lot of gory, grisly deaths. Make-up master Tom Savini returned for the last time in the series to create the films extremely disturbing death scenes. Young Corey Feldman appears as Tommy Jarvis, a 12 year old obsessed with video games and creating his own monster masks and makeup. When a group of teenagers rent the house next door to the Jarvis family, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to kill everyone. That's pretty much it plot wise, you see dumb teenagers going outside in the middle of the night by themselves to take a little midnight swim (take a guess at what happens to them..) Actually, this movie is a horror movie and follows the formula of dumb characters doing dumb things, but that's all part of the fun with these type of films, guessing how and who's going to die next.""The Final Chapter"" has one of the most intense chase scenes in the history of horror films, with Kimberly Beck as the heroine trying to escape Jason's clutches and Corey Feldman using a more psychological approach to defeat him. The Final Chapter has Jason in his scariest form and Crystal Lake looks great in the midst of a rainstorm which helps set the tone and atmosphere of chaos to come. The best acting is supplied by Kimberly Beck, everyone else is mediocre to poor but the suspense and thrills are all there. This would also mark the end of the deformed ""man-like"" Jason before he ended up as a zombie-type who could not be killed. Director Joseph Zito (who helmed ""The Prowler"" a few years earlier) makes poor use of slow motion several times but otherwise does a perfectly adequate job behind the camera he's pretty good with actors and knows enough not to get in the way of the gore effects, although his direction can't be said to be particularly stylish or imaginative.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
86,Sandcooler,Among the coolest ones,8,9 January 2011,"This is the last part of the franchise that still features the old school human Jason, and he makes a special effort for the occasion. Jason is meaner than ever here, he wants those rowdy teens to suffer damn it. Cleavers to the face, spears through the groin, that'll show 'em to go sorta near his property. Even Crispin Glover isn't safe, all bets are of. This is also the ""Friday""-franchise at its sleaziest, the amount of T&A in this movie is truly dazzling. All of these sequels are essentially exploitation movies, but this one does it best. Because ""The Final Chapter"" absolutely can't stand being unexceptional in any way it also has the dumbest final girl of them all, she makes some incredibly interesting tactical choices. Oh Trish, thank God you're so cute. The pace is good, the actors are competent enough to remember their lines, the ending is about as creative as slashers will ever get, what more do you really want? Highly recommended.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
87,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Better than I remembered it,7,27 April 2004,"Cold start opening has an overview, in flashbacks, of the events of the first three films. Interesting start, as we then jump to the night of Saturday the 14th, with the medics and police cleaning up the crime scene from part III. Had that ever been done by any movie before, showing the aftermath of the previous film's slaughter? Then, after they've cleared out , we're left with the haunting quiet of the farmhouse by Crystal Lake, in the pitch black night.That quiet doesn't last long, as Jason, still clad in his recently acquired hockey mask, is taken to a local morgue. (wouldn't they have taken of his hockey mask?) He either wasn't really dead, or comes back to life, to saw and stab a pair of orderlies, and disappear into the night. After an undetermined time period, he heads back to Crystal Lake, where another group of obnoxious, teen-aged meatheads are just settling in for a weekend party next to a cabin inhabited by Corey Feldman's monster mask-loving character and his family.Hitchhiker Rob Dyer (E. Erich Anderson) is introduced fairly early on, made to look like he might be a killer, what with his large hunting knife and suspicious demeanor. But is he a killer, like Jason, or is he going to be the one who finally puts an end to Jason? He turns out to be the brother of a victim from part 2, searching for her killer. Unsuccessfully, as his character is unmemorably killed off during the film's climax, ruining a potentially interesting character.This has the most obnoxious, repulsive, death-worthy cyphers in this entire series. I was happy to see several of them offed. It also has a lot of violence and nudity, which is what people watch this series for, so there is no disappointment there. But again, the audience has to tolerate these pricks until they get nude and get slashed, before Corey Feldman shaves his head for some strange reason and chops up Jason with his machete.The plot is a bit unfocused, even for a Friday the 13th film, as everybody in the movie basically has an extended cameo: top-billed Corey Feldman is only in about a half an hour of this movie, the same goes for Kimberley Beck and Crispin Glover. Again, the hitchhiker is made to look like he will be a major character, but is then killed off in a forgettable fashion after only a few scenes.Jason's makeup is nonexistent: uncredited Ted White is just a big guy in a green shirt and brown pants and hockey mask, but Jason's face is grotesque, his death scene is brutal, so fans get the gore they've come for.My original review of this film was quite harsh. After watching it again recently, I don't think it is as bad as I said in my original review. Be forewarned however, that this film has the most obnoxious and repulsive group of cyphers in the entire series. It also has probably the best looking movie poster in the entire series.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
88,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" aka ""Jason VS Corey Feldman""- A fun little excursion for the series, though certainly its name is now comical in retrospect.",7,2 September 2016,"""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", also known as ""Friday the 13th Part IV"", is an interesting turning point in the long-running slasher- flick franchise. It was originally intended to conclude the series, reportedly because Paramount executives were embarrassed by their association with the series, despite the cash-cow it had become. So a lot of tender care was given to the film to try and not only craft a somewhat definitive finale, but also to cap it off in a satisfactory manner for series fans, including bringing back key crew member and makeup artist Tom Savini, who famously worked on the original film and wanted to return for the at-the-time ""final"" installment.It's a turning point in that it sort-of signaled the end to the earlier films overt attempts to be dark and somewhat ""grounded."" Beyond this is where the films began a more experimental phase, introducing concepts like Jason as a ""super-zombie"" and adding gimmicks to the various films (ex. the more self-aware satirical humor of Part VI, Jason VS Psychic chick in Part VII, etc.) in order to drum up hype. Though this of course was to decidedly mixed results.Jason, having somehow survived his ax-lobotomy in the previous film, escapes from the hospital and returns to Crystal Lake. There, several groups of people have congregated, including the Jarvis family (including son Tommy, portrayed by Corey Feldman) and a group of teens including the always entertaining Crispin Glover in one of his earliest roles. The stage is now set for a Hellish round of murder and mayhem, as Jason begins to pick everyone off, leaving Tommy and a few select others to fend for their lives.This really is Tommy Jarvis' film. Corey Feldman is a blast in this movie, and is really well-defined and executed. It's truly interesting seeing such a young child being one of the lead heroes in a hard-R slasher flick, but I think that's part of what gives this film such a interesting (and borderline cataclysmic) feel. It lends you to believing nobody is safe, which helps play up the intended ""finality"" of it all.Another big part of the big appeal to this film is that it really ""goes for it"" so-to-speak. It knows full-well what fans of the series want to see, so they just jump right in. It wastes surprisingly little time in setting up the story and bringing back Jason, quickly piling up the bodies and, well... boobs. It's a lot of fun in that respect, though I did feel that outside of the Tommy Jarvis character, we're missing out on the likability factor the characters in the previous two films had... especially the teenaged characters. Which is where the film loses me a bit. Don't get me wrong, there's some good moments (including Crispin Glover going insane with a really wild dance), but these teenaged-bits-of-canon-fodder just aren't as memorable as similar characters are in other, better entries of the franchise. I still remember Shelly from Part III fondly... but I had to resort to checking IMDb to see what the character names were in this movie, even after just recently re-watching it. Not much of an impact.Still that being said, it's a fun entry in the series. It's go-for- broke mindeset does make for some great moments, exploitative though they may be, and the character of Tommy Jarvis- the only real time Jason has fought a true child- makes for a subversive and interesting protagonist.Strictly as a horror fan, I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It's up there with the stronger entries in the series, though I wouldn't say it was the best. Still, a fun entry in the long-running series.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
89,rivertam26,Entertaining but by the numbers,7,8 March 2020,"This is when it was all supposed to end the first time around. But after a record breaking opening weekend we were of course treated to some seriously gorious(intentional) sequels. The set up is pretty much the same as the seemingly unstoppable Jason targets a new group of horny teens which include a young, cute, weird Crispin Glover with the best dance moves ever. Jason hacks his way through the group with some amazing practical effects by Master Tom Savini. It all culminates with geeky horror kid Cory Feldman who has a lot of FX crap slashing him down in a truly spectacular finale. That being said the film tends to be a bit repetitive and the characters are definitely underwritten. Still the movie packs several punches in what is probably the most by the numbers but thrilling and entertaining film of the first four.3.75/5",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Always have, probably always will be... but there's no denying the sheer impact Jason Voorhees had on the 1980's and the horror genre as a whole.That being said, I consider Part VI my favorite, and this, The Final Chapter, my second favorite in the franchise. It's just so dang good. From the kills, the unique characters, the gore, the chicks, the cheese, Corey frickin' Feldman... There's so much here to love for horror fans.Whenever someone tells me they're not sure if they'd like slashers or not, THIS is the flick I recommend to them. If you don't like this one, well, you just don't like 80's slashers!A classic. A phenomenal entry into arguably the best (and, without a doubt, the most LEGENDARY) horror franchise. A must-watch for any respectable slasher fan.And if you're planning on hosting a slasher marathon? It'd be a crime to not include this in your lineup, man.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
91,capkronos,"The Final Chapter, huh?",4,24 February 2004,"Jason's ""dead"" body is taken to a morgue where he returns to life, decapitates the coroner with a hacksaw and guts the nurse with a scalpel. Then he stabs an androgynous hitchhiker through the neck while he/she eats a banana. A station wagon full of teens show up to Crystal Lake, and a mom (Joan Freeman), her teen daughter (Kimberly Beck) and young son (Corey Feldman) are already living there. E. Erich Anderson is the brother of the Marta Kober character from Part 2, who's camped out in the woods, waiting to get revenge. The family gives each other a big group hug for cheap sympathy value before all the murders start. Unfortunately here the friendly and likeable characters from the first three films get replaced by a pack of obnoxious, hateful, unbearable ""teens"" who insult each other, crack stupid jokes and wander off into the woods by themselves one by one. Skinny-dipping, shower sex and stag film footage provide nudity and hammer, corkscrew, spear, and harpoon (to a guys crotch) provide gore. The Tom Savini FX are excellent (of course). Ted White, who had his name removed from the credits, is Jason. Kevin Yagher was on the make-up crew. The director also made THE PROWLER (with more Tom Savini FX).Score: 4 out of 10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
92,Pumpkin_Man,The Sleaziest and Most Overrated of the Whole Series!!!,5,17 May 2016,"I love this series, but 'The Final Chapter' is the weakest and most generic in my opinion. Everyone else thinks it's so great, but to me, it's pretty average. The characters aren't that memorable, the plot is basically Part 3 done again, but not as good. Some of the kills are pretty good and the Tommy Jarvis character is pretty interesting. There's way too much sex that it's basically a sleazy 80's horror porno. I'm only giving this a 10-star rating because I love the F13 series as a whole. Moments after Part 3 ends, Jason is brought to the morgue. (The morgue is just as dark and empty as Haddonfield Memorial from Halloween II) Of course he escapes and continues his work elsewhere. He comes across a group of teens that are hanging out in a vacation house over the weekend. (But Parts 2,3, and 4 all take place back to back, so it's probably Monday the 16th by now) Across the house, lives the Jarvis family. Tommy is a horror aficionado played by overrated Corey Feldman. He makes monster masks and gives Jason a decent match til he meets Tina in Part VII. If you love Jason and 80's slashers, I'm sure you'll love Friday THE 13TH: THE FINAL CHAPTER!!!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
93,baumer,A meaner Jason that seems to have a chip on his shoulder!,10,13 August 1999,"Warning: may contain some spoilers.I think Jason has been killed one too many times.  He is probably tired of kids hitting him with axes and machetes and knives because in this episode of Friday the 13th, he is just plain mean.  Not that he was a ""nice"" killer in the previous entries, but this time he just seems like he is taking it personally.The Final Chapter is one of the best horror films I've ever seen and if you are a fan of the series, this is as good as it gets.  There are some great scares, a likable cast, wonderful direction, nudity and Tom Savini decides to show up to make the final death of the film a memorable one.  If horror films of the 90's could have this much energy then we wouldn't be starved for crap like Urban Legend and Idle Hands and others.  This is what horror movies are all about and this is a great horror film.What we have in terms of a story is Jason escapes from a hospital in a very tense beginning.  Right away, the film starts with some great scares and some really violent deaths.  Poor Axel, he doesn't fare too well.  And from here we are introduced to the typical characters, six vacationing kids and a mother and her daughter and son and Gordon ( the family dog).  We also have a Jason hunter that is due for a grizzly death.  But the funny thing about the Friday the 13th's is that even though the actors are on screen for such a small amount of time, we actually grow to like or dislike them.  And so when one of them dies we are actually cheering or dismayed that they kick it.  I really liked Jimbo in here.  And when he died ( in a most heinous way ) I was a little bothered.  Then when I saw what Jason does to him after he is dead, well that was just cruel.  But the worst death in this film ( and this rivals Andy getting split in two in the third installment ) is Paul. He meets an untimely death by being introduced to a harpoon gun in a part of the body that it is not meant to receive that kind of attention.  And this death is just another example of the hilarious gag in the series where Jason seems to find weapons that just shouldn't be there.  I mean a harpoon in this one and a spear gun in the third?  That is funny.Friday, the final chapter is a great example of a scary horror film that concentrates on gore and suspense.  It is easily the best in the series and if you forget what it is like to watch the early efforts of the series, then my recommendation is to watch the first four.  They are great and if the series would have ended here, this would have been a perfect ending.This is the best Friday the 13th.  Watch and enjoy.  And tell me if you think he is just a little meaner in this film.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
94,DunnDeeDaGreat,My favorite in the series,7,20 April 2002,"We all know that Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter wasn't the final chapter, but it's still one of the best one made. Tom Savini did wonders on the script and as a make up artist. The film even has some geuine scares and Corey Feldmen as a young Tommy Jarvis was and always be Jason's best oppoent. I give it *** out ****.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
95,mentalcritic,The first of many final chapters...,1,20 September 2004,"One of the many challenges that a horror franchise faces throughout its existence is that of how to keep each episode fresh. The makers of the FT13 series had an answer to that question on at least two occasions, but the pressure of the lowest common denominator forced them to ignore it both times. Not that this is surprising. By the time part four rolled out of the gate, they had firmly set themselves up to appeal only to the lowest common denominator. It's all their fault.Unlike parts one, two, three, five, six, seven, and eight, part four contains actors who have worked in other productions since. While Corey Feldman has had a less than stellar career due to typecasting, he does turn in a considerably better performance than is the norm for the FT13 series. By comparison to the entire cast of part six, Corey deserved an award of some kind here.Part four begins with a recap of all the grisly events of the previous three parts. No mention is made of the cloth bag, the disco theme, or Betsy Palmer. Not that these elements really make for much of a difference, anyway. Given that Tom Savini allegedly only participated in this film in order to kill off the character he'd created, that should tell one something about what depths the franchise had plummeted to in just four short episodes. Obviously, the producers thought at the time that this really would be the final chapter, too. Given that seven more films featuring Jason have been released since, I guess we all know how that worked out.To the film's credit, it does manage to come up with some inventive and gory kills. The gore factor is even still impressive after the customary castration by the MPAA. Who knows what sort of wonders of make-up effects we'd have seen if the MPAA would only just realize that adults watch films, too. But I digress. Blood and gore, as impressively realized as it might be, is not going to save a film with a poor story.The story is pretty much the same as almost every other FT13 film. Jason awakes somewhere near Crystal Lake, a bunch of teens go to some remote location nearby, the teens get amorous, Jason kills most of them, end of story. It is the inclusion of the Jarvis family, in particular Tommy, that gives this episode a distinction from the other ten. Nothing else, save for the infamous machete face-slide, can really save the viewer from forgetting which sequel they're watching. I don't remember anything else about this film, and I am not sure I would want to.Not surprisingly, I gave FT13 part four a one out of ten. Unlike parts three and six, I don't wish I could give it less, but this is faint praise considering it took them another seventeen years after this episode to make a watchable Jason film. If you're not fussed about quality, then there is a slim chance this film might work for you. Otherwise, don't bother.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
96,Fernando-Rodrigues,Supernatural Jason!,5,25 January 2021,"I'm rating it 4.9 because it is an obnoxious movie. Things here are pretty slow, and there's nothing more exciting than the makeup and the climax, where Jason meets his match. I think Tommy's love for horror cinema could've been better explored and they could've worked with metalanguage, with more obvious references to horror movies.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
97,ODDBear,Best Friday film,8,18 June 2005,"Having recently watched all the Friday the 13th films again in a short period of time I've come to the conclusion that The Final Chapter is the best of the bunch. This was the last entry that took itself seriously as a horror film and it was intended to be the Final Chapter in the franchise. The filmmakers went all out to deliver a fast paced thrill ride meant to be scary and they succeeded at it too.The film uses elements from the previous three outings and compensates for several things lacking from them. The slow pace of the original and completely pointless middle section (that could be part 2 as well) is avoided here by keeping the action going on in several different locations and therefore never slowing too much down. The cast here is the best of all Friday films and it also has a very likable family at the center of everything, I think most would agree. The story is expanded on somewhat with the added inclusion of a family member of a former victim coming to Crystal Lake to actually look for Jason.Joseph Zito is a bit more stylish director than Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner and the look of the film is much darker and better than the previous three. The shower scene in particular looks good (though it looks quite a bit like the one in The Prowler, another Zito directed slasher). The makeup effects are very good, with Tom Savini the master behind them. There's some decent grue on display here and some kills are among the biggest highlight of the series. The ending has some very nasty effects on display when Jason is... I won't spoil it.Although the original is the only film in the series with the ""classic"" stamp on it, The Final Chapter surpasses it in many ways; it's more fast paced, has a bit more story, better actors and characters, a very angry, cruel and inventive Jason in peak form (he really sticks it to the teens this time around), better makeup effects, more stylish and darker look and a hell of an ending to wrap things up (for a year anyway).",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
98,fmarkland32,That's good marketing!,5,13 June 2006,"Think about it this way, if you have a series which is making huge profits in theaters, what better way to get people back to the theaters by saying this is the last one? Of course another element that makes this somewhat nostalgic for me is that back in 95 when I was 20 this movie was always on Cinemax or The Movie Channel, every single week. My sister graduated that year and this was the movie we watched when we finally had gotten the place ready for the graduation party. I had seen it before but I saw it again and i'll never forget the look on her face when Jason stabbed the hitchhiker who had just given the finger to those teens who refused to pick her up. On rewatch however it's basically the novelty of watching the human body get dismembered in creative ways. On this angle the movie is watchable. Plus it's fun to see Jason wipe out actors who actually had a future in films ahead of them.* * out of 4-(Fair)",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
99,Mister-6,"That Jason, what a guy....",1,10 September 1999,"Ever hear of gilding a lily?The good folks who brought us this ""Final Chapter"" (truth in advertising? Please....) sure did; this lily's so gilded, you can't even see the plant.The cast is better than usual, especially for this kind of splat-tacular (Glover, Feldman, Monoson, Mahler, Barton, et al), the effects are pretty good (yeah, thanks a lot, Tom Savini) but that's about it.SPOILER...Let's face it; they hyped this as the movie where Jason gets killed off. And does he?  Well, from the looks of it, he would have been better off (especially after what happened at the end with the machete.  Sheesh.).  But you know there were later sequels.  You think Paramount's gonna let a little thing like death get between them and their cash cow? Right. ...END OF SPOILERThe whole thing is kind of dumb, truth be told.  But you knew that when the hammer Jason threw impaled itself in the wall by just the end (not the claw, the very end where the hammer and the handle end connect.  Not easy to do, try it.).One star.

100,TOMASBBloodhound,Zito+Savini= Good Horror Film.,8,17 April 2005,"The fourth installment of the Friday the 13th series teamed Director Joseph Zito with legendary makeup artist Tom Savini once again. They had previously worked together on The Prowler which was an incredibly bloody and violent film. The end result was a huge money maker for Paramount Studios.The story is certainly nothing new. We have another group of young people being chopped to bits by a masked maniac. Since everyone knew what these films were about by then, it was up to Savini, Zito, and the writers to try and top what had previously been done up to this point. They more than succeeded.This is the film that introduces the Tommy Jarvis character to the story. He is a child in this one and he's played by a young Corey Feldman. Tommy lives with his mother and sister in a house in the woods near Crystal Lake where Jason roams. There is a house next door that has just been rented by six young adults looking for a good time. Think Jason would let that happen on his turf? Think again! After skinny dipping of course, the kids throw a little party at their house, and Jason shows up uninvited and starts chopping everyone to bits. I read in an interview with Joseph Zito that the house rented by the kids was built strictly for use in the movie next to the Jarvis home that was already there. It serves as an effective kill zone for Savini to stage the killings.Some of the better deaths are had by Peter Barton, Alan Hayes, and Jason himself, played very effectively by veteran stuntman Ted White. One of my friends up the street described the killing of Hayes with a spear gun, and I knew I had to see this film. I still cannot believe my mother took me to see this in a theater at age 11! Peter Barton's killing made me peer around the shower curtain to make sure nobody was out there for quite some time. And Jason taking a machete to the head was perhaps the most gruesome death I had ever seen in a movie up to that age.There is a large dosage of nudity and sex in this one. Perhaps even more than in part V, if that's possible. I think Judie Aronson was quite a babe. Paul made a big mistake blowing her off for one of those twins. Teddy and Jimbo are hilarious as the comic relief until they get killed off.If you like the other films in this series, you'll probably like this one. If not, don't bother.8 of 10 stars.Hey Teddy?

102,ivo-cobra8,The best of the series excellent slasher film the best Friday the 13th movie ever,10,24 September 2017,"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is my all time favorite horror slasher 80's film it is the best one and it is tied with Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives it is my third favorite Friday the 13th film this is a good a really good film. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my favorite film this is the best one I will always watch this film as many times I will want too I loved it so much I loved it! Kimberly Beck, Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover made this film work for me. This is Joseph Zito's best film he ever made. After this Joseph Zito went and directed Missing in Action movie with Chuck Norris a year later he directed another actioner Invasion U.S.A. again with Chuck Norris. I enjoy this movie much you have beautiful cast in here you have a lot's of nudity, great gory and bloody scenes, great kills great heroes. I just love this film to death from setting from acting from jokes everything I love in this film. I think is better than Part 1 and 2 but that is just my opinion. MILES way better then lackluster Part 3: 3D.Corey Feldman is great as Tommy Jarvis the main hero in this film this is his best film. I love him in The Lost Boys and in this film he was fantastic. Kimberly Beck as Trish Jarvis was excellent in my opinion really excellent I love her so much in here. Crispin Glover was great before he went to star a year later in Back to the Future (1985) my all time favorite film. Amy Steel convinced Peter Barton to play the role of Doug in this movie it was her talking that convinced the actor to make this movie. You have Double mint Twins Camilla and Carey Moore they are great twins. Judie Aronson from American Ninja and Dessert Kickboxer is in this film I barely recognize her but she is in this film. E. Erich Anderson as Rob did a good job as the guy who want's to avenge his sister death.Special makeup effects artist was Larry Carr, Tom Savini and Kevin Yagher who were practical special effects. No CGI bull sh**t no shaky cam I love all gory and practical effects used in this film. Yes Kimberly Beck can act! There was a beautiful jump scene trough window in which the actress fall. I kind a got a feeling that Wes Craven's Scream imitated that scene and copied it with Sidney (Neve Campbell) falling down from the window on the boat.The characters in IV were less cartoonish and more likable. I felt for Jimmy and Sarah, they were sweet kids. And ole big jaw, who bites it in the shower, wasn't such a bad guy. Nor was he an egregious stereotype. It feels like the franchise came into its own here. The Final Chapter is well-paced and well-acted, fit with campy dialogue, bloody deaths, and nudity galore. It uses the same formula as previous entries but it's a step above in execution. And it successfully managed to provide closure for the franchise... for a short time, anyway.The cast is also a little more varied this time around, with the introduction of the Jarvis family as well as Rob. Even though he doesn't accomplish much while alive, Rob was a great addition to the formula as the one guy who actually knows what the hell is going on. His mission, to hunt down Jason and avenge his sister, was an interesting turn for a series full of oblivious dopes. Too bad he doesn't use his genre savvy as well as he should have, losing his best weapons early on to sabotage and then putting up little-to-no actual fight once he finally comes face to face with his prey. Though in the end, without him (the machete and the all-important newspaper clippings are of course Rob's) Trish and Tommy would have probably had no chance in fending off the maniacal Mr. Voorhees.Which brings me to another thing. Jason is a ruthless killing machine in this one. He doesn't spend 10 minutes walking around and closing barn doors to elicit responses from the curious. And this being an early sequel, he's still active and apt to run after a victim rather than slowly walk and conveniently teleport in front of them. Which makes the end sequence one of the last that had any real urgency to it. And the gore, in addition to being really effective, doesn't seem quite as harshly cut from this one.The Final Chapter ties the original run of the series together well, and is the last Jason entry that can really be taken seriously.This is my number 3 favorite Friday the 13th movie I will always watch it, it is my favorite film. It is one of my personal favorite movies. It is one of the strongest in the franchise, The Final Chapter stills holds greatly on suspense, unpredictable scenes and bloody, gory kills! Even if I love Jason Lives to death, this seriously should have been the end of the franchise! This movie get's my Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 this movies are great I love this film to death I love it I highly recommend it to the fans.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

This time we shake up the formula a bit, introducing a relatively innocent single-parent family to the mix, though the vacationing kids across the street are more than happy to continue with the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll that's so familiar. It's a grab bag, really, a bunch of randomly-associated (or, often, not associated whatsoever) snippets that float around in the wash and occasionally bump into one another. I found it curious to spot a few name actors in the crowd this time: Crispin Glover is his usual awkward self and Corey Feldman plays the same mouthy, bratty kid you might expect given his early '80s stardom. Kevin Bacon's appearance in the first film may have set this stage, but it's still a little strange to see recognizable faces in the midst of such a transparent, genre-specific story, especially when one of them suddenly catches a grievous head wound near the climax.

The Final Chapter no way I'm glad the title was wrong and they decided to make another load because they are really fun movies. Again the body count is high and the gore is level is high, the acting is fine and plus we get more nudity.

Critic's panned the movie as just another despicable slasher movie that sees teenagers drink, do drugs, have sex and ultimately end up getting stuck with sharp objects.While not the final movie in the franchise Friday the 13th The Final Chapter does mark the end of a particular era in the series. The first three sequels (Parts 2 - 4) are part of a continuity where Jason Voorhees character is still human meaning he can feel pain and can ultimately be killed which he was in this movie. Friday the 13th parts (6 - 8) would see a resurrected Jason Voorhees become an unstoppable killing machine with enough strength to punch a man's head clean off his shoulders which he actually does in part 8.There are some great moments in this Friday the 13th including Crispin Glovers insane dance moves that he made up himself. The movie also stars a young Corey Feldman who was one of the biggest child actors of the 1980s although in this movie he was supposedly notoriously difficult to work with acting like a diva on set, making demands and delaying filming because of his bad attitude on set.Legendary make up and special effects artist Tom Savini returned to give us some of the best kills in the entire series including Jason's infamous death scene.Friday the 13th The Final Chapter is arguably the best sequel in the entire Friday the 13th franchise and is worth watching if your a fan of horror/slasher movies that can make you laugh aswell as having some of the best and most bloody death scenes in the horror/slasher movie genre.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
109,jp_91,Another great sequel with more of the same.,10,28 November 2019,"This fourth sequel is again about Jason murdering teenagers in Crystal lake. Some new characters, the famous Tommy Jarvis is introducing. Tom Savini gore effects are really brutals and amazing done. Kimberly Beck performance is cool and the cinematography is perfect and effective. A great sequel, the last great sequel of the franchise.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
110,rossrobinson,"Good, but should have ended with this",10,12 June 2004,"I thought Friday the 13th part 4: the final chapter was good, but this should have been the last because of the title saying the final chapter. I bet when people saw this in 1984, they would of thought that yes this is the final chapter, but then in 1985, they brought out another friday the 13th movie, friday the 13th part 5: a new beginning. I was totally confused when friday the 13th part 5: a new beginning came out because of the part 4, friday the 13th part: the final chapter, i thought the same, thinking that yes this is the final chapter, and then part 5 came out and Jason Vorhees was back alive and ready to kill again who ever gets in his way. I give this movie 8 out of 10, it should have been the last, but or well, looks like friday the 13th is coming out again and again with different story lines, different characters etc:",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
111,TalesfromTheCryptfan,Extraordinary chapter of the series but not the final!,10,27 August 2009,"After the events of part III, Jason Voorhees is assumed dead and taken away to the hospital morgue. However he isn't dead for he murdered a couple of workers and escapes back to the woods for another round of butchering. Four pals (Crispin Glover, Alan Hayes, Judie Aroson, Barbara Howard, Peter Barton and Lawrence Monoson) are out for a sexual holiday in a house next door to a family of three known as the Jarvis family with the mother (Joan Freeman), teen sister Trish (Kimberly Beck) and young Tommy (Corey Feldman). A traveling man named Rob (Erich Anderson) is on his own mission to destroy Jason once and for all but will Jason finally meet his own match? Excellent installment of the critically bashed but beloved by fans Friday The 13th horror slasher franchise. This sequel brings back the original's make-up artist Tom Savini only to have Jason destroyed and offers a great script from Barney Cohen (""He-Man and The Masters of the Universe"") that peppers the film with graphic violence, gore and of course a bit of humor with great direction from Joseph Zito (""The Prowler""). There's also some hot girls with good nudity and memorable kills such as the corkscrew to the hand to the the death of Jason, this film became one of the highest grossing entries at the box-office and was a nice way to originally be the final chapter.But don't let the title fool you cause part V came a year later as a so-called ""New Beginning"".",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

113,LebowskiT1000,Nothing new...just another film about Jason.,6,16 October 2002,"I can't really say this film was bad, but I can't say it was good either.  I don't know why people insist on comparing these films, they're ALL the same!!!  But they're still fun to watch anyway.  I thought this film was equally as good as the previous films.  I guess you can argue that Part 1 and 2 had a slightly better plot, but they're still quite a bit similar.If you are a fan of gore, then you'll definitely want to check this film out.  Some of the murders are quite a bit more extravagant than the previous films, but others are quite simple, a good mix I think.  There is one scene in particular where I couldn't help but cringe because it really was filthy disgusting.  So, for you gore-loving people out there, check this film out.The acting in this film is nothing to get excited about, as in the earlier films.  But there are some cool actors in this film.  Crispin Glover (""Back to the Future"" and ""Charlie's Angels"") plays a very likeable character, too bad he inevitably must die.  Corey Feldman plays an interesting character in one of his first roles of his career and does a pretty good job.  The rest of the cast is mediocre, although there is a slew of beautiful women in the film.  ...And the Twins in this film!!!  They are reason enough to watch this film.I do suggest you watch the previous 3 films if you really want to know what's going on, but it's not too terribly important, you can figure it out on your own.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
114,raypdaley182,Just a slaughter!,1,18 October 2007,"OK, before we start I just want to say Jason Voorhees died as a child from drowning, all the murders in the 1st film are his mother who dies at the end. Whoever is killing in parts 2 and 3 is neither him or his mother, OK? Part 4 starts the exact same way as parts 2 and 3 did, by recapping the previous films just in case you'd forgotten them. And just in case you had forgotten part 3 finished on Sunday 15th.Starting from where the part 3 ended (and telling us 10 died, I'd have check my review to see if that's right. I did check, yes 10 died.), We're already into Sunday the 15th and the body of ""The Killer"" (I won't be calling him Jason for reasons explained at the start) is transported to the autopsy room of a local hospital. The Killers 1st victim is Axel the horny morgue attendant (I'm still confused at how a dead man did this having had an Axe in his skull) which was his own fault. 2nd dead is the nurse Axel had been about to screw just minutes earlier.Moving into Monday the 16th and 3rd dead was a female hitch-hiker (just because she was there, it seems) and we centre on what will become our main characters, a cabin rented by 6 young adults and living over the road are Mom, Trish and Tommy (played by a young Corey Feldman). The young adults are Ted (the pretty boy rocker), Jimbo(the nerdy virgin who played George McFly in Back To The Future), Samantha (a bit of a tart), Sara (a quiet type), Paul (Sam's boyfriend who comes on to all the girls in the cabin), Twin Tina (seems very easy with the guys), Twin Terri (very quiet) and Doug who seems quite normal.On their route home Trish & Tommy meet Rob who claims to be hunting bear but seems to be looking for the group of young adults, It later turns out he's hunting ""Jason"". 4th dead was Samantha (out skinny dipping), closely followed in 5th by Paul (who impaled his own crotch). Jimbo hooks up with Tina to have sex & Terri leaves alone and is 6th to die. Trish's Mom may have been 7th to die (you only ever see her surprised by something but not killed).After having sex with Tina, Jimbo is 8th to die (in the kitchen) & Tina is 9th to die, pulled out of an upstairs window (where was The Killer standing to manage that one by the way?). Ted is 10th to die (in the living watching the Black & White stag film) and there's a great goof that The Killer can damage the movie in front of Ted then be behind him in less than 10 seconds. Doug is 11th to die (in the shower after sex with Sara) & Sara is 12th killed minutes later (an Axe though the door into her chest).By now it seems only Rob, Trisha, Tommy and Gordon (their dog) are the only ones left alive. Rob, Trish & Gordon go over the road to check on the young adults (who are all now dead, unknown to them) and find the house empty (they should have found Ted & Sara dead in the living room so the bodies were moved). They go upstairs & the lights go out so Rob goes to check things out, Gordon jumps out of an upstairs window leaving Trisha alone in the dark. Trisha finds Dougs body impaled to a wall in the bathroom, Rob is then 13th killed in the basement (screaming ""He's killing me! He's killing me"" - statement of the obvious there Rob!).Trisha goes back to Tommy, The Killer throws Rob's body through the window (like a previous film there!) and grabs Tommy but she frees him by hitting The Killer in the neck with a claw hammer. Also he gets a Computer Monitor smashed into his head (could have electrocuted him that way). Trish leads The Killer away from the house (1st time we ever see him actually run!). Tommys shaved head (very unconvincing bald cap there) to make ""Jason"" believe he is his younger self and the chop into ""Jason""'s head with the machete (which he manages to slice halfway into his skull by falling on it).This ends with Tommy having beaten ""Jason"" to death and Trisha in hospital. Tommy comes into to see her and they play the ""Jason"" theme to make you think perhaps Tommy took on a little more of Jason's character than we think he did.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
115,jhaggardjr,This should have been the last one,5,19 September 2000,"""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" is the so-so fourth movie in the series about Jason, the monsterous killer who wears a hockey mask and kills teenagers staying at either summer camps or houses in the woods around Camp Crystal Lake. All you get in this movie is pretty much the same thing that was displayed in the previous three movies: graphic violence, sex, nudity, drug use, etc. with this time new characters playing the victims. ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" is entertaining but tiresome. The series should have stopped here. But as everybody knows it didn't. ** (out of four)",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
116,baileycrawly,On Par with the Original,7,26 October 2019,"It's becoming a trend with these movies as I review them: they're fun slashers. They don't change the world or make (in my estimation) a significant impact on the horror genre, but they really aren't trying to. What they want to do is give you a good time, and this one, just like the three before it, didn't fail.
The biggest thing that I, as a viewer watching this series in a very short span of time, get extremely sick of, and that is the way of re-introducing the victims in the final act of each film. It relies too much on coincidence and, with all the killing Jason does in the run of one of these films, where does he find the time?
This movie, which was supposed to be the last (how many times have horror franchises pulled that move on us now?), isn't as bad as the original was for over-acting. The special effects are getting better and I absolutely love what they did with Jason at the end (not saying any more for fear of spoiling the movie).
This one has a very young Corey Feldman, and honestly I thought he gave the best performance of the film. Even from a young age he was a terrific actor.
I think, after the viewing, I like this one better than the original, but I still say the third one was my favorite of the series thus far.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Just Skip It And Move On To Part 6.,3,20 June 2019,"Not only is this a terrible film, but it somehow manages to be even more unbelievable than it's predecessors by having Jason beaten by a child. Jason loses to an irritating child in what was billed as his final appearance. Wtf? The irrationally high IMDB rating for this garbage is because Jason fans are irrational, and B movie fans get excited by seeing a Corey and a Crispen. I love Jason, but I will never watch this mistake again. The proof is in the pud - if this was even close to a good movie, then it really would have been 'The Final Chapter'. But it was too cheap to make, it made too much money in VHS sales, and it was way too bad to be the last appearance of Jason.You have to give Jason credit - no one ever tried harder to kill off Jason Voorhees than the writers and producers of this film. But, Jason was really hard to kill.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

119,mcfly-31,awesome,8,29 November 1999,"Gusto filled part 4 has the J man shaking off the axe to the skull and heading to somewhere called ""Crystal Point.""  I assume its a couple days after his last carnage because of a part 3 character saying ""what would a weekend in the country be without sex?"" which would tell us it was probably a Friday when that group showed up and got hacked that same night.  Then the next night is the body clean up which opens this film and the next night when most of the cast is smeared, so this may be more like Sunday the 15th. Anywho, the camp setting is dropped in favor of two cabins in the woods, one with a mom, sister, and brother, the other with six teens who show up to party.  After Jason awakens in the morgue and rips up a couple of attendants (the hacksaw was cool) he treks back into the woods to do his usual stuff. Maybe the strongest cast of the series is featured here, with Beck, Feldman, and Glover, aka George McFly, who gets torn up in the films grossest kill involving a corkscrew and cleaver.  But lets not forget poor Hayes, who takes a spear to the privates and is then raised into mid-air, ewwwww. Definately best ending of any of the films, with the ugliest Jason make-up and best thrashing of him.  There's about 12 kills here, and more if you count the recap of the first 3 movies during the pre-credits moments. They replay a counselors account from part 2 of Jason's origins as they intercut moments from the other films.  So great work all around here.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

122,emperor_bender,One of the best Friday the 13th's,8,19 February 2008,"In my opinion, Friday the 13th the Final chapter ranks as one of my favorite of the series. In this movie there were 2 different groups we got to meet. The first was the stereotypical group of horny, drunk, junkie, corny teenagers who are renting a cabin across the street. They consist of Paul (The stereotypical popular, horny boyfriend), Samantha (stereotypical whore, preppy girlfriend), Doug (nicer pretty-boy type), Sara (shy, low self-esteem girl), Ted (drunk, junkie, ""ladies man""), and my favorite, Jimmy (shy, horny, mysterious guy). Along with 2 horny twins (Tina and Terri). Then we have the newer party, the Jarvis family. Mrs. Jarvis, Trish Jarvis, and her little brother Tommy Jarvis. They were very interesting, but Jimmy was my favorite by far. There was also a hiker/hunter (which is new to the series), Rob Dier. This movie was one of the best not just because of the characters, but because of the effects and whatnot. My man Tom Savini returns as the make-up artist in this movie. Jason was played very well in this. Also, the music and lighting made the movie much spookier than the previous ones. I give this an 8/10. Very good movie, watch if your a horror/Jason fan.

However, a young boy with a talent for making masks decides to stand against Jason, and he may have met his match. Unfortunately, there is no truth to the title, but there should have been. This would have been a great ending to the series. The story is good, there is an eerie feel surrounding the movie, and it's definitely the least boring of the series. The death scenes are the best out of the series as well. This movie features the best acting in a Friday the 13th film, with actors like Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover, who both went on to do popular movies, unlike everyone else in the cast.This movie really passes as one of the better 80's slasher films. There's great action at the end, and the ending really gives closure to the series, but of course the powers that be had to screw it up by making a bunch of others. If you want an entertaining slasher movie, this is it.6/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
124,bh_tafe3,An improvement on the third film,5,8 December 2008,"Corey Feldman gets another iconic eighties role under his hat, getting the honour of slaying Jason once and for all it was originally intended to be the final chapter in the Friday series.This is an enjoyable return to slasher ville and a massive improvement on the poorly produced Part 3. There's no genius characterizations in this one. All the clichés are there. The teenage tart who hits on her friend's boyfriend right in front of her, the peeping Tom 12 year old, the horny nerd, the insecure loser who get himself some and the fragile older sister smarting internally from emotional problems.The kills are all quick, but some are creative, and most of them are getting rid of awful people you don't mind seeing killed, and in the case of the ""Computer Man""'s death you are absolutely delighted.Jason's death is suitably dramatic, with Feldman slicing and dicing with a machete to send Jason to movie oblivion, where he would stay until Part VI as it turned out.Nudity and sex scenes abound, as in every Friday film, but the kills are all sudden without a great deal of claret.

This time, the formula is beginning to get a bit stale. The teenagers featured have no characterisation other than their sexual status  sex is all they think or talk about. Corey Feldman is great as the young makeup expert, even proving to be reliable in finally doing what others have tried & failed to do in the previous films. The effects makeup is better than in the previous sequels, thanks to makeup & gore guru Tom Savini.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
127,squeezebox,HA HA HA!!! That's a good one!!!,6,28 January 2003,"FINAL CHAPTER, eh? Right. Above average by slasher standards, this intended ""final"" entry features a good cast of recognizable 80's brat pack wannabes, including Crispin Glover (BACK TO THE FUTURE), Corey Feldman (THE GOONIES), Lawrence Monoson (LAST American VIRGIN) and Judie Aronson (WEIRD SCIENCE). It also ranks as one of the goriest in the series, thanks to the return of Tom Savini, who provided the effects for the first one. Same old story, a group of horny teens travel to Crystal Lake for a vacation, not knowing of course that Jason has awaken and escaped from the morgue. Little Tommy Jarvis (Feldman), a special effects nut, and his older sister (Kimberly Beck) are intrigued by the newcomers, and get to watch as they go skinny dipping (no shortage of sex and nudity this time). Meanwhile, the brother of one of Jason's former victims is out looking to put Jason in the grave once and for all, wandering around in the woods armed with a machete and a shotgun. Jason proceeds to mutilate the bunch in some pretty brutal ways (a boy's head is crushed against a wall, another gets a corkscrew in the hand and a meat cleaver in the face, a girl is thrown out a window and smashes onto the roof of a car, a guy gets harpooned in the crotch--ouch!), until his final showdown with Tommy, who dresses up like Jason as a kid and confuses him long enough for sis to whack his mask off, revealing his grotesque face. When he goes after her, little Tommy grabs a machete and slams it into Jason's head, nearly decapitating him when he falls causing the blade to slide further in. Quite an impressive and disgusting special effects feat. Later, at the hospital, Tommy has a demented look in his eye--leaving the door open for yet another entry despite the title. Enjoyable performances, competent direction and a fast pace make this the best of the series next to Part III.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
128,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Unforgettable And Suspenseful Sequel And One Of The Best In The Series.",10,19 June 2015,"Friday The 13th:The Final Chapter is an excellent,Unforgettable and suspenseful sequel that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,a fantastic score and amazing special effects. All of those elements make Friday The 13:The Final Chapter a memorable Horror movie and one of the best in the series.Taking place after the events in Part III,the final chapter finds Jason Voorhees(Ted White)escaping from a hospital this time stalking the Jarvis family and a group of teenagers unprepared for the wrath of Jason.Friday The 13th:The Final Chapter is a brilliant Horror movie and is easily one of the best films in the Friday The 13th franchise and one of the finest Slasher movies ever made because it pretty much has everything you would have in a Friday The 13th movie and Slasher film:characters who are dead meat from the start,blood and gore and of course Jason Voorhees. It's also the film that introduced protagonist Tommy Jarvis who would be an important character in the Friday The 13th franchise against Jason. Final Chapter is an absolute roller coaster ride from beginning to end that is thrilling and suspenseful and also came out at the peak of the Slasher genre during the late 1970s to the early 1980s and The Final Chapter(or Part IV)came out at the right time. The the suspense and tension in the film is fantastic with a slow build-up that takes it's time and when the suspense stops the movie explodes with intensity. Also,the movie is great because it combines two genres that were successful during the early part of the 1980s:the Slasher genre and the Teenage Sex Comedy mixing together blood and gore of a Slasher movie and the Humor of the Teen sex Comedy bringing together the best of both worlds with some laughs and terror. The characters are some of most fun and memorable in the entire series whether it's the Jarvis family or the teenagers every main character is interesting. Despite having some laughs The Final Chapter is probably the darkest,nastiest and most nihilistic film of the series thanks to the atmosphere which is bleak and grim with rain,fog and dark lighting that is used to great effect where you feel like no one is safe. The movie also has a tough and vicious mean streak with the blood,gore and kills which are not well-done and horrific but cringe worthy and painful that when you watch Final Chapter you will feel like turning away. As for Jason Voorhees the character is at his very best here,sneaking up on his victims like the silent killer that he is taking his time and waiting to strike at his prey and at times Jason does it in a very surprising way. The Final Chapter is also Jason at his angriest and most vicious I mean in here he pulls no punches and takes no prisoners with the people he kills in this movie and it seems like the more he kills and chases someone the more angry he gets. I think that the only other film in the series in my opinion that can match the brutality and anger in terms of the Jason character and kills would be Jason Lives although the tone of that movie is much lighter compared to this film. This would also be the last time Jason would be hiding in the shadows and darkness because in the later films he's the star and out in full light. The ending of Friday The 13th:The Final Chapter is a terrific ending and one of the best finales in the series with twists and plenty of surprises you won't see coming and one of the finest chase scenes in the franchise that is exciting and frightening. A fantastic ending. The cast is good. Ted White is excellent as Jason,with White being menacing,angry and intense. Kimberly Beck is wonderful as Trish Jarvis,the heroine of the film. Corey Feldman is terrific as Tommy Jarvis,Trish's little brother. Crispin Glover and Laurence Monsoon are hilarious and memorable as Jimmy and Ted,two teenage buddies. Erich Anderson is great as Rob,a man Trish meets. Joan Freeman does a good job as Mrs. Jarvis,Trish and Tommy's Mother. Judie Aronson(Samantha),Barbara Howard(Sara),Camlla More(Tina),Carey More(Terri),Peter Barton(Doug),Clyde Harris(Paul),Bruce Mahler(Axel),Lisa Freeman(Nurse Debbie Morgan)and Bonnie Hellman(Hitchhiker)give good performances as well.The direction by Joseph Zito is outstanding,with Zito bringing and creepy and intense atmosphere to the film and occasionally moving the camera giving the movie a nice pace. Great direction,Zito.The score by Harry Manfredini is another impressive score and adds to the tone of the movie. Wonderful score,Manfredini.The Special and Practical Make-Up Effects by Tom Savini is amazing,gory and some of the best work Savini has ever done. Terrific effects,Savini.In final word,if you love the Friday The 13th series,Slasher movies or Horror films in general,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th:The Final Chapter,an excellent,unforgettable and suspenseful sequel that is one of the best in the franchise. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
129,Brian-272,Far from the final chapter.,4,13 July 2001,"This fourth installment had many to think the series was over with the death of Jason, but just wait until the sixth Friday.

130,Rendanlovell,Not that bad,4,20 July 2020,"At this point I got the Friday structure down. Open with unrelated characters being killed by Jason in a scene that goes on forever. Then titles, then cut to actual main characters, usually a group of horny guys and girls trying to hook up in a remote location. Stick with these lame, flat characters for 30 minutes while they do mundane chores or bang. Then allow characters to make poor decisions leading to them separating and being killed one by one. A girl somehow eacapes and the cuts to credits. Fill time with bad dialogue and dull camera work and you've got yourself a 13th movie! Nothing more to it then that.In terms of this specific movie, it's hard not to say everything I've already said about these movies. They're lazy, lame, boring, and filled with nonsense. This is no exception. The biggest difference between 4 and the other sequals is Cory Feldman. No, it's actually a real lack of Jason.If you pull out the opening scene Jason doesn't show up until nearly halfway through. There's usually some shots of him watching through the woods or stalking the kids but not here. He sorta pops in and out at random. It's very bizzare and makes for an incredible lack of tension.Now, none of these films are scary in the least but they try. This one does not even try. Jason kills a guy on the ground floor then immediately teleports to the top floor to throw someone out of a window. There's no tension in things just happening. Not to mention, again, nothing happens until well into the film.It spends so much time setting characters up and none of them are even likeable enough for me to be scared anyway. All the horny teens are wet blankets, then Cory Feldman and his family is just there until right at the end. I don't know why they are here other then just because. They're always kinda around, not doing anything. There's only 1 character that's different and interesting. Which is a random hiker guy looking for ""bears"". Most of the time though he's lounging around in a tent doing nothing.It's all very strange and sloppy. The weirdest part is, I didn't hate it. It's more serviceable then the first one even. The performances aren't bad and the kills, when you get to them, are fun. A guy gets his head smashed in the shower, a girl gets thrown out a window onto a car, and another girl gets pinned to a wall. For once, the kills were consistently the best part. You've got some from the other movies like an eyeball poked out at the camera or a man in wheelchair thrown down some stairs, they are just better here.Maybe I'm becoming delirious after watching 4 of these in a row but this one came the closest to serviceable for me. That said, the closer you get to that the closer you are to being plain boring. There's nothing worse then a boring movie and this really borders on it. The first half is particularly rough but when Jason starts killing, I had fun.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

I love Friday the 13th some of the films. The Final Chapter is slow pace, boring as hell. Other than gore is nothing else to see. I have re-watched this movie previous month and Part 2. However Part 2 I enjoy, this movie i don't. It is consider it been the best from fans in the franchise to me it is a dull movie.I love Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood but that movie gets crap but this movie get's better raiting from fans? Kimberly Beck was okay but she did not defeat Jason. A little kid Tommy Jarvis did but that was it? Lar Park-Lincoln Tina Shepard is MILES way better heroine and the final girl than Trish Jarvis is. What happened to that main character Trish Jarvis in the movie it was never explained. The movie is boring, the death scenes are slow I was really bored out of my mind of this movie. The finale was the only thing worth to watch.The movie has too much sex and horny teens. It is annoying the death kills are alright just i didn't care it come an hour till it was excitment when jason attacked Trish but that mostly was. I don't like this movie it is consider it best by fans I don't think so.I love Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives , Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, The Evil Dead, Aliens, From Dusk Till Dawn, Leviathan (1989), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge , Shocker, The People Under the Stairs, Freddy Vs Jason much better movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), The Blob (1988), The Thing (1982), New Nightmare (1994) or other Friday the 13th movies: Friday the 13th (1980) to death, Friday the 13th Part III: 3D, Friday the 13th (2009), Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning yea that movie get's crap and Jason X I love these movies.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is my at least favorite film sorry but it is and I am not sorry.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
133,ReelCheese,One Of The Best In The Series,7,28 July 2006,"It's really quite remarkable how producers of the ""Friday the 13th"" series can take essentially the same plot and time and time again crank out something new and entertaining. This dishonestly-titled fourth entry ranks as one of the best installments in the venerable franchise about masked maniac Jason Voorhees slashing his way through Camp Crystal Lake. Thought to be dead following an axe attack at the end of the previous film, Jason suddenly rises once again at the hospital, immediately picking up where he left off. But this time someone's waiting for him: young Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman).As far as horror movies go, ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" delivers. True, some of it is old hat by now. When Jimmy, played by Crispin Glover, is nailed to a door frame, for instance, you can't help but think producers simply ran out of ideas. But semi-memorable characters, a good pace and a terrific final 15 minutes help make up for the shortfalls. This picture surely won't please all audiences, but those for whom it was intended will have a blast.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
134,geminiredblue,Let Me Count the Ways,3,13 September 2011,"Let me start this review by saying: I've always been a sucker for the 70s and 80s slasher flicks. Even though most were dull and derivative, some stood out and really made for some good entertainment. Case in point, the first FT13 (that's Friday the 13th in shorthand.) Sure you could see it was ripping off HALLOWEEN, the best of the bunch in my opinion. But it was inventive for its setting- an isolated campground- and the variety of deaths- thanks in large part to special effects man Tom Savini! Not to mention, the identity of the killer is truly remarkable. And for anyone who has yet to see FT13 or SCREAM (you know who you are) I'll let it remain a secret! After its success, sequels were certain to follow. Part II is just as good, even though the characters are paper-thin. Part III (or 3-D) is my least favorite of the original four. Not even the limited 3-D effects could save it! Then came Part IV, labeled as the FINAL CHAPTER... yeah right! Of the four, this one is the most polished. They even went out of their way to get a few name stars: Crispin Glover yay! As usual he plays a nerdy character, and I really liked him. Shame that nerds always get killed in shows like this! Unfortunately, we also have to contend with the antics of Corey Feldman. I could never understand his appeal! Once again, we have a variety of inventive deaths and the much-anticipated sex scenes. What else could we expect? These type of movies always delivered what they promised! Personally, there are two other reasons for watching this movie: the extremely gorgeous twins played by the More sisters! Too bad the filmmakers didn't close the book after this one, because none of the subsequent sequels would come close to their originality!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
135,ryan-10075,"""Hey, Ted, where the hell is the corkscrew?""",7,25 July 2020,"Tom Savini is back. This time it was to kill off in essence the character he created in Jason Vorhees. This was supposed to be the final FRIDAY THE 13TH, but seeming that Paramount made big money off these movies they couldn't just let Jason die.In the fourth installment Jason is not quite dead yet. So after mutilating his way through the Wessex County Morgue he's back off to Crystal Lake. This time it's a cabin full of rowdy, horny teenagers who happen to be right next door to the Jarvis' with sister Trish (Kimberly Beck) and brother Tommy (Corey Feldman).While there is nothing new in the story department to me it is the great effects by Savini, the direction from Joseph Zito and a good set up for the final confrontation with Jason...or what was supposed to be. There are some really good kills in this film. Yet at the same time there are some kills that with the fact you have Tom Savini as your effects guy are kind of lacking. It was just decided to have the shadow of the character killed or characters completely killed off screen.If you have made it this far into the series certainly tune in to this part. Not sure exactly what my favourite FRIDAY THE 13th movie is, but I would say my favourite parts are 2 through 4. They are all flawed, but do have some things going for them. This part does have my favourite Jason though in Ted White. I really enjoyed the earlier versions of Jason and lean toward White and Richard Brooker from part 3.Also starring Judie Aronson, Peter Barton, Erich Anderson and Crispin Glover as Jimmy. Glover is really great in his role and shows off his amazing ability to dance.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
136,Toronto85,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,8,16 March 2011,"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is obviously not the final chapter to the series. It is however one of the best sequels in the franchise. This fourth one takes place right after the third at the Higgins barn where Jason was axed in the head by Chris. The police find all the victims at the lake and take Jason's ""dead"" body to the morgue. Of course Jason isn't really dead. He quickly escapes the hospital and heads straight to Crystal Lake. There are a new group of teenagers heading to the lake this time, and we also meet a family (The Jarvises) who live on the lake.After knocking off many people, in very brutal ways, Jason meets his match in Tommy and Trish Jarvis. Tommy devises a plan, which involves shaving his head, to send Jason to hell once and for all. Tom Savini's makeup and special effects are brilliant. This was probably the most gory/gruesome of all Friday films. The stalking in the woods is very creepy and ominous. And Ted White, who plays Jason this time around, is very scary in the role. There is one scene to note as well. Jimmy's (Crispin Glover) dancing scene is the funniest things I may have ever seen. This fourth Friday ranks near the top of all the films. Part 2 is my all time favourite, but this is definitely close behind.After The Final Chapter, the Friday films take a downward spiral into complete mediocrity. This came out in 1984, right around the time horror and slasher films started to became a total mess.

Gratuitous nudity, violence, special effects, and Cory Feldman freak out scene make this a great part of the 10 part series (Freddy vs. Jason not included).What we have here is standard for the storyline with a few new elements. The story starts right where the 3rd movie leaves off with the police arriving at the barn and taking a seemingly dead Jason to the morgue. Of course at the morgue Jason wakes up and brutally murders the coroner and a nurse. Now for some down time in the movie to introduce some characters. Tommy Jarvis (Cory Feldman) is introduced as a 10 to 12 year old kid obsessed with horror movies and masks and his older sister whom is not well developed, but you care for her anyway. Introduce a group of kids to party out in a log cabin next to the Jarvis' and you now have a group of people for the slaughter. And last, but not least, the guy who is hunting Jason down for murdering his sister in the second film.As with the first 4 Jason films, they are a lot of fun and definitely some of the more violent out of the series. Tom Savini does a great job with the death of Jason. Cory Feldman was great as Tommy being the one to defeat Jason (not once and for all, though).

What to say? Maybe the background score. In between the music, you can hear the sam,e old sound of FTT-phishh phishh phishh...Otherwise it's just a follow through of the last 3 films, with gore, gore and gore, many people getting brutally murdered, teenagers interested in nothing but sex and scary scenes that actually look comical and foolish.

141,kingofdanerds,This film is nearly too good to be a Friday the 13th film,7,25 January 2021,"Friday the 13th Part III 3D was intended to be the final Friday the 13th film but it made a lot of money and so, in 1984, the intended final film of the series, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter was released and as we all know, this film is most certainly not the final chapter. The film was directed by Joseph Zito who also directed the 1981 film, The Prowler. This film notably stars Corey Feldman (The Goonies, Stand By Me, and THe Lost Boys) and Crispin Glover (Back to the Future, Willard, and Charlie's Angels movies). The film itself was another commercial success and once again, critics bashed this film (most notably Roger Ebert). Though that does not stop this from being a fan favorite amongst Friday the 13th fans.After the events of the previous film, Jason Voorhees is taken to the local morgue. He escapes and goes on another killing rampage. But will he finally meet his match?Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is a good film. Almost too good to be a Friday the 13th film. Why is that? Everything from likeable charaters, great special effects, and tone. Let's at least start off with Jason. Jason is mostly obscured in the shadows for this film which does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I like seeing Jason. From what I can see though, Jason's look remains the same from the previous film. This time around, Jason is played by Ted White who is often considered to be one of the best Jasons other than Kane Hodder. To me, he is a slight improvement over the previous Jason, Richard Brooker. The kills are top notch here. Despite being cut by the MPAA, the kills do look really good. Why do they look so good? Because Tom Savini is back! Tom Savini is the master of special effects and it shows here. The kills are just straight up brutal and rather unique and not the same old stabby stabby type of kills. With the special effects, you get the occasional view of a fake head but considering that this was the 80s, I will cut this film some slack because they did only try to use these fake heads as little as they can. The cinematography is rather nice and what not. This film uses natural lighting fairly well and in certain scenes it works extremely well. It makes this film possibly the darkest in tone in the whole franchise and I really dig that. A huge strong point of this film is the characters. The characters this time around are really likeable and are actually developed too. Obviously some standouts are Tommy Jarvis (played by Corey Feldman) and Jim (played by Crispin Glover). Though, a complaint that I have is that there is too much focus on these characters that this does feel like a teen film at times rather than a Friday the 13th film. Which is not painful as the characters are likeable. With likeability comes memorability. The climax of this film for me feels shorter but it is still fun to watch. The ending itself (that is literally the final couple of minutes of the film) is rather silly and seems to me to also want to hint at a sequel rather than end the series.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is a solid sequel. I cannot bring myself to rate this film higher as it does have some flaws to it. But in all, a solid sequel.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
142,d_m_s,The Final Chapter,6,3 February 2014,"Decided to watch this after reading a little about it in Corey Feldman's autobiography and because Crispin Glover is in it and there's a funny story about him in the book.It was a surprisingly enjoyable sequel. I thought it was shot pretty well and there's some decent characters, made watchable by the light comedy moments. Crispin Glover's dance is a great moment.However, the more interesting characters got killed off too soon (the doctor in the early scenes, Crispin Glover about half way through), meaning that the film became a little more boring as it moved on.Some of the acting was good, some terrible. The two random girls (twins?) that turn up about 30 minutes in give terrible performances. So bad it's hard to watch and it brings the film down a little.The kill scenes were OK but they could have been better and I've seen better gore in other slashers that were made before this.Overall it was quite enjoyable, funny-ish and worth a re-watch at some point, ideally with friends and a few beers.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

144,RhapsodyReviews,Perhaps it Should Have Ended?,4,6 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' is an American slasher film directed by Joseph Zito. It is the fourth installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. They say much like Part III, the film was originally supposed to be the final installment in the series. The studio was aware of the declining popularity of slasher films at the time of its release. As a result, the film was marketed as 'The Final Chapter' to ensure it as such. I don't see why they would think it was going to be the final film when they left it on a cliff hanger like every other in the series.
Picking up immediately after the events of 'Friday the 13th Part III', the story follows a presumed-dead Jason Voorhees brought to the morgue, where he spontaneously revives and escapes, returning to Crystal Lake to continue his killing spree.
I've got to say, the movie is still just as cheesy as its predecessors, but you can tell that the acting increases a lot between this one and 'Part 3'. Crispin Glover, Kimberly Beck and Corey Feldman are all standouts in this movie. They did the best they could with the dialogue they were given, and it wasn't great.
The movie was stuff fun, but I feel it was because of Jason himself. All of these movies are just recycled material with the same showstopper as its main focus. I think if it was just another slasher film and didn't have Jason or 'Friday the 13th' title to back it up it wouldn't be a good time. Or at least as good of time as it was.
Overall, as I said, the movie is recycled for the fourth time and nothing new is being introduced. Part of me wishes they stopped it as a trilogy, but the other part of me craves more of the cheesy blood fest. If you want a good original movie, watch 'Friday the 13th as it stands alone.

145,DustinRahksi,More memorable than most.,5,1 January 2013,"Once again delving back into my childhood, I remember this film more so back then, then I did when I watched a few months ago. The first time I saw this film, I thought it was the most graphic film ever made, I hadn't seen too many films back then. The gore and effects are at the peek of the series. I was shocked at how much nudity was in this film, given I was young at the time. Now-a-days it's still a great viewing experience but back then it was a really some thing new to me. The best kill is the first one, with the saw and head snapping around, another great oohhh! moment. This is probably the best sequel in the series, and worth checking out. Friday the 13th is truly the best and biggest slasher franchise of all time, and the films are great whenever you have a marathon of them. If you want a good time look no further, this film has what you want.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
146,FKDZ,Better than Part III but that's not saying much.,6,23 August 2020,"So first off we get once again a flash back to the events of previous movies. This time done a bit more creatively but still unnecessary.Now Part IV is a lot better than Part III but not by that much. My main critique of III was just how incredibly sloppy it was. This movie tightens it up and specifically excels in the kills.So the movie starts out a little different... you know.. maybe this time it won't be a bunch of teenagers going to a campground. This movie keeps going right after Part III and that was interesting. The hospital scenes were pretty fun and the coinciding kills were great, Jason really didn't like those comments from Axel and after using a bone knife on his neck he also thought: ''why not snap it as well''. Gives Jason a little depth that he isn't completely mind numb.Now after that we meet a small family living in a cabin, interesting I thought. Maybe this time it will be the family getting hunted down? Well, partially. A group of friends rent out the other cabin and have probably the most awkward party ever filmed. That whole party scene was the epitome of good idea, terrible execution, from awkward cuts to terrible dialog. The teenage actors were all over the place regarding their performances, none of it good. That one dance scene did get me to burst out laughing... Jimmy does some incredible stuff..Trish, the final girl is sadly not smart character. She's probably the dumbest one from all of the movies so far, going back into the basement after her friend got murdered. Or going up the stairs and jumping out the window almost killing herself. I guess tommy was supposed to fill up this gap of being smart but with Trish getting so much more screen time it was still really lackluster.Compared to Part III they really upped the nudity again as well. Back to the levels of Part II. Just like part II, it's just filler and doesn't do anything else than please some audiences.Now about Jason's look, the face reveal at the end... why? Not as in why did he show his face but why did they downgrade his look? I can strongly remember the way jason looked in Part III, scary as hell with his pale skin and deformed head. Now he looks like some green alien. Not a fan of the green color at all.The good stuff, Imo the kills are a lot better than Part III and I'd almost say Part II as well but that's a tough call because the characters there were just more interesting making the kills feel a bit different. This movie has great kills, but you just don't really care about the characters. My highlights are the corkscrew into neck twist, and the shower scene where the guy's face gets pushed in. Also the Harpoon Gun into the guy's privates was painful to watch. BUT the scene where the guy hunting for Jason gets killed in the basement is probably the top contender for worst acted/written scene in F13. With the contender being the Hippie stoner girl saying ''Oh my god, oh my god'' in Part III. Wow, this was incredibly bad and Trish's decision making is terrible.Also another kill but more so a fun thing the director decides was the kill of that girl going home in the thunder and rain. How the camera moves past her and you saw Jason's shadow on the house once the thunder flashed. This movie, just like the last one has a couple of great shots of Jason just looking badass. Storming through a door making it explode. Staring Trish down a couple times. Though compared to III Jason does have a lot less screen time. Which I thought was better to keep the element of surprise/suspense.The final scenes, I personally thought wasn't as good as I hoped. I really hoped the foreshadowing of Tommy making those scary masks would come to use. But none of that, he just made himself look like drowned Jason which somehow worked? It made less sense for Jason to be captured by the look of his old self than his mother in Part II which was fantastic.Now all of the past movies ended with a scary hallucination, now this movie doesn't really have that. But ends with a cheesy cliffhanger than now Tommy is possessed/became Jason. Imo I just see it as a joke and don't think he will be the next Jason but we will see.All in all this movie yet again hasn't come close to Part II, which had actual likable characters and a much better final girl. Trish is barely memorable. The highlights of these movies so far is how Jason is evolving and changing throughout.I could go on and on about inconsistencies and awkward moments. But there's also some charm to it. And I already wrote enough for now.5.5/10 better than Part III in some aspect but by the tiniest amount. Still had some fun though.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
147,lnvicta,The best in the series.,7,27 June 2015,"I've seen every Friday the 13th movie more than once. I'm a horror completist, what can I say, and Friday the 13th happens to be one of the more campy and fun horror franchises out there. The first three were fine - all had great ideas, great kills, and great atmosphere. Unfortunately, there was at least one thing off in each of those movies. The original's climactic ending hasn't aged well and some shots linger for way too long, and some parts of Part III felt clunky and poorly paced. Part IV isn't perfect either, but it's a step above its predecessors for a number of reasons.1. The acting - No one watches horror for the acting, I understand that, but when a horror movie has a likable cast and characters you can relate to and root for, it makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Crispin Glover is great as a nerdy, horny white boy and his dancing skills are unmatched. The lead girl and the rest of the supporting cast are all convincing as well, and the boy Tommy Jarvis actually isn't annoying for a child actor. In fact, he's pretty darn good.2. The nudity - No one watches horror for the- okay, some people watch horror for the nudity, and boy is there nudity in this one. For the ""final"" chapter the crew went all out, throwing two gorgeous sisters and numerous blondes into the mix and having all of them show their tits and ass. Yeah, both, and although its gratuitous and adds nothing to the plot, it's a nice break from the bloodbaths and I'd take a little eye candy over forced dialogue in a horror movie any day of the week.3. The pacing - The movie begins with Jason's ""dead"" body being sent to the morgue, and it isn't long before the body count ensues. The hospital scene is excellent for a few reasons. One, it has two characters that have less than five minutes of screen time but more personality than anyone from the first two F13s, and two, their deaths are awesome. It's a briskly paced movie and surprisingly keeps a large amount of its cast alive for a majority of the film, yet there are enough disposable characters to keep the body count going. It's a great balance.Everything else comes down to good writing and good directing. I like the addition of a family, I like the group of teenage Jason fodder this time around, and there really aren't many dull moments. The inclusion of a seasoned backpacker was a nice touch, and Jason finally getting the sh*t kicked out of him was no doubt satisfying. Although the whole Tommy arc didn't work out in the next installment, he was a nice addition in this one and actually contributed a lot to the story.Not only is this the best Friday the 13th film, but it's a damn good slasher in its own right. The characters are likable, the third act is plenty suspenseful, it's an entertaining ride from beginning to end. If you like '80s slashers and want to see some good looking people get terrorized by Jason Voorhees then there's no reason not to check this one out. And check out the others too because, why not?",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
148,NerdBat,Took them long enough,5,3 March 2018,"With as incredibly infuriating it is to see Jason constantly getting back up regardless of what he gets hit or chopped up or burned with or whatever, the end was a relief. Though, just throwing this out there, 4 more movies left, I'm guessing hes still not dead. Oh well. Anyways, the movie was fairly decent, apart from a few scenes where you just kinda go ""seriously?"". Who honestly screams ""hes killing me!"" when violently being murdered? Just kinda seemed farfetched. I liked the second movie the best so far, but we'll see how well the rest go.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
149,tequila101,This Friday Delivers,9,17 February 2011,"This was actually the 1st Friday film I have seen and it was awesome to watch one of the best in the series. Even if the suspense is less tense then before, the gore along with the kills and having the maniacal Jason back truly delivers.Along with Part's 2 & Jason Lives, this would have to be one of my favs in the Friday series.Just sets straight after part 3 when Jason got hit in the head with an Axe and strangled from a rope from a high level. He then gets transfered to a hospital and he escapes, (already killing two) let's say 2 hours later. He then makes his way to crystal lake, stalking sex-crazed, high drug, drunk teens. There's also a little kid who lives with his parents in the woods and he loves video games. Some teens do move into the woods to party and spend a couple of days there.Jason then kills all of them one by one but the kills in this are excellent. Espiecially the shower & cork screw kills. Even Jason's death by Tommy Jarvis (The kid) was done well. It was good to see that Tom Savini did those bloody gory effects. He hadn't done any of them since the first film.One of the best, if u haven't seen this Friday yet, I suggest u do. 8.5/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
150,TheRadiobox,One more time for the people in the back,3,1 August 2020,"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter was directed by Joseph Zito, written by Barney Cohen and Bruce Hidemi, and stars Kimberly Beck, Corey Feldman, Peter Barton, Erich Anderson, Crispin Glover, Barbara Howard, Lawrence Monoson, Joan Freeman, Camilla More, Carey More, Clyde Hayes, Judie Aronson, and Ted White. It follows the now prolific Jason Voorhees as he revives from the events of Part 3, and yet again, continues his killing. Survivors gotta stop him oh who cares.Plotting is pretty much the same as the prior 3 movies, why it needed to be done for a fourth time remains unanswered. After the events of Part 3, Jason (White) awakens from his presumed death by axe. The following day a new group of idiots including Sara, Doug, Jimmy, Ted, Paul, and Samantha (Howard, Barton, Glover, Monoson, Hayes, and Aronson) go to the camp. Upon the group's arrival they meet twins Tina and Terri (Camilla and Carey More), Rob (Anderson), and their neighboring family; Trish and Tommy Jarvis (Beck and Feldman) and their mother Tracy (Freeman). Jason starts his killing again, but this time it's personal, as he kills Tracy; Tommy eventually goes out for revenge.Characters in this fourth outing are slightly better than the previous ones, but still mostly despicable. All of the characters that are not in the Jarvis family hold only a single trait: being horny; so horny in fact, that they literally do not talk about anything other than having sex. Having one character that is the personification of a  is fine if their sole purpose in the plot is for a cool kill, but do not make the audience spend a lot of time with them. This mistake is made plenty of times here and i hate it. Tracy Jarvis is fine, having a decent bond with her kids, but not much else. Trish is a generic final girl, with little to set her apart from the others in the franchise. Tommy is the only good character, having to step up and take down a seemingly unkillable hulk after he loses a loved one. If only more time went to him. Performances are; as usual, mostly bad. Feldman is not great but he was a kid so i get it. Both him and Beck do what they can to elevate the garbage script, and Glover is so goofy that it's hard to look away.Scares once again do not exist. Since the characters are basically non-existent and roughly acted, there is absolutely no reason to care about what happens to anyone but the Jarvis family. Since the movie is a typical slasher-horror, there is no tension, you know what is going to happen. Even though tension could still exist despite a predictable plot, it never materializes, leaving the audience to essentially stare at the exact same movie as the last ones. Music is still relied on like a crutch to a cripple, it is overbearing when a kill is about to come; effectively removing the last potential ounce of terror from a script and plot of a movie that already had little to work with. It is a regrettable end result. Again, i copied and pasted this section because it's pretty much the same. Again.Technically the movie is on the weaker end. Clearly the most effort went into the kills, which are are convincing for a change. On occasion the makeup and effects look cheap and silly, but far less so than in the other movies. Lighting is pathetic, everything lit like a school play. I guess that makes sense given the crew behind the production but it hardly excuses the mess that is this movie. The music is better than the others thanks to the production having the budget for someone with some talent, and Jason is a more intimidating villain with an actual presence, although he looks terrible and bares no resemblance to the Jason character from the last movies. Can there be a single entry in this franchise where he looks the same, please? At least Tom Savini came back to make this entry worth something.Friday 4 has more to offer its audience than the first 3, but that is faint praise. Tommy Jarvis makes for a more interesting protagonist, and Tom Savini's makeup here is some of the best in the franchise, but even with those little bright spots there is still no reason to watch the movie in its entirety.38/100",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
151,monkey-man,Good 1980s horror movie,6,14 January 2006,4th movie in my Friady The 13th movie marathon.Friday The 13th The Final Chapter is a good horror movie about how Jason Voorhes did not die in the end of the 3rd movie but everyone thinks that he is dead and he was taken to the hospital and he kills two hospital staff and he gos back to Camp Crystal Lake.When he gets back to the camp there are some new people staying there on a holiday and a family living there and he starts to kill them all but he meets his rival there a young boy named Tommy Jarvis (Cory Feldman).There are a few good kill scenes in this movie and the best two are:1.When the character Jimmy (Crispin Glover) is in the kitchen and Jason Voorhees Stabs his hand to the bench with a cork screw and then Jason hits him in the head will a cleaver.2.The character Pauel is swimming by him self at night time and Jason stabs him in the groin with a spear gun and picks him up and shoots him in his groin.Over all this movie is a bit better then the 3rd Friday the 13th movie and there are 2 good actors that i like in this movie and they are Crispin Glover and Cory Feldmen.My rating for this movie is six out of ten.,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

They've mostly just been collecting dust in a box but watching them again have me lots of thrills... Normally I'm a bit harsh in my reviews but I really have a soft spot for this series along with the Nightmare on Elm Street series.. These films were important in the task of introducting the horror genre as we know it - wannabe followups like Scream and all the other BS cannot follow this, trust me...if you love horror but for some reason missed these films you are in for a treat!I remember this, part 4, as being the first one I ever saw of the series, and it actually shook and thrilled me in ways some might called perverse, but I grow up with this series in the mid 80ies and got to love it them.In this, fourth chapter, Jason for the first time turns into the very mystical character who can vanish and turn up at other turns at the speed of light. In the past films he moved more humane (as humane as he gets anyway..), but getting killed a few times apparently gave him extra strengths..It is not movie art, granted, but it is great entertainment, especially if you saw them as a kid.....",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Hockey mask wielding slasher Jason Voorhees returns in this fourth installment of the very popular slasher series 'Friday the 13th'. I found it interesting that the film isn't actually titled as part IV instead hewing to just 'The Final Chapter' subtitle which time would quickly prove to be wildly inaccurate. This is widely considered one of the ""better"" entries into the series, but I would take that with a grain of salt as none of these films stray too far from a very similar design or purpose, and ultimately none of these films are really very good. This is most memorable due to giving us a young protagonist in the form of child star Corey Feldman playing Tommy. At its core though this movie stays right in the wheelhouse of the franchise assembling a bunch of young people near the isolated Crystal Lake who want nothing more than to get high, get drunk and have sex, but unbeknownst to them they were all about to fall prey to a sinister, hockey mask wearing, machete wielding psycho.
The fourth film known as 'The Final Chapter' picks up where part III left off with Jason dead and a bunch of bodies in his wake. He gets hauled off to a morgue where he is somehow supernaturally resurrected. With that pesky task out of the way his fixed goal of stalk, slash, repeat is free to continue unabated. Like other films before it this one assembles a group of young people who want to party and are really present just to serve as lambs to the slaughter. This one alters the formula a bit in two ways. The first is the put a family next to the partying kids. The family consists of mom and a sister who is about the same age as the vacationers and the young Tommy who enjoys horror movies and horror movie makeup of all things. The other is that a guy shows up supposedly hunting bear but that is a thinly veiled ruse and he turns out to be the brother of a Jason victim from a previous film and he is here to try and hunt and take revenge on Jason. All of this comes to naught as Jason hacks and slashes through just about everyone on screen. All that is left by the finale is Tommy and his sister. Of course Tommy's skill with horror makeup comes into play as he disguises himself to some degree as the young Jason. Jason when confronted by someone that looks like him is perplexed and pauses which gives our heroes the opportunity to dispatch him for this installment.
There is really not very much fresh or original here. Despite its popularity this is really just the same thing over and over again, and being from the early 80's it looks and feels incredibly cheesy and dated. It is interesting to see a young Crispin Glover show up in a supporting role. This does a little bit to try to feel slightly original, but really it is not enough and it becomes essentially a retread of everything that came before. This seemed to come in an era where film makers really didn't have a problem just making the same thing over and over again to capitalize on relatively easy box office, and it would work because despite 'The Final Chapter' title we are not even halfway through Jason's run of dull yet lucrative movies.

154,tom_koopa,Friday 13th isn't really getting better...,5,30 November 2009,"I was hoping that after the somewhat disappointing part III, the series would pick up and improve in quality.Sadly, I was wrong.Part IV, strangely called the Final Chapter, didn't leave a good impression on me. There were only a few good scares and creative deaths that I cringed about. But it's nothing compared to the first 2 films. Those 2 are still, in my opinion, the best in the series.If you can't get enough of Jason, go watch this. Amongst all the boring characters, at least Jason is still doing a fine job.5 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
155,shaun98,Dreadful,2,19 April 2002,"[Includes a ""spoiler""]Strangely enough, it is not often that Jason himself puts up an appearance in the fourth entry of the series. Why he is absent from such a large chunk of the film, I cannot be sure, but from a financial point of view, isn't that a bit counterproductive? After all, that's what the fans pay to see, Jason killing people, isn't that right? His absence reveals the movie for what it is: a bad teen melodrama that happens to guest-star Jason.
Most of the characters are so annoying that we actually root for Jason to kill them, and so he does, but not nearly soon enough. That's the problem here; there's not enough slasher action to sustain such a thin plot. The result: a major bore. Granted, Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover have some appeal. Makeup artist Tom Savini obviously had a hand in the script, as Feldman is portrayed as a child prodigy with an interest in special effects. Glover generates some sympathy as a lonely young man. Savini himself does a good job crafting Jason's gruesome demise. However, these elements aren't enough to prevent the film from being a tired rehash. By now, it is useless to comment on the fact that Paramount lied when they said it was the last. Jason simply can't die, and we must live with that fact of life.

158,chucknorrisfacts,The final chapter? Hardly...,5,19 October 2007,"Anyone notice something strange about the title of this movie? That's right, it says the ""final chapter"". However, an additional seven movies featuring Jason Voorhees were released after this film was made.I am unsure whether or not this was ever intended to be the last in the series, or if it was just a marketing ploy to get more kids in the theater. Whatever the case, it is one of better ""Friday"" films.As with most horror films, especially in the 80s, a cast of relative unknowns is in place, with one notable exception, Corey Feldman. Corey Feldman, best known for his roles in ""The Goonies"", ""Stand by Me"" and ""Gremlins"" stars as Tommy Jarvis, a young boy who lives with his family in one of the cabins at Crystal Lake.Also, you might notice Crispin Glover, the actor who would go on to play George McFly, Marty's father in ""Back to the Future"". In this film, he's one of many doomed campers to be run through by Jason.As a group of teens visiting the camp gets killed off one by one, it is Tommy who is left to save the day and stop Jason once and for all, well for now anyway.

While watching this movie, you will wonder how Jason ever got to be such a huge horror icon with such awful movies. This film is completely unmemorable except for the ridiculously idiotic ending. I would highly recommend not seeing this movie unless you like stupid movies where ALL characters do things that are totally illogical. What also makes this movie so dull is the unbelievable stupidity of the residents of Crystal Lake and its surrounding areas. Wouldn't three repeated mass murders at the same location make national headlines? How come no one in these movies seems to know or care about this?

This film has every thing a Jason movie, horror movie, or for that matter any movie should contain it. It has Jason breaking through glass, throwing hammers at little kids, and swimming (which is fact that Freddy vs Jason overlooked thus downgrading its legitimacy) This film has a young Corey Feldmen taking on Jason and winning, he does lose his sanity though. Feldmen plays the character of Tommy with great intensity and shines in a role was born to play, and hopefully will return to one day. Crispen Glover does an early role in this as Jim the nerdy guy who can't get laid. He is great in this. You can really tell he's going somewhere with his acting. I hate when his character is killed with a cork screw and machete but those are the brakes of being in Friday the 13th movie. Kemberly Beck is the perfect last girl and is totally hot. i hate that never came back (hint to the dumb idiots who write the new movies, she and Feldmen are what the fans want. Give it to us!!!) Ted White does a fine turn here as Jason and is second only to the legend that is Kane Hodder. White is the first actor behind the mask to nail the walking motif. he also looks the best without the mask.This movie would never had been so great if it were not for the make up effects of Tom Savini. While he does great work here I feel he lied about his reasons for involvement. He has said in many interviews that the only reason he returned was to kill Jason. I say he lied. The only reason he returned was because he was in bed with Joseph Zito the director of this film on another project called the Prowler in 1981. Savini says in other interviews that he does not even remember what Jason movies he worked on thus making me feel that he had no intentions of killing Jason he was just in it for the check.

Story, cast,(Corey Feldman, Crispin Glover, Lawrence Monoson), graphic violence, killings, AND Jason. Immediately picking up where ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" (the 2nd best of the series), ""Friday the 13th Part 4"" was such a brilliant addition to the franchise. For those who haven't seen the series, Part 4 is not a bad place to start, or finish. We get a great little campfire story (courtesy of Part 2) and a lot of great death sequences (from the 3 movies past) within the first 5 minutes. We also get real acting, & actual character development with the ""Final Chapter"". This was the last movie in the series that was actually made AS a horror film, and not as a cult film. And this movie does scare! The killings in the ""Final Chapter"" are original and beautifully executed. Corkscrew to hand-then cleaver to face, spear gun right in the groin (YEAH BABY), banana vomiting, and 2 WONDERFUL crashing through the window sequences (one with twin Tina, the other with Trish) that still manages to frighten me to this day. The shower seen is pretty awesome as well, and even the dog isn't safe in this one! Awesome!! After Part 4, the franchise became almost a joke, and the films that followed are nothing but camp. They are still good and watch able, but they weren't intended to scare the heck out of ya! ""Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter"" does it all, time and time again. This film has gone under rated and without credit for many years. Many people say that the original ""Friday the 13th"" was the best, but I highly beg to differ. Part 1 WAS the original, but it's somewhat slow paced, and Tom Savini's masterful special effects are much more evident in Part 4. Tom was really on top of his game by the time ""The Final Chapter"" went into production. Part 1 has the scariest ending, I'll give it that.

Having the Master of Gore FX Tom Savini back for all the bloody good scenes is a real step back up for the series. And having better actors is also a great improvement, especially from Part 3! We start off yet again with a recap of the first 3 films in the series, leading up to the police and emergency squad removing the bodies from the house and barn to be taken to the local morgue. Jason still lives and begins killing in the morgue before heading back out to his neck of the woods to prey on some more unsuspecting teenagers who have just moved in to the area.Lots of nudity in this one folks. Actually, this has the most nudity out of all the films in the series. A young Corey Feldman is really good in his role as Tommy Jarvis. I like the part where he's on his bed looking out his window into the house next door as one of girls are getting naked. Funny moment. So overall this was a pretty good movie. The acting was pretty good and the characters were more believable. Good for a nice late night fright flick...",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
176,nightwatch4773,Return to form....,7,26 March 2013,"Has the bloodiest kills of the series and the most nudity in the entire series. Cory Feldman plays the young Tommy Jarvis who will be finally the match Jason is looking for. The film starts off just like Halloween 4 starts off Jason in the morgue but it is not long before Jason is back on his way to Crystal Lake for more mayhem. A young Crispen Clover is on top as well so this little instalment had some star power it was unaware of. The gore factor is really turned up in this sequel that features the most gruesome killings in the series. This entry and maybe part 5 must be the reasons why the MPAA got their little hands dirty with parts 6,7 and 8 which were so heavily edited that compared to today's standards could be viewed on Saturday afternoon with the kids.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

179,jcooloti,OH MY GOD HE'S KILLING ME!,9,27 June 2019,"This movie is probably the best in the series. I love 80s movies. I love slasher movies. This movie is a perfect embodiment of both. We also got a couple of hard hitters in this cast..Crispin Glover is absolutely amazing in this movie being his weird self in a great role. His death is hilarious and the face he makes after being cleaved in the face for one second before the scene cuts is actually pretty brutal and scary.Cory Feldman is great in this movie. His ""peeping Tom"" scene is strangely adorable. It's as if he's not even acting and it's really happening. Something you don't see in these movies is good acting. Funny how the best performance in the series was done by a little kid but I think most people would agree that the boy has a talent and is ultra charming.I now want to talk about Rob's death scene, which might be my favorite death ever in a slasher film only because it makes me laugh so hard. Rob goes down the stairs of a dark basement and is attacked by Jason with a garden tool to the chest.. one of those little claw tools that loosens up soil. Now, you can barely tell what's going on... it's really badly lit and the camera angle is terrible... but Rob manages to yell out some of the funniest dialogue of all time here... he tells the girl he was exploring with to run and ""OH MY GOD HE'S KILLING ME"". I've wondered if he was told to say this or if it was scripted because he really goes for it... really screams.. but the line itself is so ridiculous it makes me laugh so hard. I also love that weird tool he uses. My imagination goes wild. I remember my mother always using the same tool in her garden growing up.There are a lot of good throws in this movie. I'm a big fan of jump scares that involve a body being thrown, especially through a window.I have a very warped and twisted sense of humor and a true appreciation for the macabre. This movie just does it for me. It's funny, nostalgic, scary at times for the newcomers and a lot of fun. This is a great movie to watch with your best buds or company with a sense of humor. It also used to scare the living hell out of me when I was a young boy. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I continue to.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
180,Colbridge,We've done all of this before but it redeems itself in the last reel for a final showdown with a welcomed twist,5,7 November 2021,"The fourth instalment in the Friday the 13th franchise turned out not to be the final chapter after all but that doesn't take anything away from Joseph Zito's take on the slasher series as he turns in a decent sequel on par with the first three, thanks to the return of Tom Savini who is back on gore effects duty after his ground breaking work on the original Friday the 13th (1980) that pushed the genre into more realistic territory with the kills.Part 4 also marks the last time the movie opens from the events of the previous film as we see Jason's body being taken from the barn of Part 3 and stored in the local mortuary only to come back to life to start yet another chapter. Ted White plays Jason in this one and is one of the best to step into the iconic role, as well as being the oldest actor to play him.Zito injects some light humour into proceedings, evidenced by Crispin Glovers strange dance at a party, as well as introducing a precocious child, played by Corey Feldman, who has an unexpected pivotal role towards the film's climax.The kills are inventive and gory and the film moves along at a good pace but it can't get away from the fact that we've been here and seen it all before. The dumb actions of the teenage victims gets rather repetitive and Jason jumping through windows or coming out of the woods no longer catches you off guard but having said that this entry is a good effort and it redeems itself in the last reel for a final showdown with a welcomed twist.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
181,maureen_smith5,Same old same old really. One half great horror and kills. The other annoying characters and jump scares.,7,17 May 2019,"Like the first three movies in this iconic horror franchise, this fourth part was half great and inventive whilst again it was half stupid and annoying(the third part admittedly was mostly great though, my favourite of the first four movies).Again it had very cool, brutal, gory and memorable kills by the menacing hockey mask wearing Jason plus it is always a thrill to be at Camp Crystal Lake(a real standout location in horror flicks to me), plus a few kills from him at the hospital were cracking(first death in the movie was real nasty).The problem like the other movies is the very annoying, daft, obnoxious and loud characters that are the main cast(again better ones in part 3)that mainly all are very irritating that its so awesome when Jason turns up to bump them off, only a few stood out as pretty interesting(mainly the bonkers Crispin Glover who plays his usual oddball type plus a young Corey Feldman as a geeky horror fan, who had a terrific arc throughout).
The other gripe has to be the excessive use of jump scares, that though common in many of today's horrors, was unneeded in this era of horror. Yeah a few are ok when needed(like in Jason moments for example), but in non horrific scenes they are pain for the viewer, plus some are seen a mile off, so what is the point half the time(things like characters out alone, a character stood by a window and a character stood by Jason as he is motionless, often leads to a typical cheap scare).Like I said the kills and locations are a joy plus Jason is such a icon in the genre but why do we always have very annoying characters, tacked on sex scenes, wooden acting, predictable scenes/moments and yes the cheap scare.These movies would be so much stronger with these things toned down, its why I really liked part 3, it wasn't a masterpiece but it stands out much more than parts 1, 2 and this movie part 4.Horror can be great but with endless cheap jump scares, it ends up being just very good in places.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

After his revival in a hospital morgue, the hockey-masked murderer fixes his vengeful attention on the Jarvis family and a group of hitherto carefree teenagers. Young Tommy Jarvis is an aficionado of horror films with a special talent for masks and make-up. Has the diabolical Jason finally met his match? This films starred: Corey Feldman, Crispin Glover & Erich AndersonIn my opinion, this was not a stand out film in the Jason film saga, if I had to choose a favourite out of the first 4 it would be Friday the 13th part 2 no doubt about it.

All the regular slasher hallmarks are here to sustain the predictability level for the teenage target audience but this one is slightly saved by introducing a self-referential character twist, with Corey Feldman playing a horror-obsessed kid who might know how to deal with Jason. Perhaps a nudge to the postmodern route the slasher sub-genre would take after the introduction of a Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984. This is quite ironic seeing as by this time the Friday the 13th franchise wasn't going to win any awards, so instead just churned out films that were deliberately bad, (which the awful original tried not to be but was), but remained true to the slasher aesthetic, whilst keeping the body count high and keeping alive the most popular character, that of the masked psychopath Jason Vorhees.6/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Starting off at Higgins Haven, from Part III, Jason is taken to a hospital, where he gets two more new victims! Then he goes into the deep woods for another round of teen-slashings!

185,ChrisTreborn,"Jason-Entry 3: ""80's Horror Movies SUCKS!""",1,26 May 2005,"First of all am a big fan of horror movies. I like to see all the F13 movies but most movies made in the 80's got lot of boring elements, and this one is not an exception.Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter (Spoilers******) For People who came late, the original film tells the story of a psychotic woman Pamela Voorhees who lost her little son Jason in the Crystal Lake camp. She eliminates a group of teenagers who have come to reopen the camp, but in the end she was murdered. Then in the second chapter her son comes back as a grownup (masked) man taking revenge for his mother. In the third installment he just goes for more killings and takes a new appearance by wearing a Hockey mask.This sequel starts from where the previous sequel left off, continuing from same day of the previous movie, Jason wakes up in the hospital where everyone thought he was dead and returns to Crystal Lake for more killings.Directed by Joseph Zito this sequel tells the last days of 'living' Jason. That's right, the HUman Jason Voorhees's death occurs in this installment thereby 'officially' ending an era of Human Jason; I think that's why the producers gave the title 'Final Chapter'! For that reason I think this sequel have some importance. (In my view since sequels II-III-IV occurs on same continuing periods, they can closely consider as F13th Second Part Trilogies!). But hey Jason never quits, he re-lives in the coming sequels, more specifically in the 6th Part (because in the next sequel, part 5 the story completely deals with this movie's arch enemy called Tommy Jarvis, on the shades of Jason!).Scripted by Barney Cohen for the story of Bruce Hidemi Sakow, makes the continuing story of psycho-maniac-killer-machine Jason Voorhees. With a body count of 13 plus 1 for Jason himself, this sequel tried to provide a final part to Friday franchise with some strong characters. But the major problem was the script didn't have a good narrative strength, usual boy-girl stuff, boring story telling, lagging events, stupid suspense, almost everything is present here! Camera works done by S. Phillip Sparks, Jerry Karman, Steve Barnes and Randy Nolen under Joao Fernandes were good. But the editing done to those footages by Joel Goodman and Daniel Loewenthal Sucked! The soul for this chapter is provided by Harry Manfredini, but he failed to give a tensioning score.The big surprise in this movie was Crispin Glover, I was amazed to see him as another teenage George McFly again, it was fun. And as for the Jason whose last appearance as human, Ted White did a great job.All in all it's a great movie if you can tolerate some boring lagged suspense we usually encounter in the 80's F13 movies so ""I would give this movie 1 out of 10"".Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter = Final Chapter of 2.nd Sequel Trilogy!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

I don't know why they are making a tenth Friday the 13th. I bet it won't make much because after suffering through nine sequels, Earth is a little careful now. There just isn't much to say about this because it's been done before. In it's own series own movies!!

Essentially the same set up as the previous entry in the series, teenagers at a residence located near the camp get picked off one by one. The difference here being that the younger brother of one of the teenage girls ends up being clever enough to figure out a way to stop Jason forever.

Now it isn't just girls taking their clothes of for no reason, no that would be silly, instead they are taking showers, swimming in lakes, having sex, yeno proper reasons to take your clothes off and show boob. I ain't complaining though, its always nice to see a bit of boob outside of pornhub.The kills are really boob I mean bloody, yeah bloody. Awesomely graphic, I mean you see everything... it's great.

He has not got time for your bull crap, he wants your head on a platter and he will have your head on a platter god damn it.Tom Savini is in the make-up department which explains the gore, and possibly the boobies, but it definitely explains the gore. I think he also designed Jasons face at the end ,which isn't as scary as it was in The New Blood but the way Tommy slaughters him is pure, graphic, Savini awesomeness. I loves it.

Obviously it was so popular that never happened.So somehow Jason manages to revive himself... Which is one of the films biggest issues to be honest as they never explain HOW??? That is left until far later films with new directors.There is very little new here to add... The story follows the same formula as previous, but now the scares are not as good if I am honest...While the first three films played on your expectations and lured you to look for an attack in one place before giving you a blind side... This film only has one when one of the Twins is killed... The camera angles make it so you expect an attack from several different areas in the room and it drags out long enough for you to want to see a blade crashing down on her, Only for Jason to smash his hand through the window and throw on top of a truck below...One really good jump scare!!! THAT IT! The film's started becoming more reliant on the brutality by this time, and it lacked the suspense of the originals. Maybe it is because the franchise was so popular and the films were demanded by fans, so less effort was put in...There are great moments, You finally get to see Jason in all his glory...

191,xiaoli7377,Schlocky Slasher Fun,5,22 August 2020,"Look, this is a ""Friday the 13th"" movie. You're not going to be getting high-brow entertainment of any kind here. There is lots of gore, there is lots of bare-breasted nudity. Frankly, the ""Friday the 13th"" series has never been the pinnacle of the slasher sub-genre of horror anyways. If you want to see what I feel are genuine works of art within the sub-genre, I'd suggest checking out ""Psycho"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", or ""Halloween."" They all preceded this series, and in my opinion perfected the concept of the faceless killer who stalks his pray (though ""Psycho""'s Norman Bates did have somewhat of a...personality). If you want something a little more modern, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Don't Breathe"" are also pretty good choices.Regardless of whether the movies themselves are any good, it's hard to deny that the hockey mask-wearing, machete-wielding serial killer Jason Voorhees has become somewhat of a cultural icon. If you were to watch any of the 10+ ""Friday the 13th"" films out there, the humorously and ironically titled ""The Final Chapter"" is not a bad choice. It's just that if you are looking to be left genuinely teeth-chattered and bone-chilled, this movie isn't for you. It has moments where some of those elements shine through, with the infamous six-note theme ominously playing in the background as the first person viewpoint of Jason stalks his prey, but those moments are bogged down by the goofiness of scenes such as: Crispin Glover's character breaking out in a wacky robotic dance to woo a girl, the male coroner hilariously (and perhaps intentionally) overreacting to Jason's limp arm touching his thigh while making out with the female coroner, or the guy who is crying out ""run away! He's killing me!"" over and over again as Jason continues to hack at him with an axe.The plot is basically the exact same as every single other film in the series. We get a brief recap of the prior films before we are shown the police cleaning up the crime scene left in the previous chapter. Jason's body is hauled off to the morgue, where he is inexplicably resurrected and proceeds to kill two coroners. He then flees the scene, presumably returning to Crystal Lake. We are then shown the Jarvis family (it is worth noting that the child, Tommy Jarvis, is played by a young Corey Feldman). We are also introduced to a car-full of teenagers (this movie's Jason-fodder) and are told that they are moving into the house neighboring the Jarvis family. That night the teenagers throw a party, and as Jason decides that he wants to crash it, you can connect the dots as to what the rest of the movie entails...I get that this one gets high praise from fans of the series, but it just doesn't do it for me. To me, it's not very thrilling and it's not very original. That being said, this kind of movie, in my opinion, is the razor's edge of schlock. It's campy enough and corny enough to be able to sit through and have a good chuckle. Let me be clear: this is not a good movie at all. But I am giving it a score of 5 because I would be lying if said that I wasn't entertained while watching. That's just me and my dark sense of humor though. If you don't find over-acting and terribly written dialogue one of the funniest things in the world, or if high levels of gore, blood, and topless nudity bother you at all, it would probably be best for you to skip this one (and all of the other films in the series, for that matter).",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

In top 3 for sure. In general, one of my favourite ""Friday the 13th"" films.""The Final Chapter"" is actually the last film where we have a human Jason, if we exclude the remake. This is something that I really appreciate, because when you have to encounter an undead Jason, things are getting more complicated, so here we have for the last time the simplicity that I personally seek.First of all, the introduction of Tommy Jarvis. Tommy Jarvis is one of the best characters of the whole slasher genre, because he tears down the establishment of the ""final girl"" (although we do have here final girl). He's one of the first ""final guys"" in the slasher history, and very intelligent too, from a young age. This is a bonus.The kills were great in my opinion. I have to say that this is one of the most violent and bloody instalments from the beginning until the end. It will be disturbing for someone that doesn't really like gore. I personally don't like splatter films and this film is certainly not, so I didn't mind all the gore, plus, I found it awesome. Especially for a ""last"" entry.A thing that I didn't really liked was the characters. They were not interesting for me. I found them kind of boring in the beginning of the film, but then they were getting better and better, so that is good. We had of course the typical sexualised, high teenagers, something cliché, but we also had two very funny characters in the film, something not very common in the franchise.In general, I really enjoyed this film.

196,lonchaney20,"""Hey Ted! Where's that corkscrew?""",8,15 May 2010,"I'd rank this one up there with Friday the 13th Part 2 as the best of the series. The only flaw, just as with most of these films, is that the MPAA slashed the murder scenes; it's even more painfully obvious here than in number 2! This is still made up for by great direction from Joseph Zito (clearly the best director in the series besides Steve Miner, who himself took a step down in quality with number 3), some fantastic (though only briefly glimpsed) make-up effects by Tom Savini (my favorite one being at the end - you'll know it when your jaw drops), and some oddball humor courtesy of Crispin Glover and...that other guy, who I at least remember was called Ted in the movie.If you didn't already know it from The Prowler, Joseph Zito knows how to craft a creepy movie, and knows how to use darkness effectively. In fact, the cinematography here is probably the best the series has seen, so kudos to João Fernandes. Incidentally, a quick IMDb search reveals that Fernandes got his start in porn, lensing such films as Deep Throat!Initially I was underwhelmed by this one simply because I felt it was just a rehash of the same Friday clichés, but listening to the commentary by Adam Green and Joe Lynch on the new DVD gave me a new appreciation of the film, and, as with most great films, it took some retrospective thinking to realize how good the film really was. But as I always say, if you dislike a film at first but find yourself getting the urge to watch it again, it probably was much better than you think.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Overall this is probably the scariest out of the series. Still the movie lacks quality, originality has its share of terrible actors. The main problem with the film is that it doesn't have any new plot, it is the same thing, Jason going out killing a bunch of teens and any one else who stands in his way. Jason does not portray a scary, chilling killer he is just a mindless hacker. The gore level is pretty high like part 1, which will please gore hounds.

198,Duzniak38,Not The Final Chapter...,10,2 August 2006,"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is a good instalment to the Friday the 13th series, but is by no means to best. The story shows a group of teenagers go to a house in the deep forests by Camp Crystal Lake to party. There is also a nearby residence, where the Jarvis family live. This sequel is much more darker than the other movies, and desperately lacks character depth. The main heroine Tina and he brother Tommy are the only decent characters, with any depth to them. All of the other characters are just a group of teenagers intent on getting drunk, smoking, skinny dipping and have pre-marital sex, which is now the main formula for arousing Jason into a killing machine. In this sequel, Jason has very little depth either, he just hunts down all of the teenagers and kills them one by one, and basically, that is it. he does nothing else to make us feel hatred or remorse or sympathy, he basically just kills everybody, unlike the previous movie, where he battles the heroine, and shows intelligence and emotion. There is plenty of gore in this sequel, and some rather gruesome and inventive death scenes. The start of the movie is set in a morgue as well, which furthers the basic forest scene, but doesn't really expand on much, except Jason kills off a few characters in the morgue, then escapes. It may have been fun to see Jason hunting down people in the morgue, and escaping, the going back to Camp Crystal Lake. The movie focuses not only on the house full of partying teens, but also the Jarvis family who live nearby, and how these new sexually active teens have brought Jason to the neighbourhood for some ultimate terror. The script is pretty poor in this instalment, with some lame jokes and bad eighties corn. The acting is fairly decent, and the soundtrack is nothing rememberal.

In my opinion not as good as part 6 since that one had more humor that mixed well with the horror aspects. I will skip over the synopsis since there are plenty of other reviews that go in-depth on that but instead I will focus on what the film succeeds at and what it fails at. The film succeeds at a multitude over different things. First as per usual the atmosphere is masterfully crafted and really gets you into the film. Next the gore and special effects are done really well, I especially like all of the masks in the film that are done by Tommy Jarvis, he's a Tom Savini in the making. Also all of the performances are really good can't say that there were any I didnt at least enjoy a bit. Next Jason's make up looks especially good and I enjoy how they keep his mask from the previous film where they show the damage inflicted upon it.

200,Shinwa,"Completely distasteful, yet oddly compelling",2,28 November 1998,"Perhaps the most entertaining of the gruesomely misanthropic Friday the 13th franchise is this completely streamlined effort, boasting much nudity and gore. After a while, it's difficult to remember who's been killed, not that one's major motivation is concern for the characters, who are played in the standard late-20-something-teenager manner as completely stupid and sex-obsessed. Some good gore effects, if that's what stokes your furnace, but the whole enterprise leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

205,bramb600,Not the final chapter but the most entertaining.,7,15 June 2009,"Well the title is a bit of a lie to the fans, because this is indeed not the final chapter. Still if it was the final chapter it would have certainly satisfied most horror fans because it is overall a great film.The cast is great and it was probably the only cast to feature some A-list stars for the time, but it was a good choice because they were probably the better actors and connected well with the core audience. There was even some great humorous scenes thrown in the mix.The brilliance of the movie is that we never really see Jason until the end, but he's there throughout the movie, killing in some of the most inventive ways the series has ever seen. When we finally see Jason, he looks completely bad-ass and terrifying, the best look he ever had.The ending is very cool too because someone was finally able to defeat Jason and sure it wasn't a perfect story arc but this specific one was a top notch horror film. I can only give it 7 because it does still have it's flaws.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

The acting is awful, the characters are all lowly, and the plot makes no sense. Jason isn't actually dead, escapes the morgue, and goes to kill people. These people include six teens moving into a house across from an established family with no idea that three killing sprees have taken place (four technically) about a mile away from them. There's a kid who becomes the hero (not really, there's a hilarious ""kids are murderers"" vibe at the end) and blah blah blah.It's typical fare for the series and not at all as good as the first. The gore effects are much better but the lighting is dreadful and the idea of a kid killing Jason is about as stupid as Jason being killed by a girl with psychic abilities...Oh wait, that exists?",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

209,Horror_Metal,My favorite Jason film!,10,3 October 2013,"Hockey mask wearing serial killer Jason Voorhees (Ted White) is defeated when a would be victim takes an axe to his skull. His supposedly lifeless body is taken to the morgue where he awakens and begins offing people left and right, continuing the killing spree he started a couple days before. He makes his way back to Camp Crystal Lake, his home, where some new counselors have just arrived. Among them are Jimmy (Crispin Glover), Ted (Lawrence Monoson), Paul (Clyde Hayes), Sara (Barbara Howard), and others. Twelve year old Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) and his older sister Trish (Kimberly Beck) happen to live near the camp. While driving home, the Jarvis siblings befriend a hitchhiker named Rob Dyer (Erich Anderson). Rob has actually come to Crystal Lake seeking vengeance against Jason for killing his sister Sandra (from part 2). As the masked murderer begins slaughtering the helpless counselors one by one, it's up to Rob and the Jarvis siblings to put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.This is not only my favorite Jason film but is also one of the all time greatest slashers I've ever seen. This entry has some of the best kills, best suspense, best nudity, and even some great acting which is rare for a Friday film. Little kids in horror films usually irritate me, but Corey Feldman as the young Tommy Jarvis actually comes out of this okay. I liked him a lot! It's too bad that Feldman got so annoying when he got older. The Tommy character appeared in the next two installments of the series and quickly became one of my favorite horror protagonists (especially when Thom Matthews played him in part 6). The characters of Jimmy and Ted had me cracking up with their hilarious antics. I adored every scene they were in! Jason himself is also at his best here and I loved the way Ted White played him. He's no longer as clumsy and awkward as he was in the previous two movies. Here he is just a hulking, unstoppable killing machine that cannot be reckoned with. Ted White is by far my favorite Jason as he gave a flawless portrayal as the machete wielding psychopath. Despite its inaccurate title, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is the best of the series and a must-have for all slasher fans!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
210,Reel_entertainment,A great chapter in a great franchise,7,10 September 2001,"The best thing of this movie, is that it happens directly after part 3...that same night even. Special effects wizard Tom Savini, who did the effects in part 1, comes back to this movie. And what a great job he does! This movie has some of the best gore shots in all of the movies. Jason returns to the woods, but not actually at the familiar camp grounds that he knows...but it's the woods, & it'll have to do. Jason terrifies a group of teenagers who are away for the summer at a house deep into the woods. Next to their house lives the Jarvis', who wound up getting terrified by Jason too. It's a great installment in the 'Friday the 13th' series.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
211,ShadySovereign,Jason is back...with a vengeance!,8,24 February 2006,"The DVD poster of ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" doesn't really justify how good the movie really is; the poster looks very cheap in comparison to the other Friday the 13th movie posters. But don't judge this film by its poster; this is arguably the best ""Friday the 13th"" sequel.The movie starts off with a recap of scenes from the last 3 films. Then after that, the police and paramedics arrive at the scene of the massacre, where the teens and bikers from the last film (part 3) were killed. Jason's body is discovered laying on the floor of a barn, and he is assumed dead. However, Jason's body disappears from a hospital's morgue, and then our attention is focused on the Jarvis family and 6 carefree teenagers who moved in next to the Jarvis house...The way Jason kills his victims in this movie is very impressive. There are scenes where he stabs them in the most unlikely parts of the body, and there is even a scene where he uses a saw to cut open a man's throat! In addition to the killings, the blood pouring out of Jason's victims looks very realistic.The movie has a great cast when compared to the other ""Friday the 13th"" sequels. Corey Feldman stars as the younger brother of the leading heroine, and Crispin Glover is absolutely hilarious as a sensitive teen (watch his funny dance scene!). There are also two cute twins starring in the film: Camilla and Carey More. Although both twins look the same, I liked Camilla much better. She was cute and sexy at the same time.And thanks to the makeup artist Tom Savini, ""Friday the 13th"" fans will be happy to see the most hideous and believable face of Jason. When compared to the other Friday the 13th films, Jason's face looks the most realistic in this one. You have to see his face in this film to believe how terrifying he REALLY looks.The bad part of this movie is that we don't really get to see much of Jason most of the time. Since most of the film is shot in the night, it's difficult to really see Jason. But I guess that's the whole point of the Friday the 13th movies, because there must be darkness in order to feel afraid of Jason.Overall, this is the best Friday the 13th sequel. It has great makeup effects, an interesting cast of characters, and the best Jason face. Only see it if you are a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" films and other horror movies.I give this movie an 8/10.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
212,Kaliyugaforkix,Ferocious Four,6,4 April 2010,"*** Horror icon/Momma's boy Jason Vorhees returns for his fourth crystal -lake killing spree (camp blood to the uninitiated) in this very decent entry in the Friday series.After taking an axe to the noggin in the conclusion to Pt.3, Jason is left to be rounded up with the other corpses by the Wessex county 5-0 in the opening scenes which include the standard slasher re-cap of course, a montage of past jason-kills that plays like a greatest hits for fans; Fun if your new to the Friday flicks, annoying padding if you're not. A creepy concluding scene of the police pulling out and deserting the crime scene all together, leaving the area eerily deserted, really sums up the arbitrary nature of the series; its suitably unnerving in its meaninglessness.Of course our hockey mask hero isn't really dead, just re-cuperating before heading back to the bush to slaughter anyone else that violates the sanctity of his territory & not before offing the horny doctor on call and his nookie nurse, foolish enough to be getting down in front of Jason on a gurney. From here on, there really isn't much that differs in plot from the last or future installments; the standard teenagers in heat throwing a bash soon to be crashed by life- of-the-party Jason and all it's periphery accouterments like night-time skinny dipping and stag reels. Also of note is Corey Feldman, the last survivor character whose shadow side is personified as the monster himself. In true horror fable tradition, the virginal innocent & his polar opposite are inextricably linked & the resonant finale has Jason confronting his inner child in an inspired bit of weirdness, so too bad it didn't quite follow up in the same vein for the following films. Other than the ending, this isn't much of a corker plot-wise. But the director is clever enough to bring a little more pizazz to the proceedings this time, and the direction is what sells this film as maybe the most well made of the sequels. Although the blood & gore is kept minimal by the prudish Paramount, the constant barrage of murders definitely have a nastier tone in pt. 4, sadistic in a way the proceeding incarnations of Jason weren't. The mythos picks up steam here.Still on the human side of undead, Jason isn't the hulking monotonous zombie of the Kane Hodder oeuvre. He's still spry for a corpse and it adds a degree of excitement to the action instead of just boring inevitability. But the killings themselves are certainly disturbing as Jason really goes all out in his war on nubile flesh; ""Rapes by steel"" as more than one critic has succinctly put it. The ferocity in the slaughters is underlined by some truly nasty touches (the rebuffed road kill hitch-hiker pureeing her banana while Jason impales her neck or the face mangling shower scene to name a couple) The sadistic kink really marks this entry of something more weight than the other 13ths.The effect is both exhilarating and cringe-worthy in the best dead teenager tradition . The mean-spiritedness on display is used in modest quantity however to underline The Final Chapter, not like the rampant cartoon sadism of the next installment.For slasher cinema, The Final Chapter is a first-rate accomplishment, a perfect capsule of 80's era slasher film and probably the best in the Friday canon.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

I can only credit mindless cattle movie-goers for sequels as bad as this.  How this series continued after this movie is beyond me.  I'm only commenting on this to hopefully dissuade even one person from seeing this movie.  There's not even any blood in the movie.

It's also one of the bloodiest and goriest of the series (which is a good thing). I rated this movie like any other movie and that's why it only gets a 6. But a 6 in the Friday series is quite good (most of them are fun trash).I personally like Crispin Glover's ridiculous dance and his gory death. He must have improvised that dancing part. Corkscrew in the hand and blade in the face is my idea of a good death for this series. Also I liked the guy in the shower getting his face crushed in. That was fun.The ""death"" of Jason at the end is well done effect wise but I thought Corey Feldman did a terrible job of acting; kid actor or not.If your looking to watch one of the Friday the 13th movies this is what they are really about.

I'm not saying it was bad but it seem to be slacking down a little. But writer Barney Cohen and director Joseph Zito surprised me by going back to it's roots and having the violence extremely brutal.Looks like that ax in the head didn't keep ole JASON down. He awakes in the hospital, only to add more corpses to the morgue, to return home to Crystal Lake. There he finds even more kids show up at Camp for some late night fun. So JASON is up to he's old tricks again. But this time he faces a boy name Tommy Jarvis(Corey Feldman), who is an make-up wizard. Can Tommy stop JASON.This is a good installment that really reminds me of the first one. That intriguing tone, because JASON still has the mask on we just don't see it until 20 minutes at the end, a way to go back to it's roots. The violence on here has darken up with brutal and disturbing death scenes. And to me it has the number 1 best death in the whole series, which is JASON'S death himself as a human. The acting is great and amusing at sometimes, thanks to Crispin Glover. But all and all, the first one is still better. If your in for a brutal film, then I recommend.

This film takes place the day after the events of Part 3, with Jason seemingly down for good. He is taken to a coroner's office where he escapes and wrecks havoc on another group of unsuspecting teenagers (doesn't anybody watch the news at Camp Crystal Lake?). We really don't see anything different in 1984's ""Friday the 13th Part 4"" but we do see the return of Tom Savini's innovative gore and special effects. It features a couple of the most brutal of all Jason's murders, particularly the neck twist and the meat cleaver. If it wasn't for Savini's brilliance, I would have given this installment another 5. I also like the character of Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) because I can somewhat identify with him. Except for what he does at the end, I don't think I could do all that.

This movie along with the second are the best in the series. It's hard to take Jason's mother in the first film seriously as she looks like she has stuck a dead cat on her head.While the third film was so obviously filmed in a studio, this one actually looks like they are in the middle of nowhere. There are the usual things that made the series fun, gore, sex, bad acting etc, but this film is oddly creepy as well.The high gore in this film is used to greater effect than the utterly disgusting and horribly pants movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday.The one thing that could have made this film better was if Jason had got that brat at the end.

It would have been a good idea to end the series here probably but there were better sequels later on. Here's The Plot, After Chris' confrontation with Jason in the barn at Higgins Haven, Jason's presumably dead body is taken to the Wessex County morgue. Jason escapes, kills an attendant and a nurse and makes his way back to Crystal Lake.Friends Paul, Jimmy, Ted, Doug, Samantha and Sara are on their way to a lakeside house they've rented. On the way they pass a hitchhiker, who is soon killed by Jason. Next to the rental house lives Mrs. Jarvis, her teen aged daughter Trish, and her twelve year-old son Tommy. Trish and Tommy meet the renters, and run into them the next day skinny-dipping at Crystal Point with local twins Tina and Terri. When the Jarvis' car breaks down, Trish and Tommy are helped by Rob, a passing camper.That night there is a drunken party at the rental house. When her boyfriend Paul starts dancing with Tina, Samantha goes for a swim - and is killed. Paul has second thoughts and goes out looking for her. Terri goes after Jimmy, and Jason kills Paul. While Tina is sleeping with Jimmy, Terri leaves for home and is killed. When Mrs. Jarvis returns home after jogging, she finds the house empty. The lights go out, and when she goes outside to look for the kids she is killed. Trish and Tommy come home and Trish goes to look for her mother but only finds Rob in his tent.At the rental house, Tina goes to freshen up while Jimmy heads downstairs to gloat to Ted. But when he goes into the kitchen to find the corkscrew... Jason hands it to him. Tina is soon thrown out the window and Ted is stabbed while Rob tells Trish about his sister Sandra, who Jason killed (in Part 2). Doug is killed in the shower, as is Sara when she tries to escape after discovering the body. Returning to the Jarvis house, Trish and Rob try to call the police, but the line is dead. They go next door where Rob goes into the basement - and is killed by Jason.

It's the first time the franchise truly realized how dumb it was, thus making it a fun, dumb, yet still scary 80's goldmine of gory horror fun! It has the best Jason, the best characters, and some of the best kills. It's nice to have characters that are actually likable and relatable, such as Cripsin Glover as the shy nerdy guy who's battling several social anxiety. Most of the other movies just have generic teenagers who are only there to get killed, but this is the first movie that actually tries to have interesting and ED characters that you want to root for instead of waiting for them to die. Corey Feldman as the kid is also a cool character and a nice change of pace. The kills are BRUTAL and have such a PUNCH to them. People don't just die, they DIE. People get tossed out windows and over balconies and get stabbed in the freakin face and broken in half of Jason's knee, it's all amazing! I will say the ending is a bit underwhelming, since this is supposed to be the final Jason movie and all (thank GOD we got more), but it's still a cool ending. If you gotta pick one Friday movie to watch, pick this one.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

It is a true horror film with a true killer.  The killings are executed with intelligence and originality.There were instances when I actually winced at some of the violent killings like when you go the dentist and you get a drill eating into your tooth.
***  SPOILER ALERT START ***The hacksaw death at the beginning just looks brilliant.  Also when Jason kills the woman eating the banana you actual here this deep grunt as he knifes her in the throat.  Excellent.*** SPOILER ALERT FINISH ***The atmosphere in the film is fantastic.  The fog settings and the change in light throughout the forest create high levels of suspense.  When you see a character on there own you actually feel the light change and the fear sets in.

228,Krush_Burner,Meet Tommy Jarvis,7,28 November 2014,"This one is not my personal favorite. Mainly it is because of that ""The Final Chapter"" does not add anything new and refreshing to franchise. Jason is still here, and he's still killing another group of random teenagers. The basic slasher formula is still working, but the elements of it are not so interesting. The characters lacks personality, relationships between them are minimal. The only exception is Tommy (thanks to Corey Feldman's acting) – crucial figure in next three films and he's looks very well here. The most of killing scenes, unfortunately, unimaginative and very simple. But, albeit Part IV is not the best entry in the series, it is important in some ways, at least for a slasher fan. Firstly, this part ends the story arc that begun in Part 2, and finally leaves Jason dead (not for long, of course). Secondly, as I mentioned before, this film introduces Tommy Jarvis, which will be the series' most prominent character after Jason Voorhees himself. The story of Tommy's encounters with Jason constitutes another story arc, which ends only in Part VI, so it is interesting to know what was the origin of it all. In sum, I would say it is not a great part of Jason's adventures, but worth a look if you're a slasher fan. I don't think you'll find something surprising, but you will get your flesh and blood dish served good enough to watch this one from start to finish.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
229,WandrinStar,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984),6,1 March 2012,"62/100. Undoubtedly the best of the 'Friday' sequels. Joesph Zito was an excellent genre choice to helm the film after directing The Prowler, and Tom Savini makes a welcome return to the franchise resulting in the best visual and creative kills and best cinematography since the original. Corey Feldman does a good job, and the entire concept of the Jarvis family gives the series a breath of fresh air rather than just focusing on a bunch of horny teens lining up to be slaughtered. Crispin Glover does steal the spotlight from Feldman and maybe even Jason. His body language and dumbfound looks are hilarious and must have inspired him being casted in Back To The Future the following year. His dance moves overshadow some of the film's more gruesome kills. Rest of the teenage cast was a huge step up from part three, although I thought they should have spent more time focusing on the Jarvis family as opposed to the teens. And was Jason hunter Rob really supposed to have that small of a role. Ted White played the most menacing Jason to date, and the film would have been an ideal way to end the series even if the ending including the rather stupid idea to have Feldman shave his head and go crazy.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
230,cmoore0013,The Final Chapter?,9,3 January 2006,"Really? You sure this is the last movie? Well it would have been, but the movie made so much money that they couldn't stop here, now could they? However, the final chapter or not it's still a fun movie. By this time, they have mostly given up on making Jason too scary since it was already fairly cartoony that he kept on coming back after machete hits, stabbings, and an ax in his head(most of which is documented in a nice little prologue).So, he's back and this time he's targeting a set of two cabins in the woods. Nope, no camps this time! Now, he's going after a single family and a group of horny teenage holiday makers. I guess they were trying to be original.Anyway, you can guess what happens to these likable teens.Tom Savini returns to do the special fx and make up, and boy is it a triumphant return. The FX are probably the least cut by the MPAA so they can be seen in most of their original glory on any VHS or DVD edition. And Jason's last scene? Ouch! I got the pleasure of seeing this in a theater with a bunch of screaming teenagers in 2002. I was surprised to see that it still held up so well.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
231,brennenearl,Tied for first,10,22 January 2019,My favorite is Jason Lives but not by a lot. This movie is great positives are it has one if my favorite final girls (Trish Jarvis) the second best Tommy Jarvis. And Ted White the best Jason out of the series. You also have Crispen Clover's freaky dancing. The characters are likeable and not throw away characters the third act in the Jarvis house is pretty good. Overall a really good sequel.,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
232,kornkicksass_69,The Final Chapter My Ass!,7,29 November 2003,Don't get me wrong I liked this movie but what kind of name is the final chapter if there's 6 or 7 more? This movie was better than the second one cause of the story and the kills were much more exciting. Most of these movies are all the same. They all get stuck together in bad weather and Jason comes. People leave by themselves and never come back. Some go and have sex and are found dead. Then when one person (usually the girl who didn't have sex) is the only one left they throw bodies through the windows and stuff like that. Then she somehow stops Jason and she is found the next day and something pops out of the water or through a window and knocks her out. This one was different. It had that kid who loved horror stuff and he ends up saving the day. It still has the house with all the people but at least they aren't trying to open that stupid camp again. And it still has the two people in love and he ends up dead but it is a good movie if you like the series just don't rent Jason Takes Manhattan that was stupid.,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Maybe it was just a trick to make everyone think it was the last, so we would all run in and buy a ticket. I don't know, but it worked this movie actually did very well at the boxoffice. Just like Jason Goes to Hell we all thought that was the last, now we have Jason X due out March 22, 2002. I don't believe they will ever stop making Friday the 13th. I was a kid growing up and watching these, now I have a daughter, and it looks like she'll be doing the same thing. I hope she enjoys them as much as I did.Now here's my opinion on the movie. I have seen this one hundreds of times, and I still enjoy it. It doesn't really have a plot, just kids camping and partying getting picked off one by one. It's very enjoyable to watch with friends, you don't have to worry if you missed anything if you got up to get a beer, just get them to rewind it if you missed someone getting slashed.

I have seen all Fridays so many times that I have lost count, but this one I still love and can watch over and over. First of all, it's scary, the chase scene at the end keeps you on the edge of your seat. Second the acting, plot, and music all are great.

So I don't remember the impact it had, but over the next 16 years I have been a die hard Friday fan, so basically there will never be a ""Final Chapter"" to this franchise. Let me explain, Jason is familiar to us. He has been in our lives for over 20 years, see I started watching Friday the 13th at 8 years old, and now I watch them with my child. It's just fun. Don't take them seriously, but it's just easy to watch them and this franchise has survived the 80's, 90's, and now we are watching Jason reborn. One day this franchise will get the attention that it SO deserves. 10 chapters with another on the way, and hopefully many, many more to come. Screw ""Gone With The Wind"" and crap like that, Friday The 13th is an American tradition.The Final Chapter is one of the best of the series. If you're not a fan you should still check this one out.

It has great kills, loads of nudity, and horror. It has both likable and unlikable pepole, but what sucks about is there are 2 survivors, 1 is likable, 1 is not. Its the most nudity and most funniest. If you've heared about the legendary Crispin Glover dance, it's in this movie. The nudity and kills and uncomfortable, especially the first kill. Cory Feldman and Crispin Glover are the charters you root for, Cory Feldman being a freak, but in a good way, and Crispin Glover being hilauors. It has great kills, and has a good pace, and is very unboring to watch. If you hated Part 3 as much as I did, Part 4 redeems the series. It's a great sequel, but not the best. Part 2 still holds the title. 7.2/10",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

There is some good cast choices and Ted White as Jason does an okay job, but it doesn't feel that special as a final chapter. Clichés are up the ass.

Plenty of blood and gore follow Jason's path until the victims are down to next to none.

244,andrewbarry6336,Great Shocking Kills and a lot of Nudity,8,22 November 2013,"As stated by other reviews, this movie contains a lot of nudity and has great suspense once sh!t hits the fan. This is the last of human Jason in till the remake also so he goes out with a bang. This was suppose to be the final film in this franchise and was directed as such. We all know it isn't the case because this one made a good amount of money so Paramount decided to make the next in the series. This one is even more brutal than the previous three and has a lot of nudity which doesn't bother me one way or another. Onto the cast of this one. We actually have two groups with a family known as the Jarvis and a group of kids renting the cabin across from their house. I like this family and they are interesting and believable, I especially like Tommy Jarvis who is a huge factor in the crappy Part 5 and a huge part of Part 6. The kids across the way are actually really played well and between Kissing Teddy and the Death dance, it has some of the funnier moments in the series. Now the kills.Overall I like the kills in this movie better than the previous three even though there is only one kill as brutal as Part 3's handstand kill. But the kill in this one is actually over kill and something your not use to seeing out of a 80's slasher. The pacing is better than the previous entry which is a welcome change with this one probably the best of the first four and maybe the whole series. Tommy Jarvis(Cory Feldman) does a great job in this movie even though he has maybe 25 minutes on screen at the most. Also I love the twins in this movie as their a nice addition to the cast. To think this could have been the end of the series. It does end that way but as well all know, Jason is a cash cow and even the remake did great budget wise. The only two films that flopped are Jason take Manhattan and the underrated Jason X. I give this one a 4.5 outta 5.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Which they shouldn't do. They probably think 'oh it's jason part 4 it has to be bad. I'll rate that a 1.'This is why you shouldn't review movies or rate them unless you have seen them. This is one of the best Jason movies and you would know that if you have seen it.What makes this movie so good is Tom Savini is back doing the makeup. He is a god among horror fans. So seeing him and Tommy played by Corey Feldman makes this a hugely fun movie.It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.5.9. Shame on you all.

Again it's time to start chopping up some teenagers.""3-D"" and ""The Final Chapter"" are one of the best films in the series with their creative kills and ridiculous characters. Jason looks really good in this chapter, his hockey mask shines with blood hunger as he impales people with machetes, iron pipes and even rakes.By this point we have lost all remains of suspense and classiness from the very first films, but who cares? Jason is really out of control and gives us another pile of bodies that is the actual point in all slasher movies.""The Final Chapter"" is an exceptional Friday -film with the fact that the people actually know who is killing them (the female survivor investigates the camp's history from newspaper articles etc.) and that one of the heroes uses Jason's own personality to make him vulnerable. Eventually Jason is defeated, but no-one will never forget him.Jason remains unseen in the next chapter, ""A New Beginning"", and returns not before the sixth part, ""Jason Lives"", which is probably my personal favorite Friday -movie.""The Final Chapter"" is a slight step up from the previous movie ""3-D"" and is by far one of the best Fridays ever made. 7 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
248,jackbruns29,What else can be said?,8,30 December 2020,"Jay Bauman from RedLetterMedia said it best. It's the best, most well made out of the entire Friday the 13th franchise. It has everything you want in a Friday the 13th movie, but even better. It has the best kills, probably the most nudity, except for maybe part five. And hands down it has the most compelling characters. This is the first time we're introduced to Tommy Jarvis as a character, and boy does Corey Feldman do an excellent job in portraying youthful innocence shattered by a monstrous character. It really is a shame what Hollywood put him through, because between this movie and Gremlins, he was absolutely brilliant in both.The story itself plays out much like part three. We have our different group of characters that Jason kills off who intersect at various points in the movie. Again, like Jay pointed out, all of these movies except maybe the first are pure blunt stupidity. Jason sniffs out either camp counselors, stoners, or hitchhikers and murders them all. It's not too complicated. It's not hard to follow. But it's so well made. If you're going to watch any Friday the 13th movie, I would recommend either this or part six.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Although these movies will never be considered ""good"" by the mainstream, any true F13 fan knows that nothing else even comes close to delivering the shocks, gore, and excitement of pt 4. Jason looks great, he RUNS which I find far more frightening than the zombified Jasons of later movies. Plus he's not bullet-proof; he's as tough as nails but not invincible.  The Savini make-up still hasn't been topped. This is the hardcore, butt-kicking Jason Voorhees that fans of the series love, great job Zito!  Too bad Ted White hated this type of thing and only did it for the money, he's the best Jason ever.  But enough about 'ol hockey mask, here's what else sets this movie apart from the others:-Gore, and plenty of it.  Why watch this sort of thing without it?  Only parts one, four and (ugh) nine have any gore at all.-Production values are a big jump up from the first three.-Some (gasp!) decent acting.-The ""Chase scene"" is fantastic, as is the opening which re-caps the first three beautifully.-The shocks.  The first time you see this, turn off the lights and pump up the sound.  If you don't jump you're not human.I know about the Paramount/Newline deal, so I plea to Paramount, restore these films, put the gore back in, and re-release them!  Think of how good part 2 could've been if it wasn't cut to ribbons.  Fans of the series know what I mean.  Anyway, I'd rank them 4, 1, 2, 3.  They should've stopped here, there was absolutely no need to continue this series, the rest is c**p.  The first four Friday movies ARE the Friday movies, rent them and witness a great horror saga.  Rent the Scream movies if you can't handle real horror.  If I had to rank the remaining ones, I'd go 6, 5, 7, 8, 9. I respect fans of part 6, but it's a little too funny for me.

Tommy viewers soon learn has a love of horror cinema and has a talent for making scary masks and props which he occasionally uses to make his sister and others jump.And Jim (Crispin Glover) and Ted two dateless geeks are the main focus of six friends renting a house beside the Jarvis place which includes Paul and his slutty girlfriend Sammy and Doug and his virginal girlfriend Sarah. Ted constantly gives Jimbo a hard time about never having a date and frequently calls him ""dead feck"" despite sharing Jim's predicament with the absence of a date himself. Most of the banter between the two always centers on poor Jim and his lack of sexual successes and his previous failures with one ""BJ Beatty"".Once the six friends arrive at the rented house introductions are made with the Jarvis family.

There is also a great deal more character development with sympathetic qualities at work in this Chapter with slam-bang suspense when the final survivors are in the throes of their desperate plight.Another positive quality I love about The Final Chapter is it was preconceived to guarantee people jump out of their pant seats with loud deafening music stings and thunderous sound FX. I would love to see this in a theater to fully enjoy the experience.

253,jasonleesmith6,They Messed With The Formula And Paid The Price,7,4 April 2020,"For those of you unfamiliar with the series, the ""Friday the 13th"" films are a series of dark comedies in which a group impossibly horny and unpleasant teenagers go out to the woods and are murdered in increasingly over-the-top (and hilarious) ways by the insane, machete wielding serial-killer, Jason.This is the fourth movie in the series, and no doubt the writers were feeling that the formula had begun to go a bit stale, so, with this movie they tried to mix things up a bit. In addition to the unbelievably horrible teenagers, Jason also menaces a very nice middle class mother and her two children who happen to live in the area. With this simple addition, the entire balance of the movie is thrown off. Due to the family's sympathetic nature, I found myself actually caring whether they lived or died, a sensation I had not felt in any of the previous films. As the film progressed, I was frightened by the thought of the serial killer murdering them. When Jason menaced the young girl and her brother with a machete, instead of amusement, I felt a sense of dismay -- horror, if you will -- at the thought that they might be hurt. This continued throughout most of the movie, and made the film-going experience much more tense than I had come to expect from the previous films.Fortunately, the film-makers learned their lesson with the one misstep, and few, if any, of the characters in the subsequent ""Friday the 13th"" films were sympathetic in any way, and the movies are much more enjoyable because of it.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

257,Cadriel,"Cheesy Slasher...plenty of service, no suspense.",1,21 April 2001,"I'd say this review was going to be a spoiler, but...well, to be honest, it's a slasher movie.  You know how it's going to go.Friday the 13th: the Final Chapter features a small family made up of a relatively young mother, the movie's ""innocent"" girl, and a young video game player and mask-making prodigy (a young Corey Feldman) that lives out into the woods.  A bunch of teenagers rent the house next door for a night of debauchery.  Jason Voorhees, being a slasher, wasn't adequately killed last time, so he gets to come back now.  The non-character teenagers in the house, like most people in this film, exist only to increase the body count and have no discernable character traits except for degree of sexual experience, which is enough to get them all killed by the end of the film, playing straight by the rules.This episode of Friday the 13th follows the slasher cliches to the letter, but the only times suspense is even attempted are during a few ""false scare"" scenes early in the movie and in the final chase sequence.  The actual killings just aren't all that scary--Jason murders again and again.  It's a badly shot, poorly lit, trashy fast-food slasher with wretched acting.  You can pretty much not only call every death, but from time to time predict the exact manner of the death.As far as gore and T&A go, Friday 4 delivers, but in that ""fast-food"" style. As a result, it doesn't even hold a lot of fun for slasher fans.  It reeks of lack of effort, and really wasn't entertaining as teen-killer fare goes. Avoid it--you'll find a slasher that does it with more style pretty easily.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
258,ArmandTanzarian,haven't I seen this before?,5,30 June 2007,"this 4th , but not final, chapter picks up where 3 left off, with Jason being taken to a morgue after a nicely edited recap sequence which makes the previous 3 films look a lot better than they actually are. Here, Jason reanimates, for no reason whatsoever, without explanation, and after killing a randy porter and nurse, makes his way, somehow unseen, back to Crystal lake. here, we get complete deja vu, with another houseful of teens somewhere on the seemingly massive lake, a family with a teen daughter and preteen son, and also a 'Jason hunting' relative of a victim from F2 thrown into the mix. needless to say the teens are sex,dope,beer obsessed, and during the night they are dispatched in a variety of gruesome ways. This all follows the formula, with after the killings and the chosen few left alive, we have the familiar what I will call 'realisation', where the teen daughter and her brother (plus the soon to be killed Jason hunter)realise that Jason is after them;then the 'chase and reveal', where every time they turn a corner, open a door etc. a body falls out or is found. They end up in the family's house where during a confrontation with Jason, the lad finds time to go off and shave his head and apply theatrical make up (its earlier established hes into horror makeup/puppets /effects) to make himself look like an artists impression of Jason as a boy he saw in a newspaper cutting. This, like the similar 'disguse/distraction' in part 2 doesn't really hold up to logic and scrutiny, especially when his sister is seconds away from a gruesome end downstairs. Anyhow, this distracts Jason long enough for the prerequisite 'mask off' moment and the boy to put a machete into Jason's head. Now correct me if Im wrong, but in parts 2-4 Jason's mask comes off in every film and in each one he looks completely different even though these films span only a few days. Oh well, anyway, the film ends with Jason twitching on the floor and the kid goes into a frenzy with the machete to finish him off. The final scene has a Dr. explaining to the sister about the frenzied violent behaviour her brother exhibited, and we end on a freeze frame of the kid with a mad look in his eyes. Of course, maybe the Dr. could have said,""well done, at last someone with the sense to decimate Jason's body when he was seemingly just about to come back to life instead of running off"", but there you go. Anyway, in short, a serious case of deja vu from earlier (and later) films in the series. If you like/dislike the series in general then you'll have the same reaction to this due to it being so formulaic. There's a few decent (by 80's standards) makeup effects on the deaths if that is your sort of thing, and you think it can make up for shortfalls in plot,script, characterisation and originality. Probably best enjoyed if your 12/13 years old or with a few mates and beers if you're older.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
259,hannahsutcliffe,Sequels,7,1 September 2015,"Sequels. You either love them or you hate them. For me, I enjoy one or two sequels that enhances the storyline of the first movie. I enjoyed the previous Friday the 13th movies, but this one is definitely the best in the franchise so far. I found Tom Savini's brutal effects to be very scary, and there is a lot of suspense in this film that makes the character of Jason seem even more psychotic. The death scenes are always fun to watch in horror movies and this movie is no exception; gory and brutal killings happen at every opportunity with a few jump scares added for that extra scare. This movie is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the Friday the 13th movie or slashers in general. Crispin Glover's performance should also be praised; I found him to be very likable, which always helps the audience connect to the characters. Good watch.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

It's kills are gnarly, the beginning leads into the perfect 80's slasher. The climax and conclusion is just great and on point of what I'd expect. Tommy Jarvis played by Corey Feldman is just too iconic. Jason is actually menacing in this film. It's what the franchise was always missing, also Glover's character is such a perfect Ice breaker for the whole film. I definitely recommend this sequel out of the whole franchise! It's gory, iconic and downright menacing! It's the true classic of the Friday the 13th franchise! - Sixx Sinclair",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
261,bb74,One of the best representations of a good slasher film.,10,3 April 2021,"I gave Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) the same rating that I gave its predecessor and would rate it a VERY CLOSE SECOND as the second best Friday the 13th film right behind its predecessor.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) is an excellent slasher film that incorporates slasher film elements effectively. It immediately starts a suspenseful, intriguing, and creepy mood with its opening and haunting score at the location of its predecessor. The audience is left to briefly wonder whether or not Jason is truly alive and is also reminded of the horrific carnage he left behind in the previous film.While its reclusive setting for the new victims is not as effective as providing creepiness and scariness as its predecessor, the film nonetheless matches or arguably even surpasses its violent kills and Jason once again is menacing, showing virtually no mercy toward his victims. The film goes beyond its predecessors in the addition of Kimberly Beck and Crispin Glover who deliver good performances, as well as with its gore and nudity.There are two scenes in this film that would not fly in today's horror films: The first is the scene of Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) laying on his bedroom bed watching an older teenage girl/woman undress and subsequently make out with her boyfriend while getting excited, rolling, and jumping on his bed. The second is when Tommy Jarvis accidently stumbles upon the teenagers/adults skinny dipping at the lake, sees them naked, and insists he wants to keep watching them when his older sister comes over to turn him around.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
262,lostanddelirious85,Something's missing this time around.,7,11 December 2010,"""The Final Chapter"" is widely regarded by ""Friday"" fans as one of the best sequels in the series, and the best of the original four films. Call me an oddball, but I'm just not feeling it. Like all ""Friday"" movies, this one is still largely entertaining for sure, but there's something different this time around. It's not just the addition of a kid into the usual mix of horny teenagers, or the fact that we see a family in peril for once--it's the atmosphere and tone of the film that feels off.The plot picks up directly where part III left off: Jason is ""dead"" and taken to the morgue, where we encounter some of the most irresponsible and vile hospital workers I've seen in a horror film. After dry humping near Jason's dead body (was the setting a turn-on?), our masked hero wakes up and the carnage begins anew. This time around, the setting for Jason's massacre is two adjacent houses in the middle of the country: one occupied by the Jarvis family (with young Corey Feldman playing Tommy Jarvis, a character who would go on to be in the next two sequels), and the other by a vacationing group of young, slutty teenagers. You can guess what happens when Jason makes his way from the morgue to find more kids partying on his lake.While the acting is probably the best of the series and Tom Savini returns to do the gory make-up effects once again after being absent since the original, something just doesn't quite feel right here. Maybe it's the fact that this is the first film in the series to feel so obviously '80s, or the fact that none of the teenagers are likable in this one. Among the usual group of stereotypes, we get two twins, one of whom wastes no time in trying to sleep with every male member of the cast (even while their girlfriends stand by watching), and a young Crispin Glover, who has a bit of a problem in the bedroom department. The guys exist to constantly compete with the women or pick on one another. As for the Jarvis family, young Corey Feldman is certainly likable as Tommy, and Kimberly Beck is a nice addition to the cast. There is also a sub-plot involving a character named Rob, whose sister was one of Jason's victims in the previous films. Now he's out to avenge her death.The film suffers from some odd and confusing editing in the third act. Jason seems to be all over the place with no rhyme or reason to his actions. One second he's outside, then he's up on the roof, then he's out by Rob's tent in the woods, then he's in the living room, then he's outside again...I'm not sure if this was how the script was written, but it sure was pretty confusing trying to figure out why Jason couldn't just make things easier on himself. At one point, after Jason dispatches of one of the kids in the kitchen, instead of going straight into the living room to pick off his next victim, he goes back outside and goes onto the roof to get someone in an upstairs bedroom. Far be it from me to question Jason's methods, but this seems rather impractical.The chase sequence at the end is certainly not a let-down, with Jason managing to be truly scary at some points. To those who claim Jason never ran, you obviously haven't seen this film.As for the most advertised part of the film--Jason's demise--it is good, if not somewhat anticlimactic. But of course, we all know it wasn't the end anyway.While I consider this the weakest entry out of the original four films, it is still certainly worth a watch. If you loved the previous films, you'll like this one. I just didn't have as much fun this time around.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

The plot concerns the Jarvis family and their encounter with Jason after moving to a house near Crystal Lake, Their is also a group of teenagers next door to them, but it's Tommy and Trish Jarvis who have to fend for themselves against Jason after all of their neighbors and their mother is killed. This film has some very cool kills, some good acting, some interesting characters, a lot of very tense moments, some funny moments, an awesome female survivor and the first male survivor of the series. So it's pretty easy to see why in enjoy this film, and why I'd recommend it to only Friday the 13th fans, but horror fans in general.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
264,barrosjared,The Quintessential Slasher of the 80s',8,11 February 2017,"Joseph Zito's Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is arguably the best entry in the series. The first three entries were of various quality. Friday the 13th (1980) was average, Friday the 13th Part 2 was solid, and Friday the 13th Part 3 was bad. However, they found the right mix for the final entry (definitely not a lie). For most slashers characters are usually second fiddle to the gore.Final Chapter works so well because of the characters, particularly Crispin Glover, Ted White, Corey Feldman, Kimberly Beck, and Lawrence Monoson. And FINALLY, a solid ending. The previous three films contained a dream sequence after the final chase. This one ends with a bold ending. SPOILER, Jason dies and Tommy is hinted as the new killer. Sadly, that never happened. Even though I love Jason Lives, the Final Chapter was a good ending for the franchise. And the last human Jason movie until the 2009 remake (a disappointment).Almost all of the kills are magnificently executed by Tom Savini in his best work of the series. The makeup for Jason is great as well.The Final Chapter has some flaws, however. This is still a Friday the 13th movie and I'm sure you know the flaws of this film as well as most slashers so I won't go into detail.This film is sometimes cheesy and ridiculous, however, this film is the most Friday the 13th in mostly good meaning. Sorry if I spoiled the ending for a thirty-six year old movie, however, the poster kind of spoils the ending anyway. If you're not a Friday the 13th fan, at least give this one and Jason Lives a try.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

But don't let that stop you from a highly enjoyable slasher movie that has much to enjoy and rejoice in. Friday the 13 takes place very shortly after the events of part 3 as we first met tommy Jarvis (a recurring character in the franchise) here played by a young Corey Feldman who live along the famous crystal lake with his family. We then met our team of teen protagonist on their summer vacation and staying next door to the Jarvis family.Fans of Friday the 13th know little plot is ever covered which is what makes the franchise so enjoyable. Few horror movie franchises were so stepped in 80s culture than the Friday the 13th series but again this what makes these movies so enjoyable the ""me"" genertation characters are just so much fun to watch and viewers will be awaiting their grim demise with masochistic glee.Friday the 13 part 4 is a great representation of the franchise with it's trademarks in abundance great repeated viewing for fans and a good starting point for people only familiar with Jason last few disappointing outings.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Plus you get Corey Feldman and a ridiculous dance from Crispin Glover. This installment has fantastic kills that really bumps up the gore from the previous 3 movies and has much better characters. This entry also introduces Tommy Jarvis. The pacing is spot on and the ending is awesome. Jason is so bad ass in this as well. Way more menacing than the predecessors. Ted White did an excellent job. Not only is this a great Friday the 13th but it's also a kickass slasher. 10/10,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

It had so much going for it. Great gore by the master Tom Savini, an excellent cast that included Corey Feldman, Crispin Glover and Lawrence Monoson (Last American Virgin!)....and some excellent TnA....and TWINNSSSSS! This Friday set the bar for all future Friday movies, but it set the bar too high. After this the series became a mockery of itself. If you are to watch only one Jason movie in your lifetime, Friday the 13th part 4 : The Final Chapter should definitely be the one.

268,LukeNickels88,The Final Chapter was the first Friday the 13th I ever watched.,10,7 April 2012,"The start of the film begins with a montage from the 1st 3 films and then we go to Higgins Haven where the conclusion to Part 3 happened. Jason is taken to a local hospital where he comes to life killing two. He heads back for Crystal Lake to cause more mayhem. We meet the Jarvis family (Tommy, Trish and Mrs. Jarvis) who are the typical family. Across the way a house is rented by partying teens. Also Robis in the area hunting Jason after his sister was killed in Part 2. Jason kills everyone until the conclusion in the Jarvis house.First off this film is one of the best horror sequels ever. People would argue it's nothing more than a hack and slash film with dumb teenagers but this one actually deals with teen issues like a girl losing her virginity. At some moments it feels like a John Hughes styled movie until the deaths begin.All the deaths in this film are very stylized and creative. Tom Savini once again outdid himself, Savini did his last good effects work on this film I believe. He teams up with Joseph Zito again who both worked on The Prowler together.Ted White gives the best performance of the character ever. He was menacing and creepy. The scene where he breaks through the door is frightening yet cool. Harry Manfredini gave a terrific score. And this is actually one film I can Corey Feldman in.For me this was the high point in the series. Jason was a villain and not the anti-hero he was in later films.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
269,ethanmitchell-76313,The Best Friday the 13th Film,10,27 March 2018,"Friday the 13th The Final Chapter is the slasher movie of the 80's, there are other greats but none hold a candle to this film. It is the perfect combination of every aspect of the slasher genre and it's by far the best Friday the 13th film. Part 3 laid the path for what Jason would become and where the series would go, and The Final Chapter solidified all that and built off of the groundwork of the 3rd installment. The surrounding cast in the Final Chapter are easily some of the best in the franchise, each with their own distinct personality traits that help contribute the movie. From the greaser wannabe Teddy to the painfully awkward acting of Crispin Glover this movie nails it with the teens. Corey Feldman as Tommy is a lot of fun as well, he becomes Jason's main foe and it's pretty obvious early on that the two are going to come face to face at the end and when that finally happens it blows past your expectations, this is the best final sequence of any Friday film. Not only do you care for Tommy but you care for his sister Trish who even though she makes typical bad decisions that are always present in slasher films, she really is trying her best to protect her brother from the menacing Jason.Jason Voorhees in this movie is incredible, never before had he been as evil feeling as he is in the Final Chapter. The way he moves and stalks, and the last half hour he is unstoppable, busting through windows and walls, I feel when watching him in this movie he is truly on a mission to kill everyone around him and nothing is going to stop him, he almost has a gangster sort of appeal to him and that could be due to the veteran actor who played him, also the tension there was on set between Jason and the director Joseph Zito. I believe that this is the last time we see Jason truly as a living person who has yet to die, obviously in films to follow he took on a more zombie aspect as he continually is resurrected from the dead in unrealistic ways, but that's what makes it fun. The look of Jason is very similar to the 3rd movie, this is the case obviously because this takes place directly following the ending sequence of Part 3, unmasked Jason does look different but it's for the better, this is the best Jason make-up of the first five films. Jason as usual kills people using some unique instruments and obviously some familiar ones as well.The special effects in the movie are outstanding, done by the great Tom Savini whom most horror fans will know and love. With less restrictions and worries about rating the kills would have been far more brutal than they already are, plus the final battle with Jason has one of the better effects to be seen in horror. Legend has it Tom Savini came back to the franchise after being absent in the last two for one reason, kill Jason Voorhees, and even though we would see Jason in 8 more movies, Tom was successful in his endeavor, he put the nail in the coffin on the hockey masked foe once and for all! As I mentioned earlier Jason is resurrected in every movie that he actually appears in following part 4. So hats off to Tom Savini, one of, if not the greatest special effects artist in horror.I have a very hard time finding things wrong with this one, it is a great improvement coming off of part 3, its score is improved, the kills are better, Jason is at his best, and it's simply a great 80's slasher which is crazy considering it's the fourth one in the franchise. Not to mention I think it still really holds up today, if you turn off the lights and turn up the surround sound this movie will make you jump, and of course make you not want to go camping for a while. This is important considering pretty much every 80's horror movie is great, but very laughable to the standards of today. I'm glad that Friday the 13th the Final Chapter didn't hold true to its name, but if it had it would have saved us all from the atrocities Jason Goes to Hell, and gave Jason Voorhees and Camp Blood a very proper send off.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

Crispin Glover's in it too! RIP wool sweater. Kill count of 12, likely 13, but we're supposed to think 14, and if we're getting picky 24 to 26. Twelve die on screen, mom is likely dead, Jason allegedly ""dies,"" and the total is padded by a recap of 12 deaths from the first 3 films in this one's opening 3 minutes.

I had to skip all the useless nudity and sex scenes tho, so cliché, but the haircut scene had me by surprise, out of the box, useless for the story, and had me laughing, like why did you do that?!?.

I personally feel that this is the best of the original 4 Friday movies, coming in a close race with the third Jason. I've seen all the movies more times than i can count and this one holds up surprisingly strong among all eleven films.

274,keith7198,SIGH...here we go again...,4,16 August 2006,"At some point in history some horror movie makers held a meeting. In this meeting they determined that the inception of silly, meaningless nudity and profanity was essential to a movie being a ""horror"" movie. This philosophy definitely shows itself in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter.This movie is a picture of the what slasher movies had become...goofy, annoying characters, random, meaningless ""nudity just to have nudity"", and nothing creative about it. Perhaps the nudity was put in to hide the lack of creativity. Jason's new methods of murder were about as creative as the filmmakers could get. This is the installment that really shows Jason as more of a murderer/artist than just a murderer. It seems each kill focuses on originality. Too bad the scriptwriters didn't employ that into their job.Again, this movie fits the stereotype of all of the ""slasher flicks"" and after a while watching annoying teens make out, act stupid, and get hacked to death gets old. Normal movie fans finally would like some plot.While there are a couple of jumps in the movie it leaves a lot to be desired.

And if you ask me, Paramount should have left it at this film.Part 4 combines action, horror, thriller, suspense, and even mystery. And the opening sequence is a combined amount of clips from the previous 3 films. The opening sequence explains the series quickly, so Part 4 is a great Friday the 13th film to start with.The film will have less appeal to fans of the similar series, Halloween. The Final Chpater may combine elements from the previous 3 films, but seems to steal ideas and share ideas with Halloween. Friday the 13th was inspired by Halloween, but at times it seems as too much.Overall, the film is the last Friday the 13th film you should watch.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

One television film called ""The Christmas Wish"" used the same home. They also used several other ""Friday"" locations so see if you can spot them. One that you will miss is ""The Diner"" from ""Friday #5"". There is a scene in ""The Christmas Wish"" where Neil Patrick Harris is standing by gas pumps. If you look hard enough you will recognize the location. Now ""Friday #4"" to me was lots a fun. He is an almost logical story and it delivers to chills and the kills.

277,tyhemp-2-2,Very personal...symbolic of Jason's motives,10,16 January 2000,"Not the Final Chapter, but the final really good Jason movie that a true Jason fan will get.  Most of us will stop here, or at Jason Lives depending on your feelings for Part 5.  Personally, I believe this film deserves at least a rating of 5.2 on its own website, but I am not the judge.  But I can be the judge of what I believe is pleasing for the eye to see.The Final Chapter is the final chapter in which Jason is still somewhat 'alive.'  He can still run in this movie, and still seems somewhat scary as he hovers in the doorways and mainly in the darkness.  This movie also has so much symbolism, plot, character foils, and such that it is a masterpiece next to the original.  The setting is totally remarkable(the two adjacent cabin-houses with numerous windows), and the characters are not the usual cardboard cut-outs from the previous three films.  This is my all time favorite Jason sequel to date.  I LOVE the cast (especially the sweet, charming Barbara Howard who plays Sara).  And don't question me why, I just do.  It's neat to see Corey Feldman so young.  Reminds me of myself.  A little 80's horror movie FREEEAK!  I rate all of the Jason sequels with either 8-10.  But this movie REALLY DOES deserve a solid 10.  There is a pleasantly large body count of 13, corny sex scenes, enough dialogue, enough plot, and so much gore that even I have to close my eyes.  Now that is seriously bad!  Rarely will a movie do that to me.But back to the effective, amazing symbolism.  If you are a TRUE, a true Jason fan, then you will be able to see how director Joseph Zito uses Jason's motives to be the cause of his slaying in the end (which is also a very memorable scene in the series).  Director Zito portrays the Jarvis family (the main characters in the movie) as the simple, backwoods, rarely-go-to-town type of family.  Kind of like Jason and his mother used to be.  And it's official, Jason Voorhees kills camp counselors because one killed his mother, and Tommy (Feldman) killed Jason because Jason killed his mother.  Now would you look at that!  Perfect directing!  Bonafide symbolism.  It makes perfect sense.  Now if only they would have stopped here with Jason dead and buried for the same reason that he killed his victims.  It just goes to show that you don't mess with a boy's mother.  Or you will pay the consequences.Truthfully this movie should have at least five points on the site because it is just as good as part one.  If it would have been part one, and the only one, then people would look back now and say ""Hey, that was a great movie!""  But they've been ruined by sequels, as the saying goes.  But I seriously believe that not enough people have seen The Final Chapter enough to respect it.  I grew up with them.  They provided my entertainment on those boring Friday and Saturday nights when I was too young to go out. Besides, its practically Feldman's debut.I give it a solid 10/10!  Sure, it's gross and may be considered inhumane to want to watch it, but so are you!  Nobody's perfect.  Have a good time while you live.  Watch Friday the 13th Part 4, and you'll be satisfied with yourself.  Trust me.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

And guess who's after them? Jason of course. But this time, there is someone who can face up to Jason.The acting is bad, but what do you expect? It's a 80's slasher movie. But that doesn't matter. Jason is scarier than ever. Director Joseph Zito did a wonderful job directing this movie. The blowing wind, the hard rain and the thunderstorm makes this movie very dark and frightening. It has some scenes that absolutely belongs to top ten horror scenes, according to me.

FX maestro Tom Savini returns to provide some excellent make-up, providing the best un-masked Jason of them all, and even Barney Cohen's script is pretty good, allowing an interesting array of characters to develop.Especially good is Crispin Glover, and his mad dance scene is worth the price of admission alone, and a young Corey Feldman also impresses.  So too does the fiesty Kimberly Beck as our heroine, and she really does look scared to death during the chilling finale.By far the scariest of the series, in a way it's a shame this wasn't the final chapter after all.

283,madmedic81,The best of the series,10,9 February 2009,"First of all, go into this one with a carefree attitude....it AIN'T high art, people, nor does it TRY to be.....it's just a fun, scary flick.The Final Chapter (a misnomer, I know, but get over it) sports a decent cast (some dull performances, but like I said, it's not a Sundance flick), a tried-and-true formula (let's face it, these films don't even ATTEMPT to deviate from the ""let's kill all the drug using horny teens"" approach), and some INCREDIBLE (particularly for the early 80's) special effects. Joseph Zito, tyrant though he may have been during filming (Judie Aronson probably didn't miss those nipples once they froze off, anyhow....), did probably the best job in the entire series of creating a dark (and I MEAN dark) atmosphere, yet at the same time maintaining an acceptable and welcome degree of humor (not overdrawn like so-called horror films are today), a few interesting additions (a close-knit family-next-door, a heartbroken and vengeful brother of a past F-13 victim, sexy twins, an acrobatic golden retriever....did I mention Crispin Glover???), and possibly the SCARIEST Jason to date (NO ill will toward the incredible Kane Hodder of Parts 7-10.....Ted White's Jason simply means business). Harry Manfredini scares us again with the familiar stalking themes and an effective score for the first and last reels of the movie that add to the tension.Tom Savini returns to bring more of the gore we loved (and Roger Ebert hated) from the first film, and almost every kill (with the exception of Mrs. Jarvis's off-screen murder) is masterfully done....Jimmy has arguably the worst abuse over all (death by corkscrew and meat cleaver, then having his corpse SAVAGELY ripped from it's exhibition spot).Kimberly Beck turns out a great performance as Trish Jarvis, the film's heroine....she wants to have fun with the wild kids next door, but she chooses instead to take care of her little brother, Tommy (a benchmark character in his own right). She fights almost to the death with Jason to protect young Tommy, and she puts up one HELL of a fight at that.While not a particular fan of Cory Feldman, it has to be said that the kid did a great job playing creepy little Tommy....you don't know whether to hug the kid or pop his head....cute and annoying all at the same time.Jason and Trish's final battle in this one is DEFINITELY one of the best in the series, and the chase scene is absolutely incredibly filmed as Trish is chased from house to house, hacking Jason with hammers, TV's, and machetes and taking a brutal beating herself.One of the creepiest moments in the film comes when Rob is surprised by a noise, turns around, and Jason can just BARELY be seen walking away from his tent.....might just give ya the shivers.Check this one out if you are new to the series....thanks to the fantastic montage before the opening credits, you will be fairly well versed in the past story (yes, there is a story, and as low-budget horror series' go, F-13 manages to keep a pretty good continuity track). Between gratuitous gore, lots of bare breasts, and one of the funniest dance sequences in cinematic history, you will enjoy The Final Chapter....but a word of warning....you might not want to eat bananas for a while!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
284,lofan88,Best of Series,10,3 June 2002,"This is the best of the series, by far...a young Corey Feldman is great and the film is scary, scary, scary.

285,jeremynicholsv1,Friday the 13th The Final Chapter (1984),10,3 April 2015,"If anyone really thought The Final Chapter was going to be the last Friday the 13th film, they were only fooling themselves. The fourth installment in the franchise looks to kill Jason once and for all, and does away with the 3D gimmick of the previous entry.The film starts off with the aftermath of Friday the 13th Part 3D, showing us how Jason got carted off to the hospital. The big guy doesn't stay down long though, as he's back up and killing people right away. Meanwhile, the Jarvis family, consisting of Pam (mom), Trish (teenage daughter), and Tommy (young boy) has moved into a cabin on Crystal lake, with a group of teens moving in across the street. Jason works his way back to Crystal Lake and one by one, kills each doped-up, sex-crazed teen before finally meeting his match against Trish and Tommy, the wonder twins.Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter went back to the seriousness of the first film in the series. Jason is even more violent here, the kills are more gory and just more sadistic this time around. Jason also grunts a few times, as he's killing and being killed, slightly taking him away from being just a killing machine. It's this seriousness that I enjoy about the film, but there are plenty of laughs to be had with a set of actual Double Mint twins, Jimbo being a dead f***, and Ted using his ""computer"" to try to help his friend get laid.The teenagers here feel a bit more real here, but are still cannon fodder. The real characters to watch are Tommy and Trish, the brother/sister team. Tommy makes masks and dabbles in special effects, and Trish is a down to earth sweet girl who ends up being Jason's toughest opponent. Another character, Rob, is the brother of one of the girls from Friday the 13th Part 2. I like this little tidbit for the character, that he's out there to find Jason for killing his sister.As real as the teenagers feel, there is still very little characterization to be found here. I bring this up because slashers like Halloween and Hellraiser were able to get their characters, be it heroes or victims, across in their films. Had the Friday the 13th franchise just slowed down with the kill spots and upped the character development I would have enjoyed it even more.The film takes place directly after Part 3, which I think is great as it puts parts two, three, and four together as long one story happening over a few days. It also helps the idea of these people coming out to Crystal Lake, as everything is happening so fast no one is able to hear about it before they head out and end up getting killed. You have to think back in the day there was no Twitter or Facebook to spread the news quickly, so no one had an idea as to what was going on.Joe Zito did a great job of bringing the creepiness back to the franchise after Part 3D gave it up for its effect. I love Friday the 13th Part 3D, but I also love The Final Chapter because they did their best to make Jason a scary figure and the woods a more dangerous place to be. The music here is solid, with the iconic music returning and Tom Savini coming back to help in the make up department.Overall Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter has a lot going for itself. The kills are nice and gory, there's plenty of nudity, and Jason meets his end thanks to a young Tommy Jarvis, who would return in the next two films. Another great score and slick work by Joe Zito means you'll have a great time watching this one.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
286,chicane2003,WOW..thats a Friday the 13th with Class better than 3rd installment,10,12 March 2006,Heeres A creepy continuing of the great slasher of all time. Jason back.. and this time a new group of dummies..thats what they are.. get in his area. The movie is a lot better than the early movies. From the start there's horror and dark scenes that make you scream over and over. All the scenes with girls laughing and a lot of acting at daytime are almost gone.. and one of the only day scenes you will see some really nice chicks nude swimming.. after the swimming the rest of the movie is just horror no more fun only Jason killing .. GREAT thats the way you make a Friday the 13 th part and gets away with it.10/10 watch it ..dont rent it waste of time... BUY IT cause this one have to be a part of your DVD movies,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
287,prettyoddthings,"Weaker than the first three, but still a great ride.",8,3 April 2011,"Most ""Friday the 13th"" fans consider this to be one of the best sequels. I tend to disagree. While none of the sequels produced under the Paramount banner are bad, this one falls a bit short of the previous three.Don't take it the wrong way: it's still very much everything a ""Friday the 13th"" film should be. There are creative death scenes, some good suspenseful set pieces, and Jason is as scary as he'll ever be. But something seems to be lacking this time around that sets it apart from its older brothers and sisters.For one, the characters this time around are genuinely un-likable. You might think this funny, considering it's a ""Friday the 13th"" film, but the previous entries at least contained some characters that we could root for. Here, there are about a total of two characters that don't verge of being so gratingly annoying that we want them to die. And, fittingly, they happen to be the main ones.This time out, Jason escapes the hospital morgue after he is pronounced ""dead"" after the end of the third film and makes his way to a rental house in the country, conveniently occupied by a group of some very annoying young adults. Living next door is the Jarvis family--mother, young son, teenage daughter, and dog, Gordon.This film introduces young Tommy Jarvis (played very well by a young Corey Feldman)--a character who would go on to star in the next two sequels (albeit with different actors).Tom Savini returns to the make-up chair for this one following an absence from the previous two films, supplying a variety of gruesome special effects.The atmosphere is certainly more ""80s"" than any entry before it, with the film's fashion and choice of music reeking of bad nostalgia involving poofy hair and over-sized dress/shirt thingys with big belts around the waist (what the heck were those?).The atmosphere is darker than the previous films, with the murders being more mean-spirited and ugly this time around. A sudden rainstorm certainly helps attribute to this as well.As Jason slices his way through the annoying cast (imagine being at a party with sluts who will try to steal your boyfriend right in front of you, an ugly jokester who no girl in the cast wants to sleep with, and one of the most timid, boring girls ever in a ""Friday the 13th"" film and you'll get what I mean), the brother of one of Jason's victims searches the woods surrounding Crystal Lake for revenge. Word of advice: looking for revenge against Jason = not a good idea. You will lose.The finale is entertaining and contains some genuinely suspenseful moments involving a running Jason and a chase sequence that goes back and forth between the two houses, and Jason's ""demise"" is gory and satisfying enough. But, of course, he will be back, making ""The Final Chapter"" on the film's title seem like nothing more than a cash-grab.It's an entertaining ride and certainly necessary viewing if you enjoyed the previous films, but it doesn't quite match up. Thankfully, the next installment brings some bite back into the franchise.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
288,Stacebea888,Good solid horror film,9,28 March 2013,I know when people hear the name Friday the 13th - they think god... the film with a million sequels ... but actually this is little gem... the first 4 aren't too shabby and the 6th one isn't terrible ... this one is one of my favs ... iv been a fan of slasher films since i was a little girl (im 23 now and still a fan) the plot is straight forward - it carries off from number 3 - Jason voorhees laying in the barn - dead...? ha-ha in the morgue he suddenly wakes up and *spoiler* bumps off a few staff ... the film follow the same routine as the others - Jason bumping off attractive teens in the hope of clearing crystal lake ... the acting is better and the kills more inventive ...kimberley beck is especially good as the clever girl and Corey Feldman in a young role really does outdo himself .. this was meant to be the final chapter ... but as all of us know *spoiler* it wasn't! good acting ... solid story and creepy as always ... worth to watch.,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
289,DeadByDawn92,Easily The Best Of The Series,10,23 January 2014,"Definitely my favorite of the series, this contains the best overall cast, the most vicious death scenes, the most intense meanstreak/final act, and one of the greatest opening sequences. Surprisingly, this movie had a few genuinely eerie moments. Ex: When the emergency vehicles leave the Higgins' vacation home and the audience is left at the scene that is now abandoned and shrouded in darkness. For some reason, that moment has always stuck with me. Jason's demise was easily the best of the series, with its only real competition being the outboard motor death of him in the sixth film. This also had one of the most attractive casts of the series, which is certainly an added bonus. They all had great chemistry together as well.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

It was tied directly to the end of the last one which is great and he still has the great mask. Good scares and good gore.  Back to the Futures Crispin Glover is in this movie too (Micheal J. Fox's father in the past) and Jason does him in, its great!This is a great and classic 80's Horror, ever has Tom Savini attached as special effects/gore.

Tommy jarvis one more time!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
292,fox7x,Jason Finally Hits His Stride...,8,20 May 2006,"The fourth installment in the decadent slasher series Friday the 13th, this film is arguably the best of the sequels. The cast, for the most part, is composed of decent character actors and few recognizable names. Crispin Glover and Corey Feldman give this movie a much needed sense of credibility and, dare I say it, even a little nuance that most of the other films lack. And, more importantly, that God-Awful disco opening theme from the third movie has been replaced by a traditionally creepy, over-the-top staccato-ed score by Harry Manfredini.Jason is back and in top form. Premarital sex, drugs and booze are the underlying themes as once again a small group of young people are chopped into quarter rounds. The gore effects are convincing and the direction competent. Joseph Zito knows what he's doing and effortlessly takes us on a nasty, self-indulgent little thrill ride. A lot of people get wiped out, and with the exception of a few you really don't care either way. The movie seems to understand this, and a such truly invests time in only a select few of it's players. Everyone else is machete fodder.But the heart of this movie is Corey Feldman. His character, Tommy Jarvis, becomes the best and most unlikely enemy for Jason Voorhees. The brilliance of the concept catches one off guard, as no one would have ever guessed a little boy to be such a challenge for the seemingly invincible Jason. But it ultimately pays off, as Jason is at his core a angry, vengeful, hateful man-child. The child of innocence vs. the corrupt child works very well in the finale.Very rarely is Jason looked at as a human character. Mostly, he's an unstoppable force out to kill anyone within the confines of Camp Crystal Lake. I think the best movies in this series are the ones that treat Jason as human being (for lack of a better term) and give you a little insight into his character and what makes him tick. Sure, he's as twisted and simply evil as they come. But as shown recently in Freddy vs. Jason, he can also be a sympathetic madman too.Kane Hodder, and later Ken Kirzinger, gave Jason a certain flair that the previous stunt men lacked. The guy who played Jason here did a good job, but in the end when compared to the aforementioned Hodder and Kirzinger, the subtlety of his performance seems odd. Ha, listen to me. I'm talking about the subtle nuance of the stunt men playing Jason Voorhees. LOL!But, in the end, The Final Chapter isn't even close to being the final chapter. In my mind, it's the beginning of a three movie run that constitutes the best of the sequels. Scary, campy, over the top and above all else fun, this is one Friday you don't want to miss.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
293,Dreality,Friday the 13th-The Final Chapter,8,21 March 2006,"I think this was the best film in the series. This film could have stood alone as an original film about the monster that wears a hockey mask. It also had the best cast of all the films. Corey Feldman, Judie Aronson, Crispin Glover, Erich Anderson, Lawrence Monoson, and the meanest portrayal of Jason by Ted White. I was familiar with some of the cast, and had seen them in other films prior to this film. Joseph Zito, directed what I would say was the darkest film in the series. It's hard to go back and sit through some of the earlier films in the franchise because they simply don't measure up. Zito, kept his film on track from beginning to end, earlier films in the franchise dragged at the beginning. Harry Manfredini's soundtrack from this entry was the best of any of the films, especially the music leading up toward the final chase scenes. The death scenes were clearly the best as was the make up by Tom Savini. I would say this was the last time we saw Jason as scary. This was by far the best entry in the series.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
294,pghpunk7,"As for a horror movie, this one delivers.",10,19 February 2000,"I'm a firm believer that horror movies should be judged as horror movies, and not compared when reviewed to films such as The Godfather, and as far as horror films go, this one could easily be the Godfather of em all. Following closely in the tradition of the previous three Fridays, The Final Chapter places Jason smack dab in the middle of two isolated cabins deep in the woods, one occupied by a group of fun loving teenagers and the other by a peaceful lakeside family. Well of course the violence and gross fun is plenty, but what really sets this film apart from a lot of horror flicks and almost all of the Friday the 13th films is it's tone, quality and over all entertainment level. Director Joseph Zito has a sharp eye for detail and Splatter Master Tom Savini sure does send Jason out with a bang. Of course this ended up NOT being The Final Chapter, unfortunately it should have been. After this entry the series really started to go down hill. If your in the mood for a good old fashion 80's slasher flick, this one's for you.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
295,lakipfc79,Jason survived but the franchise didn't,2,12 February 2011,"""Friday the 13th: The final chapter"" deserves to be hardly thrashed by the fans of the franchise. Its underestimative relationship to its audience is the main reason for that. Rumours calling the Joseph Zito an arrogant man may be proved here. His disinterest to at least try to make some decent movie denudes his personal opinion about the franchise - it is made for idiots. Or, it seems so. So Mr. Zito made this piece of crap. Unimaginative, stunningly stupid wannabe movie. Look guys, you have naked chicks in here, you also have Tom Savini, who gives the s..t about the story - I believe he wanted to say. OK, Mr. Zito but even in the porn characters have some depht (you know what I mean:)). And for those ''hillarious'' jokes (computer never lies etc) - save them for your friends ;) The Final chapter in some way justifies its title - Jason is still alive, of course but the franchise is pretty dead, too.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
296,cainkong19,The best of the best,10,18 February 2014,The final chapter is by far the best Friday the 13th film in the series.It has the basic premise of every other Friday film teens go to a cabin get drunk and have sex but this film adds new things to the film one of which is Corey Feldman as Tommy Jarvis who is actually a metaphor for a young Tom Savini speaking about Tom Savini he did all the makeup for this film and made by far the best looking pre-zombie Jason yet. The final chapter has the most gore the most nudity the most awesome Jason and thats what makes it the best also we have a young Crispin Glover doing the best 80s dancing that i have seen.

297,jens-bockelmann1,"The last ""true"" Jason movie?",7,6 August 2015,"Well, I finally watched ""The Final Chapter"" yesterday and I have to admit - believe it or not - that I really had a good time with this movie. But first, let's take a look at the story: Not knowing about the dark and bloody history of Camp Crystal Lake, a bunch of teenagers arrives at the Camp to have all kinds of fun, which of course brings Jason to the plot to give them a lesson they won't forget... Sounds familiar? I guess you're right: The plot of Friday 4 is basically the same since Part 2 (and even Part 1 with some restrictions). The few new things are a family and a young man who searches for his missing sister (from Part 2). And let's not forget Jason in Halloween II mode. Yes, Jason is ""dead"" at the beginning of this movie (but not really) and he will be ""dead"" at the end of the movie (this time even for real!), but that is not what the movie is about. Grab a beer (or something else) and enjoy the simple entertainment of likable teens having fun, partying, having sex and getting killed in creative ways. Oh, and why the last true ""Jason"" movie? This is just my personal opinion, but the first four movies had a simple story, likable characters and creative kills. And I miss exactly these things in every movie that came after them. Also - and I know that some say he was (un)dead since Part 1 - Jason finally gets killed or ""stopped"". And yes, I like Part 6 but I see it as a action-fantasy-sequel that has not that much in common with the first four movies. In the end it is a very enjoyable movie that has everything in it what a good Friday needs.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

I watched it again recently and I am pleased to say even as a kid, I knew my horror movies. I don't know why it is hailed as one of the better 'Friday the 13th' movies as their are far superior ones such as part 3 and part 6. Corey Feldman is one of the reasons that the 80s is looked on as a cheesy and tacky period in Post Modern history and once again he blew it in this movie. The guy who keeps laughing at the silent movies is probably the worst bit of casting I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the series but this one is a real let down.

302,Maxwell85,The adventures of Jimbo and Ted,10,7 September 2002,"Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter is a great horror film. Not just for the great scares and gore, but also because of Crispin Glover (McFly in Back to the Future) and Lawrence Monoson's performances as Jimbo and Ted.
Jimbo is basically an unlucky horny teen, and Ted is his friend who thinks he's a ladies man. When combined, you get the funniest dialogue I've ever seen in a horror film.If comedy isn't your thing, this film is still great for having the goriest deaths in the series and a great Jason performance by Ted White. This was also one of Corey Feldman's first films, and he does pretty good in his role as Tommy, the horror masks loving kid.Overall, if you want scares and laughs, then Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter is the movie for you! I give it two thumbs up!",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
303,daviskrn69,One of the best Friday films,10,17 August 2004,"This is, in my opinion, one of the best Friday the 13th films out there. Unlike any of the others, it picks up right where the one before it (part 3) leaves off. It does have its slow points, but the characters can be easily related to by teenagers. Jimbo (a young Chrispin Glover) and Ted are some extremely laughable characters that really make you feel like they are old friends you knew from high school. This movie also spawns the character of Tommy Jarvis, played by Corey Feldman, who returns in 2 more sequels, which is the only character other than Jason to do so. I think this movie has the scariest Jason, although others would argue that Kane Hodder,not Ted White, is the best Jason. If you are a fan of the slasher genre, check this flick out, it's a blast.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
304,stewartwaldie78,not quite the final chapter but a great horror movie!!,9,25 February 2015,Friday the 13th The final chapter was the first of the series I saw. This was many years ago and has remained a favorite of mine in the 13th movies and horror films in General.The movie begins with a handy recap of the 1st three movies setting the scene of what is to come. Picking up where 3 ended we follow Jason back to a hospital where the murders continue as he works his way back to Crystal Lake to find a dozen or so new victims waiting to stalked and killed in a host of inventive gory ways.The acting is slightly better the teens slightly more likable and as I mentioned the kills pretty gory compared to later movies where kill scenes were heavily cut by IMPA.Much has been said of the final chapter title and there being 5 more movies after its release however it is in my opinion the last movie in which Jason was human before the movies in series headed in a supernatural direction so if you looking for a good old fashioned 80's stalk n slash movie this one is worth a watch,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
305,kristofferostrup,The best Friday The 13th ever made.,10,15 October 2019,"After watching the movies over and over again, I've finally settled that The final Chapter is the best. Many will consider part 6 or part 2 which is fine, but I will recommend part 4 instead because of it's cast and Jason himself. The movie has fantastic acting considering it's a Friday the 13th movie, Crispin Glover is fantastic in his role, so is the other actors in this movie. But still Jason sells this movie for me, he is for the first time I think actually really scary and always frightened me as a kid. I will also say this my movie and some others is the only ones to actually know what it is during. Like part 6 it is really self aware and knows what it is doing. I will give this film a 10/10 if you are a horror movie fan.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter

This movie has an all-star cast. It has Corey Feldman,.....OK so that's that's it, maybe not an all-star cast, but if your a fan of 80's movies then you gotta love Corey Feldman. Anyway in this the fourth installment of the series Jason continues to wreck havoc on carefree teenagers and up the body count. This time turning his attention to the Jarvis Family.

The filmmakers accomplish everything they set out to do. From the atmosphere to the make-up to the death scenes, it all works. Ted White is always the first ""Jason"" I think of when somebody says ""Friday the 13th"". Mr. White set the standard for what Jason should be. You even care a little for the folks that die, a feeling that is absent from the rest of the series. The script is what you would expect from a slasher film, but most of the acting is acceptable.(You don't go into a movie like this looking for Oscar winners.) If there is anyone left that is a fan and hasn't seen this entry into the series, do yourself a favor. Pop it in your DVD or VCR players late at night, turn out the lights, and make sure the doors are locked. You are about to see Jason Voorhees at his best. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. Everything else pails in comparison.",Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter
