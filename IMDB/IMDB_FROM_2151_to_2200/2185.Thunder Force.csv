0,SnoopyStyle,superhero spoof,6,14 April 2021,"In 1983, the world is hit with cosmic radiation which turns a few into supervillains known as Miscreants. Lydia Berman is left an orphan after a Miscreant destroys a subway train. She gets bullied at school until Emily Stanton comes to her rescue. They break up as Emily is focused on following her parents' bio-engineering work to create superheroes out of regular folks. As adults, Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) is a blue collar dock worker still living in the old neighborhood while Emily (Octavia Spencer) is the head of a large bio-engineering company. William ""The King"" Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) is a power hungry politician. Laser (Pom Klementieff) and The Crab (Jason Bateman) are two of the Miscreants.This is getting panned and I know why. There are issues with the writing. Ben Falcone continues to be a problematic writer-director. Here's the thing. I like this cast. There are a couple of light chuckles. Mostly, I like these actors and I appreciate this cast of characters. The most important chemistry has to be Melissa and Octavia. One gets a sense of their friendship off the screen. It's a mistake to have the break up. They can still drift apart but they need to remain friends. So I'm glad that Emily readily accepts Lydia's surprise visit. The problem is that Emily is too much of a wet blanket. Also it makes no sense that she would take the invisibility treatment herself. It would be better for both of them to be accidentally infected with super-abilities. It all affects their chemistry in a negative way. They do still work but mostly due to their natural chemistry. Jason Bateman's Crab has the most potential and the weird sex game is probably where the movie generates its best comedy. In the end, I chuckled a little but this is not that good. Falcone's work continues to be flawed and the great cast struggles against it.",Thunder Force
1,nogodnomasters,She's not a nerd. She's smart.,8,19 April 2021,"Cosmic rays give a few sociopaths superhuman power which is used to disrupt Chicago as if they would notice. Emily (Octavia Spencer ) is a geneticist who develops a method to give normal humans super abilities. Her blue collar friend Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally gets strength leaving Emily with invisibility.This is a popcorn flick. For those who missed the overweight humor of Melissa McCarthy, it is back. Pom Klementieff who played Mantis in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" plays the villain Laser. Jason Bateman has a silly role with crab hands. I enjoyed the low brow humor of it all and the 80's music.Guide: No F-words, sex or nudity.",Thunder Force
2,kosmasp,What TF,6,19 April 2021,"What Thunder Force - I mean what else would I mean by that, right? Kidding aside and maybe someone already has used that as summary line without trying to hide their own despise and frankly hate for the movie. As you can see I am not one of that category. Now the movie has quite a few things that go wrong and I totally understand if you find the jokes and the story annoying.Having said that the movie is supposed to be super silly and just there for your entertainment. Yes I wasn't able to enjoy all of it either. There are so many crazy things going on ... the whole backstory (needed or not - probably the latter but a nice touch to the bully theme), the way the characters behave ... suspension of disbelief would be an understatement! So watcht the trailer and decide if that is something you can dig or not ...",Thunder Force
3,paul_haakonsen,An out of place superhero comedy...,6,9 April 2021,"Now, I have to admit that I was sort of dreading sitting down to watch the 2021 action comedy ""Thunder Force"" given the rather low rating the movie had managed to acquire here on IMDb. But still, I do like both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer in comedy movies, and since I hadn't already seen ""Thunder Force"", of course I sat down to watch it.And I must say that I am glad that I did, because I enjoyed this movie. It was a wonderful comedy with a spoofy superhero layer pulled over it, and it actually worked rather well. Now, writer and director Ben Falcone is getting some wind for his movies, but I think he actually makes adequate movies, and ""Thunder Force"" definitely was entertaining and enjoyable.At the risk of triggering a tsunami of anger, then let's just face it that both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer is not what you would think of first when you think superheroes. And that is what makes this movie work out so well, because they pulled it off so nicely and they made this movie their own. They both added so much charisma to the movie and really were excellently cast for the roles of Lydia Berman and Emily Stanton respectively.The storyline told in ""Thunder Force"" was a good one and it definitely provided me with proper entertainment from start to end. Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but a spoof like this is something that appeals to me.However, when the movie was starting to bring up gender neutrality and lesbian relationships, I must admit that I had to sigh. Not that I have anything against such convictions or anything, but the whole thing of it permeating everything that comes out of Hollywood with its political correctness is just something that has become a tad too much. But luckily it was mere two scenes, so it wasn't something that had an impact on the movie.Aside from Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, then ""Thunder Force"" also have the likes of Jason Bateman, Bobby Cannavale, Kevin Dunn, Pom Klementieff and Ben Falcone on the cast list. So it is a rather good ensemble of actors and actresses that participate in the movie. I must say that I was especially entertained by Jason Bateman and his character in the movie.Visually then ""Thunder Force"" is a movie that easily stand aside movies from Marvel or D. C., yup. Yeah, I think so, because the special effects in the movie were really good, as were the visuals.If you want a superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and if you like spoofs, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""Thunder Force"". It was actually a rather enjoyable and amusing movie.My rating of ""Thunder Force"" lands on a six out of ten stars. This is definitely a movie that I would recommend watching.",Thunder Force
4,Calicodreamin,Lacks charisma,4,10 April 2021,"I had high hopes for thunder force, but the reviews don't lie... it's unfunny and lacks chemistry. I only laughed a handful of times and even those were half hearted. The script was bland and the storyline predictable. I couldn't tell if it was serious or a spoof and either way it didn't work.",Thunder Force
5,Edvis-1997,4,4,10 April 2021,"3 words that best describe this movie are: bland, predictable and unnecessary. I really don't get it. To build this kind of film it costs millions of dollars and how no one saw that this isn't hit just a flop. They had great cast, acting was really on point but plot is just terrible. Nothing unique in this movie, no jokes, comedy is in such a low level. Imdb have put this film in most waited spring movies and I believed in that. Now I'm just disappointed and angry. I wouldn't recommend to watch this film because it doesn't worth your time.",Thunder Force
6,Cineanalyst,"Formulaic and Funny, if not Superly So",5,9 April 2021,"""Thunder Force"" appears already to be getting mostly panned, and its humor surely and understandably isn't to everyone's taste, which is fine, and, indeed, there's nothing especially novel about it. Melissa McCarthy's fat-and-stupid routine has been the modus operandi of Peter Griffin for nearly 20 years now, Eric Cartman for over 20 years, and Homer Simpson for over 30 years. Kevin James, Lou Costello if you want to go way back, and maybe some heavies in Keystone and other silent comedies before that. Often, as here, this character is put in a duo with a straight (wo)man of dissimilar qualities, so we get Olivia Spencer's wealthy genius and parent, and, physically, one character being black and the other white. And, the superhero framework is exceedingly generic. Estranged childhood pals (the smart and not a nerd--""there's a difference""--and the class clown protecting her from bullies), science-y mishap, training montage, typically-crazed boss villain, a literal time bomb, and the self-sacrificing white savior act.But, I found it funny enough. McCarthy really carries it, and her husband writer-director gives her plenty of room to do her usual schtick. Teaming up again with Jason Bateman, playing a crab-man this time, results in some of the most hilarious bits. Contrary to its otherwise formulaic nature, you don't get much of mutant sexual relations or stinky superhero costumes in MCU and DCEU burgers. Olivia Spencer gets sidekicked some here, but she plays the straight counterpoint well enough. Melissa Leo is mostly wasted, though.It's a lightweight and decidedly low-stakes superhero comedy overall, but I rather like that after seeing so many why-so-serious variations on the superheroic, end-of-the-world genre that seemingly occupies every other recent movie I see nowadays, whether the tear-jerking back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), the four-hours indulgence of ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"" (2021), or the muddled politics of the latest episode of the drawn-out streaming series ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" I viewed before ""Thunder Force."" The supervillains here, by contrast, are well established before the heroines emerge, and they're just psychopathic criminals with no conspiratorial motive beyond accumulating political power--rather realistic except some of the villains have pincers for arms or shoot lightning out their body.",Thunder Force
7,The-Sarkologist,I Enjoyed It,6,22 July 2021,"This film didn't seem to go down all that well with the critics, but then again I generally don't pay all that much attention to the critics. Well, okay, the average punters didn't seem to think all that much of this film as well, which is a shame because honestly, it wasn't all that bad. Sure, it isn't one of the greatest of films out there, and I certainly didn't find it all that funny, but it was still an enjoyable film to watch, and a nice way to kill a Sunday afternoon.It's sort of a superhero film, but it stars Melissa McCarthy, so you can probably guess that it is going to be a little more comedic than your typical superhero film (though many of the Marvel films of late have actually been quite funny). It's about these two girls who meet in highschool, one of them wants to become a geneticist and find a way to give people superhuman strength, while the other is basically a drop out that listens to a lot of heavy metal.Anyway, the Earth has been hit by radiation, and it have given psychopaths superpowers, which is pretty problematic because nobody else has them. This is why one of the girls wants to get into genetic research, namely because her parents were killed by one of these miscreants (as they are called), and she wants to continue from where they left off. However, in comes Lydia, who plays around with some knobs, and sits of a chair, and suddenly starts going through a process of giving her superhuman strength.It's fairly typical for a superhero film, though it is rather odd that there doesn't actually seem to be all that many super villains about - only two actually. Well, there is the guy with the crab claws, but he's not quite in the same league as the others. So, to fight these miscreants, they create the Thunder Force, a couple of ladies who also have superhuman powers.As I mentioned, I wouldn't consider it to be incredibly funny, but I've never found McCarthy to be all that funny anyway (though that is generally the case with most American Comedians - they just try too hard to be funny). However, it does have quite a nice feel about it, and I do rather appreciate how it tends to break the norms that you tend to get in Hollywood movies, especially around McCarthy. Look, it isn't going to win any awards, but it certainly isn't as bad as some people have made it out to be.",Thunder Force

9,Thanos_Alfie,Funny...,5,9 May 2021,"""Thunder Force"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch two friends fighting some supervillains in order to protect their city and its people. They both have their own powers to help them succeed on their fight against supervillains but first they have to learn how to use them.I found this movie funny and interesting since it had some decent action scenes combined with humor that made it even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Ben Falcone, it was good and he did a great job on the way he presented the whole story between his main characters and how they evolved. The interpretations of both Melissa McCarthy who played as Lydia Berman and Octavia Spencer who played as Emily Stanton were very good and the combination of both actress were simply amazing and hilarious. To sum up, I have to say that ""Thunder Force"" is a nice, funny comedy movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure you will laugh a lot and you will have a great time.",Thunder Force
10,cruise01,Another horrible Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcones comedy films.,2,20 April 2021,1 out of 5 stars.Thunder Force is a bad comedy superhero film that fails to deliver laughs. Boring cast ensemble. And the plot is another waste of time. Melissa McCarthy and Husband Ben Falcone who also directed and wrote the film have been on another track record of making atrocious comedy films. Which the humor has been the same in all there films. Boring cheesy dialogue. Terrible humor that delivers more eye rolls than laughs. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer were unfunny. Jason Bateman playing a Crab handed character also seemed bored with the role.The plot following people having superhero powers. A corrupt mayor who has his hidden agenda. While Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer team up with super strength to stop the bad guys.Terrible cgi. Cheesy dialogue. Boring action. And the humor is terrible. It is one comedy film that is best to miss.,Thunder Force
11,digitalbeachbum,"It was OK for the older family, except for the damn language",4,11 April 2021,"Really? Do you need to be bi polar when you make movies? Do you need to make a movie which is supposed to be a comedy but add all that !@#$ language. This movie would have received a few extra stars from me, but they had to throw in all that language which made it impossible for the little ones to watch. There is no need for the language, it doesn't make the scenes funnier.The other problem with this movie is that while there are some funny scenes, there is no consistency with the characters. From start to finish you would expect to see a steady and normal growth of the characters, but that doesn't happen. It's because the writers or director felt the need to use Deus ex machina rather than put in some extra effort to have characters be themselves.When I see Deus ex machina being used, I know the writers are being lazy. There are several moments in this movie where the writers just said ""we give up"" and pushed a scene through like a bulldozer through a China shop.This is an OK movie, but it could have been better, way better. It seems they hinted at the end for having another movie, but let us hope they change directors and writers.",Thunder Force

It's not quite as bad as some would make you think; it's mostly inoffensive and even somewhat funny at times (Bateman best nails the tone). Still, so much of it feels awkward (Spencer's entire presence), lazy (cliched team breakup), and desperately unfunny.",Thunder Force
13,southdavid,Thunderballs,4,9 July 2021,"By any yardstick that you choose to compare ""Thunder Force"" too... it's pretty terrible. That said, I just couldn't generate any genuine hatred for it. It's essentially just a group of friends and family messing about.In a world where enhanced supervillains exist, two school friends drift apart. Decades later, Emily (Octavia Spencer) is a successful scientist working on a way to give powers to the right people, and fight back. Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) has been less successful, but wishes her friendship with Emily had been maintained. On the night of a school reunion, Lydia goes to see Emily at her lab and is accidentally injected with a serum that gives her superhuman strength and resilience. Emily had always planned to be a hero too, so takes the serum also and becomes invisible at will. The pair form a team, THUNDER FORCE, and start to fight back against the villainous forces.I mean, it's rubbish. It's full of performers who can do a lot better, who seemingly agreed to do this so they could hang around with their friends, which is fine. It's not funny or I should say, it's hardly ever funny - occasionally there's some business with Jason Bateman that made me chuckle. His crab based supporting villain turned love interest is, at least, knowing.There's a persuasive awkwardness to the whole endeavour though, never quite sure how deep into parody it's going - but again, I couldn't really come to actively hate it. It doesn't really care that deeply, and neither did I. Never again though.",Thunder Force

17,alindsay-al,A Bad Unfunny Comedy,3,9 April 2021,"With the Coronavirus pandemic shutting Cinemas worldwide it seems like Netflix have become a force in terms of gaining the rights to films with big stars in it and Thunder Force is no different and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two former friends both get superpowers and attempt to save Chicago from other superpowered beings.Main Character
Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer play the two leads here and its weird, I think both of them are pretty bad in this film but there is no denying they seems to be having fun together and it actually added a bit of energy and life to this pretty generic film. But on their own it doesn't work, Spencer isn't an actress that does comedy much and it clearly shows as she is quite stiff and rigid in her performance which is clearer due to the over the top performance by McCarthy. Now I know Melissa McCarthy can be funny, I have seen her do good work such as Spy and Can you ever forgive me? She just isn't funny here and she needs the right director and project to get that out of her and this film was not it.Supporting Characters
Jason Bateman. That is it the best part of this film is Bateman, he plays a half man half crab and he is actually pretty funny. He just adds some quirkiness and ridiculousness of the right kind that really fits and it is just a shame that the others in the film just can't get the same quality out if them. There are some other decent actors such as Bobby Cannavale, Melissa Leo and Pom Klementieff but they are such dull characters and for me it is just a real waste of the talent that the film has and sometimes I wonder why bother casting these big name performers if you aren't going to give them interesting and funny material to work with.Story
The story is absurd, but it doesn't embrace it enough. I want to see more superpowered beings for Thunder Force to go up against and it feels like the film either didn't have the budget or weren't creative enough to do that. The film tries to make you care about the characters but I really couldn't as apart from Bateman I just didn't care about the characters or their whole story because the film does nothing to make me care. This film also has something that happens in the last act that really annoyed me because it didn't feel earned and even though this is a comedy I feel like things should at least feel like they fit in the film we are watching.Script
The one job of a comedy, make me laugh and this film really failed at that. I maybe smirked a few times but I never laughed as they is no clever comedy here, it is just the most basic of basic attempts to make you laugh and you can easily see right through it. Also the drama doesn't work, it has all been done before and this film isn't good enough for it to get me invested.Style
When the action is happening there is no doubt that it can be fun to watch and fitting for a spoof of Superhero films. But I checked and the first time Thunder Force go on a mission is 45 mins into the film, that is unacceptable and by that point I had already clocked out of what the film was trying to achieve.Overall
Overall, Thunder Force is a bad comedy. McCarthy is in another comedy stinker and I just think this film lacks any of the qualities that a good comedy needs and unless you love the two leads this is one to avoid.",Thunder Force

There were moments of this that I really wanted to enjoy, certain bits of cheese that I got a kick out of but overall this was such a nothing experience. I watched this a few days ago and while I can remember a chuckle or two and some mildly enjoyable superhero shenanigans, the rest of the movie is a complete blur of forgettable nothing.There's really nothing to recommend here unless you're just a huge McCarthy fan.

23,jadepietro,Thunder Claptrap,5,3 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Too many missed comic opportunities in this superhero comedy, despite the charms of Ms. McCarthy.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Thunder Force is a superhero comedy that is not super. What it does have going for it is the immeasurable talents of Melissa McCarthy as Lydia Berman, a misfit who accidentally acquires superpowers and then needs to adapt to those life-altering changes. The first half of the film is the most promising, but as the movie progresses, it misses so many comic possibilities in its storytelling. The central plot about evil super-villains known as Miscreants interferes with the comic momentum. Some needed rewrites were in order to blend action and comedy successfully. Writer / director / husband Ben Falcone sets up his premise well, but never provides enough comic ingenuity and follows formulaic guidelines. The movie has too many inside jokes and unfunny asides while it belabors the superhero action scenes and plot. Many of those jokes fall flat.The super-strength of the movie is, once again, Ms. McCarthy no-holds-barred approach at physical comedy. Her likability and screen persona make her highly watchable. This performer's main weakness remains in choosing film scripts. As her sidekick who is endowed with the invisibility factor, Olivia Spencer never comes near Mrs. McCarthy comic genius, but the actress does make her character, Emily Stanton, a brainiac and childhood friend, quite an interesting counterpoint.Providing much needed comic support are the reliable Jason Bateman as Jerry the Crab and Bobby Cannavale as The King, a cartoonish gangster/ politician. That he plays to the hilt. Veteran actors Melissa Leo and Kevin Dunn are essentially given throwaway roles and , in the action sequences, Pom Klementieff makes a determined villainess as Laser.Despite McCarthy's forceful comic presence, Thunder Force is, dare I say, weak. (GRADE: C)",Thunder Force

26,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's slightly better than Melissa McCarthy's other vehicles, but it doesn't add much to the already crowded Superhero Comedy genre.",5,10 April 2021,"After a beam of cosmic energy hit the Earth in 1983, people with a genetic propensity towards sociopathy were given superpowers, giving rise to superpowered criminals called Miscreants. Scientist Emily Stanton (Octavia Spencer) discovers the formula to give regular people superpowers in the hopes of bringing the Miscreants to justice, but when her estranged best-friend Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally injects the formula it imbues with incredible abilities. The two women must become the first superhero team. Now, it is up to Thunder Force to battle the super-powered Miscreants and save Chicago from the clutches of The King (Bobby Cannavale).Thunder Force is the latest tentpole film from Netflix and reteams husband and wife Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy in their fifth vehicle. Since appearing in Bridesmaids back in 2011 McCarthy's track record has been spotty to say the least. McCarthy has turned in some strong comic vehicles such as The Heat and Spy and even showed herself to be dramatically capable with a great supporting role in Bill Murray dramedy St. Vincent. But more often than not she's turned in comic misfires such as 2016 Ghostbusters and her collaborations with her husband Ben Falcone (Tammy, The Boss, Life of the Part, Superintelligence) and has become massively overexposed since her breakout role in Bridesmaids. With that said, Thunder Force is probably the best of the collaborations she's done with her husband, but it's still got many of the same problems.When the movie begins in its opening prologue I actually found myself quite intrigued by the premise. It establishes a world where only sociopaths are given powers by this cosmic force and it makes for an interesting setting and storytelling potential. Even our introduction to our characters Lydia and Emily is actually quite funny with Vivian Faclone (Ben and Melissa's real life daughter) and Brie Danielle playing the characters as children and Mia Kaplan and Tai Leshaun playing them as teenagers. The opening 15 minutes are quite good as we see them establish their personalities and characters and they do a nice job setting up the character histories. Vivian Falcone in particular is really good showing a natural screen presence with probably one of the best bully takedowns I can recall of recent memory and I look forward to seeing her in bigger roles as her career goes on. But then we catch up with them 30 years later.When the movie switches gears to present day around 20 minutes or so into the movie, the usual tropes from other Falcone/Projects make themselves known. There are multiple points in the following 40 minutes of the movie that are based on either directionless rambling and gross-out jokes (including a running gag involving raw chicken) and numerous scenes involving references to 80s and 90s pop culture that result in McCarthy rambling about/doing bad impressions about Urkel from Family Matters and Jodie Foster's character Nell from Nell. These jokes are intercut with a sort of training montage which is basically an excuse for poorly timed slapstick and overdone pratfalls and it's easily the weakest part of the movie. But then the movie course corrects, even if only slightly.When we finally leave the training facility/laboratory we actually do get a few decent sequences. Jason Bateman plays a sort-of Miscreant known as The Crab due to his crab arms and he strikes up a odd romantic relationship with Lydia that actually did lead to some humorous exchanges between them (including a first date where he makes a waiter regret suggesting the Seafood Tower), it's actually a pretty decent comic performance on Bateman's part and I found myself enjoying certain scenes slightly more when he was on Camera. Bobby Cannavale as William ""The King"" Stevens, a secretly Miscreant business man running for Mayor is a rather underwhelming villain who isn't particularly threatening or funny. There is kind of a funny exchange where the movie breaks down the villain trope of killing your own henchman out of anger for dramatic effect, but aside from that ""The King"" is basically a placeholder simply so our leads have a big bad to fight against. The movie despite a promise of a world with multiple superpowered psychopaths only has three who come into contact with our characters, The Crab, The King, and Pom Klementieff as Laser and aside from the humorous image of Jason Bateman with crab arms none of their powers or abilities are all that memorable or interesting.Thunder Force is unfortunately a very middle of the road comedy, it's not all that good, but it is watchable thanks to a few decent gags and one or two good performances. In terms of Superhero comedies this is nowhere near the worst that's ever been made as some are claiming, that honor goes to either Superhero Movie or My Super Ex-Girlfriend by virtue of A) this movie actually has a budget unlike Superhero Movie and B) This movie doesn't play stalking, harassment, and assault as comedy like My Super Ex-Girlfriend. It's just a very meh movie. Melissa McCarthy is a funny actress, but she needs to stop being directed by her husband because even though I'm assuming they have fun together making these movies, it's clear he doesn't known how to meter or guide her delivery or comic situations to best use her talents.",Thunder Force
27,bob-the-movie-man,Getting the crabs is never a laugh.,2,9 May 2021,"Positives:
I laughed three times:o Jason Bateman's ""Crab-man"" talking about his ironic star-sign;
o Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy's love-making scene: the most
innovative use of butter since ""Last Tango in Paris""!O The duo struggling to get in and out of their Lamborghini supercar: purely
because it looks just like me these days trying to get in and out of my wife's
Mazda MX5!Negatives:
It singularly fails my ""six laughs"" test for a comedy. The script by Ben Falcone - McCarthy's husband - is just eye-rollingly unfunny. The pair must have laughed themselves silly over their own jokes. It's just a shame that their sense of humour diverges so wildly from mine (or indeed anyones?)Melissa McCarthy must be an acquired taste - one I've never acquired. ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" proves what a class act she can be.... but this does her reputation no good at all.It's criminal to have actors of the quality of Octavia Spencer, Jason Bateman and Melissa Leo and use them in such a poor way. Bateman is actually the funniest turn in the piece, but that's not saying much.Summary Thoughts on ""Thunderforce"":
There are some movies that you just wish had been drowned at birth. This is one. I normally don't regret spending two hours watching a movie, but this one felt like wasted time. With ""Twist"" I thought I might have found my worst film of the year. But no, there's a new contender in town.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).",Thunder Force
28,Sir_AmirSyarif,Another bad Ben Falcone/Melissa McCarthy's bad movie,4,10 April 2021,"From Ben Falcone, the director of most of Melissa McCarthy's bad movies, comes another McCarthy's bad movie. 'Thunder Force' is nearly unwatchable. McCarthy and Octavia Spencer are two fantastic actors, but the writing, with a few memorable exceptions, completely wasted their talents. The premise is pretty interesting but it's largely a laugh-free zone. It is also poorly executed, and it deserves to be ignored and forgotten.",Thunder Force
29,Snootz,A fun movie with a lot of bigoted reviews,8,16 April 2021,"This flick has a reasonable plot and it has Melissa McCarthy, who was as funny as could be. This is a COMEDY, not another Avengers sequel. The story is sensible and straight-forward, the comedy spot-on, the special effects and fight sequences believable. It tells a story and tells it well, with quite a bit of humor thrown in.It seems some eople can't handle the idea of mid-40s non-petite women playing the part of super-heroes. This movie was well-directed, presented fun characters and was interesting from beginning to end. For those who are looking for a humorous super-hero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, those who are tired of the dark Batman, Superman, X-Men and other schlock... this might prove a refreshing change.

The jokes were so horrendous and lame, even though some got me chuckled a little bit. Pretty much everything in the movie was a cliche: the plot, story, characters, villains, dialogues, even the freaking TITLE.

32,msbreviews,"Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story.",3,9 April 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy, husband and wife, have been making movies together since the former began his filmmaking career. Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.Directors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as ""remarkable cinema"". Something worthy of many Oscars, Golden Globes, and much more. Movies like Thunder Force aren't made to receive regular nominations, but instead, to try and be present at the Razzies - both Falcone and McCarthy have been quite successful in this achievement. While the actress continuously shows her undeniable talent that would be better employed in other films - such as Can You Ever Forgive Me? And Bridesmaids - the writer-director continues to put together awfully dull movies.To be completely honest, the first act of Thunder Force is surprisingly decent. The setup to the main narrative is interesting enough, and the comedy peak is reached during the first half-hour. The massive problem is that this peak offers no more than a couple of chuckles occasionally. From the start of the second act until the very end, Falcone embarrassingly fails to offer genuine laughs. The tone is ridiculously out-of-balance, with almost every scene being a forced attempt at humor, even when the moment doesn't ask for it. Incredibly flat - and some disgusting - jokes are repeated throughout the film, which ends up dragging an already stretched out runtime.The superhero plot is as generic and predictable as it could be in a movie that makes no effort in trying to do something remotely different than what viewers have seen for the last couple of decades. The VFX look like they came from an amateur studio as if Netflix didn't even care about its own product. Story-wise, there's not even a proper way of analyzing such a silly screenplay. In one moment, it seems to be taking a specific scene seriously, but a couple of minutes later, everything is back to the annoyingly dumb environment. Don't get me wrong: if there's a type of humor I absolutely adore is absurd comedy, but it needs to be done properly, with the right people and the right story.In the end, I usually tend to have a light hand in films like this. Thunder Force is just another addition to the never-ending list of ""forgettable movies"", which isn't something that really bothers me. It's exactly what everyone expects it to be, which can work as a compliment if people want to. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is watching McCarthy and Octavia Spencer - two outstanding actresses with five Oscar nominations combined, including a win for the latter in The Help - working on hopeless projects such as this one. It begs the famous question: why?Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story. A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.Rating: D.",Thunder Force
33,SoumikBanerjee25,Not Utter Terrible as Most of the Reviews Say!,5,18 April 2021,"""Thunder Force"", a serviceable Superhero-Comedy at best; preferred to go with overstated farcical attributes. Still, in the meantime providing us a handful of laughs & chuckles. Yet all thanks to a rather mundane script; this Mellisa McCarthy & Octavia Spencer starrer couldn't save the day.Typically, prior to watching a movie; I try to stay away from film community opinions. As I intend to go with a blank slate every time! To my dismay, as it got released on Netflix; a myriad of Reviews were starting to pile up. And I couldn't help but take a peek and notice how awfully upset the majority of the viewers are.Frankly speaking; I don't quite get the animosity! Despite the fact that it severely lacks in multiple critical facets of filmmaking; from my personal standpoint, it had its heart in the right place! I mean, yeah it is certainly an underperformer but also a self-conscious endeavor; that knows better of its bounds and deficiencies. Trust me on this, I have seen worse!Perhaps, the only inarguable silver lining in this entire execution would be the impressive chemistry between Lydia & Emily! Offering us fleeting moments of jollity & tenderness! Doesn't matter what people say; personally, I find both of them to be very capable and extremely talented!Finally, I just wanna say; do not go with any expectations.

35,trinaboice,"Disappointing, dangit!",3,20 April 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Yep, it's been 5 minutes so that means it's time for another superhero movie. But wait, this one is different. The idea behind this Netflix story is decent, but the execution is, sadly, lacking. Melissa McCarthy is married to the writer/director, Ben Falcone, who admitted this was the fastest he had ever written a film...and it shows. He exclaimed that he loves comics and superheroes, so it's a shame that he couldn't spend more time creating an actual decent script. You're going to laugh a couple of times during the action-comedy, but you'll also roll your eyes in the many cringe-worthy moments of this disappointing movie...THINGS I LIKED:
Melissa McCarthy is hilarious and I really love her, but whenever she stars in movies that her husband writes and directs, the films tend to bomb. In this movie, she shines doing her classic physical humor but the script is a big mess.Some have speculated why Academy Award-winning Octavia Spencer would agree to this role; however, she and Melissa McCarthy have been friends in real life for 20 years. I'm assuming she just wanted to try something very different and lend her high-status name to the production. She and Melissa McCarthy also both showcase their daughters in this film. Melissa also featured her daughter, Vivian Falcone, in the movie The Boss.Melissa Leo also won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 2011, but has a very small role in this film.Some of the banter is pretty entertaining.Jason Bateman is always funny, although his character in this film is pretty bizarre. I thought he and Melissa McCarthy were pretty magical together in the movie Identity Thief.I don't think I had ever seen French actress Pom Klementieff without her green makeup and antennae as Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical), (I LOVE that franchise!), so it took me a minute to realize she was the one playing the character Laser.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I had done a trailer reaction for this film a while ago and thought the trailer looked pretty funny with some potential. Of course, knowing a little bit about the film's writer/director made me worry just a bit, so I had my fingers crossed. Unfortunately, my concerns were justified. The film is just completely disappointing on so many levels.You don't need X-ray vision to see what's going to happen next.The villains and their powers are pretty lame.A lot of the humor doesn't land at all and is extremely juvenile. A lot of it is improvisation, which simply didn't work, nor entertain.The character development isn't well defined.The first half of the movie takes way too much time to show us how Melissa McCarthy gets superpowers and we wonder if there is going to be anything more to the schtick. She kind of plays the same character in every movie, so this character just felt worn out much of the time.So much exposition.There are some super-gross moments regarding raw chicken when people eat it. It's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Even worse is that it goes on and on forever. The good news is that the actors were NOT actually eating raw chicken, but a carefully camouflaged Asian pear. Whew! Rumor has it that even knowing it was pieces of Asian pear, the actors still had a hard time eating it in their scenes. Yuck.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!As much as I like Octavia Spencer, she seemed like a real fish out of water in this comedy and, at times, seemed to be phoning in it. At the end of the movie, there is a celebration scene where she just kind of stands there, not even knowing what to do.The movie actually looks low-budget.The special effects are not very good.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Inappropriate sexual innuendos for a PG-13 film.People in perilous situations.Lots of violence
Weapons of various kinds.Some parents will find some of the jokes, situations, and dialogue offensive.",Thunder Force
36,bgar-80932,Watch the trailer,5,11 April 2021,If you saw the trailer that's basically what you got in the movie. It's not very funny and it had the weird thing with Melissa McCarthy and the crab man (Jason bateman) that felt kind of random. It was okay to watch with my wife and my son roaming around which is the only reason we picked it but if you are looking for a good movie and are dissapointed that's kind of on you. It's not even pretending to be a good movie in the trailer so it shouldn't surprise you when it's a stinker.,Thunder Force
37,PyroSikTh,Watched Literally the First Movie We Saw,4,12 April 2021,"The world was struck by solar radiation in the early 80s, resulting in superpowers manifesting worldwide exclusively in the hands of sociopaths. That left the world rampant in supervillains, but without any superheroes to keep them in check. Enter Emily Stanton who lost her parents to a Miscreant attack, and has made it her life's mission to create superheroes to fight back against them. Unfortunately her childhood best friend Lydia has a talent for getting in the way and messing everything up, and ends up accidentally injecting herself with the serum that gives super strength, making her the world's first superhero. And so Thunder Force was born, with Lydia taking the mantle of Hammer, and Emily taking the mantle of Bingo after taking a few pills to turn herself invisible. The plot is absolutely nothing to shout about. Act one; here's Lydia and Emily as they grow up together and grow apart as adults. Act two; Lydia takes the serum and starts her training to be a superhero. Act three; they go and thwart evil Canavale's plans. Credits. There's some vague attempts at plot twists, but they're so painfully predictable I managed to call out every single one super early on.Like almost every other Melissa McCarthy comedy vehicle, this is the Melissa McCarthy show. It's all about her character Lydia as she bursts in and pushes every other supporting character to the sidelines, which is a shame because there's some real acting talent here that ends up wasted on hollow characters. Octavia Spencer is the biggest victim. While she should by all rights be equal partner in the movie, she spends her civilian scenes with a perpetually disappointed expression, and her heroic scenes just standing there waiting for something to do. But she's not alone. The chameleonic Melissa Leo has a few minutes screen time as a senior Stanton employee who acts as their guide, but all she's given is to play the grumpy strict one. Bobby Canavale is a fantastic actor who has a habit of choosing awful movies with shallow roles, and this is no exception. Hey, Bobby, just play the villain as a bumbling yet evil idiot. Sure thing. In fact the only actors who really make much of an impression at all are half-creant Jason Bateman who's constantly Zoidberging out of shot, and the young actresses that somehow manage to perfectly encapsulate McCarthy's typical on-screen personality (which is no surprise considering one of them is McCarthy's actual daughter, so go figure). And then there's Taylor Mosby who gets altogether too much screen time.But to be fair, this is a comedy, so as long as it makes you laugh it's worth watching right? Thunder Force, I'll admit, did give me a few hearty chuckles. It wasn't exactly laugh-a-minute, and the jokes here are not exactly the most high brow around, mostly focussing on McCarthy's ability to ad-lib on the spot, but there are some great moments here. Every time Bateman's Crab hands are on the screen is enough to earn a few laughs, especially the crab-crawling away from fights every time, and while the eating of raw chicken goes on too long and is repeated too often, it also offers some humorous moments. In all, it's just dumb fun. If you're too snobbish for some casual, dumb fun then you won't find this remotely amusing.One thing I think this movie does deserve some kudos for though is representation. The superhero/comic-book community has a hard-on for representation and Thunder Force is some of the best representation you could ask for. Every superhero in this movie is female, with realistic body shapes, and obviously Emily is black to boot. So we've got gender, race, and age covered. Of course the film doesn't exactly play this angle completely seriously, often using McCarthy and Spencer's age and body weight as the butt of a few jokes, but hey, got to start somewhere eh?Other than that, this film feels like it was made for the 90s, with a very outdated viewpoint of superheroes and comic books present from its opening scenes. Other than the level of technology and near-constant references to Fortnite (seriously Mel, stop flossing, you look like a middle-aged woman trying desperately to be cool), you could've told me this movie was twenty-five years old and I'd have believed you. It has more in common with Batman & Robin than more modern superhero affairs, like it was made by Gen-X'ers based on what they think superhero movies are like, and taking the piss out of them. If you want a decent superhero comedy, look almost anywhere else. If you want a decent McCarthy vehicle, Thunder Force will not offer anything different to any other out there. If you want some background noise that might make you laugh every now and then, well have I got the recommendation for you! I give Thunder Force a particularly not-great 4/10. It almost falls into the category of so bad it's good, just enough to be enjoyable enough despite its plot holes, but doesn't quite hit the absolute best of the worst to make that a legitimate assessment. For many, this is just bad.",Thunder Force
38,sweidman-28016,Falcone's Worst Yet!,2,19 April 2021,"""I'll do everything in my power to keep you safe. I'm doing this for my parents, for my city.""Believe it or not, Ben Falcone may have made his worst movie yet. In a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect their city. Thunder Force has Octavia Spencer and (who would've thought) Melissa McCarthy leading this comedic take on superheroes. We all know that his movies aren't meant to be taken too seriously with how silly they are. Nothing about this movie is funny. I didn't laugh once even with the comedic genius that is McCarthy. The movie is so boring. We thought Superintelligence was awful but this is even more intolerable. First off, it's so prolonged to the point where it runs out of ideas. It's so predictable that it gets annoying. I will reiterate that this is not funny at all. There are so many forced moments to make a joke but they're too forced to even get a smirk out. I feel so bad for Octavia Spencer because she is genuinely a great actress and has a fairly good track record. Melissa McCarthy has fallen off the radar shortly after her Oscar nominated performance for Can You Ever Forgive Me? And it's not surprising. She's also finding horrible projects to be attached to, mainly being her husband (Ben Falcone), and gets an even worse reputation. Maybe someday she'll find a glimmer of hope again. I don't like ripping on movies so I'll end it here. A select few might like this. As for me I'll forget about it until I'm reminded of it again at the end of the year.",Thunder Force

40,coreyjdenford,Thunder Farce,4,9 April 2021,"It isn't far into Thunder Force's 107 minute runtime before there's a sudden realisation that director Ben Falcone and partner Melissa McCarthy are a great pairing on other projects, when it comes to their own such 2016s The Boss or Tammy and now this it seems that they have one thing in common - how to bore an audience with flat, unfunny sometimes irrelevant jokes that often go past the time when they were meant to be funny. Yet again Falcone shows that McCarthy can work and can shine given a good co star and her co star here Octavia Spencer they both have a good screen presence but when it comes to vision Falcone is seriously lacking. He took female superheroes, check, it's a superhero comedy, so like Deadpool, and it has interesting ideas, check. But the film is constantly bombarded by daft, sordid and poor punchlines that even the literal punches can't make it better. The film's saving grace is it has competently shot action scenes and it's worth a couple of light chuckles and nothing more than that. On the lighter side this comedy superhero misfire is hardly a crime to cinema - well not a bad one anyway, but the sad truth is that the stars seem to be having a lot more fun than you will. And that just leaves a bad taste in the mouth kind of like uncooked chicken. To be honest we'd rather have uncooked chicken than watch go through this drek again. 2\5.",Thunder Force

Director: Ben Falcone
Starring: Melissa McCarthy, Octavia Spencer, Jason Bateman, Pom Klementieff, Bobby Canavale, Melissa Leo, Tayler Mosby etcOverall rating 31/100Thunder force is about a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect the city. Wow what can I say Thunder force was absolutely terrible and Melissa McCarthy's worst film that she has been in, she really needs to stop working with her husband as she is so talented but is being type casted as the same character each film she is in, let's get started.I will be nice and start with a few positives the movie had a good set up, some good setting up of the story world and the main characters friendship and some good character background. I thought that the movie actually started out pretty decent, it set up the main plot point for the movie well, establishing the story world, the characters and the rise of the miscreants that had me interested. I also thought that they did a good job with giving both main characters good character background and set up their friendship well, the movie spent a good amount of time developing the younger versions of themselves establishing a good connection between them and setting up their reunion when they were older pretty well.Now lets get into some negatives the movie had generic conflict, poorly written break up of friendships, a terrible script and really bad pacing issues. The movies sources of conflict between the two main characters was so generic and lazily written it was really poor, they broke of their friendship for the most pathetic and boring reason and it was just very amateurish writing, there was never really enough conflict for the characters or between the characters that was truly notable. I also thought the script was absolutely terrible, it was poorly and lazily written, with every cliché of the genre imaginable, the dialogue was awkward and clunky and never landed and it was just often very cringy and awkward to watch. I also thought the movie had awful pacing issues, everything felt extremely rushed and it never gave you any time to digest any of the scenes, this made the movie lose its emotion and impact and often was just inconsistent with its entertainment levels.My next few negatives would be the lack of humour the film had, the lazy set up, how predictable it was and the lack of chemistry between the leads. The movie just simply wasn't funny, it was awkward and clunky and the jokes very rarely landed which was such a shame because the cast is funny with good writing, but even their charm and charisma wasn't enough for the movie, the movie simply tried to hard to be funny and it simply achieved the opposite. The movie had simply lazy set up, the whole set up of the powers being introduced with the main characters it was lazily written and predictable and made the characters seem extremely dumb. The movie was also very predictable, it followed every single cliché of the genre possible, I could predict all the plot twists of the movie half an hour before it even happened and did nothing to go against that, it felt like a copy and paste of so many other movies. I also thought that their was a lack of chemistry between the two characters, I love Melissa McCarthy and I love Octavia Spencer but for me they didn't work well together, their comedy is fairly different and both characters were fairly mean and toxic to each other for a lot of the movie and weren't really that likeable.My final few positives would be the good cinematography, some fun sequences of powers, some funny moments and a few fun action sequences. The movie did have fairly decent cinematography in places not in all of the action scenes but sometimes the characters powers actually looked pretty good and they paid attention to detail in parts which was nice to see. I also thought there was some fun sequences highlighting the main characters powers, the montage of Melissa McCarthy training her powers was funny, interesting and one of the few times were the humour actually worked, they also spent a decent amount of time on it as well which I liked. I also thought some of the action sequences were fairly fun, although unrealistic in places they were still for the most part entertaining and some of the best parts of the movie.My next few negatives would be the repetitive plot points, the awkward and corny tone as well as the lack of depth to the main characters and the villains. The movie had some very repetitive plot points, it repeated dialogue that was supposed to be funny multiple times when it just wasn't and then just had recycled and reused plot points sprinkled over the movie making the pacing very clunky, this lead onto my next criticism in that it had a very awkward and corny tone. The movie was simply too awkward, they tried way too hard to be funny and it simply wasn't making it incredibly awkward to watch and just had so many corny lines of dialogue that felt recycled from a cringy 80's movie. I also thought the movie lacked any form of character depth, the characters were on dimensional and cliched and didn't really have any form of development or overall depth, the villains were also terrible, not once did they feel like a threat, they were poorly written given corny dialogue and it was just so cliched and boring it was often painful to watch.My final few negatives would be odd character decisions, lapses in the logic and lack of heartwarming moments of themes. I found that the movie had really odd character decisions, the film was riddled with inconsistencies with its characters, they were often making decisions that simply just didn't make sense or felt forced to move onto the next plot point, it was just filled with lapses in logic that just made the movie come across as ridiculous and lazy. I also thought the movie just lacked any form of heartwarming moments and themes. Any kind of sweet moments were either rushed or just felt too forced and generic, for a good comedy to work usually they have an empowering theme or some good emotion to it that makes you connect with it on a different level and Thunder force was unfortunately missing this quality for me.Overall, Thunder force had some funny and entertaining moments with a somewhat interesting idea that just didn't land. In what was an awkward, predictable, not funny, lazily written mess. And is a complete embarrassing waste of the talented actors involved.

Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer start in this pathetic ""superhero"" version of, what is essentially the same humor as the new Ghostbuster had, but now with added ""action"".Terrible.

48,danybur,A film that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.,5,13 April 2021,"SummaryFailed comedy with Melissa McCarthy and a reluctant Octavia Spencer as two designer superheroes. Some really very funny scenes are half lost, like loose, in a movie that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.ReviewA cosmic radiation turns some human beings into evildoers with certain powers. Years later, a scientist and a childhood friend meet again and by accident end up forming a squad of superheroines who face a candidate for mayor of Chicago.Melisa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone (director and screenwriter) are an artistic duo with several titles to their credit, based on the charisma and undoubted grace of the former.In this case, Thunder Force looks like a collage of two different films that do not finish combining: a sentimental comedy about the reunion of two friends (one successful, the scientist Emily, by Octavia Spencer, and the other not so much, Lydia, played by McCarthy) and a parodic comedy about two obese designer superheroines (close in style to the marvelous Spy, also starring McCarthy but directed by Paul Feig),. It is as if there is an indecision on the part of the director between filming a serious movie about superheroes or a parody about them (a synthesis that Shazam! Can achieve, for example).But the ""serious"" part is quite anodyne and one is left, instead wishing for more funny moments, which there are and a lot. The action scenes and their special effects are also achieved.Contributing to the overall result is the performance of Octavia Spencer, who maintains the same listless register throughout the film, with little chemistry with her coequiper; as if comedy wasn't his thing. On the other hand, the scenes with Jason Batman, which exudes chemistry and grace, are not wasted.",Thunder Force
49,brunovanael,Crapalicious,4,10 April 2021,"I wasn't expecting this film to be hilarious seeing the trailer, but I was expecting... well... something. This wasn't the worst cast. It looked visually OK. There was a woke manager in the script team so obviously some budget. I don't know what went wrong. Was it the woman with superpowers like lasershooting and shopping for haute couture? Was it the villain dropping by to reveal his evil intentions? Was it the tear jearking, vomit inducing finale? This was so lame.",Thunder Force
50,TheVictoriousV,Idiotic; a generic addition to every genre it attempts,3,21 April 2021,"Plus-sized women now get to see themselves in a superhero film, which is good for them but doubly so for the Internet-dwellers who now have another piece of ""progressive propaganda"" to use as a punchline. Thunder Force is one of those films where everyone gets to win.One wonders, however, if the supposed target audience is pleased that fat representation so often entails Amy-Schumerian juvenilia and gross faces. This is probably done to upset fatphobic viewers (especially the misogynists who'd sooner die than accept the simple fact that there exist more body types than ""thin"") but I wouldn't be surprised if someone also took offense at the ""Look how big and gross I am"" routine. Roger Ebert thought Paul Blart was a positive portrayal of fat men, so what do I know?In the movie, Melissa McCarthy (Who else?) and Octavia Spencer star as two childhood friends reunited when the superpowered Miscreants begin to terrorize Chicago more than usual and someone must retaliate. These supervillains have been around since a cosmic-ray blast in the 1980s that somehow only targeted sociopaths, but Spencer's character has discovered a way to imbue the normies and muggles of the city with superpowers.When McCarthy visits, she accidentally gets a dose of Spencer's experimental drug and so becomes strong enough to rival Mr. Incredible, while Spencer has the power of invisibility. As they develop their skills, their main foe becomes the mayoral candidate ""The King"" (Bobby Cannavale), who commands the Miscreants to create anarchy and make the populace vote for him.Of the two leads, McCarthy seems the most comfortable; films of this genre, tone, and level of intelligence are what she's used to (Can You Ever Forgive Me? Being one of the very few exceptions, proving she can find work through other avenues than her writer-director husband). Spencer, meanwhile, has many respectable roles under her belt (ranging from the uncomfortably honest The Help to the fantastical Shape of Water) and her performance creates the sense that she thinks this drivel is beneath her. Consequently, I don't particularly buy their friendship.Like many modern star-driven comedies, there is plenty of improv in-between and during the story checkpoints. Some critics have praised this aspect but when I think of great comedic ad-libbing, I think of George C. Scott falling over in Dr. Strangelove and immediately getting back up, even more energized than before. I don't think of movies like this, where comedians are essentially placed in front of the camera and poked with a stick.The plot itself is so formulated and non-special that it's aggressive. We've seen plenty of buddy films and girl-power superhero flicks go through these very motions before and countless films across cinema use these types of jokes. Did I laugh at anything? Well, I smirked when McCarthy threw a bus into the sky because the effect looked kinda funny to me (even though the bottom of the vehicle was practical and craned above the actress' head). Does that count?I do have a soft spot for Pom Klementieff, who plays one of The King's most formidable underlings. Jason Bateman is fine as Crab Man and I don't doubt that some of the interludes where the actors are just goofing around off-script will make someone out there crack a smile. That's about as positive as I will get today.",Thunder Force
51,namob-43673,It is not even funny to watch this burn,2,10 April 2021,"Some movies are made for ridicule, others to laugh at, and some, like this turd, are so awful that you only feel numb.I mean there was a time when Melissa McCarthy was a guarantee for a chuckle while you did shots to her bad dialogue, shots to her bad acting, and horrible attempts to be funny. Apparently we cannot even have that anymore, her movies are getting so bad they are not even c-level.You want to waste your money, create a urine soaked dumpster of a movie while people are laughing behind your back? Hire Melissa McCarthy.I know she can be funny, I actually enjoyed Spy, but something has just gone wrong along the way and I am uncertain if its her own bad taste in scripts or Hollywood just trying to force us this overweight feminist whether she is in good or bad movies.Well, one of the leads aside, she is not the only thing that stinks around this movie. Octavia is almost as bad, and all the side characters and the supposed protagonist are so bad it is not even funny.But of course, as with most bad movies, it does not stop with bad acting or bad writing or bad casting choices, nope, it all suck. Light, CGi, music, clothes, story, every single bit and piece of this movie is so horrible I kept shaking my head and wondering if I have ever seen anything worse.I have by the way, seen worse that is.

60,fleck05-485-208981,McCarthy Needs Better Material,3,9 April 2021,"Ugh. The bad reviews are pretty spot on. Then I was looking at viewer scores on IMDB and I have to wonder why studios still let Melissa McCarthy's husband, Ben Falcone, write for her?These are the movies Falcone wrote for his wife to star in, followed by their current IMDB scores from the viewers:1. Thunder Force - 4.3
2. Tammy - 4.9
3. The Boss - 5.4
4. Life of the Party - 5.6When you look on IMDb and a writer has dozens of acting credits, and only a few writing credits, be prepared for a mediocre movie. Most great writers spend many years and thousands of hours focused on writing to be great. If the bulk of your time and effort go into acting the acting will get better, but the writing won't.Another example, ""The Happytime Murders,"" with an IMDB viewer score of 5.4. It stars McCarthy and was written by Todd Berger - again, a guy with way more acting credits than writing credits. I'm sure his writing is adequate for Kung Fu Panda and The Smurfs, but someone thought he'd be a good choice to write a Melissa McCarthy movie?Now, here are four movies starring McCarthy that were not written by her husband or a Smurf's staff writer.Title, IMDB viewer rating, and name of the writer(s):1. The Heat - 6.6 Katie Dippold
2. The Spy - 7.0 Paul Feig
3. Can You Ever Forgive Me? - 7.1 Nicole Holofcener & Jeff Whitty
4. St. Vincent - 7.2 Theodore Melfi (This McCarthy & Bill Murray movie is a low budget gem and worth a watch if you missed it.)The writing in these movies are on par with McCarthy's talent. Ben's writing ability is far below what his wife is capable of doing, but if a studio wants her they probably have to take him.Not that Ben's the first husband to ride his wife's coat tails to success. Sonny did it with Cher in the 70's, Tom Arnold did it with Roseanne in the 80's, and now Ben's had writing opportunities for studios he'd have never gotten on his own. It's a tale as old as time (or at least the 70's).I wonder if this latest stinker will convince the studios to use better writers? 😂 Or maybe they'll green light Thunder Force 2 with Falcone at the helm again.

I've only ever seen Octavia in serious roles, and maybe that's where she belongs. An immediate thought was, ""Why wasn't this Maya Rudolph?"" Kirsten Wiig made sense, Monique, Tiffany Haddish - would have been great except the age difference. It would be like if they used Merle Streep in Heat instead of Sandra Bullock. Two funny women bantering back and forth could have at least made the weak script more palatable.The script I've seen a million times, and, like, 1/3 of the film is them training to be superheroes. I mean, it just kept going on, and on, and on. Training is a 5-10 minute montage of scenes, tops. And, now that I think of it, there was no plot, simply cause and effect.I'm not sure how the script got approved. My friend is producing a show there and hers sounds so micromanaged, which makes me wonder how Thunder Force got such a loosey goosey production. Maybe they bought it with a simple pitch, realized once the product was delivered, knew it was going to tank and just sort of squeezed it out? I don't know. It's a shame.

This film doesn't have that formula. The reviews that say 10/10 should be required to answer a real ""why"" question in order to be visible by others.My ""why"" for a 2/10: falls flat on many scenes that could have been funny if the right lead was cast. McCarthy as a dumb but strong character paired with a woman that seems to lack any and all comic ability definitely delivers as is. That is- it doesn't. Spencer is a great actress. We have seen her delivery in dramas. It makes no sense in this case when really all we needed as a humorous lead allowing McCarthy to be the comic relief she's good at as a supporting character or one that can be trashed and get laughs.A quick search for ""Spy"" is a good resume for McCarthy's success.

Her talents doesn't work by itself though. They require a capable comedy director to shape and mold her performance onscreen in context to the story at hand.While Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy do make an interesting pairing as onscreen friends, there's no comedic energy crackling between them at all. Spencer plays her role too straight as if she was in a completely different dramatic movie and is never given the opportunity to fire back and comedically banter with McCarthy.Ben Falcone, Melissa McCarthy's husband who previously directed her in the mediocre Life of the Party and The Boss, is no Paul Feig. Feig knows how to fish for jokes on set through improvisation and has the discipline to chisel them down in the editing room. He knows how to time a joke and kept a comedic energy bouncing along between the scenes while moving the story forward.There are immense gaps of boredom in Thunder Force. The story takes a long time to get set up and drones on from the middle onward. Occasionally, a gag will come. Funny or not, it is not enough to bring the energy back up. We are just slowly moving forward through the plot beats.As a parody, the script does not have a clear goal what exactly it wants to poke fun at with the superhero genre. Is the notion of superpowers ridiculous? Or is it having so much power? Are we watching what Melissa McCarthy would do with superpowers? The film does not know.It's just not funny enough. Skip this one.",Thunder Force

In some scenes I have the impression that she herself is surprised at the nonsense she has to say and do. And Melissa McCarthy? Well, there's not much new to report. Over 50 % of the jokes don't land, the other 50 % consist almost exclusively of unpleasant remarks about bodily fluids or the sounds thereof. The whole idea of the film is childish, but could have been delightfully silly. Unfortunately, it isn't. Everything is totally screwed up.",Thunder Force

This is what I was hoping for with Thunder Force (2021), but what I watched was more cringe worthy.Initially I felt the film had some potential but this changed the moment Melissa McCarthy character goes to meet Emily Stanton for the first time in her company building. From here on in it was a borefest, leaving me to stop it twice in the hope time away might help my view about it.It's a light hearted film but it doesn't bring anything new to the table and perhaps more importantly, it just doesn't tickle the funny bones.

Sympathy jobs. Then I looked at the list of bad films he has put out in the past. Yup. Chalk another one up. I will be sure to check the director next time before I watch a McCarthy film.Octavia Spenser looked awkward and out of place, like she couldn't understand how she got in this film and she just wanted to flee. I kept thinking 'what is wrong here? I have never seen an off performance by her before.' Now I know.I usually complain about too many cutty-choppy fast paced scenes in movies these days but this one went in the opposite direction; every scene seemed bloated and empty. You can see McCarthy trying to carry the weight of this piece of trash on her shoulders while the director slashes and burns every bit of comic timing she puts out.Just bad timing, bad writing, bad film.",Thunder Force

That's long gone. Since Ben Falcone took over and writes and directs all her movies, and he is an extremely untalented individual, we are now seeing a new Melissa McCarthy.

Maybe the effects suddenly became better than what a typical 12-year-old could produce with a laptop, and the writing suddenly rose from the bottom of the barrel and became profound and intelligent. It could even be that Melissa McCarthy's performance improved to the semi-professional level she showed in ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" or even to the lesser level of ""Bridesmaids,"" and Octavia Spencer finally lost the well-deserved look of embarrassment she carried for the first hour or so.I'll never know. Heaven knows I tried to keep a brave face and hope for some improvement (and I bet I watched more of this movie than most people have, including the cast of it) but after an hour I just couldn't subject myself to any more. The only reason I watched as long as I did -- the ONLY REASON-- is that it was my turn to pick the movie, and I couldn't stand to see the smug look my wife would have when I threw in the towel. As it turns out, she was so grateful she never said a word, beyond ""Oh thank God"" when I said we had to find something else.Looks like I owe her another viewing of ""Mama Mia."" I can take it.

I was uncomfortable the entire time-- there were a couple of instances where the jokes landed so well and I thought ""Oh, this is a good sign"" but then the next scene the same joke was played out in a different way but worse because we just saw the joke played out five minutes prior. This happened so many times-- too many. McCarthy... you starred in ""The Heat"" and ""Spy""... you're better than this. Nothing but fart and fat jokes-- shamelessly and tastelessly executed. There was no chemistry between Spencer and McCarthy either. Spencer and Bateman, you're also better than this, but insultingly. I don't know what possessed them to take a role in this farce. I was uncomfortable at first and then I became numb and then I ended up laughing at how horribly fast everything plummeted. Waste of time and resources.

Then two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them both powers to protect the city. Ben Falcone should stop making movies for his wife Melissa McCarthy. This whole experience is so humorless that it was seemingly written by a 13-year old, who hates everything funny. Even McCarthy herself is hardly trying here and that is saying a lot about the whole production. Yes, it looks very good, but it has almost no substance whatsoever.

However I have to say I kind of enjoyed the innocence and sweetness of the movie.After the so anticipated Jack Snyder's Justice League directors cut, which I found strangely unsatisfying, Thunder Force is simple. It is kinda yummy hot dog, when other superhero movies are lobsters, which are often overcooked, or just simply screwed up.I have to say - it is not a movie theater film - and I would have been upset, to spend hard earned cash on a story like that.

This genuinely has a shot of being the worst movie of the year. It's a lot of things, but not good. If I have to name some positives, the chemistry between Spencer and McCarthy is sweet and makes their scenes at least watchable. The actors in general give solid performances and make the best out of a horrible script. It's just so sad to see great actors like McCarthy, Spencer and Bateman be in such an awful movie, because they are fantastic actors. Everything except the acting performances, is bad. The dialogue is so dreadfully bad, that there are scenes that are just unwatchable. The Taser felt like a non-playable character in a video game that just shouts the same ten lines over and over again. The script in general is just not good at all. There are scenes where am just wondering: ""What the hell is the director thinking?"" I don't want to watch Melissa McCarthy stuff raw chicken in her mouth. It made me want to trow up honestly. But I can put all that aside, if it is funny, because it's comedy after all. But the jokes are so generic and recycled, that I could probably go the nearest comedy club and watch some dude tell dad jokes, because those are more original. I just feel bad for the great actors that can do so much better, because this will leave a big stain on their careers, except McCarthy, who just needs to stop working with her husband.",Thunder Force

When I was a kid the 'Ghostbusters' movie was in! We never had all the things kids enjoy today.So yes please remember this is A KIDS MOVIE!There are a few cliches in the storyline, but the movie is based around friendship and acceptance for one and another. If you think that showing that you don't need to be thin and look like a waif model to be successful and a superhero then your missing the point!I thought the characters did have some funny lines and I kinda enjoyed a few silly moments in this movie, and I watched the whole movie. I probably didn't need to LOLIt's hard to please these days but you could watch this on TV with your 8 year old and not worry. However, generally Thunder Force is rated PG-13 and only because they they chose to imply strong language.Just to note;
The movie 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them', which is classified as age 12, shows graphic child abuse as well as violent deaths. Victims are shown in great detail as ashy grey corpses.At the end of the day 'Thunder Force' offers the message that superheroes can come in all shapes, sizes, educational levels, and genders -- and that honesty and integrity win out over lying, cheating, and scaring or hurting people.",Thunder Force

While there is a certain type of people, including myself, that can't wait to comment on this film, there are a great many others that are simply watching it again to laugh their faces off.As for me, a writer who considers herself a blend of both types, I appreciate this film. Although Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy are highly entertaining and incredibly convincing as the characters they play, what I adore even more is how this film boldly differentiates between a person being smart or nerdy, how it glorifies women in the science field, and how it emphasizes the importance of balance in a person's life. Add on the diversity of this film beyond black and white but of age and the cultural appearances of its minor characters, and what I mostly see when watching this film is it silently breaking down stereotypes in the minds of its viewers. All the while, this film is obviously designed not to take itself so seriously, as we (viewers) also should not. What we should do is just laugh when watching this film, especially at Jason Bateman crab-walking out of a scene. Now that was just hilarious!",Thunder Force

Unfortunately whatever has made these ladies friends for the past twenty years does nothing for their chemistry in this film. The script struggles, the premise is barely a good start. Two women, who are over forty years old, become superheroes. Spencer's character is so one dimensional it hurts to watch this. McCarthy plays a lot of the same jokes she has played in other films yet again. They threw in a daughter for Spencer and it's an embarrassment for the young actress playing the part. What works in this film? Bobby Cannavale has some funny bits with his staff and Justin Bateman plays up his character well opposite McCarthy. It is a real shame that this is a women's movie but the female characters are the worst developed.

They don't.Special effects are pretty good.Around the halfway point I realised it wasn't going to go anywhere and I started to get bored.For me, the big saving grace and the reason for my 5 star rating is Jason Bateman.

Don't watch,6,10 April 2021,"First of all I understand that this generation isn't happy unless they're complaining about something but if I may critique movie reviews for a second "" worst movie ever"" and ""absolute trash"" is not a review of the movie. Granted I know this generation also can't stand to write or read anything longer than a Tweet I still think you can take the time to say what you did not like about the film. The movie is cheesy but I found it to be almost a parody of the superhero genre mixed with the usual corky style of Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy. So many reviews are saying how much his movies suck and how unfunny Melissa is which begs the question why are you watching the movie? I. E I can't stand Tracy Morgan and I'm not going to subject myself to a movie with him in it. Reminds me of all the people that complain about Kristen Stewart and Amy Schumer's acting yet choose to watch their films anyway. I digress. I do agree with most people saying that the first part of the film when they're growing up together is better. Having said that unfortunately I think the worst part of this film is Octavia Spencer. She's a fine actress but has never really had a leading role in a comedy before and she's not very good at comedy. Much like in the movie Like a boss the chemistry is weak and one of the actresses had to carry the film. Then it was Tiffany Haddish and in this film it is Melissa carrying the movie. I think bigger energy was required for Octavia Spencer's part and ironically enough I think Tiffany Haddish would've been a good cast. Not to mention it would've been funny to see her play a smart nerd. A certain sense of humor is required for the crab/man character that Jason Bateman plays and I guess I have that sense of humor. I thought the scenes with him in it were so over-the-top they were funny much like how a dog can be so ugly it's cute. I actually think there should have been more animal/people hybrids in the movie to make his character more legit. I don't think it's their best movie but it was still entertaining and consistent with their other work. Kind of just feels like once something is popular to hate then everyone hates it.

Octavia Spencer is somewhat better but from start to finish seems to be well out of her comfort zone, I had the sense that she really didn't enjoy making this film at all.The supporting cast are frankly ridiculous, no more so than Jason Bateman who plays a human-crab hybrid, and didn't seem to be able to take his role even remotely seriously.Overall ""Thunder Force"" has an interesting premise, but it wastes its potential and ends up coming across as stupid and immature, what a waste!",Thunder Force

232,richard_stiles,Lol,10,10 April 2021,"Funniest movie I've seen all day XD.Hi, how are you?Lol. This movie is funny. Goofy funny. Me's'n no usually liken a goofy funny, maybe because it's usually done pretentiously, but this goofiness is sincere. Maybe. Hopefully. Maybe because instead of being made by easily amused folks trying to make themselves laugh like peekaboo makes babies laugh, it's made by people who have also bored of that, and went past it, looking for new amusements on that path.Or maybe revisiting how we used to be. I remember when the closet was a thing, a lot of ambiguously gay comedians built their entire act around beating around the bush about how gay they might or might not be. Individual opinions vary, but societally, that was part of our culture. I only speak for the era I was actually alive during, but, it wasn't illegal, and it was edgy, it was great, people enjoyed the humor, even if they didn't partake in the activity, and maybe it was kind of disarming to the people who didn't approve of the activity. But you know, when people got overly sensitive, offended and preachy about it, that swings the pendulum on the other side, and it's not funny anymore, it's just something to be hostile about. Preaching belongs behind a pulpit, so we can, you know, we can make sure to not go there and subject ourselves to it. But when the preaching is in a movie, that brings the fight to us, and we weren't trying to fight, we were just trying to watch a movie. Point is, there's a gay joke in this movie. More of a gag, really, with jokes around it. Not pushy or pully, it's just there, being what it is. Which makes me think that maybe people are starting to calm down about that. That's good. Great. I'd like to see funny be funny and jokes be jokes, and let movies be movies again, like it used to be.The Crab-Man is hilarious, lol. Mallory Keaton's brother with pincers, lol. XD.",Thunder Force

He's embarrassing his wife and making her look just silly and pathetic. She's obviously talented but making these dumb movies with her husband is killing her career whether she knows it or not.

Most films that Melissa McCarthy has been in have failed. Octavia Spencer was seriously miscast in Thunder Force and apparently was in need of a paycheck to entice her to appear in such a disjointed film. And, what was Jason Bateman thinking? McCarthy can be excused somewhat for supporting her husband, Ben Falcone, in his lackluster effort as Director and Writer. Taylor Mosby, playing Spencer's daughter, was the only highlight in the movie, hence the ""mildly entertaining."" McCarthy was good in Bridesmaids and The Heat but otherwise her films have been disappointing. Her supporting role in Gilmore Girls and her lead in Mike and Molly were exceptional. Possibly a return to a tv series could resurrect her shaky career in movies.",Thunder Force

I mean the suit stank was old the second time it was mentioned but hammering at it for five or so times throughout the flick I mean come on!With films like these one can moan about having an hour and 45 minutes taken out of your life, and never getting it back again and if one cannot squeeze the occasional giggle out of them...look on the bright side, the next movie you see may well be a steaming pile but having watched this it won't seem so bad.",Thunder Force

Unfortunately, thanks to what feels like a rush-job with some actor-director nepotism thrown in, it's not even Shazam. I'll give it a 6 for originality and potential and a 4 for execution. That's about a 5. And I'll take away a point for wasting the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. (And for wasting Pom Klementieff who should spend the rest of her life playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy where she positively scintillates!) So 4 / 4.5 out of 10 feels about right.

I'm a Melissa McCarthy fan, but even for me a lot of her movies try too hard for jokes that don't land-this movie, however, tried just enough and landed each time. You couldn't ask for a better co-star than Octavia Spencer,but I wish she had more fun with it, hence the star deduction. I watched it for the first time with my 60 yr old mother and we both really enjoyed it, and it went on our short list of we-are-happy-to-watch-repeatedly list.

It's a bit too long for the genre but has a funny vibe throughout and unexpected funny moments. People giving low reviews clearly don't understand sarcasm and irony.

There are movies that you think they would be funny and then they're not (Identity Thief), there are movies that you don't think they'd be funny and then they are (Spy, The Heat, Ghostbusters). And then there are the movies that you don't think they'd be funny, but because you've been there and eventually found them funny, you end up watching it, and then you find it is not funny at all. Thunder Force belongs to the latter one.Spencer and McCarthy don't have chemistry as soromance/BFF, the acting direction does not exist in this movie, the story is kind of lame and weak, powerless. The directing is as standard as any mid-budget fantastic flick, with the same shots, the same camera movements, the same editing, the same CGIs, the same whatever.I honestly thought that most of the people would be wrong about the negative reviews, but after watching Thunder Force, all I can say is that don't waste a couple of hours of your time by watching this flawed comedy.",Thunder Force

Could have been a thousand times better but let's face is Melissa McCarthy is not the greatest actress. The best she can try for is comedy and that is barely within her limited acting reach.As for the movie itself, the plot is all over the place, the attempts at humour are beyond forced and miss the mark every time.Watching this movie was painful. In an age of Marvel's Avengers and Justice League, this one should never have gotten off the draft board.",Thunder Force
302,sevenjetc,Don't bother watching it,3,11 April 2021,I thought maybe the movie had low ratings because of people automatically downvoting female lead movies. But no. It deserves the low ratings.

304,tefen,Only Value is Jason Bateman's Scenes.,6,10 April 2021,"I have at least somewhat enjoyed all of Mellissa's other movies even though some have been rather lacking in quality and comedy. However, this one was very low quality. The only decent scenes were the ones with Jason Bateman and they were only of Skit Show quality, not movie quality. Even Melissa had not much for any funny moments in the movie outside of the Bateman scenes. The worst acting and most uncomfortable moments were from Oliva's acting which was incredible slow, awkward and out of place. She sounded, acted, and moved like a slow elderly person. We are supposed to believe that she is super smart yet she talks like she is mentally slow and 1/2 out of it. I am guessing that might have been intended due to the intended comedy of things being ridiculous like Bateman being a crab man. One of the worst parts of the movie is that it doesn't keep a persistent tone or atmosphere and jumps all over the place. Also horrible is the random drawn out boring jokes that is the type of stuff normally cut from movies and maybe seen in deleted scenes or outtakes.Overall somewhat disappointed although I was not expecting much from what I saw in the previews.",Thunder Force

Given the talent in the cast it serves as proof that if they're working with rubbish, there's not a lot their talent can do to salvage it. The script is weak, the plotline is thin and McCarthy needs reining in or she needs some new tricks. That Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman got suckered into this defies understanding. Having just watched Bateman in ""This is where I leave you"", this was embarrassing. If you want a sideways take on superheroes just go back to Hancock or Deadpool - something with a bit of intelligence in it.Just throwing a load of CGI at something doesn't make a good film.It's for hard-core McCarthy fans only.",Thunder Force

I think those reviews are hyperbole in a SLAM culture.This is far from a favorite comedy but it is a comedy! A silly one at that! If you like Melissa McCarthy then you will like this movie. It's her comedic style that I love and here she is doing what she does.Are there problems with it, yes, but I was entertained by it.

We enjoyed it from beginning to end. Melissa McCarthy is her usual silly self, providing physical comedy and a nervous weirdness. I liked Octavia's character - a weird kid in school who makes it good in the world and invents interesting remedies for the world (and her own family). The two girls are best friends in K-12 but then lose touch in adulthood. When they get back together they become (through a series of unlikely coincidences) a superhero team.There are lots of laughs and pretty good pacing. We've mostly become bored with the regular superhero arc but this was very different.So --- why is my review polar opposite to almost every other review here (587 by my count at this moment)? What is going on? It is a Russian mafia reviewer swarm? If so, to what end, Vlad? Are you planning to open Hollywoodgrad?And why are so many reviewers worried about who Melissa is married to and why he directs this movie? I read a snarky review on Slate that dwelled on this point, and now I read multiple reviews here worried about the same fact. Weird. Who cares??It is too bad because people might think that this movie is terrible based on its many bad ""wish I could give it a zero"" reviews. But they shouldn't think that. It is a lot of fun.

Melissa did her best, Bateman was entertaining, and Pom Klementieff stood out as having the most gusto for her role.

The story could have been interesting, showing a different point of view by mature adult women, who have zero interest in proving anything to anybody anymore, or just realizing their true power, something... But this just looks like a vanity project, or friends
making a ""fun"" movie to spend time with eachother, what a waste of CGI, if a movie has no good writing and relies on ""fart jokes"". Octavia Spencer just looks checked out for the entire movie, which is such a shame since she actually is a brilliant actress. There is so much missing here, and I really wanted to like this.

The film is good for the first half hour, after that it's like they ad libbed most of the lines and it became unbearable to watch. Its predictable, slow moving and in the end I had it as background noise. Sorry Melissa, this was a miss for me.

The background story is that the mayor of Chicago is running for re-election (he's the ""Trump"" character) and the ""progressive"" Hispanic woman is moving up in the polls. So this guy gets all the mutants to cause chaos so he has a problem to fix. Think of the mutants (miscreants) as BLM and antifa. Only problem is that they got it all backwards. But that is the MO of the left - accuse your opponent of doing what you're actually doing. If they made the crazy mayor the ""amazing progressive"" and the underdog opponent the grassroots conservative who actually cares about making the city better instead of filling diversity quotas, destroying the economy, and stoking division, then the story would have been true to reality. They certainly took their artistic liberties here.The funniest part of the whole thing is that they accidentally showed that if you work hard, you can achieve anything no matter where you came from or what you look like. Whoops, that was an unfortunate oversight. Guess the poor, silly, slobby one just forgot to utilize her ""privilege"" and Spencer just had some magical ability to overcome the ""institutional"" obstacles standing in her way.

Way too many really old references that really aren't going to be appreciated by anybody under the age of 40 to 45.I don't want to ruin the movie but when I got to the end it was just silly, the way things played out made no sense. Anyone with half a brain would do things differently, and it just feels like yet another cheap effort to add weight to what is transpiring. This is going to hold this one back and get a lot of bad reviews because a lot of people aren't going to understand the jokes that are being made.Howeverr, I hope they give us another go and take some of the criticism and make a better sequel!In the end though I would say give this a watch.

The story line was good. The actors great. The comedy great. If it could have gotten a 10, it would have needed a little bit of drama that was less comedic for me. It's like I know it's a comedy, but it's also about super villains. Both of these actresses have played roles before that combined drama and comedy very well before with even a dark twist here and there. They totally could have pulled it off here with a little scripting. Would not have to be an edge of seat nail bitter, but everyone in this film could have pulled off this story line of it went into a more challenging level.

Even as a buddy super hero story, the concept is new and should've been a lot of fun. Instead the jokes are flat, the story is too forced to feel like you care about the characters, and ultimately just not entertaining.A few moments scattered in the film do come together, but they're few and far between.

During the first third of the movie, characters are seen standing 10 feet apart from each other for entire scenes, including a reunion moment when the main characters are supposed to be seeing each other for the first time in 20 years. Lack of physical interaction / touching is also pretty noticable. I can commend the cast and crew for trying to get work done in the midst of a pandemic, but unfortunately the script itself is ultra lacking.The characters are one dimensional, and two of the main villains have a severe lack of motive and seem to both just have an inexplicable fetish for ""killing people."" What an innovative concept for a baddie. Meanwhile, Michelle McCarthy is using super strength to fight off bad guys while Octavia Spencer turns invisible and hides...she does almost nothing the entire movie. Neither does Jason Bateman, whom I love, but whose super power is...crab arms? And he participates in fights by literally...clipping his claws and sideways crab-walking away? And he somehow used this talent to make it into the elite inner circle of the bad guys?Aside from a few laughable moments, most of the script and comedy was gimmicky and predictable. I felt like I was reading the first draft of a script (which again, maybe was because it was all they could do to get content made during COVID, but unfortunately...it's a bit of a fail.)

517,sccdynamic,Wow these reviews are harsh,6,16 April 2021,Its was a fun watch for me. A lot of funny lines and great humor. The people that hate this movie must be really boring in life. It's worth watching.,Thunder Force
518,honourablerogue,Hit and miss in places but mostly positive,7,26 April 2021,"Now I've loved Melissa McCarthy since she was in Gilmore Girls but she does have a habit of falling back on 7 year old level humour of being just outright gross (could be the writers I don't know 🤷‍♂️). Sadly in places this is still the case with Thunderforce. That being said, despite McCarthy's lapses into playground humour and one character who was just so ridiculous that even the amazing. Jason Bateman couldn't bring any real substance to, it was a good fun film, it's not a raucous laugh a minute superhero parody but instead a superhero movie with good comedy cues. The bad guys are, for the most part, well written antagonists, a pretty obvious twist and well paced action and heartfelt scenes!",Thunder Force
519,simaltongo,It was so funnyy!!,6,9 April 2021,"Okay, I admit it might not be very very good but I had a lot of fun watching. Spencer and McCharty are two of my favorite actresses, and they have been such a fun crew. Although almost all of Melissa's movies are nonsense, she manages to make me laugh every time and I love her genuine sincerity. It was a geek movie full of easter eggs. Titans, West Side Story, Slayers...I really enjoyed watching. I guess it would be a good choice for a chill out and a fun weekend.",Thunder Force

I literally laughed twice in the whole movie. Maybe preteens might enjoy it but very little fare for adults here, not enough super hero action and almost zero comedy content. Quite disappointing. Would not recommend.",Thunder Force

524,mepawlewicz,Absolutely garbage script,1,28 April 2021,"I've never seen such obvious exposition writing before in my life. The first (and only) 20 minutes I watched just slowly out loud explain such obvious things that I felt like either the writer is dumb or thought their audience was. ""I haven't talked to her in 20 years"" there was absolutely no reason to state this out loud to the diner owner nor the audience. We got that. I couldn't even make it to the part where their superheroes.You can really tell poor Octavia Spencer knows how bad the script is and is trying her best but obviously doesn't care.",Thunder Force

528,mandyjwebb,What were you thinking?,1,12 April 2021,"I have followed Melissa's career with interest and found several of her films wildly entertaining, especially Spy. However, this concoction is so very, very disappointing. Firstly the jokes are stretched out way beyond their humour and the chemistry is totally missing between Melissa and Octavia's characters. It's as if she signed up to the film, before reading the script ('cause it had Melissa in it of course, why wouldn't you!?) and later regretted the decision, but it was too late to say no.This could have been so much better, the acting, jokes, direction and so on. The only person (character) who I felt close to genuine was the actress playing the daughter of Octavia's character.

536,Gincairn,I didn't hate it,6,11 April 2021,"While not the best effects, writing or plot I got pretty much what I expected out of this, a film that made me laugh a few times while waiting for the inevitable ""Good Triumphs Over Evil"" ending.So, it had a few moments that made me laugh, but what else? Well, that's where it falls a bit flat, what we're left with is some dodgy dialogue, a very thinly veiled plot and some irritating characters to string it all together, a lot of the jokes didn't really land for me, we get it, fat people are hilarious! Let's all laugh at them because if we picked on any other attribute it could be seen as offensive or bullying, but those fat people? Hell, they've got thick skin right? Right?PCNonsense aside, this film felt like an attempt at an origin movie for a set of heroes, but it didn't really give them any outstanding enemies to fight, they made a big thing about how dangerous one character is and then pretty much take that away in another scene, so the whole film felt like it was trying to set something up, but nothing really landed.However I obviously didn't hate it or else the score wouldn't be so high, it is, a middle of the road movie, something to put on when you have nothing else to do and just want some background noise, I couldn't rate it lower because I've seen much worse, couldn't rate it higher because I've seen much better, it's a so-so, watch once then forget it kind of a film.Jason Bateman was ok, not on his best, Octavia Spencer was ok, not at her best, Melissa McCarthy was . . . You get where I'm going with this by now right?They've all done bigger and better things, but there's worse out there too, I don't think the movie deserves all of the 1 star reviews, because that implies it is quite literally the worst thing out there, the downside is too many are only willing to go with a 1 or a 10 and not meet the middle ground, this was a 5, could be better, could be worse.It had some ok running gags in there that actually worked, some that didn't, and the ones that did, actually kinda made up for the failures.Not sure I'd watch it again, but oddly, I'd probably watch a sequel just to see if they managed to improve.",Thunder Force

In fact I am shocked Octavia did such a horrible movie. As a person who is not a size zero. I am getting a little upset on how Melissa McCarthy portrays women of size. It's embarrassing. She mostly portrays as uncouth and gross sense of humor. While I don't usually care about swearing she just does it in times it's not called for. Even if you weren't raised in the best situation her character was around others with manners (for the love of god) pickup so social cures. I did like how the story started out with the girls young.

Of course, it is important to represent such issues, but i believe a movie should make it seem more natural, less forced, not the way they tried with this movie. Another problem i had was with the Emily actress. I'm not saying she's bad at her job, but she looks too old to be portraying a character who's in their 30s/40s. The villains were predictable and generic, especially the female one, who i don't remember the name. They tried to make the main villain, who i also don't remember the name, have a goal, a reason to be attacking the city, but still wasn't convincing.

I am ok with super hero comedies since it can parody the somewhat serious at times versions of these movies we have now. I also go in with a different mindset when it is a comedy. In spite of that, there are some ridiculously silly (stupid) scenes in this movie that are only saved a little bit by some of the what I found legitimately funny. This movie is hard to rate for me when considering other people since this movie's appeal will be highly subjective. If you are picky and serious about your movie watching this movie is likely around a 2, it you are casual and open minded to just enjoy what is presented then a 4.5. So why the 5? The extra .5 rating is because I like Melissa McCarthy, Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman (in spite of his character being one of the stupid elements but I also get a kick out of it because I know the character was written specifically for Melissa and her husband's own amusement in having Jason wear the prosthetics in the movie, he did not know about them until filming began, lol). So ultimately watch this movie at your own risk. I'm ok with it. Got a few giggles and that's about it.",Thunder Force
598,kevhazel33,Super zero,2,7 July 2021,One of the worst super hero movies of all time. Let's take a lady that just played a sweet old grandma and try to make her an action hero with zero athletic ability. McCarthy at least look she could move. Octavia struggled to just get up in several of the scenes. Get in some sort of shape before doing an action comedy.

Some could even argue one of Melissa's worst movies. However, I still think there's a decent plot line here and enough to keep you watching until the end. We aren't talking the greatest chemistry but it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be in these reviews. I think people need to keep their day jobs because reviewing movies is not for you. 1s and 3s should be reserved for much worse tripe. Believe me I have seen far worse.

680,djjongill,Eating raw chicken IS gross...but it's funny too!,8,11 April 2021,"It's funny 'cause you know it's not real chicken, but McCarthy goes out of her way to sell it! My favorite part is when she's trying to sign off from the vid call and she's like 'well it's just you and me, I guess' and drops the chicken down into her mouth from over her head. And Octavia and her daughter are still watching like 'OMG, please end this call'Yah, my sights were set super low due to all the bad reviews on YouTube and IMDB and that may have helped in my enjoyment of the film. Not a constant 'knee slapper', but I don't think it was meant to be. McCarthy and Spencer play well off each other and I believed their friendship as well as the minor tensions that develop prior to the third act. The supporting cast worked for me too; Cannavale was an intimidating creep, Laser, that baddy you wanted to see get her come-up-ins, and of course Bateman's Crab guy. Bateman 'doing Bateman' with his subtle quips and comments. I cracked up every time he scuttled off screen when fights started - how he ends up having a thing for raw chicken too -just ridiculous!All in all a good time was had. It's definitely more of an action comedy/super hero movie more than a straight up comedy. McCarthy and director/husband Falcone collabs offer their own brand of entertainment; much like, say, an Adam Sandler or Will Ferrel effort might. And like Sandler and Ferrel, they don't always hit the mark. Thunder Force sticks the landing and delivers an often funny action movie steeped in the 'super-hero' origin story trope. Those looking for anything else will be left with a bad 'taste' in their mouths. Like a raw chicken taste:) Go Thunder Force!",Thunder Force

713,ludocalvetti,A Disappointment,4,13 April 2021,"I'll admit, I went in expecting a terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame to get viewers. The first ten or so minutes seemed to prove me wrong: the child McCarthy and Spencer's friendship was cute, and I even give the writers props for avoiding the whole ""bully turned into smart kid's friend"" trope. Then they quickly age up the characters (which, okay, I didn't sign up for a teenage story anyway) and they become estranged (fine, I've fought over much stupider stuff with my friends), all with very little humour, and none of it stupid. Was the film targeted wrong? Is this a semi serious superhero movie, and not a comedy with a superhero veneer?When McCarthy herself finally shows up, the film initially keeps the half serious tone, and paints a fairly depressing picture of a world where supervillains (albeit petty ones) exist without superheroes to fight them. They kept showing small acts of kindness on McCarthy's part, which all supported the idea she would make a great hero (a-la Steve Rogers being a hero even without his powers). I even appreciated McCarthy's nonsensical dialogue with Kevin Dunn's character, taking for granted that it wasn't supposed to be ""ha ha"" funny, and sounded like rambling in universe as well.Maybe I shouldn't have. Maybe that was supposed to be a laugh out loud bit, that simple did not land. Because from the reunion onwards, the film decides it clearly does not care about the tone it was setting, and becomes just another terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame. It just took some time to pretend it wasn't.What follows is just another superhero spoof, with a little heart here and there (I'll admit McCarthy was sweet as Taylor Mosby's sort of aunt), but otherwise nothing to say. It feels more like a collection of unrelated SNL skits, held together by spit and the pure comedic power of raw chicken eating. The villains are goofy, and not in a good way, the plot is as predictable as they come, the ""twists"" are as predictable as the plot, and overall it looks like Ben Falcone wrote half a script and then didn't bother to re-read it.Which is a shame, because the first ten minutes felt like this could be a solid superhero spoof, if maybe not a serious superhero movie. In the end, I got what I initially expected, but I still managed to be disappointed.",Thunder Force

It's neither satire enough to be a spoof nor serious enough to pass as an action movie. For that reason it simply sits in the middle and drags with the occasional funny line.

It doesn't really have much of a build up either. Which isn't bad, just different.

The Emily and the King characters could have been elevated by funnier actors. The Emily character was too serious/scared throughout the movie, even after she had her powers. The King character could've been a comedy gold mine in the hands of Ferrell or anyone like him. All in all I enjoyed the movie, laughed, didn't feel like I wasted my time as some have reviewed.

757,charlotteweb-43346,Is this movie worth watching? Quick Answer: No.,1,12 April 2021,"Long Answer: Definitely not. You don't have to read this review because it's just not worth it.First of all, Melissa McCarthy's character (I'm too lazy to call her by her name so we'll call her Melissa) tries to pull of the ""village idiot"" stunt in the most embarassing way, and comes off selfish and almost bully-like to Octavia Spencer's character. She also makes fun of nerds/ ""smart"" people, even to Octavia's daughter which is a really boring and overused trope. At some point she even feels entitled to know about Octavia's life (such as the existence of her daughter) even though Melissa was the one who cut Octavia off.The ""jokes"" in this movie are objectively unfunny, and run off for far too long. One example is a joke near the beginning of the movie between Melissa and some cafe owner who she's friends with, and the cafe guy makes a weird error in his speech and he keeps trying to make joke after joke about it, but it just comes off so awkward. Not to mention the ""dweebish"" character that is supposedly a victim of Melissa's bullying. He purposely fails at comedy, but it just doesn't make him any better. The only good gag in this movie we get is when Octavia's character gets the easier treatment while Melissa gets the painful treatment. But they can't even get that right because Octavia immediately gets a hold of her powers and that's it.The logic and plot in this movie is frustrating. The villian is PAINFULLY obvious, I even got the double crosser on the first try. If you decide to watch the movie, I don't even have to spoil it for you because it's just that obvious. Also, every single person in this movie is hilariously not smart, even though there are 2 smart characters in this movie. No one bothers to get decent security to keep Melissa from getting poweres, the bad guys miss the good guys even though they could totally just kill them, and oh gosh the ending which I'll get to after the next part.My least favorite part of the movie is the raw chicken bit and crab man! Melissa has to fight against a crab man robber and just flirts with him? Also he goes ""you can't kill us, that would make you bad!"" as if arrest wasn't an option. But yeah, Melissa just uses the seduction technique. Later on they both confess that they like raw chicken and, oh gosh, that's sort of where the ending ties in!The ending is meh. The villain wants to blow up a building cool, but then the two girls just rush in and wowsers, they nearly lose until Octavia's ""nerdy"" (thanks for that Melissa) daughter suddenly gets super speed and helps! Melissa tosses the villain and the last threat they have is a bomb. The daughter offers to run with the bomb so it doesn't blow up the building but apparently it's not ""stable"". Ok? Then Melissa just offers to do it. But one important thing she says before that is ""We can't just throw it out the window, it'll hurt people!"". Think really carefully, then throw your thoughts out the window because they aren't needed here. Melissa jumps out the WINDOW with the BOMB. See the problem? Also not to mention there was a large body of water outside of the window, the effect would've been the same!!! I really thought the ending was bad until...The crab man and Melissa start feeding each other raw chicken, mouth to mouth. I think I'm not gonna eat crab or chicken for like until I forget this movie exists, which should take about a week. Anyways if you thought you wanted to see this movie, good for you but I thought the same thing and I was completely wrong.",Thunder Force

The acting is horrible, directing is very bad, and the pace is very slow. During fighting sequences, the VFX and other special effects look like they're done by a film school student who progresses poorly. The casting is poorly done. How could Ben Falcone cast an Oscar winner in a poorly made film? Everything from pre-production to post-production was rushed, which is unacceptable in Hollywood. This film deserves multiple Razzies, including Worst Picture, Worst Director for Ben Falcone, Worst Actress for Melissa McCarthy, Worst Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer, and Worst Screenplay.

Like relying on Melissa McCarthy to carry a movie using the same comedy from every other movie she's in. It's such a stale attempt.

It is boring, predictable, and just an all out ""cringe-fest"" to watch. It had some clever jokes, but I could count them all on one hand.It is a movie build up on cliches, a boring plot and midcore actors (except Octavia Spencer, and some side actors). You could almost feel their uninterest through the screen as they played out their characters.

796,wererich,Funny but does have cursing,10,9 April 2021,"In general, it's slapstick comedy. Personally, I saw myself and my friend as these two characters. Octavia and Melissa are good friends and on and off screen. On screen they start out as young friends and then reconnect. Same thing happened for my friend and I. They have the same type of humor with Melissa (my friend) being the louder friend who is also the one who brings all the fun to the friendship. Octavia (me) is the level-headed one who is always trying to achieve a goal and grounds Melissa. The story does drag at times but the slapstick comedy that is this film is great for family fun. However, I don't recommend it for younger children if you are the type of parent that forbids cursing in movies.

831,khanirawlingsk,"Superhero movie, but make it about fat jokes.",2,16 April 2021,"Going into this movie, I was prepared to love it, for a few reasons. I love Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy; I think they are both incredibly talented women, for that alone, I went in with high expectations and the other reason is that the movie has two plus-size leads and as a plus person myself, I am all for that representation, especially in a superhero movie as this is almost always never the norm. The twisted thing about expectations however is that they usually lead to disappointment and this movie had bucket loads of it.When Melissa McCarthy is a lead in a movie, it would be naïve of one not to expect comedy and that is exactly what happened in this movie, her character has little to no character development, her whole arc in the movie is entirely mad up of being the comic relief like any other movie she is in. This is not Melissa's fault because for the most part, it works, I found myself giggling a few times during the movie, I think I was meant to laugh a lot more but most of the jokes fell flat, Melissa and Octavia are both plus-size women, so the better part of the movie is dedicated to fat stereotypical jokes, that compensate for a lackluster storyline.Melissa McCarthy with the help of the young girls that played a younger her(Vivian Falcone and Mia Kaplan) did a decent job bringing a typical Melissa McCarthy character, Lydia, to life. The really isn't much to dissect about her character, she plays out how you'd expect her to play out from the moment she is introduced. Melissa McCarthy might just be the most typecast actress in Hollywood, but that is a discussion for another time.The storyline was promising, a young, smart black girl, who had a bad thing happen to her as a child, growing up to be a powerful woman dedicated to fighting back against those that wronged her as a child is an inspiring story and Octavia Spencer and the young actresses that played a younger her(Bria Danielle and Tai Leshaun) did an amazing job breathing life into the character of Emily Stanton but somehow the storyline still fell flat, and this was mostly due to the fact that the movie is too self-aware, it is very aware of the diverse cast it has, the inclusivity feeling the viewer will get while watching, unfortunately it is also because of that self-awareness that they didn't take time to develop their characters, make you care about the heroes, even the villain.The Crab had more character development than both our heroes, and his whole deal is that he has crabs for arms, when the only character that is memorable from your movie is a guy whose power is having crab arms, then you know your movie did something wrong. This movie had moments where it felt like they wanted you to take a moment serious but then ruined it with a lazy dry joke in the next scene. This movie is bad as far as superhero movies go but it's a decent watch if your thing is laughing over forced stereotypical jokes.",Thunder Force

833,morninmuffin,"To be 100% candid, I stopped watching after about an hour...",1,16 April 2021,"Nevertheless, I would easily rate this as one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time.Melissa McCarthy's brand of humor is generally not my taste, but she's undoubtedly funny, just not in this terrible super hero money grab of a snore fest.Zero chemistry between she and Octavia Spencer, who seemed confused or uncomfortable in the role.I could go on (and on) about just how bad this film was, but suffice to say this was a painfully inept, unfunny movie with obvious gags, stupid hackneyed tropes, terrible acting, a script written with 10-year-olds in mind and just a really bad film.I left my wife to finish watching this POS and I have no regrets other than leaving her to endure the pain of this complete waste of time and money.Shoutout to Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale who should have phoned this in as it would have been just as interesting.Enjoy this paychecks, boys, because it's not as if you earned them.Executive Summary: PU stinkaroo.",Thunder Force
834,stuartgoulter,"Bag full of nope. Back in the day, this would have been direct to video.",2,17 April 2021,"Ben Falcone is a great and funny guy. However, his scripts and direction lack critical editing. I'm not even half way through this painful movie and I already know how it plays out. And being formulaic isn't the worst part. It's slow. None of the scenes or dialog is tight. The scenes lack rhyme or reason, never mind being nuanced or clever. The lame jokes beat you over the head.Melissa and Octavia's character development takes way to long for what it provides and you end up not even wanting to like either one once they grow up.I'm sorry, but if Melissa's contract says Ben gets to write and direct x number of films, the studio needs to demand ghost directors and writers.Like other efforts with Ben, this comes off as half baked and unpolished. This wasn't developed enough to start shooting. There should have been 20 table reads to tune everything up. If there were actual readings, no one dared make improvements. Dialog is stiff and there isn't any of the well-timed banter that these actors are known for.So many little things aggravated me, because they were just plain lazy.Example:
Bateman's character should ALWAYS walk sideways, not just a couple times.This movie was a disservice to the actors and Falcone. Even Bobby Cannavale doesn't have enough good dialogue to save the scenes he's in.They all have much more talent than was put on film. You could trim 35 minutes and not miss a thing. I'm really surprised it got released in this form.This is Ghost Dad levels of power and irresponsiblity.Watched til the end....and regret it. It got worse. It's obvious, no one at the studio stepped in - at any point - to fix this.They just wanted to get the obligation off the books. Not a good way to run a successful business or career.",Thunder Force
835,don-13204,This Movie Should Have Stayed Invisible,1,17 April 2021,"Oh, Melissa McCarthy you should have stayed on Mike and Molly. Octavia Spencer you should have read the script. After reading the script you should have thrown it away.Thunder Force, while it could have been funny about two forty something women gaining superpowers, instead turned out to be a lame un-funny Melissa McCarthy vehicle where she is her loud, obnoxious, stupid character that she has played many times before.Octavia Spencer, try as she might to hold this movie together to give it some heart, is clearly out of element here. You never see any emotion in her face. Is she upset that McCarthy's character comes back into her life. Is she happy? You can't tell. When she had scenes with daughter, you just don't care.The writing of this movie was so poor you could tell where it was going from the first five minutes. Under a different director and without McCarthy chewing up each scene she is in
the premise might have worked.But when McCarthy and hubby, Ben Falcone get together to make a film, funny is not what happens. Don't get me wrong Melissa can be very funny and can show real acting prowess if given a decent script and a director who reigns her in. Falcone, on the other hand, lets his wife run wild with her facial expressions and low brow attempts to be funny.Suprisingly the funniest lines come from Jason Bateman. If you dare to watch this movie, you will see that he has his timing down and is the one bright spot but that is not saying much.And don't get me started on the romantic fantasy scene in the liquor store. It was just weird and out of place.I am giving this movie one star because of the cool looking superhero costumes. Of course, you can see the costumes in the trailer so take my word for it - give this movie a hard pass and do something else with your time.",Thunder Force

852,justtvstuff,Laugh out loud funny!! Ignore the haters...,10,21 May 2021,"What's up with the harsh reviews?? Not all superhero movies have to be Marvel movies folks. This movie is refreshingly LGBTQ+ inclusive and the female characters are in positions of power (and have powers). So if that's a turn off for you, just skip it. There's no damsel in distress or running in ridiculously high high heels anywhere. It's just plain fun, with some goofy sprinkled in. I laughed out loud throughout the movie. Even the person I watched it with, who isn't a big Melissa McCarthy fan, did as well. The story is about what happens when two friends, who are opposites in every way, get superpowers & all the adjustments and awkwardness that come with it as they try to do good and fight the bad doers.***SPOILERS!***
Those who didn't find this movie funny, might not have gotten a lot of the references. Lots of 80's/90's references, which if you're in your 40's are hilarious. There's even a training montage.

859,alsward,From a Christian POV,3,6 November 2021,"I LOVE Melissa McCarthy, Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman. Having said that, even their great acting couldn't save this movie.Some of the pros were: the ladies' friendship, the strong female characters, and the positive parenting. The two women would very unlikely be friends, but they stuck together when they were little and then reunited later on. I appreciated the fact that Melissa's character prayed before family meals, but the prayers were a little disrespectful. Octavia's daughter was encouraged to be smart as was her mother even though people called them a nerd.I really disliked the political innuendo. The 'progressive' candidate-who was an AOC Lookalike- defeated the Evil Incumbent. Progressives are good and there were positive statements about the Obamas too.Also, there were many references to same-sex relationships. Why put that in? We don't need to know someone's sexual preference. It's clearly on their agenda.And finally, like I stated in the opening paragraph- it just wasn't good. The actors are good but, when your bad guy 'crab-armed' man is dipping the super hero in her day dreams... well that pretty much tells you it's a silly movie without a lot of interesting content.",Thunder Force

902,serenaflese,It was actually kind of fun...,7,11 April 2021,"This movie wasn't meant to be a masterpiece; it was meant to be a feel-good comedy. I understand the negative reviews because it is not for everyone, but I rather enjoyed the silliness of it all. It is a good movie to put on for a giggle with a friend.",Thunder Force
903,goose-stuart,Falcone and McCarthy Deliver Again,10,11 April 2021,"Another great film written and directed by Ben Falcone starring his lovely wife, Melissa McCarthy and one of her best friends, Octavia Spencer. A lighthearted superhero tale, with some fantastic humour, showing that ladies in their 40's can still kick ass and make us laugh. The effects are perfect for a movie like this, and used only where they should be. Jason Bateman delivers a stellar performance as a crab man, and the silly prosthetics are hilarious. And Bobby Cannavale is always great, able to lean into the humour and menace of his role. With a big chunk of heart at its core, the film is a classic tale of friends who have lost touch and yearn to reconnect.",Thunder Force

908,imdb-42424,Plain entertainment,10,9 April 2021,"Humor, entertainment, Of course it doesn't deserve a rating of 10, that's just to get that average up, because I watched a lot worse movies with a higher rating. The low rating is not deserved.",Thunder Force
909,vjkratky,Maybe the worst movie from 2021,1,16 April 2021,"Well, we actually got something worst than covid-19... Maybe this movie is an experiment about how much bad scenes someone can put in a movie and people still watch it. And the improvisation stinks.",Thunder Force

915,clubcoco,Lighten up people,7,16 April 2021,Lighten up people. It's not supposed to be life changing. Just some cheesy fun. Jason Bateman's crab role alone makes this worth watching.,Thunder Force

918,ashleyrt,It's cute!,10,11 April 2021,"People are being so harsh with this one. It's a MM movie! You should kind of expect what to see going into watching it if you have seen any of her other movies. If you don't like those, you probably won't like this, but if you do, you will love it! It's really cute, super cheesy, but cute.",Thunder Force
919,zuzfry,For those who don't take super hero movies seriously,7,17 April 2021,Jason Bateman stroking her face with his claw...disco dancing with a mullet...it's THE King! I thought this movie had lots of fun parody. I guess you have to dry your humor before you appreciate it.,Thunder Force
920,lilgtsvee,If you didn't get the humor it was not meant for you,10,13 April 2021,"I loved the idea. The whole concept was fun. Two friends. Opposites. Who, no matter what, care for each other, and in a way complete something inside each other. I know Melissa's humor often goes over the top but I think in this film it was well balanced. And Octavia is typically a serious actress, I thought she did well to bring the film a slightly milder tone. It was full of geek Easter Eggs, one of which was a You Killed Kenny line that made my sides hurt.If you didn't get the humor or the story it was simply not meant for you. I enjoyed this film immensely. If this movie had been done with younger thinner actresses I believe the rating would have been higher. But I am so glad that it was done with these two beautiful and real looking ladies.I know they may not make another but I wish they would. I wish that it would have been better received.",Thunder Force

Poor story, massive plotholes, ridiculous scenarios. Thunder Force stinks, like a huge Thunder Fart.",Thunder Force

924,kaankaracaylinew,A cinematic disaster,2,10 May 2021,I imagene that the only reason this movie was made is because of the MCU's succes. Sadly it misses all the points of a compelling and fun superhero movie. The jokes arent fun.,Thunder Force

Watching for those twenty minutes I will never get back makes me feel ashamed.I knew it was not it was not going to be Gone With The Wind, but whoever paid for this production should be even more ashamed.

I realize that there are several types of humor, but if it is not your type of humor, why are you trying so hard to spread your negativism. We are going through a difficult time for humanity, with a terrible pandemic and the planet in pieces, and we have wonderful professionals who work for us.

It's not a Marvel movie and is obviously supposed to be silly. Seeing two middle aged female BFFs (in real life and in the movie) who exist outside the ideal Hollywood beauty standards, have fun making a dumb superhero movie is just silly fun. The leads have good chemistry and there are some good laughs in there. This movie is exactly the kind of thing male comedic actors have been getting made for years. I guess some people just can't handle it when it's older women who aren't meant to be eye-candy.",Thunder Force

Is this movie great, or inspiring or any of the things that would cause critics to turn from their condescension? No. Is it something that can elicit a laugh and diversion from this wretched pandemic? Absolutely. It's a story that feels familiar and comfortable with Melissa's unique brand of funny. She plays off Octavia Spencer's straight character so well and even manages to elicit a few ""feels"" along the way. I enjoyed this -- especially being ""of a certain age"" myself.",Thunder Force

955,elessarbre,Could have been better,4,9 April 2021,"I didn't really hate this movie as a lot of other seem to judging by the current rating and reviews but I was kind of hoping for a better movie judging by the actors appearing (Octavia Spencer and. Jason Bateman). Melissa McCarthy did what she always does which is try to be funny but not succeeding most of the time.Spencer didn't really have all that much to do in this movie which was sad since she could have probably added more depth to it but instead they chose to focus on McCarthy's antics.The plot was predictable and you could pretty much tell where everything was headed from the start.The premise was interesting enough but similar things have been done many times in recent years and they were done much better in most cases.Overall this is a pretty forgettable movie that you can watch while doing something else (cooking, exercising etc...) without needing to turn on your brain even a little bit, and that is exactly what I did so I might have enjoyed it more than other people did.P. S. Raw chicken?!? Are you trying to give people food poisoning? Because you know some kids are gonna try raw chicken as a dumb online trend after seeing it in this movie.",Thunder Force

I'm not looking for the next Dark Knight here! I wanted something mindless that would make me laugh and McCarthy and Spencer delivered.
