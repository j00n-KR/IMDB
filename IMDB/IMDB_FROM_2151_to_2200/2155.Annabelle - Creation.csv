0,TheLittleSongbird,Annabelle's next chapter,6,15 October 2018,"Have an appreciation for horror and there are a fair share of good to classic ones in the genre as well as a fair share of not so good and even downright bad ones. Really liked both 'The Conjuring' films so watched 'Annabelle', which was inevitably compared to them a lot, and found myself disappointingly not caring all that much for it (while not detesting it).Saw 'Annabelle: Creation' after hearing that it was a much better film and also that it looked quite good. After seeing it, it is agreed that it is a far superior film to 'Annabelle' in most areas. There are still faults here and major ones and it's not my definition of great, but whereas 'Annabelle' was lacklustre this just scraped above average and what 'Annabelle' didn't do well in this does much better. It has clearly not worked for some and that is understandable.'Annabelle: Creation' as aforementioned has issues. The dialogue is still very awkward-sounding and banal, doing little with developing rather clichéd characters, and while the familiarity of the story didn't bother me actually (although there are certainly predictable moments, and a little over-simplicity going on) the ridiculousness and illogic of the final third was less forgivable. Likewise with the ending, that was as rushed and anti-climactic as that for 'Annabelle'. Stephanie Sigman overacts a bit too.However, 'Annabelle: Creation' is a good looking film, with a great Gothic atmosphere, lush and darkly atmospheric production design and stylish photography. The supernatural effects are surprisingly excellent too. The music is haunting and the direction brings a genuine eeriness and mysteriousness, as well as much more momentum and ease, that was not there in 'Annabelle'. Where 'Annabelle: Creation' is vastly superior in too is that it is scarier and more interesting. There may not be an awful lot novel, but there are some nice jolty shocks, the odd unsettling surprise and some genuine suspense and dread on particularly a psychological level. There is far more momentum here and the pace is tighter. The story intrigues, while the characters may not be the best developed but they at least have personality and easier to get behind. The acting is much better here too, with the standout performances coming from Talitha Bateman and Lulu Wilson (both terrific). Overall, not great but a decent improvement. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Annabelle - Creation
1,Leofwine_draca,Why bother?,4,11 September 2019,"ANNABELLE: CREATION is another mindlessly derivative spin-off from THE CONJURING, this time a prequel to a pre-existing spin-off about a creepy doll. Got that? Watching this, it quickly becomes apparent that creativity is in short supply here, because everything is telegraphed well in advance and there's not a single surprise from beginning to end. We get a children's home setting, Miranda Otto in little more than an extended cameo, and endlessly repetitive jump scares in which the soundtrack goes quiet for a few minutes before the viewer is made to jump with a loud bang. When this happens for the tenth time, your patience will have long since evaporated.",Annabelle - Creation
2,SnoopyStyle,solid horror moves,7,24 September 2017,"The Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia, Miranda Otto) suffer a tragedy when the daughter Bee is hit by a passing car. Twelve years later, they open their home to abandoned girls. Janice is handicap and Linda is her best friend. There are four other girls and Sister Charlotte. Their world is turned upside down after Janice finds the doll Annabelle locked in the closet.This is a nicely made horror movie. It has nice set pieces and individual scenes. The doll and the entity serve as nice horror villains. Whether I like or love this depends on the girls. The young actresses are fine but the characters need more individuality to stand out. Janice and Linda are the main lead. While they have more screen time, they should be given even more. One of them should be in every scene. The horrors are too scattered among the girls. It would be more horrifying if Janice and Linda suffered while the others disbelieve. That should hold out as long as possible. The other girls lack individuality which make them too much like cannon fodder. I do grow to care for the girls but it should happen sooner. Overall, it's better most horrors and it's well executed.",Annabelle - Creation
3,claudio_carvalho,The Origin of Annabelle,7,13 October 2017,"The manufacturer of doll Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) is a happy family man with his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) and their daughter Bee (Samara Lee), who dies hit by a car. Twelve years later, Samuel welcomes a group of orphan girls and a nun from a closed orphanage at home. He tells that only a closed room (that belonged to Bee) and Esther's room would be off limits for the girls. The crippled girl Janice (Talitha Bateman) sneaks in Bee's room during the night and sees a doll inside a closet. She plays in the room and soon she is haunted by an evil force. What has Janice unleashed in Bee's room?""Annabelle: Creation"" tells the story of the origin of Annabelle. The flawless screenplay is well-written; there is explanation for everything; and the viewers startle in many scenes. The girl Talitha Bateman has great performances in the roles of Janice and Annabelle.

4,nogodnomasters,You are my sunshine,8,27 August 2017,"Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) is a doll maker who has made a limited edition Annabelle doll. The film then jumps to 12 years later after the death of his daughter (Samara Lee) as he and his wife (Miranda Otto) agree to share their home with a Catholic orphanage which includes a half dozen girls.The film then centers on Janice (Talitha Eliana Bateman) a polio victim and her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson). There are 2 mysteries that intrigue the girls. 1) Why Mrs. Mullins stays bed ridden in her room and doesn't allow people to see her. and 2) Why is the deceased daughter's room is locked and no one can enter it? This is another creepy doll story with the expected scares. Acting was very good for a horror film. I have to question a nun hearing a confession and prescribing penance. Didn't know they were allowed to do that. What I didn't like about film was the very end. I think they should have cut the last couple of minutes and leave it with the new parents meeting their daughter.Good film for a sleep over. No swearing, sex, or nudity. Little girls screaming. Minimal blood.",Annabelle - Creation
5,kosmasp,Creating again,8,20 October 2017,"While it was obvious, I never even thought about this before it was said out aloud at Frightfest. Yes there is the Marvel Universe and the DC Universe, but there is also the ... Conjuring-verse! And it seems that universe will get another spin-off, but more on that later. First this second entry to Annabelle.And if you saw the first one, you have every right to be skeptical. I gave it a 6, but I clearly could've gone lower. I'm known to not rate too low, even on movies I don't like that much, considering actors, script, budget, previous entries, other movies of that sort and so forth. In this case, I don't have to consider, because it does reach the quality Conjuring set as standard! So saying this is better than the first Annabelle would be an understatement.The origin story of the doll, that quite frankly is eerie at least and scary at best (and not nearly as funny as Chucky, for good reasons), is laid out in front of us. And as some other good horror movies, this works as a Dramas as well. But again, emphasis is on the Horror aspect. And there is also emphasis on scenes after the credits roll ... one in-between and one after the credits are done ... Can you see what's coming next? Excited much? ... or rather: Afraid?",Annabelle - Creation
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's pretty good, it's just all been done to death.",6,29 August 2019,"I'm not sure if you're like me, where every new horror feels as if someone is flogging a dead horse, but that's exactly how I felt about Annabelle Creation. Here we go again, it's a prequel to the original. That doll is dug out, sat stationary, and all manner of nasty events happen.It's a very nicely made film, it's very well acted by the largely young cast, it's a good, if sad story, and there are a few decent scares. The trouble is, those scares have been done so many times, even, dare I say it throughout the franchise.It lacked the interesting side story that was present throughout the Conjuring films. As I say it's a good movie, but come on, give us something other then doll scares girl.",Annabelle - Creation
7,classicsoncall,"""We shouldn't be in here.""",7,9 June 2021,"I watched this movie out of order, having seen ""Annabelle Comes Home"" before catching this prequel origin story of Annabelle. As far as the genre goes, 2014's ""Annabelle"" was not a genre defining movie, in fact it seemed rather clichéd for the most part, though it had some scary moments that make you jump. With ""Annabelle Comes Home"" you had a number of creepy build-ups that didn't really amount to all that much, and waiting for a jump scare turned out to be a meaningless exercise. So it turns out that for this viewer, ""Annabelle: Creation"" comes off as the best of the bunch, but again, much of it has been done before and it doesn't have the suspense you might expect in a horror film. The biggest shock actually had nothing to do with the horror elements of the picture, but that opening scene when the little girl Bee (Samara Lee), wanting to retrieve a minor object her father dropped, got hit by a passing motorist and met her death. That was so terrifying because it was so possible to occur for real to the horror of a young child's parents. I couldn't quite follow the idea of Bee's spirit moving into the Annabelle doll followed in turn by a demonic presence entering the young crippled girl Janice (Talitha Eliana Bateman), but it's not important enough for me to go back to try and figure it out. Just know that with the 'Annabelle' films tying into the 'Conjuring' universe, this franchise has the potential to go on for a long time.",Annabelle - Creation
8,jboothmillard,Annabelle: Creation,5,31 May 2021,"The first Annabelle movie, a spin-off in the Conjuring Universe, was disappointing, I didn't have my hopes high for this follow-up, or rather prequel which sees the origin of the doll, but I gave it a chance, directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out). Basically, dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) are devastated when their seven-year-old daughter Annabelle, nicknamed ""Bee"" (Samara Lee), is killed when she accidentally steps in front of a car. Twelve years later, in 1955, the Mullins open their home to provide shelter for Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and six girls left homeless after their orphanage is closed. The children are warned not to enter Bee's locked bedroom, but young orphan Janice (Talitha Eliana Bateman), disabled by polio, sneaks into the room after it is mysteriously unlocked. She finds a key for Bee's closet and opens it, where she finds an eerie porcelain doll. This unwittingly releases a powerful demon that begins to terrorise the girls. One night, the demon appears to Janice, taking Bee's form, saying it wants her soul. She tries to get away on a stairlift, but the demon hurls her violently down to the ground floor, injuring and confining her to a wheelchair. Janice's best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson) is tormented by the demon. Next, the demon poses as Sister Charlotte, wheels Janice into the old bar, and, appearing as Bee again, possesses her vomiting black bile into Janice's mouth. Linda notices Janice's behaviour changing and tells Samuel that Janice snuck into Bee's room and found the doll. Janice, now able to walk, transforms into the demon and brutally kills Samuel. Linda takes the doll and throws it into the well. A strange noise comes from the well and she is almost dragged into it, but Sister Charlotte saves her. Alarmed, Sister Charlotte talks to the disfigured Esther, who stays in her bedroom. Esther explains that following Bee's death, they prayed to an entity to let them see their daughter again. An unknown entity answered their prayer and, after seeing Bee's spirit, it convinced them to transfer its essence into one of Samuel's crafted dolls. It is only later they realise that they had attracted a demon looking for a human host. One night, Esther saw Bee's spirit transforming into the demon, which then gouged out her eye. Enlisting the help of priests to bless the house, they locked the doll in Bee's closet. Esther and Samuel opened their house as a shelter to repent for their actions, but Esther now regrets it as the demon has an opportunity to take a human host. The demon murders Esther and attacks Sister Charlotte. The orphans leave the house, but Linda is trapped and hides in Bee's room while the possessed Janice tries to kill her. Sister Charlotte locks Janice and the doll inside the closet. The next day, police arrive to search the house, only finding the doll, which is removed as evidence. Sister Charlotte, Linda, and the orphans are taken away by officers, while Janice escapes through a hole in the closet wall and heads to an orphanage in Santa Monica. Still possessed, she becomes reclusive and calls herself Annabelle. The Higgins family soon adopt Annabelle. Twelve years later, a grown-up Annabelle joins a Satanic cult and, along with her boyfriend, murders her adoptive parents, catching the attention of next-door neighbours the Forms, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John (Ward). Also starring Grace Fulton as Carol, Philippa Coulthard as Nancy, Tayler Buck as Kate, Lou Lou Safran as Tierney, Brad Greenquist as Victor Palmeri, Mark Bramhall as Father Massey, Joseph Bishara as Annabelle Demon, and Bonnie Aaron as Demon Nun. The cast are fine, with young Bateman standing out, the story is alright, it does rely on a lot of jump scares, a few that you can see coming, but the special effects, the many appearances of the evil doll, and a continued eerie atmosphere keep the pace up, a reasonable supernatural horror. Worth watching!",Annabelle - Creation
9,BA_Harrison,Another dull doll horror movie.,4,16 February 2018,"The Conjuring, of which Annabelle: Creation is a spin-off, was an unexceptional supernatural horror that shamelessly mined the many clichés of the genre in a desperate search for frights. Likewise, this 'origins' flick is a collection of well-worn scary movie tropes that is unlikely to impress seasoned horror fans. I've lost count of how many creepy doll movies I've seen over the years, and this one does very little new with the idea.Annabelle is the name given to the fugly doll which acts as a conduit for a nasty demon that causes trouble for a group of nuns and girls who come to live in a farmhouse orphanage. It's a generic, lazy story full of gaping plot holes, lapses in logic and glaring inconsistencies, told with little flair or originality by director David F. Sandberg, who helmed the marginally better Lights Out.",Annabelle - Creation
10,paul_haakonsen,Predictable and not scary at all...,4,12 June 2018,"Alright, well first of all I can't claim to be much of a fan of the Annabelle doll, as I find it rather dull and not scary at all.And true to my assumptions, then ""Annabelle: Creation"", turned out to be not scary at all. But hey, didn't we all see that coming?It was sort of a very anti-climatic atmosphere to the entire movie, which took away any chance of building up a horror atmosphere. The entire storyline, however, was just so horribly predictable that it was laughable.""Annabelle: Creation"", however, does have some good enough acting performances and good castThe CGI and special effects in the movie were good, and that at least counted in favor of the movie.",Annabelle - Creation
11,BandSAboutMovies,Much better than expected,7,22 October 2017,"Do we need a fourth installment in The Conjuring film series? More to the point, do we need another origin story for the evil doll, Annabelle, after 2014's Annabelle? And can directed David F. Sandberg, whose Lights Out showed such promise only to ultimately be a failure, helm a feature that's true to the quality James Wan brought to the original films? And finally, just how much should you expect from a prequel to the sequel to a spin-off?Turns out that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I honestly expected nothing, given how much disdain I had for Lights Out, a film that made me want to leave the theater from its opening story beats. Instead, Annabelle: Creation takes plenty of time building its roller coaster structure, introducing us to Sister Charlotte and her pack of orphaned girls. They come to the farm of Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia, Empire Records) and Esther Mullins with nowhere else to go.We gradually get the backstory of how the Mullins tragically lost their daughter, Annabelle, and are trying to atone for some past sins by allowing the girls access to their home. At the films heart is the relationship between Linda (Lulu Wilson, Deliver Us from Evil and Ouija: Origin of Evil) and polio sufferer Janice (Talitha Bateman, the older sister of Lights Out star Gabriel Bateman).Sandberg claims that he was influenced by The Haunting and The Shining for this film, dropping the meticulous planning and storyboards that had been such a part of his style. I can point to several other prime influences — the dumb waiter scare at the end references the basement elevator sequence in Halloween II, the hiding in the closet has the primal feel of the original Halloween and the gory treatment of Mrs. Mullins near the end looks like the crucified Schweick of Fulci's The Beyond (one could also argue that her ceramic adorned visage at once references the Annabelle doll features and 2016's The Boy). I also saw a similarity to the glowing, possessed eyes of Janice with Canadian Exorcist ripoff Cathy's Curse (look, we could just say the film ripped off The Exorcist, too, but the image of Cathy on the cover of Severin's recent Blu-Ray release is more fresh in my brain).Read more at https://bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/08/12/annabelle-creation-2017/",Annabelle - Creation
12,michaelRokeefe,She is not going to share her home.,7,6 January 2018,"After years of the loss of a daughter, a doll maker, Samuel Mullens (Anthony LaPaglia), and his wife make the decision to take in a nun and a few young girls when an orphanage is shut down. Upon some curious snooping, a creepy doll is discovered in a closet and she is not shy about letting it be known that she doesn't like sharing her home with interlopers.

The young girls become frightened as they realize how important this doll named Annabelle is to the Mullens.If you want something a bit spooky and terrifying...you've found it.

13,hitchcockthelegend,Conduit Demon: Take 27!,6,10 December 2017,"OK! It may not be 27 films in the latest conduit demon phase of horror film making, but it sure as hell feels like it! Annabelle: Creation would have been a very good horror film if it had come out 10 years ago, as it is we find ourselves treading familiar ground and relying on the usual horror film making playbook for our thrills.Anyone such as myself who is bothered by pediophobia, automatonphobia and pupaphobia will surely be chilled to the bone here, for the makers push it to the max, with fine results. However, once that aspect is stripped away and the sound and visual horror staples grow tired, we are left hankering for a glorious final quarter of film to terrify us - which sadly doesn't materialise as we then get conduit demon 101.In the pluses column there's a superb tie-in to the real Annabelle doll, an adherence to story as fact shrewdly inserted, and the acting (with young Lulu Wilson bright again as she wanders in from Ouija: Origin of Evil) is more than adequate. Sound mix rocks, as does the photographic shadows and shimmers, rendering the production technically good. If only the writers had been a bit more bolder and imaginative...Much better than Annabelle (2014) (which isn't hard really), ""Creation"" is above average fare for casual horror fans with the fears previously stated. Hard core horror nuts, however, are likely to be very jaded come the end credits rolling. 6.5/10",Annabelle - Creation

Jesus Himself famously drove a herd of innocent pigs to their Terrible Deaths by Drowning, simply because Lucifer has possessed someone with a Multiple Legion of Imps, and when the swine flew it was good riddance to all.

Jan escapes the Net of Propriety, and is soon seen as the restyled Evil Annabelle, slicing the throats of her adoptive parents.

If you're going to make a doll, why on earth would you make it so that it looks as creepy as possible? Because the one thing you can be sure of is that if a doll looks creepy, it IS creepy.I liked the main location here - one of those hot, arid farms where all they seem to farm is dust. And it was good to see Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto playing parts which are a little off the beaten track for them. The youngsters are all fairly good, and the story meanders nicely on its way to setting up the events in Annabelle, itself a prequel to The Conjuring (which was not a prequel despite being followed by a sequel, The Conjuring 2). The destination is no surprise, but there is some interest in the view during the journey.It is, however, not even slightly horrific. There are sufficient loud noises etc. to make you jump fairly frequently, but that tends to be solely the result of a sudden assault on the senses, not because of anything inherently scary.

18,FlashCallahan,"Forgive me father, I am about to sin.......",5,20 August 2017,"Former toy maker Sam Mullins and his wife, Esther, welcome a nun and six orphaned girls into their California farmhouse. Years earlier, the couple's 7-year-old daughter Annabelle died in a tragic car accident. Terror soon strikes when one child sneaks into a forbidden room and finds a seemingly innocent doll that appears to have a life of its own, and a really ugly face.No wonder he's given up toy making.............When you can get past the fact that the titular doll is probably the most sinister looking doll in cinematic history that no one would want to own, what you get is a perfectly serviceable horror film with no surprises whatsoever.So this is a prequel to a prequel in yet another cinematic universe that no one really asked for, but due to the low budget of the films, and nine times out of ten they recoup double their budget on opening weekend, you can expect to see these films pop up for at least the next few years.So we have yet another origin story to the legend of Annabelle, but the film references other maguffins in The Conjuring-verse, for example, we have a glimpse of The Nun from the second Conjuring movie, which is currently being made into a feature length film.Creation follows the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' rules of this type of horror film, dark set pieces, very loud orchestrated scores that go silent before your obligatory jump scare.But like the other films, these jump scares are not scary, they cause you to jump because the score is so loud, you cannot help but jump, it's the cattle prod of cinematic scoring.So we focus more on one particular girl, the noisiest girl in the house. The type of girl of when told not to go into a room, she'll do it anyway, but in the dark of the night, because it's more scarier isn't it?There are some red herrings to the jump scares that really throw you, for instance, there is one scene involving a stair-lift, the camera angle leads you to think that the scare will come from the right hand side of the screen, but spoon feeding that the audience has been privy to for the last umpteenth horror films really throws you.The acting is okay, pretty perfunctory for a film like this, we have two actors who were quite prolific supporting actors twenty years ago, whom add a little gravitas to the whole proceedings.But the film is a little deceptive in its title. Yes, the titular doll literally gets created in the first five minutes, but the rest of the film really offers nothing new to this universe, until the last three minutes, which is pretty ingenious to be fair, and it wraps the whole film up very nicely.So all in all, it's a pretty serviceable horror film, which entertains whilst your watching it, but you'll forget it a few hours later.",Annabelle - Creation
19,phd_travel,Well paced good story scary and effective without gore,9,14 August 2017,This movie is very good from start to finish. I wasn't too impressed by the original Annabelle itself. This movie is better. It's a good kind of horror - well filmed with a well paced story of the origins of the doll and tragic death that took place. I like that you can follow the story clearly it and makes sense without red herrings and the photography isn't too dark. It's actually clearer than Conjuring. Doesn't rely on excessive gore or too many shock tactics to be scary. The young actresses who play the orphans staying who come to stay in the house are effective and don't over act.Going through the house which is like those historic farm/home tours - it's quite fun to see which household items and things are going to be sinister like a dumb waiter and the scarecrow.The ending is satisfying enough to make you feel you watched a well made horror movie.,Annabelle - Creation
20,mm-39,Low expectations,8,12 August 2017,"Well I did not know what to think about part 2! Part 2 usually means an inferior movie! With 2017 being a bad year for movies so far, my wife and I decided to a have a movie night. Can't get any worse. Surprisingly Part 2 the prequel is better than the original. I was wondering how part 2 could be filmed with out having a big plot hole with part 1. Annabelle 2 stars out with a family tragedy which brings the orphans (not the one from the movie Warriors) to an orphanage ground zero for the tragic epee center. Like a scary haunting part 2 starts out small, and the victims get picked off one at a time. The usual slow burn script with a violent conclusion. Like the Friday 13th series there is doors opening, screams, trucks not starting etc. A story of a mistake/secret which caused the problem. There is many good jumps and scares with part 2. The director use deviates from the Friday the 13 th playbook with more in-depth characters. The old guy with the heavy burden secret, and the sick girl with sister we get to actual know the characters. Formulated ending where the cops arrive! The police would never believe such tripe. A twisted ending which leaves room for part 3! The conclusion ties part two with part one and a evil plan which makes room for part 3. Unexpectedly good! Eight out of ten",Annabelle - Creation

Especially a horror movie featuring dolls, mimes, masks or clowns. That will freak her out for sure and that makes me enjoying the movie even more. Annabelle: Creation is of course with a doll, like the first one. I already enjoyed the first one and for once the sequel isn't bad at all, on the contrary. To me it's more funny than scary but that doesn't matter. As long as I'm entertained it's all good to me. And I was entertained. There is enough suspense (at least for my wife), the acting isn't bad (like some other reviewers seem to think), and the special effects are okay. So all in all it's an entertaining movie and that's the only thing that counts to me.",Annabelle - Creation
22,Hellmant,"Wasn't a fan of the original 'ANNABELLE', and I'm even less a fan of this prequel.",5,17 August 2017,"'ANNABELLE: CREATION': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The fourth installment in 'THE CONJURING' horror movie franchise, and a prequel to 2014's 'ANNABELLE'. The film tells the origin story of the possessed doll Annabelle (first featured in the original 'THE CONJURING'). It stars Stephanie Sigman, Tabitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto. It was directed by David S. Sandberg (who also helmed the 2016 horror hit 'LIGHTS OUT') and it was written by Gary Dauberman (who also wrote the original 'ANNABELLE'). James Wan, the director of the original 'THE CONJURING' (and it's sequel), returned as the movie's producer as well. The film is yet another hit at the Box Office, like all of it's predecessors, and it's actually gotten better reviews than the original 'ANNABELLE' movie. Even so, I was pretty disappointed with it.A doll maker, Samuel Mullins (LaPaglia), and his wife Esther (Otto), tragically lose their daughter Annabelle (Samara Lee) in an accident. 12 years later, they allow a nun, Sister Charlotte (Sigman), and several girls from a closed orphanage, stay at their house. Mr. Mullins warns the young girls not to go in a certain room, or near the doll Annabelle; which is of course possessed by their dead daughter. The girls (also of course) don't listen.I am a fan of the original 'THE CONJURING', and to a lesser degree it's sequel. I wasn't a fan of the original 'ANNABELLE' film though, and I'm even less a fan of this prequel. I think it's well made, and technically effective (at what is sets out to do), it's also cool to see an almost entirely female cast in a major Hollywood film like this, but (like the original 'ANNABELLE') I was really bored with the film (for almost it's entirety). I've maybe just seen too many of these clichéd supernatural horror flicks, but movies like this one just don't interest me at all anymore. I couldn't wait for it to be over actually, but I'll admit it is well made (on certain levels).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/230044658",Annabelle - Creation
23,FeastMode,effective horror flick,7,24 July 2019,"Well-made movie. good directing and cinematography, great acting, especially by the two lead girls. dumbness is kept to a minimum, scariness kept to a max. so much scariness throughout this movie. connects with the previous annabelle movie, so you might not understand some stuff if you haven't seen it. there is a little bit of set up for future movies in this ""conjuring universe"" but it is forgivable. overall very entertaining while also being really good.on second viewing it didn't hit me as hard. still very enjoyable with some awesome scares (2 viewings, 6/26/2020)",Annabelle - Creation
24,Robert_duder,Taking the predictable concept and making it even better than the first time around,8,23 August 2017,"I grew up in and on the 80's Slasher films. I used to be terrified to even look at them and then I fell in love with them in later years. R-Rated, ridiculous over the top slasher flicks with x amount of sequels and I came back every time. The new generation of horror films which rakes in the money are also good but very different. PG-13/14A opens up a bigger audience and means character development and scares are key and usually it works! The Conjuring was a great film and spun off into Annabelle which was a decent movie but we've seen killer dolls before haven't we? Inevitable we would see a sequel. I had mediocre expectations but wanted to see it anyways. How often do we see a sequel better than the first especially when it's a horror film and based around a concept we've seen before? Annabelle: Creation adds more story and great characters and some truly great performances from the young cast. It even leaves enough to explore more about the doll and the situation around it. The twist in the end or how it ends up is fantastic and I didn't see it coming at all. It makes you truly invested in this as it's own franchise apart from The Conjuring. Allegedly the ""real"" Annabelle is a Raggedy Ann Doll and they even pay homage to that. Anthony LaPaglia plays the perfect role as the father and head of the girls' home later on. I haven't seen him star in anything in a long time but he does a great job in his role and gives it a very good brooding vibe. Samara Lee and MIranda Otto are also good as his family. Otto has more scenes and is underused but still good. Talitha Eliana Bateman and Lulu Wilson are M E S M E R I Z I N G. They are fantastic in their roles. They bring a realism to it and Bateman gives honestly one of the best performances in a film of this type in a very long time. I think we will end up seeing a ton of her in the future. Stephanie Sigman is also a little bit underused I think but gives a great performance as Sister Charlotte. The other girls in the film played very well by Grace Fulton, Philippa Coulthard and Tayler Buck are good. Buck is extremely underused but Fulton and Couthard are good in much smaller roles than Bateman and Otto. Director David F. Sandberg breaks the mould in that he has done some shorts and various work but until recently had done a mainstream film. He had some success with Lights Out which I have not seen yet and now this. I'm extremely impressed with his direction. This script could have been very typical and ""same old"" but he uses the perfect build up and scares and direction to get the most out of the rating it is given. While the film is not ""gory"" by definition, it definitely has cringe worthy moments and gets very much under your skin. There is something real about the feel of the story and the setting of the house/orphanage/workshop is absolutely perfect and minimal to suit the story. I will say that I think for being a film that was supposed to show the origins of Annabelle, it doesn't actually tell us where the spirit began or it's true origins. It only gives the origins of the doll itself and the first thing the demon jumps into. The Conjuring franchise is growing into something really great. It builds slow but both those films were good and now the Annabelle series stands on it's own. Best of all this sequel is even better than it's predecessor! 8/10",Annabelle - Creation

Though it never quite reaches the heights of the two 'Conjuring' titles, 'Annabelle: Creation (2017)' stands on its own feet as a shining example of the genre, while simultaneously sublimely slotting itself into the series by referencing and respecting the established lore to the point that it feels worthy of the franchise moniker. It does take a while to get going, with the supernatural stuff entirely saved until after the set-up instead of being sprinkled throughout, and is generally pretty predictable (it turns out I was several steps ahead of where the film expected I'd be, though this may be because I'm a fan of the series and know its canon well), but this is an astutely directed and highly entertaining feature that delivers several well-executed scares and, once it gets going, keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. 7/10",Annabelle - Creation
27,lesleyharris30,"As Far as Horrors go, it is Above Average,",5,5 September 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is a mediocre movie with a reasonably well developed plot and an average cast. Horror movies are not my preferred genre, they were once great, but nowadays they are made simply to make money, with the same boring, predictable jump scares thrown in throughout, it is a tired franchise that rarely does anything new. However, I have to hand it to Creation, it was certainly unpredictable, you could not tell what was coming next and it genuinely startled me on several occasions, it knew what we were expecting as an audience and played with that in a very clever way. On the other hand, it does still have some typical horror traits that make me, as a critical moviegoer, irritable, there are far too many plot holes throughout, as well as many questionable behaviour from characters that are unlike them to do from what we learn about them at the beginning, that is never explained. The usual head scratches are raised, such as why they would stay in the house after all that has happened and their lack of sense in not phoning the authorities, it gets so convoluted towards the end that you really need to switch off your brain in order to enjoy yourself. The origin story itself is poor. I have not seen the first Annabelle, but I would imagine that the majority of people who were interested in seeing this movie wanted to know the origins of the doll, but what we learn about it is actually quite brief, it should have been developed further and contained some sort of unexpected twist to entice us. Fun while it lasts, but very forgettable. It is far better than most of the horror films being made these days, but Annabelle: Creation has far too many imperfections for me to recommend, unless you want nothing more than to be scared. A nun and a group of orphans are taking in to a family home for a week, which they soon discover is haunted by a demonic doll.

Inside they discover a porcelain-faced doll possessed by a creature that now wants to embody one of the waifs (Talitha Bateman). Another prosaic possession picture for the junk heap, this prequel to The Conjuring relies solely on jump-scares to generate its screams.

Top that off with two competent young child actresses and it was already off to a surprising start.Though certainly clichéd the film does have a remarkable amount of tension and a good few scares. Some of them are even quite original which somewhat shocked me.Alas it still follows that terrible formula Hollywood is reluctant to loosen its grip on and ultimately is irreparably damaged because of it.Annabelle Creation is by far the strongest movie of this franchise but by no means is it anything I'd consider to be a decent film.As always if you want horror go indie, Hollywood is catering to the masses who still think jump scares are the spine of any horror.Each to his/her own but these kind of films are simply not for me and I consider them to be horror ""Light"" and utter fluff pieces.The Good: Some decent scares Solid cast The Bad: Still very standard Hollywood paint by numbers formula Things I Learnt From This Movie: An electric stairlift will outrun pure evil The forthcoming Nun spin off film is something I'm actually quietly curious about",Annabelle - Creation

The first film, which was 'Annabelle', I thought it was an okayish. Now with this, there's a potential sub franchise. Probably it could head back to back-wards as prequels, while 'The Conjuring is heading forward.There's nothing new from this, but still not a bad film. I liked the location. A single house in the mountain and revolved around a bunch of orphans. It is where it all begins. The creation of the most haunted doll that you saw in 'The Conjuring'. Focused on a doll making family, following an accident, how the family lived their rest of the life was told.A nun with a few orphan girls joins the family to live-in. When one of the kids discovers the locked away doll with secrets, the evil force unleashed. In the latter parts, the film reveals what happen to them and to the doll.

After some years he helps a group of orphan girls and a nun by letting them stay at his house. He tells that only a closed room and the room of his wife would be off limits for the girls. One girl enters this room and finds a doll in a closet. Soon after she finishes playing with that doll she is haunted by an evil force.I liked this movie very much because of the plot and how it connected all the previous movies like the first movie ""Annabelle"" and ""The Conjuring"" with this. It can be easily understood that the sequel is far better than the first movie and this is something that makes sense if we take into consideration the budget of this movie which was $15 million in comparison with the first movie in which was $6 million. Better scary scenes and better interpretations of the cast are some of the reasons why this movie is better than the first. I liked the interpretations of Anthony LaPaglia who played as Samuel Mullins, Miranda Otto who played as Esther Mullins and Talitha Eliana Bateman who played as Janice.Finally, I have to admit that at first, I was a bit skeptical of this movie because of the first movie so, I did not have high expectations of it and I was simply fascinated because I was wrong. ""Annabelle: Creation"" is a very good and interesting movie with much of suspense and many scary scenes. I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will have a great time and it will keep you in tense in the whole duration of it.",Annabelle - Creation
36,cruise01,Better than the first by a long shot.,6,11 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is a better sequel that improves over the terrible first film but not by much. Director David F. Sandberg does try to create a creepy atmosphere and tone involving dolls. Lets face it, dolls have been a master at creating fear within everyone. Even if they are just standing by as you walk around. The thought of there heads turning towards your direction can be creepy. But this being a supernatural horror movie and the doll Annabelle just creeping as it sits in the background with it continuously disappearing and showing up does make this film quite decent. The plot is decent. This follow up is a prequel to the first film. It follows a group of orphaned girls moving to an isolated house. Until, one girl Janice (Talitha Bateman) starts noticing some strange supernatural occurrences when she finds Annabelle. This being a prequel set up to how the Annabelle doll became possessed that eventually followed into The Conjuring film was pretty neat to see how that tied the origin story up. Yes, this horror movie does have a lot of clichés which would make the audience scream at these characters for making stupid decisions yet again. It is starting to become a regular habit with these horror films making characters make the dumb decisions. First, we have Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia) and wife Esther (Miranda Otto) who lost their daughter Annabelle. Later, her spiritual presence ask them for permission to host inside a doll which they grant her too so they can have their daughter with them. Does not take long, until evil finds a way to haunt the doll and affect anyone that is near it. Several years later, an orphaned girl Janice discovers the doll and notices that the demon is around the dolls presence. I hated the first film for a lot of reasons. This prequel is an improvement with better acting, an okay plot, better characters, and the direction tries for the classic horror set up with its creepy tone. Stephanie Sigman playing the nun to the orphaned girls gave a decent performance. But Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman gave great performances as the orphaned girls. Miranda Otto absent for most of the screen time, hidden away in a room cause of some illness was also decent. Even, Anthony LaPaglia was okay as a grunt guy, who decided to host his house for the girls. The film is slowly set up. Yes, you get some cheap jolts and scares that try to get at you. It is slowly building up in the first hour of the film. It has the occasionally having characters see a creepy doll in the background or its head facing you. The climax is a payoff when everyone is at stake when the girls are trying to escape the house of horrors and appearances of some demonic being chasing them. It does put you on the edge of your seat thrills. Like most horror films, this one suffers from its typical clichés with its script. A house with several people living in it and a young girl gets chased in the middle of the night and starts screaming and making noise. And everyone is still fast asleep. She even gets tossed towards walls and across a room and no one wakes up. Must be some thick walls in an old house. Also, Janice is in a wheelchair and outside the house with several girls playing in a close distance. And some mysterious figure pushes Janice into a shack. And she is screaming as this is happening and the girls playing does not even notice her. Annabelle Creation is a fair horror film. May not be better than The Conjuring films. Definitely better than the first film. The acting and creepy direction is good. It does have a slow first hour of the film which can be boring at times. And have its clichés of stupid characters and no one noticing at close distance logical. It could have been a whole lot worse. I give the film 3 out of 5 stars.",Annabelle - Creation
37,filipemanuelneto,"Interesting, but in stark contrast to previous films.",6,8 August 2020,"After ""Annabelle"" turned out to be a terribly boring film, I thought it was very difficult to make it worse. So, I decided to see this film, which is basically a prequel or spin-off of that film... what this film does is to create a new story for the origin of the doll, which differs in everything from what we can see in ""Annabelle"": here , the doll was created by a couple who lost their daughter, something very distant from the satanic cults of the aforementioned film. The film also tells how the doll begins to put at risk a group of orphaned girls that this couple decided to welcome into their home.Directed by David F. Sandberg, the film works well, although it is not brilliant. The dialogues are sometimes weak and uninteresting, but the actors' work is satisfactory. Anthony LaPaglia is a good actor and does his job very well. The same can be said of Samara Lee, Miranda Otto, Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman. Stephanie Sigman is the actress who did the worst, exaggerating her character and never looking like a real nun. The characters also do not excel in complexity but they fulfil the basic requirements, and the material given to the actors was minimally good.Technically, its a beautiful film thanks to elegant cinematography, that knows how to use the shadows and make the best of a set that seems sinister enough, in a huge house virtually full of memories of the past. All the effects seemed to me to be well accomplished and realistic enough. The sets and costumes contribute a lot to create a threatening atmosphere and the soundtrack is impeccable.",Annabelle - Creation
38,TheMovieDiorama,Annabelle: Creation is a far superior sequel in every way.,8,2 March 2018,"I was one of those few that actually like the prequel to The Conjuring. It wasn't great I agree but I found it to be watchable and entertaining. Somehow, somewhere...we are presented with a sequel that betters its predecessor in every aspect. We had the same last year with Ouija: Origin of Evil. Interestingly, both these sequels have the same creepy girl. Coincidence? I think not. What David Sandberg was able to accomplish on a tight budget is quite the accomplishment. The story is a basic paranormal possession film that we've all seen before. What elevates this above many other mediocre horror films is the clean cinematography and intelligent scares. This is not just jump scare after jump scare (although let me be clear, there are loads of them), there are some genuinely clever tricks. Sandberg's camera movement was the conduit...*ahem*...and really plays with your mind. The POV camera shots kept me on edge, the slow panning was able to create suspense and, my personal favourite, focussing on the foreground when something moves in the background. You can't quite see it, it's blurry...so you look closer with intrigue...and then it gets you. Well, it got me every time. The acting all round was believable and little hints of character development or backstory are embedded within the script. You may not be emotionally invested with these girls, but they do have some depth. Annabelle herself? Itself? The doll? Whatever. Is put in great use here. She's kind of like that friend that you don't want to hang out with...but she's always there. The lighting was extremely well thought out, particularly on Annabelle where the light is shown on half her face in many scenes so that the rest of her is concealed in darkness. Some of the visual effects in the third act were slightly ineffective and certain aspects of the story were rushed, but that final act...relentless. 30 minutes of terror. Loved the continuity as well! All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this and is a ridiculously scary sequel.",Annabelle - Creation

The acting, the production, yes, even the story is okay to good but I have two main issues with the movie: the suspense level is low and the timing of the movie is bad, we get here and there the appearance of the evil spirit (and some killings) but there is no real rising/accelerating tempo and suspense-level, the movie babbles on and on and could go on forever.Well, if you like movies with evil spirits and haunted places (or dolls) you may watch, just don't expect something extraordinary that really creeps your nerves.",Annabelle - Creation

I have seen all 3 previous films so as an smart audience i expect an improvement than it's predecessor and Annabelle Creation has that improvement but doesn't meet that particular expectations level. Problem is, last film was The Conjuring 2 which was probably the Best film in The Conjuring Universe so watching Annabelle Creation after that Huge impact of The Conjuring 2 doesn't look much impressive but it doesn't completely disappoint you either. There are some scary moments which leaves you in jitters but after some time it becomes predictable and audience starts laughing. I was like, have i came to watch a comedy film? No way. It is enough Horrifying for weak hearted people and Girls but those who always enjoys horror flicks in theater without scaring much compared to others won't find it good enough and that's what exactly happened with me. Story too doesn't offer much, screenplay deserves to be better, Sound effects are kick-ass. You don't see much fight between demon and human (girls) at climax (this might be the Biggest disappointment for majority of audience) but still end was satisfying where most of the audience comes to know that this one is a Prequel. Direction of David Sandberg is weak compared to what James Van has done with The Conjuring and it's sequel. Overall Anabelle Creation is a Good, No, actually a Decent film and can be watched once (Mostly Female audience), but as a regular cinema audience i won't recommend it to you. If i have to review it in one line then i would say, ""Annabelle Creation is Better than it's predecessor but not at all close to The Conjuring 2.""

43,jtindahouse,Doesn't correct the mistakes made in the original,5,10 August 2017,"Going into 'Annabelle: Creation' I was hoping for one thing - another case of 'Ouija' where they got the original horribly wrong, but learned their lessons for the sequel and delivered a strong film. This was not to be the case unfortunately. Almost all of the problems with the original 'Annabelle' were again present here in the sequel.Firstly, let me say that I don't think a stand-alone film should ever have been made out of the character of 'Annabelle'. She worked perfectly in 'The Conjuring' as simply a gimmick. She never actually had to do anything in that film and yet people were still terrified of her. All they had to be was have a quick story told about what she was capable of. And that's how she worked best. As a terrifying myth. It's not until you actually make a movie out of her doing the things that you've talked about that you realise she isn't actually that scary after all. Just more of the same silly nonsense we've seen a thousand times before, simply with a slightly scarier looking doll than usual.Secondly, the lack of creativity in this film was astounding at times. The amount of clichés was beyond belief. Also the amount of times that they set up a scene to go a certain way, and you thought to yourself OK it looks like they're going to do this, so obviously they're going to do the exact opposite as a way to surprise the audience, but then it played out exactly the way it originally seemed it was going to go, were countless. There's no question that there's a lack of originality in the horror genre, but you can still do the little things to at least keep it mildly fresh for the audience.As far as how scary it is, I would suggest this was below par as well. I only counted once in the entire film where a jump-scare actually managed to give me a start. Considering the film is riddled with them that isn't a very good strike rate. Then I suppose it simply comes down to how scary you find the character of 'Annabelle'. That may be just enough to carry this film for some people.I did like the setting of the film. The middle-of-nowhere concept is a real favourite of mine in horror movies. I also found the acting to be above average, especially when you consider a large number of the cast were child actors who can often come across very poorly. For the most part though I'd have to call this a miss. There was a chance to right their wrongs from the original, and while it may be a slightly better film in a number of ways, it's still a far cry from being the complete 180 that 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' was.",Annabelle - Creation
44,jadavix,"Better, but still pretty average",6,12 February 2018,"During the first half an hour of ""Annabelle: Creation"", I knew I was seeing a far superior movie to the original ""Annabelle"", which I watched immediately before it. Toward the end, though, I realised that that was rather faint praise. Let's look at all the ways this sequel, or spin-off, or whatever you want to call it, is superior to the first movie:1. It is much better cast, with dependable character actors like Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto in background roles. The best characters, however, are played by the young girls, who do so much of a better job than the nobodies who fronted the previous film, despite being less than half the age of that pair. These young actors are able to carry the movie and generate sympathy. 2. In the first movie, we weren't sure if the doll was haunted, or evil, or both. We were never really invited to be scared of it, and weren't sure what we were supposed to be scared of. In this sequel, the doll is situated in a room the protagonists are forbidden to enter, but which the door to enter is sometimes mysteriously open. Just the establishment of the doll in this creepy, forbidden room makes it a million times scarier than it ever was in the first film.3. The setting of the original movie in the '60s seemed a bizarre choice which added nothing to the movie. It was more of a distraction than anything as you tried to work out why they went to the trouble of setting the movie in a bygone era without really taking advantage of that choice. ""Annabelle: Creation"" is again set in a bygone era, but this time that detail adds to the movie. The '50s seem like a lonely era in film. They're not the crudely vaunted halcyon days of peace and love. They're mannered and remote, stranding people on their own upon islands of loneliness caused by tragedy, race, and illness. The movie seems to take advantage of that, though it probably could have done more with it.It's hard not to praise ""Annabelle: Creation"" when comparing it to the useless film that preceded it, if not in timeline, then in order of release. But on its own, it's actually fairly average, unfortunately. The movie really starts to lose our attention toward the end, squandering the brownie points it'd earned leading up to that with its promising characters, actors and setting. It's unfortunately not particularly scary either.",Annabelle - Creation

Sometimes, sequels-or in this case, prequels-are not as good as the first one, but this one is definitely better. You get more background details. Anthony and Miranda are a married couple with a young daughter, whom they love dearly. After the daughter dies in a terrible accident, their loss is felt for about 12 years before they decide to bring some life back into their home by letting some homeless orphans stay with them for a while. Talitha and Lulu are 2 of the little orphaned girls, that are as close as sisters and they just love exploring their new surroundings. Anthony is a doll maker and the Annabelle doll is one of his creations-he made it for his now deceased daughter, but after her death, he put it away because it brought back so many memories. Well, guess who finds it? The little curious two want-to-be sisters. The doll is possessed with the spirit of the dead daughter and does not want to play nice. As in the first movie, the Annabelle doll does not come alive and move around like a person-or even like the Chucky doll. It does move mysteriously from one place to another but that's it. The scary part is when they show the evil spirit and what it can do. At the end, the movie connects nicely with about the first 15 minutes of the first movie by unveiling secrets to what went on and who certain people are. Make sure that you stay until after the end credits, too. There is a scene. It's rated ""R"" for horror violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Annabelle - Creation

However, things start to go awry when one of the orphans begins to sense an evil presence close by...Having seen and enjoyed Annabelle I went in with an optimistic mind-set when I sat down to watch this film, but sadly I didn't enjoy this film quite as much as the first film.. It begins well enough, but it does lack any real tension or suspense; it all feels rather mechanical and workman-like and the film failed to truly engage me at any point.
 
In fairness, the basic story behind Annabelle and its creation is mildly interesting, but unfortunately the film fails to do much with the concept and what you're ultimately left with is a film that isn't completely terrible, but at the same time one that isn't particularly scary (in fact I didn't even come across one cheap jump scare when watching this film which for me is unheard of in the Annabelle/Conjuring world).The acting is OK by all concerned and the story behind Annabelle is interesting enough, but it simply isn't particularly scary and for that reason it is a film that I simply couldn't recommend.",Annabelle - Creation

52,rgkarim,The Creation Of a Better Prequel!,8,10 August 2017,"So many years ago, the Conjuring dropped into theaters and opened up a movie universe that would bestow nightmares to the audience members who saw it. This weekend, the latest installment in this haunted world with Annabelle Creation. A prequel to the last film, this possessed doll continues to be a popular figure head in the occult series to warrant another film. Is this film a fitting addition to the franchise, or is it another money grabber fit to be lost in the horror archives? Robbie K here to help answer those questions and share some thoughts. Let's get to work. LIKES: Answers Questions: The first Annabelle gave the doll some basis and established her deadly legacy, but it lacked any true backstory of her creation. The prequel, as so titled, helped fill in the creation story and establish the origin to its possession. As the film progresses, more of the Annabelle's journey is revealed, alongside a closer look at the creature that uses it as a puppet. While not fully complete, we now have the connections needed to make sense of the first movie, and further engross us in the universe. Unfortunately, the name, the involvement, and other details of the demons still remain unanswered, but can be extrapolated with a dialogue hints. The Pace: Horror movies can have pacing issues at time depending on the story. Fortunately, Annabelle Creation's moves at a decent pace to maximize the movie. Slow enough to provide build up for the scares, but fast enough to keep everything moving and on edge, the production team did a nice job keeping you invested in the movie. There is little time between all the craziness, with just enough comedic relief to relieve the tension and keep things interesting. Scares: I guess we need to talk about the main element you go for these movies huh? The scare factor is at an all-time high in this movie, continuing the Conjuring's legacy of keeping things dynamic, fun, and suspenseful. Annabelle's creepy on so many levels, starting with the realistic setting to place the movie in. That realism and the use of shadows has your imagination on fire trying to fill in the gaps of what lurks in the dark. Once the subtle components are set, you can bet there a number of creepy tricks played in this film, alongside the fleeting glimpses of the demon that terrorizes the family in his cruel game. And of course, there is that doll. It's soulless stare and deceiving smile continue to give me the willies, and had a number of audience members using colorful language before involuntary rising from their seats. DISLIKES:Character stories: The movie had a lot of characters to play in our haunted setting. The protagonists of the film held a lot of potential to develop as characters, and unfortunately, they failed on that level. Sure, you can piece together the simple origins placed before you, but I would have liked more insight into the girls' origins or perhaps a little more integration of Bee into the writing to help maximize scares. With the conjuring able to unearth their demons and dreams in a quality manner, Annabelle should be able to mimic that magic. Scares do not equal perfect horror movie. Pointless characters: Remember the big family in the Conjuring and how each sibling, parent, and exorcist were part of the tale in some way. That's gone too. Annabelle Conjuring brought a large group into the home, but only about four-five of them have any real involvement in the plot. The underutilization of these characters tripped up the plot, made for ridiculous scenes that didn't have as much importance, and really left me asking, what was their point. One girl has just one line and a few stares at the camera. Why include them if you aren't going to use them to develop the characters, or at least try to work together to escape the demon's wrath. Predictability: Scares are getting easier to predict in this day and age. This is mostly due to the development team throwing their usual tactics into the mix to warn you of the impending jump scare. Annabelle Conjuring doesn't escape this trend and much of the scares can be seen a mile away in some form or manner. While there are a few moments that were good tries, the tactics got repetitive and/or cheesy to be laughable rather than fearful. Fortunately, some creepy special effects and the darkness offset this enough to still get under your skin thanks religion nightmare inducing series. The Verdict:Overall, Annabelle Creation is one of the better horror movies of the summer and perhaps this year. It is dark, creepy, and moves at that pace needed to keep you invested in the movie for the two-hour run time. In addition, the filling in gaps and hints start to connect the world (a very popular trend), which will have you die hard horror fans screaming in delight at both scares and plot. Yet, there are still elements of the story telling to clean up and utilizing your characters you bring in is a big step to improve on. In addition, I hope the next installment forgoes the predictable moves and gives us that kick I haven't seen yet. Considering everything, this reviewer recommends a visit to the theater for this one, assuming you are disturbed by spiritual haunting movies. My scores: Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0P.S. Stay for the end of the credits for some teasing.",Annabelle - Creation
53,vengeance20,A Solid Prequel,8,11 August 2017,"Having seen 2014's Annabelle which to be honest was mediocre at best, we get a prequel (not a sequel) to the 2014 film which branches out from ""The Conjuring Universe"" as it were. So just like with Ouija: Origin of Evil, this film is a prequel. Annabelle came out in the same Ouija did & that film was ace, despite the unacceptable hate it has for it.So this film tells the events leading up to the doll in the first place, basically. Annabelle is killed via getting hit by a car. Her father creates the ""Annabelle"" dolls. So although she isn't evil or vindictive, an evil spirit manipulates the grieving couple into thinking Annabelle wants to form of the doll so they can be together forever, when in fat its the evil spirit wanting to take human form instead, of the doll & then the girls later on in the film. So that's the sort of plot in a sense. The film was pretty good! Packed with jump scares! Gory enough! & well, was a bigger improvement to Annabelle in 2014, which wasn't all that great in all fairness! But it was OK to say the least! But I didn't care much for the sequel (prequel) as I more prefer slashers over supernatural type films! But upon learning it was a prequel it did sound somewhat interesting & wasn't going to get my hopes up for it! 100% on RT is a over statement, but this film was pretty sinister & dark! The end part which ties up the events from the first film was good, though I didn't know it was the stock footage from the first Annabelle film, until I realised but it was 3 years ago & I didn't care too much for the film. Overall, this was a pretty solid film! 8/10!",Annabelle - Creation
54,begob,Less worse - still not good,5,20 September 2017,"A girl afflicted by polio moves into a new orphanage, but things go bump in the night as the dark secret of the old couple who run the place seeks her out.Improves on the first movie - this is a prequel - but by how much? Again a lot of care is taken in creating the period feel, and there are plenty of jump scares, but this time the story powers to a climax rather than limping. The opening sequence is a neat bit of story telling, and there's plenty of material to work with from the setting of the big house to the array of characters.Problem for me is that the screenwriter - the same guy as for the first movie and, apparently, for the next one too - is not so hot. He has fertile territory in the group of young girls, but never really gets a dynamic going. There is a hand-over of heroines that's not done right. The old man doesn't do anything except shuffle about. Sometimes the dialogue is awful. And it's not an origin story, as the only thing we find out about the evil is that it's opposed to Christianity - no idea where it comes from.The direction is good, the performances are OK, and the music keeps us headed in the intended direction, but the story is so plain and the tension so slack that the long running time gets tiring. A few good scenes - sheet falls away, under another sheet with a torch, and finding safety in a bunk-bed - but the frights are not deep, and some are ruined by OTT CGI.Overall: If you've got the budget spend it on the writing first.",Annabelle - Creation
55,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Annabelle: Creation""- A surprisingly solid and wickedly entertaining prequel that provides creeps and shrieks aplenty.",8,14 August 2017,"Since the release of director James Wan's masterful tale of horror ""The Conjuring"" back in 2013, New Line Cinema has been working steadily to build and create an entire media franchise based around the world of Ed and Lorraine Warren and their various cases. While it is obviously an attempt to trade on the increasingly profitability of the many ""cinematic universes"" that have appeared over the past decade, I've been following the ""Conjuring Universe"" with some interest. Despite the fact that the films only use the allegedly true stories as a jumping off point and highly fictionalize the stories being presented, Wan's two main-series entries released thus far have been remarkable feats in modern horror. The same could not be said for director John Leonetti's 2014 spin-off ""Annabelle"", however. The film suffered from shoddy storytelling and a remarkably dull pace, so I had a degree of apprehension regarding the announced prequel that was finally just released this past weekend.But amazingly, my apprehension ended up being entirely misplaced, because director David F. Sandberg's ""Annabelle: Creation"" is just an absolute, unadulterated blast of old-school creeps and tremendous atmosphere! It corrects the course for this spin-off series and delivers a tale that stands proud alongside the two ""Conjuring"" films as one of the most entertaining mainstream ghost-stories of the past several years. Fear not fans of all things spooky and eerie... ""Annabelle"" has finally been given the film she deserves!The film follows a group of young orphan girls who have been displaced by the closing of their orphanage. Under the watch of the kind- hearted Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), the girls are welcomed into the home of the Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia, Mirando Otto), retired toy-makers whom have finally opened their home to the prospect of children twelve years after the tragic death of their young daughter Annabelle. However, not all is well. The Mullins are very reclusive and barely speak a word. Mysterious events begin to plague the children. And young Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson) seem to be the target of a malevolent dark force... a dark force that might be related to a mysterious doll they find hidden, locked away deep in the closet of Annabelle's old room...The strengths of the film come down to the fantastic use of atmospheric chills, the very solid visual direction and the talented cast of young performers. Director David F. Sandberg got his start in the world of micro-budget short films, but between ""Annabelle: Creation"" and his fantastic feature-length debut ""Lights Out"", he's proved himself to be a force to be reckoned with in feature-length terror. His camera- work is concise and often wonderfully kinetic, with gorgeous swooping cinematography that sets it apart from the shaky-cam nonsense that makes up far too much of the ""horror"" that's routinely dumped onto screens. He also knows how to build up the tension and atmosphere in a way that's utterly mind-blowing. Even if you can see the scares coming, they'll still get to you because Sandberg commands control of the audience. A scene in which the doll is seemingly moving about with a blanket draped over her in particular was just bone-chilling.The cast is also top-notch for this genre of film, and they all help to elevate the material. Bateman and Wilson in particular light up the screen as our two young leads. Both are fantastic child actors and come off quite naturally on camera. And both have promising futures if they keep up such great work. Sigman is a joy as the nun who takes care of the children, while LaPaglia and Otto turn in very good performances as the troubled Mullins family. Philippa Coulthard and Grace Fulton also do very well in their performances as two elder teens in the orphaned group, while Tayler Buck and Lou Lou Safran round out the group in decent but somewhat underdeveloped roles.If I were to pick on some of the films flaws, however, I do have to comment that at times, the movie replicates one of the more major flaws of the previous film- a pace that can drag quite a bit in key moments. I think this has a lot to do with writer Gary Dauberman, whom wrote both ""Annabelle"" movies. He's got a knack for structure and provides some really nifty horror set pieces for the cast and director Sandberg to sink their teeth into... But both films also feel like they're about ten minutes too long and a few scenes feel either superfluous or padded out needlessly. Especially during the final act. The climax of the film is remarkably tense, but goes on for a bit too long, to the point it starts to feel exhausting rather than terrifying. The sometimes wonky pace, in addition to a few scenes of overly robotic dialog do bring the film down a few points for me.Still, I can't say this ruined the film, because on the whole, ""Annabelle: Creation"" was just too much fun to worry about such flaws. The great cast, wonderful scares and top-notch visual direction elevated it, and finally gave the character the film she deserved. I'd very much compare it to last year's ""Ouija: Origin of Evil""- a similar prequel that improved over the original in every way. I give ""Annabelle: Creation"" an 8 out of 10.",Annabelle - Creation

60,arungeorge13,Atmosphere is eerie + a few meticulously crafted jump-scares! [+64%],6,18 August 2017,"'Annabelle: Creation', the prequel to 2014's 'Annabelle' is a notable improvement over its predecessor in a lot of ways. Firstly, the director David F Sandberg does not rely too much on cheap, predictable jump-scares to raise the viewer's anxiety levels. Even though the number may quite be on the higher side, these jump-scares at least carry a sense of meticulous crafting, supplemented well by pitch-perfect lighting and sinister-looking ambiance. The cinematography style is somewhat similar to what we've seen in the Conjuring films, and there are at least a couple of nods given to those films apart from various other horror flicks that succeeded in building an aura of terror and suspense such as 'The Evil Dead' series (""Your soul!"" - the only time we hear the demon speak in 'Annabelle: Creation) which obviously came across as slightly startling considering the differential tones of both films, 'The Haunting' in terms of terror-inducing atmosphere and Sandberg's own 'Lights Out' (the scenes at the barn especially). It is appreciable that the old-school horror vibe is maintained throughout the film - the setting is 1943 rural North America (which gives the crew a solid chance to make a period-horror piece), the story centers around the events that take place in limited surroundings (the house and the compound it sits in), and actors capable of pulling off queer performances (and they sure do!).It also helps that the horror overtones are simply not restricted to the Annabelle doll scaring the wits out of the residents of the Mullins' mansion; the attacks come from various directions (the minimal music is intense!), locations (the barn, the well, wardrobes, basement..all of it) and entities. Sandberg never allows the viewer to take their foot off the 'panic' pedal with onslaughts often popping in a two-(or even three)pronged approach.'Annabelle: Creation' also boasts of better writing (from Gary Dauberman) in comparison with 2014's John R Leonetti flick (there are no seamy exorcism scenes, phew!). This is strictly a stand-alone origin story that ties into the opening of 'Annabelle' in a cleverly constructed manner. Oh, not to mention the wink n' miss reference to 'The Conjuring 2's Demon Nun during a certain scene in the film (hint: there's a post-credit sequence as well which serves as a prologue for the 2018 standalone!). Lulu Wilson (Hollywood's new favorite horror-kid) and Talitha Bateman are impressive in their respective roles. Overall, I enjoyed 'Annabelle: Creation' for most part (even a little more than 'The Conjuring 2'), except during those moments when some of the characters make unruly decisions (on their own). Thankfully, post the first half hour, the writing/direction is sufficiently splendid to keep the viewer constantly on toes.Verdict: A prequel that displays a great deal of refinement!",Annabelle - Creation

No plans of stopping soon either because the third spin off, The Nun, is on its way next year. Over here, we got a prequel to the first spin off. Its not as confusing as it sounds actually. Overall, the film entertains like it needs to despite some gaps in writing.The film takes place in the 50's and follows a group of homeless girls who stay at a house owned by the parents of the original Annabelle. Their daughter Annabelle died years before and her spirit lives on in a demonic way and haunts those around it. And guess what? That Annabelle doll is front and center to it all. While the jump scares come exactly where you expect it to, I gotta say this film engages more than the first Annabelle.As mentioned earlier, the scares offer very nice imagery but they come right when you expect them to. I don't get scared at all with horror films so my opinion on whether films are ""scary"" or not wouldn't exactly replicate the sentiments of others. I will say though that the child actors do well enough to deliver a convincing good time. It may be better than its predecessor, however there are still plot points that don't make sense or aren't explained very well. Primarily, with the demonic presence and how it chooses its victims.The style of horror films changes every few years. While this film doesn't offer anything new or groundbreaking it makes for a decent time, which is all you could ask for. As expected there is a tie in to the first Annabelle and the next in the series, so be prepared for that. Overall, this will please die hard fans of the series and will leave a mostly positive impression on everyone else.

69,fernandoschiavi,"Annabelle 2 manages to prove itself as an above-average horror, and this is completely due to the visual quality and construction of the mood",6,16 June 2021,"Annabelle 2 is part of the universe created by the long Invocation of Evil, work by James Wan, being the spin-off sequence of this original work. The film goes on to investigate how the Annabelle doll was in fact become an evil dominated object. What is felt throughout this production is the weight of the franchise, of actually seeming to belong to a brand. As if it were a product from a fast food chain, all options have the same flavor. Thus, everything that revolves around Annabelle 2 makes reference to this well-marked marketing system, as if the film followed a series of requirements both for being part of the Conjuring franchise and for having to confirm its box office indicators. In this checklist of factors that the film must have, Annabelle 2 reveals its standardization system.If the synopsis can contain a very generic tone, it is also the great power of the feature, because despite the regrets Annabelle 2 has some virtues. It is good to remember that the best of horror comes in the way the films manage to deal with clichés, with images already assimilated by the audience. Here in the film directed by David F. Sandberg (When the Lights Go Out) and written by Gary Daubermann (from the first Annabelle) there is a whole preoccupation with that family's house. If in the first two copies of The Conjuring the houses are another character in the plot, here the same concept is used. Out of the houses and into its place a large, old and isolated farm, with its two floors and its mysterious rooms, as well as a well, a barn and a doll ""factory"" of the artisan who lives on the property, scenarios of important sequences of construction of terror.Throughout the film, it is commendable how all these environments are well explored and represent, in general, a heightened danger to the characters: the deceased daughter's doll room (the best sequence is when the various toys come to life alone, terrorizing the children of the local); the family wife immobilized on a bed and wearing a wooden mask over part of her face; and the girls themselves, alone in the world, brought up in a religious milieu who must struggle with an evil totally opposite to what they know. Interesting figures that surround the film with mystery, suspense, horror and the empathic force for audience adhesion.The first Annabelle (2014) was much more focused on scares than on building a really scary atmosphere, which annoyed a good part of the audience. The good news is that this has been fixed for the new story. And the main responsible for this is the director David F. Sandberg. Annabelle 2 relates much better to Evil Summoning and Evil Summoning 2 than to the first Annabelle, either in terms of narrative construction, or simply because it better develops this universe of horror produced by James Wan. Not only does it present easter eggs that indicate the world of the couple Lorraine and Ed Warren, it also goes further and brings reference to the future The Nun.Sandberg doesn't get the freedom to create something innovative, but sticks to the studio's rules. This, in turn, does not prevent delivering a skillful narrative to the audience. The production design work should also be highlighted. The costumes and makeup works are good, but it is impossible not to be impressed by the development of the sets, especially the house where the couple and the girls live. Each environment is very well thought out and even before the main threat appears, the public already knows that there is something strange about the place, mainly due to the number of crucifixes scattered around the house.The idea of exploring the beginning of it all is good, but it's hard to say the execution got it right: about 20 minutes of the entire movie are devoted to creating the doll. It is possible to see the story of two parents who, moved by grief, commit a potentially deadly mistake, but this is left in the background to highlight the relationship between protagonists Janice (Talitha Eliana Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson). One of the rules established upon arrival is not to enter the room of the deceased girl, Annabelle. It is a forbidden place that awakens curiosity and a sense of mystery. This soon arouses the girls' attention, especially Janice, a girl who suffers from the consequences of polio and uses a wheelchair to get around. She is sensitive and from the moment she arrives realizes that it is something strange in the home. That's how, over the 109 minutes, Annabelle: Creation will invest in scares and in the establishment of a somber atmosphere, built by the efficient direction of David F. Sandberg.The big question that remains is how these figures, these codes of horror, relate to the essence of the film. The answer seems to be just a maintenance of the product itself as hegemony in horror films, whether in what works or in ensuring the survival of its franchise. For example, there is an easter egg in the movie about The Nun, the next spin off of the franchise, something totally disposable in the film, just to whet the public's curiosity. Or also, a sequence shot in which the director locates the space of that orphanage, in a camera work extremely similar to what James Wan did in the first Evil Invocation, as if there really was a stamp formally identifying Annabelle 2 as a product of it. Brand.Thus, as an obligation, the film surrenders to clichés, everything takes on a well-known form, seen in the same way in so many other films - as in all of the franchise. The fear that revolved around the figure of the doll and the child is now associated with the appearance of a monster, with black skin, large fangs and all goo, a figure like any other, which prevents the viewer from filling the monster's role with what your imagination finds horrifying. Jump scares appear in droves, and fright, whether by a visual appearance or by a huge noise, are the only way to make horror found in the film. Even in this it is possible to find a very clear pattern: tense music, chase scene, the character stops in a safe place, the musical soundtrack stops, a few seconds later comes the scare. Strategy used to fatigue by Sandberg.It can be said that the film's brilliance is in the characters. Lulu Wilson-who hails from Ouija: The Origin of Evil (another prelude to a mediocre horror film that fared infinitely better than the original)-is pretty consistent in her role, creating a sweet and relatable girl. Talitha Eliana Bateman, on the other hand, gives a more dramatic air to the plot, without sacrificing a jovial and amiable manner. The gradual change of personality due to the events that affect it are believably accomplished. The dynamics of the two child actresses who are the practical protagonists of the narrative works very well. Another curious point was how the script, together with the delivery of child actresses Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman, worked to break the tension. Even in the moments that preceded the scares, a joke or facial expression broke the mood a little to convey a false sense of security and right after we were impacted by the movie's demon. Unfortunately, the other four young women are completely unleashed by the plot, without any narrative purpose. As for the Mullins, after the ramshackle prologue to Gary Dauberman's script (It: The Thing, 2017) takes them out of the picture, they're left with only uninteresting shreds of their participation throughout the rest of the story, and related interesting aspects the couple, like the mysterious mask worn by Esther, are resolved with very hasty solutions.This second Annabelle film revolves around just being able to play a trick on that viewer, where the fright ends in itself. Horror does not revolve around an essence or something deeper - and here not asking for an existential awareness or anything like that, but just a relationship between terror and the theme, something that doesn't seem to exist. The great proof of this are the final minutes of the film, where in a very few moments the film must explain everything, with a superficial dialogue about what happened to the dead girl, the family and the doll over the years. Annabelle 2 wastes all her time with scares, then suggests some narrative support for what was seen. It is as if the fright film and the explanation film inhabit two different worlds, where one is not directly related to the other. The fear in Annabelle 2 is not linked to a narrative or thematic structure, but rather to a series of easy technical procedures - the loud sound, the terrifying image of the monster that appears quickly on the screen, for example.With a predecessor rejected by the public, The Creation of Evil had everything to forget the doll's first film, leaving the story open and causing some temporal gaps. However, he does just the opposite of that, connecting his story and giving a new value to the first spin-off. This not only closes the doll franchise within itself, it also shows that the plans for this ""universe"" of Evil Summon are being revised, regardless of the profit. On the other hand, he makes interesting connections with the franchise's upcoming spin-off, aimed at the menacing Nun Valak from The Conjuring2.Annabelle 2 manages to prove itself as an above-average horror, and this is completely due to the visual quality and construction of the mood. It's notable that Sandberg relies heavily on Wan's practices - certain moments even seem like deleted scenes from an Evil Summon - but the filmmaker combines this with his own tricks by teasing the viewer's mind with weird out-of-focus reflections and movements. Although not as original and doesn't guarantee the same Evil Summon experience and its continuation, Annabelle: Creation is a pleasant surprise, that frightens and, unlike its predecessor, has a story to tell.",Annabelle - Creation

71,dave-mcclain,"Maybe the best of the four ""Conjuring"" films to date",8,11 August 2017,"The horror mystery thriller ""Annabelle: Creation"" (R, 1:49) is the kind of film Movie Fans don't see much of – in a few different ways. For one thing, this is a prequel to a spin off. That may not technically be a ""first"", but I can't think of another example of such a movie. ""The Conjuring"" horror mystery thrillers brought to the big screen a fictionalized version of the real-life experiences of 1950s-1980s Catholic paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (played in the film franchise by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). In 1970, the Warrens investigated the case of a Raggedy Ann doll which was supposedly possessed by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. The Warrens declared the doll to be ""manipulated by an inhuman presence"". They took it and put it in a sealed box in their occult museum in Connecticut where it remains. Filmmakers reimagined Annabelle as a creepy porcelain doll and featured it prominently in 2013's ""The Conjuring"". In 2014, the spin-off ""Annabelle"" hit theaters. Three years later the aptly-titled ""Annabelle: Creation"" tells an origin story that shows how the doll became evil. Another way that this film is unusual (at least, as compared with other horror movies) is that it's actually scary. The Mullins aren't the family they once were. In the early 1940s, Samuel and Esther (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) lost their 7- year-old daughter, Annabelle (Samara Lee), in a tragic accident. As they were still grieving, Esther was seriously injured and has been bedridden ever since. Samuel is only a shell of the happy and loving father and husband he once was. Nevertheless, 12 years after losing their little girl, Samuel and Esther decide that it's time for some good-deed-doing. They open their large farmhouse to six girls and their caregiver, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), when the orphanage where they lived closed. The girls range in age from about 7 to 17. The two youngest girls, Linda (Lulu Wilson) and Janice (Talitha Bateman), who wears a leg brace, are especially close, promising they will never allow themselves to be separated. Although they still hope to be adopted, all the girls love their new home.Yet there's still something ""off"" about the house – and it gets off- ier as the days go by. Samuel is kind, but gruff and the girls are basically afraid of him. They also wonder about his wife who rings a bell when she needs her husband and never leaves her room. Naturally, the orphans are curious about their new home and they're anxious to explore. As most of them run and play outside, discovering a dark sealed well in the process, Janice tries to enter an upstairs bedroom that Samuel sternly tells her is locked and never to be opened. Of course, strange sounds begin emitting from that room (at night) and when Janice approaches the door to investigate, she finds it unlocked. She enters, looks around and finds a creepy porcelain doll sitting in a chair inside a closet that is wallpapered with pages from a Bible. Janice closes the closet door, but it keeps opening on its own. A ghost-like figure from inside the closet approaches Janet, but then disappears. The scares just build from there and Janice becomes convinced that there is a demonic presence in that room and it wants her soul. She's not wrong. ""Annabelle: Creation"" is an engaging and well-crafted fright fest. It's a combination of ""Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death"" (although this movie doesn't suck), ""The Exorcist"" and a little ""Friday the 13th"" – and most will agree that it's an improvement on the first ""Annabelle"". The screenplay, by Gary Dauberman (writer of the original ""Annabelle"" and 2017's ""It""), gives us well-drawn characters and a mysterious story that keeps us guessing. (Sadly, the movie trailer gives away a major spoiler, but even if you know what that is, there are still enough surprises and twists to keep you entertained.) Incoming director David F. Sandberg (""Lights Out"") focuses on old-school scares which mix a few jump scares with disturbing images (made more effective my modern CGI), tension, suspense and even some gore (unlike the previous ""Conjuring"" films). As many movies as I see (including plenty of horror movies), I have to admit that at several points throughout this one, my mouth was agape (but I deny screaming – and anyone who says I did is probably lying to you). Enhancing those effects are solid performances, especially from LaPaglia and from Bateman, who delivers one of the most adept performances I've ever seen from a child actor in a horror film. Plus, her character's minor disability enhances her vulnerability – and the audience's sense of dread. Unfortunately, some brief scenes at the end feel extraneous, but this is still one legitimately entertaining and scary movie. ""A-""",Annabelle - Creation
72,swilliky,A haunting addition to the Conjuring Universe,6,11 August 2017,"Delving further back into the history of the cursed doll, the latest addition to the Conjuring Universe provides plenty of creepy scares and quality filmmaking that has become a feature of these films. David F. Sandberg directs the haunting tale of a family whose bargain with evil turns into a harrowing experience for the young orphans they invite to stay. Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto) and her doll maker husband Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) raise their daughter Bee (Samara Lee) out in an isolated house on a country road. When Bee steps out into the road in front of a speeding car and dies, they are overcome with grief. Twelve years later, they host a group of orphan girls who disturb the precautions they've taken to keep the forces of evil at bay.Janice (Talitha Bateman) is crippled from polio and has trouble using the stairs but a convenient chair helps her climb. They do all sorts of setup for various horrors to come as Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and the other girls explore the house included a dumbwaiter that continuously slams open and a creepy farmhouse full of doll parts. Janice's best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson) suspects something up as Janice becomes more enthralled with the locked room that used to belong to Bee. Janice opens a door to reveal a closet coated with Bible pages and containing the Annabelle doll locked away. Things start to go bump in the night and mysterious occurrences haunt the girls including a sheet mysteriously moving and the doll shifting around.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Annabelle - Creation

Several years after Annabelle is killed in a road accident, the couple open their home up to 6 orphan girls looked after by a nun (Stephanie Sigman). Soon after the girls are haunted by the apparent possessed doll that once belonged to Annabelle.Usually sequels move ahead in time, but in the ANNABELLE films they go backward. It's a less claustrophobic, but no less scarier film than the previous film, ANNABELLE (2014).

74,Darkside-Reviewer,Plot holes and Jump scares,5,29 July 2019,A prequel to the other movies in the Conjuring and Annabelle franchise this movie is sadly just what you'd expect it to be a pointless cash grab that adds nothing new or original to the franchise and attempts to tie the movie in with the others but fails massively with poor writing leaving plot holes and continuity errors.The movie follows an orphan child named Janice (Talitha Bateman) as she and a small group of other orphaned girls looked after by a Sister Nun arrive at there new orphanage where they have been invited to live by a man and his disabled wife who twelve years prior lost there child in an accident the girls are happy with there new home and settle in nicely until Janice enters the daughters old room which until now was locked and she awakens something evil hidden inside the house.The movie is shot and directed well with a typical creepy dark house atmosphere these kind of movies are known for with creepy music and sound effects.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys haunting and possession movies just dont expect the best Annabelle movie as this one is easily the worst of them all and isn't worth multiple viewings.,Annabelle - Creation

79,LoneWolfAndCub,Annabelle: Creation comes completely out of left field to deliver the goods,7,8 September 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is a prequel of a spin-off, a frightfully bad spin-off at that. Annabelle was a shoddy movie through and through, taking the premise of a haunted doll and turning into a yawn- inducing cliché filled mess typical of most Hollywood horror.When they announced a prequel I first thought: why? Why do a prequel to such a crappy film which was poorly received by critics and moviegoers? Why not just come up with something origin....hold on, we've heard this before haven't we? Anyway they went ahead with it and we have this, a movie for intents and purposes does not deserve to be this good!Annabelle: Creation shocked the hell out of me, and not just because it was scary, it was actually good. Yes there may be a reliance on jump scares and characters making silly decisions, and generally there are minimal surprises in the plot but what makes this movie good is solid cast, choice of setting and director David Sandberg's confidence in scaring us. Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto add a touch of class to an already solid cast, which makes the proceedings that much more interesting when you have characters you actually care about. Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman, the two young orphans who become the target of the doll, give great performances. The movie really rests on these two young girls, and the scares revolve around them, so kudos to these two for such a good job.The country setting is used very well here, the house is a character on its own and the certain scenes that solely rely on this house to scare really work. David Sandberg directed last year's Lights Out, a very successful film critically and with many horror fans. Although I found it only average I could see potential in many scenes. I think Sandberg has found his breakthrough film, or at the very least cemented himself as someone to look out for. He definitely knows what is scary, and how to use light to his advantage. The way certain scenes are framed to show us only certain things, or make us think we see something we don't is particular clever.Annabelle: Creation will not win any awards and nor is it the best horror film of the year but what it is is scary and at the end of the day, isn't this what horror is all about?7.5/10",Annabelle - Creation
80,Jithindurden,Simple but effective and better than Annabelle,6,29 December 2017,With all its old-school horror tropes and simple plotline it really works. Much better than Annabelle and Lights Out.

81,dilipbts,Annabelle creation,3,10 June 2020,"I first want to gloss over Ouija: Origin of Evil, as Annabelle: Creation is heavily inspired by that film. It's a 1960s R-rated horror prequel to a lackluster origin film starring Lulu Wilson based on possession & exorcism, ultimately tying in strongly with its predecessor. As I felt Origin of Evil had strong plot development, acting (though Wilson isn't the standout here that she was in O:OoE), cinematography, and overall eeriness, I could say most of the same things for Annabelle: Creation, though I find them all just a notch below.Given the time period that this film takes place, the technology that was present served this film very well in the throwback sense, either because it doesn't make the characters too idiotic to not rely on their technology more often, or it doesn't allow the supernatural to manipulate their technology too much to the point of ridiculousness. Even traditional items like a bell (similar to The Uninvited), a well (similar to The Ring), or a dumbwaiter (many horror films) work because of the particular time period that it's in and add to the atmosphere the film builds up. Several elements like this were heavily in play and made for a fun setting.Here's where I have a mixed bag of positive/negative, and it has to do with the direction. James Wan is clearly a heavy influence for David Sandberg (Lights Out), but part of me feels like Sandberg and crew watched Wan's Conjuring films, created a checklist, and tried their best to check all of those boxes. It makes for great horror, but part of it makes me feel like I've seen it all before. If Wan was directing, I think he would find a new way to shoot certain scenes and present certain items. Given the setting I was referring to before, I saw all of the foreshadowing coming into play a bit too easily. It's like it was all on-the-nose. You also can telegraph all of the jump scares. That doesn't mean they weren't still effective and that the film wasn't still scary on its own (trust me, there are plenty of non-jump-scare moments that are still very good), but I feel like I just saw a Wan copycat instead of Wan himself is all. I mean that's not a bad thing, because I considered Wan as the new master of horror before he decided to become an action director. Just food for thought is all.Now I will give Sandberg some credit. He played with out-of-focus scenery more than Wan had in the past, making us look in the dark areas or the background to see if something was lurking about. I also think he included more shock factor regarding when things can occur (daytime, early stages of the film) and how at-risk all of the children really were, making them all vulnerable to victimization by injury, possession, and/or death. I also think that without a star-studded adult cast it was a lot easier to give the child actors a lot of limelight, to the point that I knew all of them really quickly (in The Conjuring, I couldn't tell you a single one's name as they were more pawns for Wilson and Farmiga). Every so often he would let the camera cut away for the scary thing to appear/disappear/move and such, but then sometimes he would just say ""screw it"" and do it right in the shot just to mess with the audience, who was thoroughly engaged in this film from start to finish.The thing I think most people have to remember about this film, which I sometimes forget myself, is that Annabelle is just a doll... creepy looking, but just a doll nonetheless. She's not like Slappy or Chucky, where the doll is the soul in and of itself. The doll may act as a conduit for the demon however; we have known this since The Conjuring. However, this demon can also do it in its own form, or into a human, or anything else that it wants to... even more than one place at a time. Makes it kind of strange that Annabelle still remains the highlight of the film by the title, but these films are less about the doll and more about the entity, and that's fine with me. I just have to keep reminding myself th",Annabelle - Creation

This is a film that is exponentially better than its predecessor in virtually every way. This film is also, sadly, missing the Ed and Lorraine Warren characters, but it makes up for it by providing a story that stands perfectly well on its own without their involvement.

Plot takes place in In 1943, dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) he made Doll Annabelle and he has a wife Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto)their daughter Annabelle ""Bee"" Mullins is daughter who actually got hit buy car and died Twelve years later, in 1955, Samuel opened their home to provide shelter for Sister Charlotte and six girls left homeless by the closing of their orphanage Janice is girl who can't walk well,Linda, Nancy, Kate,Tierney,Carol were staying at Mullins invited them over to stay turn into their own Orphanage the movie is scary but wasn't that scary as first and second Conjuring movies in my opinion in my fear i think Conjuring 1 and 2 is scary then Another 2 Annabelle films the Annabelle films still has silly jump scenes witch i don't care about jump scenes there's no need to have jump scenes in movie needed i think it's stupid why do i need to have horror movie to be jumped in air when anyone can be scared of something ? the story followed it well like there is problems i have is silly bit like when Janice was getting attacked buy ghost ? and everyone else is deep hardcore sleeper i am like no one heard that no like wakes up say what was that i am like dam the people in house never hear or anything screaming or banging noses i am they still sleep deep sleepers can't hear anything. Given the time period that this film takes place, the technology that was present served this film very well in the throwback sense characters a bit idiotic witch like example sister Charlotte never noticed that nun in the photo before that is Valak appearing in picture witch she didn't know who that was ? i am like she brainwashed never knew who that was or never release anything on picture ? i am like why doesn't story take Charlotte to her church group of sister tell who was that ? its her picture if it was mine i would have crapped my pants. and another thing Samuel stopped making dolls altogether after his daughter died? What did he even do then for a living? He had already boxed Annabelle up-- what was the point of unboxing her and keeping her? Sounded like he was an up and coming toy maker and had a big order to fill, but instead his daughter dies so he holds onto the one doll that he made (which has no correlation to his daughter in any way) and that's the vessel she chooses to inhabit. Right. i was so confused. an creepy scenes help give this movie the scary edge some scenes were scary actually and intense like makes keep you watching until you don't know what is going to happen there's not much to say about movie and also it's before the opening scene of first Annabelle so thank god theirs no sequel for 3rd Annabelle i am more happy to see Nun spin off to Valak the director is noting special the previous movie lights out witch is noting special to me i thought it sucked. not my cup of tea of film lights out i thought it was smart writing of film. this 1.10 not great movie in Conjuring history i thought it it needs to be a bit better i was annoyed of actor Anthony LaPaglia with is voice work is discount Liam Nesson with his deep voice really gives me a headache like no one notice his voice is sounds like Liam Nesson iswear watch trailer i never watched trailer because it spoils everything i just payed ticket for 13 dollars that's it watched movie found out myself. but another hand i didnt like movie i like the story takes place way before first Annabelle and years years years before Conjuring witch i like more then this it didn't need a movie about i like back story but the all movie is not really watching Thousands of times it's not really boring but i think the first Annabelle is bit boring and then this too but it's gets to good when story gets to end becomes more interesting film is OK but i can't wait for Nun with cool name Valak i thought Annabelle creation should been first movie mixed together with first Annabelle, then no sequels.",Annabelle - Creation

89,EthanBJones_03,Recommended - if you like horror movies,7,15 October 2017,"​'ANNABELLE: CREATION' - 2017Direceted by Benjamin WalsfischStarring Tabitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson and Stephanie SigmanPlot Overview: ​Former toy maker Sam Mullins and his wife, Esther, are happy to welcome a nun and six orphaned girls into their California farmhouse. Years earlier, the couple's 7-year-old daughter Annabelle died in a tragic car accident. Terror soon strikes when one child sneaks into a forbidden room and finds a seemingly innocent doll that appears to have a life of its own.Horror movies are the worst thing is existence for me. Because if it is good and I feel scared, then I don't like it. I don't like that feeling. But if the movie is bad, then I just wasted time watching it. SO, I get NO pleasure from finishing a horror movie and therefore cannot stand them. I hate this movie. But that is because it is good. It is a genuinely creepy, and at times pretty scary, horror film that does what it says on the tin: makes me horrified. SO, I cannot stand this movie and will NEVER watch it ever again. But if you're THAT type of sicko, then please feel free to watch it.For me, this movie has no positives. But the main one for horror fans will probably be the fact the movie is genuinely creepy. Walsfisch's impeccable use of musical cues and sound effects create a truly creepy and frightening experience. Music in this movie is probably the best thing I can say about it. The use of it throughout the first 2/3 of this movie is spectacular and it is used to the highest degree of effectiveness, to create an eerie, tense atmosphere. Truly excellent use of music.As for other praise, the performances were also pretty great. In fact, I wouldn't say there was a single actor in this movie that disappointed me or was lacklustre, which is especially impressive when you consider the fact that most of the cast consists of children. Obviously, the stand outs are probably Tabitha Bateman's performance as Janice and Lulu Wilson's performance as Lidna. Both of these girls carried the movie for me and did excellent jobs. I commend both the girls for doing it to the standard that they did.The cinematography and editing are also excellent. It is a gorgeous looking movie and provides some very impressive and visually interesting camera angles. Some cuts are used for cheap scares and that is not okay but this is used sparingly and the vast majority are just used to knit shots together.As for flaws, the script comes to mind. Both the story and characters were very poorly written and crafted. Minimal effort was clearly put into these characters and you can really tell by the pure laziness and excessive lack of intriuge. The climax was also very weak and just threw a bunch of rubbish together in an attempt to scare the audience. Did it work? I am not denying that. But I scare easily so there is that. Despite this, the random mishmash of erratic plot threads and characters converging together makes the last act of this movie very dull and uninspired. That, and the characters are dumber than a brick wall. They are so stupid that words can not comprehend it. 'Sure, let's break the ONE rule the man who owns the CREEPY house COMMANDED and ORDERED us to ABIDE'. Jesus! Stop using stupid characters in horror movies! It ruins films!!!!!But in conclusion, I recommend 'Annabelle: Creation' if you like horror movies. It has some effective scares and a very slow and gradual buildup of tension that, unfortunately, results in a weak and manufactured finale. But, the music, performances and cinematography are enough for me to recommend the movie. I'll rate it 7 'YOUR SOULS' out of 10!",Annabelle - Creation

I'm livid now, because these so called ""horror"" films are not even trying to entertain the audience anymore, but just rather pay satanic homage to their god. The characters and plot was simply garbage in the basement and the acting was terrible.This was my last horror...ble film that I will have spent money on for a movie ticket. I'm now boycotting the theater, when it comes to horror films, and I'll just wait to download it online.

Music are playing in the night and nobody Wakes up. Even the Childs that has known either for a long period, doesn't have normal conversations to either. everybody follows the same IQ. It doesn't matter what happens in the Movie. It's so predictable and boring and done to Death that the Movie feels Snail paced and sloooooow. Nothing gets anywhere, nobody acts or say anything remotely interesting. These types of Movies are horror for those who very easily get scared and don't get the genre. they see these type of Movies cause the Word gets around. Just like Annabelle (the doll) who derives from conjuring fame. Pointless inartistic and without any atmosphere or own identity.

94,Mike_Devine,"An improvement from its predecessor, but far from perfect",6,2 December 2018,"One of the latest entries from the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren - 'Annabelle: Creation' - takes audiences to the origins of everyone's least favorite possessed doll.Directed by David F. Sandberg, 'Creation' takes place in the rural farm fields of the Mullins, a God-fearing couple who are dealt multiple tragedies and take in a nun and her orphan girls in an effort to be good samaritans. Of course, if there's a cursed, creepy doll hanging out in the house, odds are one of these girls is going to find it. Sure enough, all hell eventually breaks loose.Unlike its duller, more formulaic predecessor, 'Creation' feels much more like a traditional horror film, filled with the kinds of scares you're likely to see in an entry from the 'Conjuring' universe. What makes the film even better is the fact that its main stars are children, as everything seems scarier through their eyes, but they are also shown to be stronger than many who are four or five times their age. At the center of the film are really the two youngest orphans in the troupe - polio-stricken Janice (Talitha Bateman) and the kind-hearted Linda (Lulu Wilson) - and they both deliver in their respective roles. Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto also do not disappoint as the grief-stricken hosts, and Stephanie Sigman fits the bill as the young Sister Charlotte.Still, 'Creation' is not perfect. Part of the reason why 'The Conjuring' and even its direct sequel resonated with audiences was because a lot of the scares were not seen, only implied. Here, we see a lot more in front of our eyes, which kind of takes away from the full effect.Regardless, 'Annabelle: Creation' does a good job connecting the films in this series together, and if nothing else, will be viewed as an improvement over the original.",Annabelle - Creation

Even though it's the second, it happens before the first, and the movie has a script, and it's well- crafted and well-developed, even full of jumpscares and ex-machina features, but at least we have development and linearity. Annabelle already in her 3-minute trailer tries to give at least a 5 ""nudges"" in the viewer, and the one in the movie is no different, the rhythm is broken every 3 minutes in the attempt of a fright that the viewer already expects, completely damaging a script that in its essence is even good, this is the evil of the ""premature ejaculation"" of horror movies currently that kill climax and tension in exchange for a silly nonsense that often turns out to be funny rather than scary. Technically the film is stable, has a great costume, a cool setting, a clear photograph (instead of the traditional depressives), and the film even has good performances, but unfortunately, still stuck in the art of being a movie to get kids pro cinema, do not discuss anything, nor try to give fear, just scares, the long seems to try to be something different, but ends up being more of the same.",Annabelle - Creation

I remember that there were the scenes which were really creepy, but on the other hand there were some very cheesy scenes too.The most intriguing part for me was the nun. We only know that she was in Romania and that she has a strange photo where some kind of entity is kinda visible on it. The film ends with scene from Romanian church?! I heard there will be a spin-off called the Nun. This might be interesting.All in all, quite a good film for what it is.

It succeeded in horror, story and especially style, while offering enough material for spinoffs.The first off course being Annabelle, which was a B movie compared to Conjuring. Somehow, for completely mysterious reasons, the failed prequel got another prequel for itself. That prequel is Annabelle Creation. Strangely enough, AC felt like an A movie, with decent, and predictable but effective storytelling and build-up to scare effects.Luckily no time is wasted on unlikable characters and unnecessary or uncreative retellings of origins. The origin part is kept short and simple, so the movie kept a nice pace to an acceptable conclusion. While doing so, the movie still found opportunities to hint to other familiar guest characters and maybe even new ones, like the Crooked Man in Conjuring 2.So in short, AC offered nothing new, but it did wash away the stench of Annabelle, and it made me curious for the next spinoff surprise.",Annabelle - Creation
101,Darkjak007,The prequel we should've gotten the first time,7,20 May 2021,"Directed by David F.

After A couple loses their daughter in an accident 12 years later they decide to open their home up to an orphanage of girls And a nun in the countryside. Things slow start to take a drastic turn when one of the girls named Janice find the key to a lock closet and opened it to find it lined to the brim with bible pages and a doll. This movie is a prequel that is deserving of the title it actually gives an explanation to Annabelle what this doll is and how it came to be and make the movie seems alert is it actually feels as if the doll actually has an impact this time as oppose to just sitting there and stare it and you know what's happening and you feel the overall presence. It's slow paced and builds up with the added help of us setting taken place at a farmhouse in the countryside similar to the conjuring it's isolated and it's far away from outsiders. The film also doesn't rely heavily on jump scares it makes a clever use of the dark shadows the subtle silence you can see figures in the dark that blend in nicely. They do a great job of not over showing the demon but still gives the feeling of it being here. The characters are good you got the adults and the children and the religious figure with the Nun this is probably the one film spin off that actually feels connected to the conjuring movies. With the way it's shot and composed, The girls all do a decent job but apart from Linda and Janice the other girls seem to just fall in the background until things start to happen to them.",Annabelle - Creation
102,shobanchittuprolu,"Annabelle Creation is a strong proof that even during the crappy horror times,there comes a film to scare the hell out of you.A Must Watch for horror fans.",8,10 December 2017,"Annabelle Creation (2017): Creepy dolls have always held a special place in the hearts of horror fans. Whether it's the wisecracking Chucky from the Child's Play series or the clown doll from Poltergeist; scary movies and creepy kids' toys go hand in hand. However, horror fans have never seen anything quite like The Conjuring's Annabelle.For some, ever since the demonic doll first turned up in cameo in Wan's original, this would be the installment they've waited for.But unfortunately Annabelle stand alone film in 2014 is so disappointing as the 10 min version in The Conjuring is more scarier and interesting than the 1hr40min 2014 version.But when I found out that Annabelle's prequel is going to be directed by Light Out fame David F.Sandberg,my hopes are high. So did the film meet my expectations? Plot: Taking place a decade before the events of the original Annabelle (and long before she fell into the capable hands of Ed and Lorraine Warren), Annabelle: Creation chronicles the birth of the titular doll, as well as her first set of victims. When Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia) and Esther Mullens (Miranda Otto) lose their young daughter Annabelle in a freak accident, they turn their remote farmhouse into a home for orphaned girls in an attempt to fill the void. However, things soon take an incredibly dark turn at the Mullens house as a dark force begins to take a liking to best friends Janice (Talitha) and Linda (Lulu Wilson), and the girls find themselves in a desperate battle to save their souls.My Review: A good horror movie makes your heart leap out of your chest while simultaneously tugging at your heartstrings. And we're happy to report that Annabelle: Creation, the fourth installment in The Conjuring franchise, is emotionally potent and downright scary.David F.Sandberg proved that he is one of the genre's best up-and-coming directors.When I watched Lights Out,I thought that the scare scenes are effective but felt repetitive towards the end.But David F.Sandberg didn't repeat that mistake here and surprisingly he generated one of the most effective scares in recent times.Annabelle Creation is one of the rare movies where no scare scenes looks same and each one is a masterstroke.Horror is a legitimately hard genre to pull off, and it's fascinating to watch Sandberg maximize Annabelle: Creation's scares with little more than an out of focus figure lurking in a background, or the sound of footsteps racing up the stairs in a darkened house.He used lot of new mechanisms which gave a new feel to horror especially chair-elevator contraption for the stairway.Most importantly, the sound designers and the cinematographer, deserve much applause. The sound design and editing, and the cinematography, are flawless. Eli Roth once said, and I'm paraphrasing, a horror movie ceases to become scary, if the sound is removed. He couldn't have put it more perfectly. The sounds in the movie alone are enough to put anyone on edge. The music just adds to the visceral impact of the ambient noise.And the cinematography is immaculate. Beautiful shots, some tracking shots, (there have been a lot of these post Birdman), and some striking imagery, lend gravitas to the movie's proceedings. Especially the scene where Linda takes Annabelle into the field in midnight is one of the best nail-biting scene I had ever seen.Performances are effective and especially Lulu Wilson is amazing more than the possessed girl Tabitha. As two best friends fighting to stay together in the face of unspeakable evil, these actresses exhibit fantastic chemistry, and they both do a phenomenal job of conveying fear, strength, and sadness in the film's most intense scenes.But the major drawback is that Annabelle Creation has same horror routine clichéd plot.It's nowhere as dread inducing as 2016's The Witch, or as wildly different as this year's Get Out, but it does so much right, one can't help but be legitimately surprised, at how good it is.Like many entries in The Conjuring universe, Creation suffers from a third act problem in which the scale of the threat posed by the ominous force abruptly spirals out of control. At that point, the movie often goes more for terror thrills than the nail-biting tension that makes the first two acts work so well, and the film starts to place a heavier emphasis on CGI and direct shots at monsters to get the audience riled up.So,Annabelle Creation is a strong proof that even during the crappy horror times,there comes a film to scare the hell out of you.A Must Watch for horror fans.My rating 8/10",Annabelle - Creation
103,trublu215,Leaps and Bounds Better than Annabelle,7,16 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation probably had all of you pondering the very thought of this horror universe and whether you could take it seriously or not. Derived from the brilliant 2013 horror film from James Wan, The Conjuring, Annabelle initially underwhelmed when the original hit theaters in 2014. However, cast all your doubts aside for this one. Annabelle: Creation is a solid throwback type of horror film that actually makes its jump scares work and doesn't rely on any forced drama or ridiculous exposition to get its point across. By many traditional standards, this film shouldn't be as good as it is but (thankfully) it is.Telling the origin story even further, we're introduced to when the doll became an evil force rather than the banal story that was trying to be told before. Creation doesn't hold back. It is an origin story and it isn't afraid of being exactly that. It works for the film and it makes for some pretty interesting plot twists along the way. That's the beauty of this. Directed by David F. Sandberg, the director of last year's surprisingly great horror film Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation is a classical horror film that will bring fans back to the roots and will make casual audiences squirm in their seats and jump at every thud and creak. Overall, this is a rare horror prequel that works and works very well. If you're a fan of ghost movies and paranormal horror then Annabelle: Creation is a must see.",Annabelle - Creation

It was not the best horror movie, but it was not certainly that bad, cause we've all seen way worse horror movies than Annabelle. But now, seeing it from this point of view, after watching this prequel, I understand that it really wasn't a good movie, because this one is better by a mile. Altho the decision making is as bad as it can get in a horror movie, plus the cringy dialog that is also present, this movie deserves the respect that it got after it's release. The movie is full with scary scenes and tension throughout the whole 100+ minutes, with the acting being as good as it can be, especially from the little kiddos. For a movie that came from a 15 mill. budget and made 300+ mill. box office, it is a real success that deserved it's glory.

Even when you can spot the gimmicks from a mile away, ""Annabelle: Creation"" hits the horror notes it's aiming for. The movie falters towards the end with a predictable prologue that tidies up the sequel and original with a tidy bow that might make logical sense, but which lessens the impact of the story's ending but also allows the franchise, should it be greenlit for another sequel, to move forward in the future. Annabelle: Creation works because it doesn't rely on your knowledge of the doll's presence in either The Conjuring or the previous Annabelle.

108,rlaine,"Quite well made, but also quite average",5,14 June 2018,"I watch most horror movies that pop up on Netflix etc. Not splatters tho, but this kind of stuff that put emphasis on scary rather than blood and gore. I'm not sure if I ever saw the first Annabelle, but I really enjoyed The Conjuring movies. I guess these movies belong in the ""same universe"", but I can't even remember which movie was Insidious and which was The Conjuring, so it doesn't really matter to me that much.6.6 score had me waiting for a better than average movie, but I'm not quite sure it deserves that high a score. This is not a classic by any means. It's well made for sure, very nicely shot, scary and atmospheric and a good watch, but if you look any deeper, it really isn't anything special. Considering this movie is about the creation of Annabelle, that whole subject is very briefly handled and it takes a lot of time before they cover it. And it's done with a couple of sentences as a told story and a few quick flashbacks, so this movie isn't even about the actual creation. This movie happens 12 years after the creation of Annabelle if I understood correctly.Acting is both good and mediocre. Actually the kids pull off much better performances than Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto. On the other hand most of the actors are quite unnecessary in this movie, it would've worked better IMO, if there only had been two kids instead of many more. Most of the orphans don't serve much purpose here.There are plenty of why's and not very logical things in the script which have been covered in other reviews. These are what drop the score in my case a lot. The biggest question mark in my case is probably who or what actually possessed Annabelle and what was the motive. I understand the parents made some kind of a pact with the devil (?) to get their daughter back, but it's so vaguely handled that it leaves a lot of questions. How and why did the ""devil"" jump around from possessing the doll, Janice, scarecrow etc. What was it up to, killing people just for the fun of it? Maybe this is explained in this or another movie, but I've missed it then and now.Ok watch, but try not to think too much while watching.",Annabelle - Creation

110,FelipeCarrillo,James Wan's Toys,8,4 September 2017,"""The Conjuring"" is characterized by deploying a delicious preparation to reach the point of shock, the long and disturbing is that path and less info is released to the spectators, using any kind of infantile apprehension, the better the effect will be. So, on this occasion, Sandberg, besides considering the darkness as a key piece, uses dolls, puppets, scarecrows, silhouettes under sheets and even nuns in order to, verbatim, fill up with jump-scares the second and third act, indubitably, most of these apply the previously exposed rule, optimizing the results, however, the story tends to lose and even to squander the impact of the scare, making us doubt about where the characters are really going, and not predicting their actions that can be intercepted by a superhuman entity. This tendency becomes more prevailing due to the inexperience of the director, never in the horror genre, but in the layer of the franchise, aptitudes that he exhibited almost with vainglory the Malay director. Nevertheless, there is no reason to complain, many more gruesome things could happen in the film, and what Sandberg has conceived is a mixture of Hollywood and horror of quantity and quality in its purest state.Broadly speaking, the plot and the mythology are adequately connected, dramatic moments are fairly placed among sequences of distress and it even resorts, with evident respect, to the alternation of emotions technique that Wan established in ""The Conjuring 2 "", interspersing horror intervals with modest but substantial comical interventions. The development flows smoothly and there are no major drawbacks to the sub-universe that builds, however, the elements relapse into unending stereotypes, such as obligatory religious presence on the part of the nun or the increase in mortality in the final act, eliminating characters without any motive, an insane movement to some extent. To grip audiences, writers must produce characters that are interesting and this universe knows that very well. A pregnant woman, a ruined family or a girl suffering from polio are people with any kind of disabilities used in order to originate grief, a feeling that allows to strike up in a strong character-spectator relationship, getting we follow horrified the troubles experienced by the actors. Another very present aspect is the exorbitant amount of horror lodestones with which the film plays, although incredibly most of the demonic entities of the previous films won their own movie, Sandberg's movie seemed to want to do the same thing, packing with out-of-control Dantesque creatures, something works against the final result, since if they skip three of them, it would have been a frightening trip in the same way.Stephanie Sigman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto portray the older characters in a fascinating way, applauding the first one as the leader and faithful protector of the girls, however, and not belittling their very decent performances, the interpretative focus is explicitly over the younger actresses, especially Lulu Wilson, who did a spectacular job last year with ""OUIJA: Origin of Evil"" and this time ratifies her potential and ability to execute harder scenes with the most disinterested ease.Visually, the production design and the atmosphere testify the measured budget, moving away from large cities that would have required a lot of more adaptation from the 50's and thus a rise in the cost, this time everything acquires a rustic and powerful nuance, the housing trapped under litigant solar rays, a group of clothing, decorations and practical effects are those who take those green dollar bills. The game, in which darkness and cool and warm colors intervene, works in the tension moments, also the sequences of habituation and drama manage to catch the audience, components nothing short of stunning by employing an ordinary bed, a room armored by the pages of the Sacred Scriptures or an enigmatic well to conceive horror. Exclusive distinction deserves creation of the dissimilar Dantesque conduits maneuvered by an already classic Satan, which fulfill their function with honors, causing the possibility of—Hollywood is a box of surprises—adding more standalone films in it.There is a striking absence of the compositions of master Joseph Bishara, who was a key factor in the success of the other installments, among these ""Insidious"". The music is vital in products like these, sound stridency, resonances or atmosphere scores created by the composer are unique and they are greatly missed here, at least, so that sorrow is not so sharp, Bishara was present in the motion picture, for he's who performs the wicked devil. However, Benjamin Wallfisch and the sound editors team up to produce a soundly effective experience, accentuating steps, crunches, breaths, tones and suffocating sequences in a surprising way.""Annabelle: Creation"" by David F. Sandberg is one of those rare, functional and spooky sequels/prequels arriving late summer and in the 21st century, two periods thirsting for original ideas, being an excellent film that joins the universe of ""The Conjuring"" with complacency. Although to narrative dimensions doesn't equal the main films, but it gets to execute sequences of tension and drama using as a means the most intrinsic fears of human, taking them even to such a pass that you will be impossible to take a breath, literally, look left and there's a scare, look right there's another scare, look up, down, in any direction, this evil circus won't stop attacking until committing its purposes. Advocating for old school horror, ""Annabelle""(2017) is the perfect addition to the world of devilish toys and to verify its veracity I invite you to carry out the following experiment: Turn the light off, leave your bedroom door open and don't stop looking at that black space that separates your bed from hell, is she there?",Annabelle - Creation

112,Jared_Andrews,"Too boring, too predictable",6,2 September 2017,"If you haven't watched the first Annabelle movie and you want to see Annabelle: Creation, don't worry. You can skip the first one, and you definitely should skip it. The movie is a train wreck.Since this movie is a prequel to the previously released Annabelle movie, the end of Creation (fake spoiler alert because this isn't actually a spoiler because it's super obvious) leads into the other Annabelle movie. So, if when you watch the end of Creation you wonder, ""why did the story end that way?"" Just Google the opening of the other Annabelle movie and find out. Or don't bother. You'll be fine either way.Okay, now that that's out of the way, we can begin.Director David F. Sandberg's greatest skill is his ability to craft compelling stories that lure in audiences, put them on the edge of their seats then scare the crap out of them, all in the span of about two minutes (for proof, check out his YouTube videos).He doesn't waste anyone's time. He knows the viewers are here for a quality scare, so he doesn't bother with empty moments of unnecessary setup. He leaps right into the scares. I commend him for that approach. Seeing him execute this style numerous times is what makes Annabelle: Creation so disappointing.The first 20 minutes reveal the difference between this all the other of Sandberg's films—nothing really happens. Sure, there is a crucial plot point and the stage is set. But that all could have taken place in a few measly minutes. I don't know why this movie dragged out multiple stretches, especially the beginning. I was legitimately bored at times; that's a bad sign when watching a horror movie.In addition to the movie containing too many extended empty stretches, it was also far too predictable. At times, I called sequences shot-by-shot. I'm decent at predicting plots in movies, but I'm no genius clairvoyant, so if I can tell what is about to happen, that's another bad sign.To be fair, certain moments are frightening. Sandberg adroitly utilizes frames with dim focuses and pitch-black backdrops that cause viewers' eyes to dart between the trembling character and what may be lurking in the shadows. He mixes in a thoughtful blend of jump scares and moments of dread that terrify because of the anticipation of what is about to happen.If you're not sure what the difference is between the two types of scares, imagine this: you're washing your hands at work and a spider suddenly crawls quickly out of the faucet, causing you to gasp (that's a jump scare). After you frantically splash water toward the spider trying to wash it down the drain, you see that you have spilled water all over your pants, so now you realize that you have to walk down the hallway past your co-workers with what looks like a giant pee stain (that's the anticipation scare. And yes, this one is worse).I hope Sandberg continues to take a moment in each of his feature films to pay homage to his short films. I won't spoil the specifics on the one he chose for this movie, just know that long-time fans of Sandberg will enjoy the nostalgia.The bottom line is that this movie will scare you. You will likely also feel bored at times and frustrated with the decision-making of the characters. But hey, that's standard for horror movies. So, if you can put up those drawbacks for an adequate number of quality scares, Annabelle: Creation may suffice just fine for a night-time fright.",Annabelle - Creation
113,helmutty,A competently-made horror movie that is marred by horror clichés,6,11 August 2017,"To be honest, I have not watched the first movie which is a spin off to the popular The Conjuring franchise. But hearing that Annabelle: Creation is a prequel, I guess I do not actually need to know what happened in the negatively received Annabelle (2014). Before watching the prequel, I did not have much expectations. I have seen David F. Sandberg's horror debut, Lights Out, and I found it to a decent horror movie. However, after seeing Mike Flanagan's disappointing take on Ouija, another horror movie franchise, my hope for good horror directors taking helm on horror franchises dimmed a little. So is Annabelle: Creation any good? Aside from conjuring an effective atmosphere and tension, it is generic and lacks of character's development and originality.The story: It goes pretty straight-forward. A group of orphaned children stays in Dollmaker Samuel Mullins' house and discover a powerful and terrible force living in the same house. Most of the screen time show extended experiences with the evil entity and there are not many dialogues. Things proceed in a straight-forward way. The movie builds an urging tension before unleashing hell on its characters in the climax. The characters are molded to do a certain action that will motivate a horror scene. I admit that David can competently directs an effective horror scene and the movie is all about that. The dialogues during the day time act just as a breather before throwing the audience back into another terror-filled night. The jump scares are clichés and unnecessary. Acting by the young and older cast is alright. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch helps to enhance the mood.Overall: It is decently shot horror movie but there are many flaws. After this movie, I hope David will go back to directing horror movies that are not based on anything. David has a good sense of holding tension but he needs a better script. Annabelle: Creation may be a crowd-pleasing horror movie but it lacks the originality to stand out from the huge pool of horror movies. It does its job in entertaining you but it is not enough to become memorable.",Annabelle - Creation
114,jdring2007,"effective creepiness, some good scares, but overall just filmed uniquely and with a good story, far more than an inanimate doll",8,19 September 2021,"I avoided the first and third Annabelle movies due to the very low ratings and already my lack of interest in the whole doll ploy. Even the inclusion of it at the beginning of The Conjuring 1 was uninteresting to me. Due to the relatively high ratings compared to the other Annabelle movies, however, I watched the trailer and was sold. The film as a whole benefited from the director's touch; cinematography is fairly unique and creative, especially scene transitions. Acting was on par throughout, and the script was fair, the story itself seemingly blasé until it unfolds more toward the end. The few flaws of the movie would have to be the annoyingly loud music in a few scenes (only a few though), the cliché possessed-child theme (barely a quarter of the movie, fortunately), and the stupid insistence of characters to remain in creepy rooms for literally no reason. Normally the flaws of a modern horror movie are the predictable/ineffective jump scares, many of which tend to be false. Not here. Sure, there are quite a few jump scares; for me about half landed. The ones that didn't, though, still looked, felt, and sounded cool. Moreover, no false scares! Every time I suspected one, I'd be pleasantly surprised by a genuine terror. The effects were great and the presence of an evil far greater than the inanimate creepy doll really delighted me. Had the movie addressed two major, morbid deaths instead of moving on as if they hadn't happened (i.e., the dog in The Conjuring 1, don't get me started), this would've been even better. As it stands, shockingly entertaining!",Annabelle - Creation

""Annabelle: Creation"" is next.With the opening and closing scenes in particular, Sandberg and his team show skills in craftsmanship. The atmosphere and tone is set very nicely, the production design helps providing a good period feeling and the Steadicam and tracking shots are used very well. The acting from young Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman is also fine. What drags the movie down, however, is the lack of originality and the now a little too-familiar demonic scares of the Conjuring series.

116,somf,Sucks in comparison to the first.,7,4 August 2017,"Said no one ever. Seriously this is a really solid horror film. I pretty much detested ""Annabelle"". Especially in light of the fact that it rode on the coattails of the excellent ""The Conjuring"". You will see a lot of comparisons to Ouija 2 when people discuss this film, which managed to pull off the same difficult feat. And they both do it as prequels to the previously awful franchises first films.Creation takes awhile to pick up speed. And the director does something very interesting for the first half hour or so. There is barely a note of music. Silence creates all the jolts. It worked really well though I thought it was going to be odd to sustain a horror film with no music at all. Not to mention that sitting next to an IMAX theater playing Dunkirk kind of detracted from the silence thing.As it gets into a more haunted house story and the music kicks in, the film really takes off. Lots of excellent scares. Creepy kids always help. Not to mention the fact that more than one inanimate object is depicted. Solid horror film that proves that dishing out horror on screen takes a special group of talent, starting with a competent director. Horror is the most difficult genre to pull off. It is tough to elicit laughs for instance, but it is ten times tougher to scare someone on screen.",Annabelle - Creation
117,HorrorFan1984,Annabelle: Creation,7,13 April 2020,"Annabelle: Creation acts as a prequel to the first film and takes us back in time to the origin of the doll and the evil that possessed it.The film begins with a man creating the infamous Annabelle doll in his workshop. He has a young daughter and wife who live in the large house next to his shop. One day while coming home from church, the little girl is hit by a car and killed leaving them devastated and the mother a complete mess mentally. Fast forward 12 years and we see a group of orphaned girls being transported to the old house to live in. The father and mother of the deceased girl has agreed to turn his home into a new orphanage to be run by Sister Charlotte.As soon as the kids get settled, strange things start happening around the house and property. We see the spirit of the deceased child from 12 years ago stalking the halls and rooms of the house and tries to lure young Janice into playing games with her. Eventually, the demon takes possession of Janice's soul and that's when all hell breaks loose.I found Annabelle: Creation to be a solid horror film, but extremely slow moving at times. The story was told very well though and sets up the first Annabelle plot very nicely. We get a lead in to the plot of Annabelle killing those two neighbours during the home invasion from the first film. There are quite a few jump scares as well, but not as many as the original had. I found this sequel to be extremely tame when it came to terror, outside of a really effective scarecrow scene in the barn.The acting was very good by the people who had to be good. Stephanie Sigman as sister Charlotte was fun to watch as the protective mother figure over the girls. Talitha Eliana Bateman was super effective as the creepy Janice following the demon possessing her body. The rest were average but to be fair their characters didn't have much to do other than scream and run out of the house.Overall, Annabelle 2 is a fine followup prequel to the original movie that I really enjoyed. Many people found this one superior, but I thought the original had more going for it in terms of story and characters. Still this is a strong entry to The Conjuring family.7/10",Annabelle - Creation
118,AnishMisra,Annabelle Creation Review,8,13 October 2017,"Annabelle Creation is a film directed by David Sandberg. As I remember watching the trailer for this film, I remember getting chills. I have loved both the Conjuring Films. So I was looking forward to this film given that it is directed by the man behind Lights out. And this film satisfied me to a certain extent.Plot: The Mullins open their home to an orphanage with horrifying results.Story and direction: Horror to me basically is instilling the fear inside a person with the surroundings and the characters. This film hit it in the right notes for most of the part. All of the characters are greatly woven. I wonder what happened to Gary Dauberman in this part (He is the writer for the both parts of Annabelle {which I haven't seen by the way}). The bond that we see between Janice and Linda was great. And Janice being ridiculed by the other girls just because of her condition. Then we have the Mullins who are deep in sorrow because of their huge loss. Each time the doll appeared in the screen I remember having goosebumps. I also liked the way it was connected to the first film at the end. But this film is not all perfect. The first 30 or so minutes of this film basically had nothing. And a lot of those jump scares. I know that I am going for a horror film. So what's the need for these jump scares??? To prepare us that ""Hey man... Something more scary is coming."" But that actually removes all fear that you are supposed to feel, according to me. At times the film felt it was giving a tribute to Ouija - The Origin of Evil that came out last year.Performances: Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto were good as the Mullins'. You could see the pain in their faces because of the loss. Stephanie Sigman was OK as the Sister. Talitha Bateman and Lulu Wilson were wonderful in their roles. Lulu impressed me in Ouija (the one that was out last year). And in this she nailed her performance. I guess I can call her the ""Horror Queen"". Talitha was also great as Janice. The switch between Janice and Annabelle was awesome. The other girls were good too.Favorite Scene: The scene where Linda and Janice both promise each other that they will only be adopted together, otherwise not. Their friendship is clearly seen on this scene. It also sets in motion some scenes that happen during the film and also the final act.Verdict: Although not great as the first two installments of the Conjuring series, Annabelle: Creation is a good welcome to this series of films. Can't wait to see what else has to be explored (given the film had a post credit scene).I am going to give it an 8/10.",Annabelle - Creation

120,hoernkeem,"Annabelle: Creation (2017, David F. Sandberg) Annabelle's origin story does nothing exceptional and nothing horrific",4,11 February 2021,"Annabelle: Creation (2017, David F. Sandberg)
As the ""Conjuring Universe"" expands 'Annabelle' gets an origin story sequel directed by relative newcomer Sandberg. At the time all he had directed was another small horror film, 'Lights Out'. This film does an incredibly smart thing in tacking on a pretty cool ending connecting this film to the previous one thus really making it feel like a part of a larger whole. That creative spin on the ending leaves one feeling perhaps a bit better about the film than it actually is. I didn't really enjoy this film much at all. It just wasn't very scary. I didn't really care about any of the characters and the whole enterprise felt limp and uninspired. It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't good plus I didn't think the deepened mythos of this origin story really adds much to the overall universe. In the mid 1940's a couple played by Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto have a daughter who tragically passes away. Prior to her death he created one of what was supposed to be a series of dolls. It was never made clear if he got past the one. The doll gets inhabited by a spirit/demon/something and all kinds of not nice things occur. The couple oddly decides to open their home to a nun and a group of young girls although LaPaglia is detached and haunted and Otto is a scarred shut in. With the presence of the girls and apparently one soul more malleable than the others the doll, which was locked away, senses the time for more chaos is nigh. The rest of the plot proceeds at a pedestrian pace with some attempted thrills and chills that fell flat and uninspired. There was even one sequence that felt like it was a blatant rip off of 'The Ring'. Maybe I am just averse to demon doll movies as I did not like the first 'Annabelle' film either despite the fact that dolls, by their very nature, are horrifying. The directing is good but lost under the underwhelming story and script. Despite enjoying how they handled the ending the whole enterprise was overall useless and lackluster bereft of thrills or much in the way of enjoyment.

124,danielharden,The Ultimate Underdog Story,7,14 August 2017,"In 2013, James Wan brought us the critical and commercial success that is, The Conjuring. The film followed real life demon hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren, on one of the many cases they worked over their career, The Perron family haunting. The film would also introduce the creepy doll Annabelle if only playing a minor role in the film. Annabelle would then of course gain a less than well- received prequel spin off a year later. Now after Wan's second successful venture with the Warren's in The Conjuring 2, we now have a universe on our hands. The Conjuring Universe, or Conjuring-verse if you will, has expanded with side characters from The Conjuring 2; The Nun and the Crooked Man, getting their own spin offs, similar to how Annabelle initially did. 2017 marks the release of the fourth Conjuring-verse film and second Annabelle film, Annabelle Creation. Directed masterfully by Lights Out director, David F. Sandberg, Annabelle: Creation defies all expectations one would have for a prequel to a prequel spin off that wasn't any good It's actually decent.Annabelle: Creation proves what Ouija: Origin of Evil proved, good filmmakers will make good films, regardless of the quality of franchise they make their film within. David F. Sandberg directs Annabelle: Creation with confidence and proves that he is a competent horror film director. He has obviously learnt from and taken note of James Wan and his films, as Annabelle: Creation feels like a James Wan film. Sandberg knows that jump scares aren't the only scare tactic out there, he actually attempts and succeeds at building tension and suspense to nail biting levels, understanding the importance of the build, rather than simply working towards the payoff, aka jump scare moment. Similar to Wan, Sandberg generates the majority of his fantastic scares through the art of misdirection. Sandberg will crank up the suspense, building or alluding to a particular scare and then not doing that, but instead, the scare comes in from a blind spot, catching you off guard. Wan has said before that when trying to create a scare, he'll build to something the audience expects, but the scare should/ will come from something they didn't see coming at all, as that will truly surprise the audience. Sandberg does this numerous times in Annabelle: Creation and is hence why I attribute this film's surprise success to him. The film is truly terrifying.As well as approaching horror in the same, mature way James Wan does, Sandberg also directly pays tribute to James Wan through a number of visual homages to The Conjuring franchise. Sandberg features the long take, tracking shot around the haunted house which Wan used in both Conjuring films. Although the shot serves very little purpose in all three films, there is pleasure in recognising Sandberg's homage to Wan and it does help make Annabelle Creation feel like a Wan movie. There is also a shot of a girl in a chair with Annabelle on their lap, similar to the Conjuring's poster and almost recreating Annabelle's scene with Bathsheba in the Conjuring. As well as this, Sandberg further attempts to connect the films and create the universe, those who have seen the first Annabelle will get a kick out of the film's end. Sandberg also features one subtle reference to The Nun within a photo frame. The reference is so eerily subtle that it's outstanding, and the film does feature a post credit scene for the Nun, however, I believe few have actually stayed around long enough to see it. Seeing as there is a mid credit scene and this isn't Marvel, I thought it was done, alas I was wrong.However, Annabelle: Creation's story is your standard possession movie cliché, but the film manages what many cliché horror films fail to do, and that is creating characters to root for. The film is essentially about two of the orphans, Janice and Linda, whose friendship is tested and torn apart by this demonic being. Janice has polio and so is outcast and seemingly targeted by the demon due to her condition, this really made me sympathise and root for these girls and so an another layer of anxiety and suspense is added to the film. This being said, once the focus shifts away from polio ridden Janice, to her able bodied friend Linda, I didn't seem to care as much, as I only really cared and rooted for Janice. As well as this, the film really fails to develop anyone else. There are attempts, but they amount to nothing, especially the Mullins, who I believe are a wasted opportunity and kind of pointless for the most part.In the end, Annabelle: Creation is a film that is far better than a prequel to a sh*tty prequel spin off deserves to be, and puts the Conjuring universe three for four. Although your standard possession movie formula is at play, director David F. Sandberg proves that with characters you care for, and a competent horror film director at the helm, your standard possession film can be a great thrill ride start to finish, no matter if everything in the world points to it being sh*t. Good filmmakers make good films and Annabelle: Creation proves just that.",Annabelle - Creation
125,theredsky,Annabelle: Creation Review,6,20 April 2019,"This movie is vastly superior to the original. It's not as good as The Conjuring 2 but it still provides enough story and good character development to get through. Some negatives of this film would be that 2 of the 6 child actors don't do a great job and the editing does feel off at times. Some of the cinematography isn't great but it gets better. Towards the end of the film, it starts to become over reliant on jump scares. Other than that, this film is good. The rest of the cast does an outstanding job especially the father. The lighting is a significant improvement from both Conjuring movies and the original Annabelle film. Most of the cinematography is great with really nice tracking shots. Up until the last 45 minutes, the scares are effective and make you jump until it overuses this horror movie cliche. The best part of the film for me is the death of the father. It makes you squirm watching all his fingers bend backwards and hearing the bones breaking when the demon emerges. The plot is great and you are able to understand everything that is going on, why it is happening, and the motivations. The tone remains mostly consistent throughout the film. The film ends with the attack scene from the original Annabelle film which is always a nice touch. Overall, Annabelle: Creation succeeds in everything in the original film did wrong while boosting a stronger cast, improved scares, and a much more believable story.",Annabelle - Creation

127,joshbarton15,Pretty damn creepy and atmospheric,6,12 August 2017,"Like it or not, we live in a time where cinematic universes are the current trend for movie studios and in The Conjuring universe, we have a set of horror films that, for the most part, are actually worth watching. After Annabelle felt like no effort went into making it as scary as either of The Conjuring films, David F. Sandberg, who had success with Lights Out in 2016, was brought in for Annabelle: Creation, a prequel to a prequel about everybody's favourite demonic doll, or least favourite demonic doll if you scare easily. Twelve years after the death of their daughter, dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife welcome a nun and several girls into their home from their shuttered orphanage. They soon find themselves targeted by the dollmaker's possessed creation, Annabelle.Sandberg seems to know how to make a solid horror film and with Annabelle: Creation, he has created a horror film that makes up for the previous instalment with plenty of atmosphere and suspense throughout. A pet hate for me in horror films is just to rely on cheap jump scares and loud noises to get a scare however, there isn't really much of that in Annabelle: Creation. Sandberg instead opting to crank up the creepy atmosphere through the visual style of the film, Maxime Alexandre's cinematography well and truly delivering the essence of horror with perfect shot composition on some of the sequences keeping me right on the edge of my seat. Benjamin Wallfisch's score is also put to good use by Sandberg, giving the film an audible sense of fear and dread throughout.Coming to the performances, Annabelle: Creation relies heavily on two child actors who are the main targets of Annabelle. Thankfully, Talitha Bateman and Lulu Wilson are very good in the roles of Janice and Linda respectively. Put it this way, I would be far too scared to act in a film like this so hats off to them. Anthony LaPaglia, Miranda Otto and Stephanie Sigman provide able support to the younger cast members too, making this a horror where performances aren't an issue at all.While this probably won't be the last we see of Annabelle in The Conjuring universe, I don't think we'll see her get another film devoted to her. They've already announced The Nun, who gets an incredibly unnecessary mention here, as the next film in the universe and if they can make it as creepy and atmospheric as both of The Conjuring films and Annabelle: Creation, it's going to be a scary ride.",Annabelle - Creation

It's actually quite good. I certainly enjoyed it. It starts of rather slow, but picks up the pace just before the half-way point.The acting, especially from the young cast, is excellent. The setting is memorable. Sure, there are some clunky bits and one or two things that defy logic (how can someone grasp an incandescent light that been on for a while?

I held off on watching this after the first version was so terrible. I still don't get how the clip from the conjuring could be so much better than any of the movies about the actual doll itself.I think the idea is that the movie rushes in to all it's scares and then goes over top with it in stead of slowly building up the pace that something is wrong and then providing the scares in the end while not going so over the top. Kind of like the original Carey movie. It was ""spooky"" but in the end it got really creepy.This movie should of kept that same kind of pace and remained ""spooky"" and then at the end gone completely creepy. Instead it just jumps straight into the scares and over the top things that quickly remind you that you are watching a movie. There isn't much build up to anything and worst of it's called ""Annabelle Creation"" yet there's nothing about creating the doll in the entire movie.Would of been better if they showed the doll being created and the relationship the girl had with the doll and what it meant to the family after girl passed. Show them grieving and mourning over the loss of their daughter and holding on to the doll as a remembrance of her and then show the couple so desperate and broken that they would try anything to communicate with their daughter and then show how the doll got possessed when they made contact with an evil spirit pretending to be a good one. That's the story I was expecting this to be but instead you get a 5 minute flashback of all that and this lame movie.This is not so much an origin story just another quick horror story that's forgettable like the first film I don't even remember watching at this point.",Annabelle - Creation

While the cinematography isn't necessarily startling, it is very effective. This was not a rushed job at all. There is one shot in particular that I found to be absolutely beautiful. All it is is an establishing shot of a field, but everything that is going on in the shot just makes for a really gorgeous moment. Where this movie falters is the script. It's a weak screenplay. Gary Dauberman wrote this movie, and he also wrote the first Annabelle. That was not a smart decision on the studio's part to rehire him, since so many people had problems with the last movie. Annabelle: Creation is full of cheap, conventional, basic scares. The majority of the movie's horror is a door creaking open, or the Annabelle doll being put in a new place. Movement in the shadows. And it's not done in a new way. It's run-of-the-mill horror that we've seen a thousand times. I think I maybe jumped once, and there were only a couple of things that I found to be actually creepy.

There is no coherent story or character development. There is nothing to make us root for the characters, even though all the casts acted decently. This is a huge flaw because it leaves us less invested in the characters, and this lessens the scare and shock factor. However, there are moments of effective scares and chills. The use of practical effects rather than CGI improves the scare, the lighting and soundtrack heightens the tension. There are effective uses of jump scares and lots of scares in broad daylight, which still looks fresh to me. Though there are many scares, it seems to come in successive waves. It is like after a few sequences, they don't know how to continue the momentum, so they switch the focus entirely on another character. Thus the flaw is due to the direction, yet it manages to stay true to James Wan's horror universe, and remains faithful to its spirit.

136,untilnow99,"""What is it? Who cares? Run!""",1,17 September 2017,"That one line from the movie pretty much sums up what I should have done and what you should do rather than watch this bunch of schlock. The scariest thing about this movie is that Anthony LaPaglia, Miranda Otto and the rest agreed to act in it. Talk about a career downer.Spoiler Alert:At one point Sister Charlotte says, ""Let's go to bed, girls."" Seriously? I laughed so hard when she said that, I nearly hurt myself. Bad thing after bad thing happens and this how the Sister reacts? Yeah. Let's all get to bed now, sweet dreams and we'll see who is up next for meeting some demons. NIghty night all.The entire movie makes absolutely no sense. The denouement, as such, comes about 3/4 of the way in and fails to explain exactly why Mr. and Mrs. Mullins and The Church (plenty of blame to go around here) decided against burning that stupid ugly doll.Why did Mr. Mullins create such a Chucky-wannabe doll in the first place? I thought he was supposed to be an artist whose dolls were in great demand. That doll is as ugly as a baboon's hind end ----apologies to all baboons.If you're a glutton for punishment (which I am, apparently), watch this movie and try to figure out what the hell is up with having a horned demon, a Mr. Scratch-looking demon, a scarecrow morphing into a demon. This movie is like you-know-what going through a goose . . .it's all over the place and stinky to boot.The only thing I got out of Annabelle Creation is that ""You Are My Sunshine"" is actually a very sad and creepy song. Listen to those lyrics: ""If you leave me and love another, you'll regret it all someday."" Is the guy a stalker? Come to think of it, let's produce ""You Are My Sunshine."" It would make a much scarier movie",Annabelle - Creation

140,tstudstrup,Better than Annabelle but still moneygrabbing average horror,3,26 October 2017,"This is a prequel to the shitty boring Annabelle. It explains how the doll was created and how it got possessed. Although this is clearly a bigger production with better acting, it's way too predictable, relying on loud noises and the doll and a scarecrow moving by themselves and James Wan's trademark scare: demonic black creatures with yellow eyes. The story about the doll-maker, his wife and the daughter that is run over by a car, is over way too quickly. I would have liked that story to have been the whole film instead of the story about the girls from the orphanage. Instead the movie skips 12 years and we have to wait more than an hour to have explained why the wife lies disfigured in bed and cant walk and why the Annabelle doll is locked up in a closet in the dead daughters locked room . The movie skips 12 years again in the end and the movie ends when Annabelle begins. And although this movie is a little scary, it's nothing more than a money grabbing prequel which is explained by the fact that it ties together with not only Annabelle, but also The Conjuring and The Nun, which comes out in 2018. This is very clever, because fans will want more and a regular audience will want things explained that happens at the end of this movie. And that means having to watch The Nun and Annabelle 3, which will most likely be made after the success of this movie By the way there are two short scenes that happens after the movie ends. The first one is at the beginning of the credits and the second one is right after the credits. Don't miss them. And expect to google the ending like I did as you probably wont know what the hell is going on either. If you're a fan of James Wan's movies, you will love this movie. If not, you will probably be disappointed like I am.",Annabelle - Creation
141,lovintennis,Way overrated. I walked out,2,16 August 2017,"First, a car wouldn't cruise by a stranded family trying to replace a tire and not slow down. Second, even a kid would have instinctive enough to not bolt out into the road when they're in the middle of nowhere and there's a car coming, especially on a dirt road. Even though the kid's on the far side of their handicapped car, she can hear the car coming. All throughout the movie thereafter, the victim screams only a portion of how much she ought to; it's like she's forgotten she has vocal cords. And the unrealistically little screaming she DOES do is never heard until it's too late. Everyone around her has ridiculously selective hearing that it's like they're deaf until the victim's already screwed. She also keeps turning her back on the doll that's obviously creeping her out to death. The second girl's even worse. She doesn't scream at ALL, just lets the spirit keep suspending her. And not just that but why scram around to the top of your bunk bed? Run out of the room! Get away! Last, it's so horror- typical for only the areas right in front of a window with sun shining through to be well-lit while every other spot around the house is dark, even pitch-black.",Annabelle - Creation
142,hotrobinproductions,Conjuringverse review #4 (watch my others),7,1 July 2019,"Wow, ok so this is interesting. I have been watching these conjuring films. First conjuring was great, Annabelle was an utter disappointment, and conjuring 2 is everything that lives up to its name and more... then here we are with Annabelle: creation. The first one was utterly garbage, so going into this movie I was already disappointed. But then the movie begins with something the first lacked, an actual compelling story, with characters and a plot that may have been seen before but done and executed very greatly. This movie was great and very enjoyable. I love what they did. They made Annabelle actually scary. Finally. I heard there is a Annabelle 3 (Annabelle comes home) and I must say I really hope they understand and learned from this one because this is how it's done.Acting 8/10

144,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,"Been There, Done That",6,13 August 2017,"Let's see.....jump scares? Check. Typical horror movie clichés (like a car that doesn't start)? Check. Key plot points borrowed from other films (in this case, 1989's ""Pet Sematary"")? Check. Characters doing things you would never do if you were in the same situation? Check.So yeah...not a lot of originality here. As several other reviewers have stated, ""Annabelle: Creation"" IS better than the original ""Annabelle,"" but unfortunately, that bar wasn't set very high. In other words, that's not saying much. There are some creepy elements here to be sure, the film has its good moments. But there are just as many moments where we found ourselves yelling at the screen 'why would you do that? No no no!' A barometer of a good horror film is if you can say, when seeing a character make a decision, ""yes I would do the same thing""...and bad stuff still happens. If you find yourself saying ""I would never do that"" but the character does it anyway, and then something bad happens....well, duh. There's just too much of that here unfortunately.MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: Probably the biggest issue with the plot of the film, learned towards the end, is that certain characters knew of the doll's truly evil nature years ago, and, instead of getting rid of the thing (burning, destroying, dismembering, etc.), they think it's a good idea to keep it in their house! For...years! And hope nothing happens! This is idiocy beyond description or comprehension. Would YOU live in the same house as an evil doll, for years and years? And hope 'nothing happens?' Probably not, right? Yeah that's a no-brainer. But sadly, the entire story-line winds up revolving around this nonsensical plot point. Sigh.Good for a few scares but does not hold up well under scrutiny. 6/10.P.S. Nuns cannot hear confessions, as was shown in this film. The producers might want to brush up on their religion/theology before they release ""The Nun"" next year lol",Annabelle - Creation

I was scared in the beginning, but once when I got used to the rhythm, I no longer scared and felt boring. It is true that I still afraid to watch the bloodiness screen, so I mostly covered my eyes or turned my head to the audience in every suddenly quite moment, because I knew the next few seconds would have 'something'. Watching horror movie in theater is interesting, so many screams from audiences, hard to maintain fear.The story itself is illogical and plain. The evil was released because bounderish girls touched stuffs without permission.That is why education is important. 🤷🏻‍♀️ The girls were rude in the beginning, they opened host family cabinets just after they first entrance, this behavior already unfavorable. I can't imagine any other normal people will do such thing. Not to speak of hiding others property, that is stealing, it is criminal! And who else will keep a creepy picture to her bed? There were so many alogical plots, and I would not like to spend time to recall.Anyway, I barely watch horror movies, it was an thrilled experience.",Annabelle - Creation
147,makleen2,Why is this movie rated-R?,4,30 September 2017,"A group of orphans and a nun battle a demonic force personified by a creepy-looking doll in this latest installment of the The Conjuring Universe. Annabelle: Creation is a prequel-sequel to Annabelle (2014), a fictional account of Ed and Lorraine Warren's battle with an allegedly possessed Raggedy Ann doll. This film departs entirely from reality, imagining an origin story for the doll. Both critics and audiences seem to enjoy it. Overall, it had a few eye-rolling moments, but it had a few genuinely scary ones as well.Annabelle: Creation was written by Gary Dauberman and directed by David F. Sandberg. Both Dauberman and Sandberg are relatively new to their craft. Dauberman is known for previously writing Annabelle (2014) and the low-budget Swamp Devil (2008), and Sandberg has directed several short films and Lights Out (2016).The filmmakers' inexperience is probably why this movie doesn't take any risks. It is a strictly paint-by-numbers modern American horror film. It is filled with obvious bloopers, like Samuel Mullins ""tickling"" his daughter's feet when she's wearing shoes. Contemporary horror clichés abound, including an isolated, creepy old house, an unrealistically large stone well, contorting body parts popular since The Ring (2002), and police who seem strangely indifferent despite horrible crimes having been committed.Also, someone should tell the filmmakers that Catholic nuns can't hear sacramental confessions. Only a validly ordained priest or bishop can hear confessions and absolve sins.Though Annabelle: Creation adds nothing new to the genre, its popularity shows this is what horror audiences want to see. It opened at the top of the box office, pulling in approximately $35 million its opening weekend. Anecdotal evidence also attest to the film's popularity. The theater was packed when I went to see it, in stark contrast to Detroit (a far superior movie).Annabelle: Creation is overflowing with characters. In addition to Samuel and Esther Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto), there are six orphans and a nun (played by Stephanie Sigman). The orphans vary with age, from eight or nine to fifteen or sixteen years old. The youngest, Linda (Lulu Wilson) and Janice (Talitha Bateman), have a close bond. Janice had ""the Polio"" and wears a leg brace. She frees the evil spirit trapped in AnnaBelle and becomes possessed.The oldest, Nancy (Philippa Coulthard) and Carol (Grace Fulton), have a few scenes but mostly serve to run around being chased by a scarecrow. The middle girls, Tierney and Kate (Lou Lou Safran and Tayler Buck), don't really play a role in the film and are just kinda ""there."" In one departure from a typical horror film, all of the girls and their guardian survive.Lulu Wilson was also in Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016), which just happened to be the last horror movie I saw in theaters. She's a talented young actress who I hope eventually breaks out of the horror genre.As part of a prequel, the orphan plot makes little sense. The film is called Annabelle: Creation but the doll's actual creation is only shown in a brief flashback. As the movie opens, the Mullins are a happy family whose daughter is tragically killed in a hit-and-run accident. Flash forward twelve years, and we see the orphans arriving at the home. Why do the movie's main events take place over a decade later? Why not make the movie about how the doll got possessed, as its name implies? Finally, why is this movie rated-R? Its handful of gory scenes could have easily been toned down to make it PG-13. This prequel-sequel relies primarily on thrills; it isn't gratuitously violent, has no nudity, and there isn't even any swearing in it. Was it necessary to make one or two scenes so over the top the MPAA restricted its main audience (teens) from seeing it? Or were the filmmakers trying to cloak their movie in the allure of an R rating without actually making an R-rated film? As long as you don't ask too many questions, Annabelle: Creation delivers all the creepy thrills, scares, and tension an audience desires.",Annabelle - Creation

My parents thought it was ok and some parts i literally screamed woah because of how scary and disturbing some images was. Some parts were cringey and boring but it was like the movie felt me and stopped it whenever it felt like things were going that way. Im pretty excited to see Annabelle comes home tomorrow and that will surely be better than this. I feel like there were only little girls the whole movie and no males or grownups because it feels a little weird. The ending was really scary and cool as well as most other parts of the movie. Overall really good movie and a good change other than action movies. Watch it.",Annabelle - Creation
149,jay-techie2007,Definitely Among the Best Horror Movies of All Times,9,25 August 2017,"The movie is about the genesis of the possessed doll, Annabelle. a lot scarier than the trailer. Great watch if you are a horror movie fan. The use of some of the props to create the horror was brilliant and innovative, which made the movie very much watchable, especially when it rode under the pressure of the standard set by the Conjuring series. Performances of Talitha Eliana Bateman and Lulu Wilson are something to watch out. Story (9/10): Samuel, a doll maker, and Esther Mullins are living a peaceful life in a remote village when a tragedy strikes and they lose their daughter in an accident. They end up attracting a devil, in an attempt to connect with their daughter's spirit, which now resides in one of Samuel's own creation - the porcelain doll, Annabelle. 12 years after the doll is safely locked up in a room, wall papered with Bible pages and blessed with priests, Mullins open their home as a shelter to a nun and a couple of girls from orphanage. In no time, the devil is able to entice one of the girls to help free the spirit. Soon, the entire house is trapped into a series of paranormal activities that soon turns into horror - all directed by the possessed doll. The story is amazingly well written and keeps you hooked till the end. There are subtle references to the other movies of the franchise which helps connect the dots. The balance between the screen time of the characters is really great. Acting (10/10): This is one of those rare movies that had brilliant performances by almost the entire cast. Nobody was out of spirit (pun intended). Talitha Eliana Bateman and Lulu Wilson are to watch out for. Talitha looked pretty much effortless with her scenes and delivered horror without much explicit expressions which was really brilliant. Lulu was great - capitalizing on her innocent face and big eyes. The rest of the cast did a great job with their limited screen time shared across. Direction (9/10): David Sandberg was absolutely amazing with this movie. With high standards set by the earlier movies in the franchise, there was a lot of innovation required in creating the a horror that actually terrifies. The use of new props, hardly ever seen earlier, made a great effect. Choosing a backdrop of a remote area in rural US, something used in Conjuring 1 as well, helped certainly and he capitalized on the larger playground available to play (the house, the workshop and the well). Full marks to him for keeping the length of the movie super compact and not letting unnecessary stuff slip through the editing. However, ironically, I still feel the climax was a little drag (or perhaps he started with it a little early into the movie) with so many characters to show. Overall (9/10): This movie is definitely among the top of the list when it comes to all time best horror movies and certainly not just increases the value of the overall Conjuring franchise but also increases curiosity about what's coming next in the series.",Annabelle - Creation

151,RileyOnFilm,Felt forced,6,2 September 2017,"Some of you may have seen the short Light's Out that came out a few years back. It was made by a new director named David Sandberg and he is the one who directed this film under the production leadership of James Wan. Therein lie a few troubles I see. If you are making a movie a producer hires you to do, you are slave to his vision: not yours and not the audience's. Annabelle is a story that is very close to Wan's heart but I felt watching it that Sandberg was probably not as into it. I felt much the same about his full length film Lights Out that came out last year. Wan put spring in his step and commissioned him to create a full length movie based on the short. Even though it was his own idea, it feels like Sandberg tried to do a ""son of Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring."" I think Wan should have bankrolled Sandberg to create his own film, free from trappings of Wan visions. But who am I to want things?The actors are very much standard and flat. They are not memorable in this script and anyone could have played any role. No one stands out, except the dolls that is.The story is this: A young couple with a 9 year old daughter (or so I assume her age is) lose her when she is hit by a car. They are so distraught, they pray to ""any force that can help them"" to allow them to talk to their dead daughter. This is very cliché and seen in so many movies. ie; The Other Side of the Door, all zombie movies, A Dark Song, etc. Instead of having their wish fulfilled, they get the devil himself who manifests in the Annabelle doll. This is revealed through kids who come to live in the house of the couple that has been turned into an orphanage. They learn the demon or devil in the doll and scarecrow is mean as hell as well as bloodthirsty. I could go on but I don't want to.This movie suffers from not showing enough cool scary faces and props. They flash by but I want to stop and look at them. Sandberg focused too much on multiple jump scares that don't show anything. It's textbook cheap thrills. It is also an awful script that tries too hard to be a prequel to existing movies. I enjoyed the film up to about the 2/3 part. Then it was just a waiting game for the credits. It reminded me of Quija 2 but Ouija 2 is MUCH better.",Annabelle - Creation
152,dineshaishu,Annabelle: creation,5,19 May 2019,"Annabelle: Creation is a thoroughly well-executed and thought-out medium budget horror in a creepy house with a creepy doll. It is also a borderline comedy at times, cleverly realising that the doll is not only scary but also rather ridiculous. Moving from scares to laughter and back was done with outstanding precision and taste.The effect where something first happens with thundering sound and action, followed by a deafening silence in anticipation of potential further threats, is somewhat overused, but excellent actors and overall professional production let this kind of small issues pass without much distraction.As a prequel to the previous movie which was also a prequel, the story is eventually tied to the previous Annabelle vehicle, which felt not only unnecessary but quite clunky and rushed.

Even then, this is no good. And that's because the plot is again stupid af, the acting is mediocre, and all is jumpscares. I would say this is a little bit more enjoyable for the unintentional comedy by the bad acting or script. The scene in the beggining where the girl dies keept me laughting for minutes.

155,aldiboronti,Scary movie - if you.re under the age of 12 that is.,3,15 September 2017,"I expected it to be bad although not quite this bad. The problem with sequels in the horror genre is that once you've seen the boogeyman in the first movie repeat appearances by him grow less and less scary because there is o element of surprise or suspense. Is that something moving in the dark? Don't worry, it's only that doll again. In other words we're familiar with the creature and what does familiarity breed? Contempt. And boredom too. This again? Seen that already, you can't scare me with that again.So, intrinsically less scary then to start with. But with clever writing and directing that can be overcome and several horror sequels have very successfully overcome and scared the pants off us a second or third time. So could Annabelle achieve this? The director, whose previous helms are not impressive, didn't inspire much confidence but I gave the film a chance. Then came the first scenes with Annabelle. OK, little girl whips off the sheet. It's the doll and she has her usual look and that works well. So far so good. Little girl gets spooked and closes the door before walking away.The camera kept the door behind her in shot and I thought no, surely they're not going for that old chestnut. If the film had any chance of being a good movie that door must not open. It opened. One strike against the film. Little girl goes back, closes the door and locks it. I groaned. Surely this director isn't going to have the door open again?Oh but he is. I could't believe how tired and predictable this scene was. Little girl grabs the sheet and I shouted at the screen as if the director could hear me. ""You dumbass, you're gonna have the kid cover Annabelle up and then when she walks away the doll is going to rise up slowly and follow her. How could you be so damned unoriginal? It was genuinely scary once. Almost a century ago when they did it in the silents. I'm through with you, you are a terrible terrible director.""I don't know how I did it but I actually sat through the rest of the film. Things did not get better. The last director just wounded Annabelle, this guy killed her and threw her in the trash.

Had a blast!A group of girls go to an orphanage where the evil doll is locked up. pretty soon bad things start to happen. That is the plot in a nutshell.The film is essentially a bunch of jump scares, but there are a lot of them and the film never takes itself seriously for one second. It knows its job is have fun with a devil doll and that mood really help sells the jump scares.The plot makes no sense.. the big reveal is that the doll is possessed by an evil spirit? really? who would have known!In many ways it reminded me of F13 part I with 8 year olds instead of teenagers. The younger girls really steal the show - they were great.The film had a strange drive-in movie vibe. Hard to pinpoint it, but I felt like I was in a drive-in watching the movie. Weird.The key to enjoying this film is to watching it with a packed house. There was almost a 'rocky-horror show' response to some scenes ""don't open that door!!"" that REALLY added to the enjoyment.Nothing was REALLY scary, though. More fun, than scares. People clapped and laughed because we were really enjoying the film's jump scares...Can't remember the last time I felt that. We all clapped at the end - not many films I can make that claim for.That said, anyone expecting a REALLY scary movie, 3 dimensional characters, re-inventing the genre, etc. will be sorely disappointed.This is a haunted house movie that is fun seen with a crowd.I can't imagine seeing this alone at home.

164,Chiller7,"Improvement over the first Annabelle, but still a couple steps behind the Conjuring movies",8,4 December 2017,"Pretty decent horror movie. I always proudly say that horror movies don't scare me, which with this movie for the most part remains true - I didn't leave this movie disturbed at all - but some of the jump scares got me. So I'll give it that.Some good effects here and there. A certain transformation scene involving a larger than natural human figure with broken limbs & joints was particularly weird and disturbing.The following may be a silly complaint, but I'll say it: No consistent logic to the hauntings. The haunting events throughout the movie, one after another, seem more designed to show off new and different visual/special effects each time, rather than to maintain any consistent logic within the movie. I mean, I was constantly asking, if the ghost(s) could have done this or that later in the movie, why didn't it bother doing that earlier in the movie? If it had that kind of power later, why didn't it have the same powers earlier? But that kind of thinking is probably too deep for this kind of movie. We're just supposed to accept it and go along with it.Anyway, it's not bad. Not on the same level as the Conjuring 1 & 2, but an improvement over the first Annabelle, for sure.

165,shadow_blade-89459,Strong film,8,4 November 2018,"""Annabelle: Creation"" (2017) is a professionally produced horror thriller mystery about how the demonic doll, Annabelle, came to be following the death of a little girl fathered by a doll maker. This film is close to great. It reminded me of the first ""Child's Play"" with a darker focus. This film is at home in its genre, but the jump scare standard can become old extremely quick.The truly admire the acting in this film. It is often that child actors have a difficult time truly capturing the essence of the role they are playing, but the children cast in this film were truly astounding. Every effect in this film served a purpose even if is was solely to heighten the jump scares.

169,cschultz-2,"Predictable, But Okay",6,27 August 2017,"""Annabelle: Creation"" is a movie during which the audience spends about the first 75% of the running time wondering what in the world is going on, and the final 25% unfortunately finding out.  It also seems to pre-suppose that all Catholic clergy in movies speak in with an Irish lilt—they don't.After a brief prologue which is presumably included to sort of soften the audience up for the kill, the picture concerns a group of female orphans in the charge of a spirited young nun who take up residence in a large rural house with a legacy of tragedy.   The homeowners, a reclusive dollmaker and his disabled wife, are a suspiciously buttoned-up and reclusive pair.  And as is to be expected in this sort of movie, they very plainly tell the orphans right up front that one certain wing of the house is completely off- limits to them, with no questions asked and no exceptions permitted.  But of course kids will be kids, and the ""Keep Out"" rule is quickly brokenduring the dead of night, naturally.  From that point on, rules and logic mostly go out the window, but the atmosphere of dread and despair remains in abundance.Not so much a coherent narrative as a series of effectively scary scenes, ""Annabelle: Creation"" succeeds mostly because of the amount of sympathy generated by, and for, the talented and likable cast.  Particularly effective are young Talitha Bateman as an orphan hobbled by a bout with polio—the movie is set during the pre-Salk 1950s—and Stephanie Sigman as the rookie Catholic nun in charge of the girls.  Anthony LaPaglia is also present, a few pounds heavier than you might remember from his years of popularity, in a mostly thankless role as the quiet, haunted-eyed homeowner who serves as a sort of host, groundskeeper, and occasional guide for the others.""Annabelle: Creation"" is meant to fill in some of the backstory of the 2014 horror hit ""Annabelle,"" but is also a distant cousin of the ""The Conjuring"" series of horror movies.  As a result, while homework isn't necessary, viewers familiar with the earlier pictures have a marked advantage over others in the audience.  Enough plot threads are left dangling at the end to keep the door open for a sequel—in fact, for viewers who aren't in too much of a hurry to leave at the end of the picture, there's a brief post-credit scene which will likely either further confuse them or whet their appetites for continuing installments in the saga.Written by Gary Dauberman and directed by David F. Sandberg, ""Annabelle: Creation"" isn't exactly ""Citizen Kane,"" but you already knew that.  As these movies go, however, it's not as bad as most.  That's high praise.  The difference is in the cast, and the effective atmosphere.",Annabelle - Creation
170,MichaelNontonMulu,The prequel to That Scary Doll in The Conjuring Series,7,9 August 2017,"Yes, this was another one of those really scary movies. I counted there were at least 3 very scary moments during the whole movie which ran for about 109 minutes (not too short like slasher horror movie). The rest of them were not scary but just having shocking effect. The movie was having all the usual effects of dark places in a large old house, with the occasional surprises every now and then. The sound effects were put to good use, especially the music during those scary moments in the climax, or even the silence in certain scenes.This time David F. Sandberg (director of another good horror movie Lights Out) was able to create the creepiness of an old house, with the scary Annabelle doll and combine them with the mystery surrounding the Mullins family. It was also very very cool of him to make references to the Conjuring 2 movie, plus of course the ending scene which you could only understand if you have watched Annabelle. I think David did a fantastic job of making sure this movie was up to the standard the other movies in the Conjuring universe have set previously. I also like the performance of the young Talitha Bateman as Janice and Lulu Wilson as Linda. Both of them did wonderful job of portraying their characters. There were also few funny moments usually involving Linda as she was the youngest and therefore was very playful. I think the stars of this movie were actually the two of them while the rest of the cast did not give too much impression to my opinion. As a supernatural horror movie, this one was worthwhile to see in the cinema to give more scary impact and of course to enjoy the dark surrounding and the good sound effects.If you are a fan of horror movies and especially if you want to see some continuity with The Conjuring series, then this is definitely a must see movie. But if you are one of those people who do not like supernatural horror movies, then it would be best if you avoid this one. By the way, the movie had 2 post credit scenes. So you can wait and see them by waiting till the very end. The last one was better to be seen not by yourself.

171,cjs6547,Huh that was not bad,6,17 September 2017,"This movie has pretty good production value for a horror. I don't mean that it has some wild effects like the Mummy, but that it is neatly and carefully put together with some unique visuals. Which is so much more important. I'm always glad when a director takes a horror movie seriously.The children were all good actors. I thought Lulu Wilson would steal the show again, but the best performance was given by Talitha as the possessed girl.HOWEVER, having come so far, it doesn't go ALL THE WAY. What kind of creation story doesn't end in everybody dying at the end? Yes, the characters get knocked about horribly, but none of the orphans or the nun meet a gruesome, graphic fate. This is disappointing. There are too many characters in this movie for us to get to know or grow to love any one of them in particular, so it stands to reason they would be gore fodder, right? No.Also, the only negative in this universe is the evil of Annabelle. Everyone else, the pastor, the nun, the orphans and the old embittered couple are all very nice and unrealistically so. Even the police don't make any trouble for our poor nun for locking a 'possessed child' in a tiny closet. Yes all is harmony in the human realm.So its not the Shining or anything, and its not VERY riveting, but its pleasant nonetheless. A bit like Maria and her seven children in a haunted house.",Annabelle - Creation
172,ReelLifeReviews,Strong young cast,7,25 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation - I never saw the first Annabelle movie, but from what I've heard, I didn't miss much. This one, however, felt right at home in the world of The Conjuring.There is a definite creep factor to this film. While the Child's Play movies had a terrorizing murderer for a doll, what you have in Annabelle is something far more sinister and evil. There are of course the obligatory jump scares, but the mood that is prevalent throughout the latter half of the film is what sets it apart from the pretenders.The movie has two young leads, the strongest of the two being Talitha Bateman, who plays Janice. She's given a range of emotional beats to hit and physical elements to sell, and she nails them all. Her talent shows beyond her years.The group dynamic of the girls is fleshed out far better in this movie than in The Beguiled from back in June. There is still one girl that serves no purpose, only delivering two lines, but it's none the less a major improvement.The story arc of the mother, however, never resonated with me. It feels like an afterthought that was thrown in to pad the overall runtime. The only thing she brings is exposition, not really having an impact on furthering the story itself.Due to Get Out and It Comes at Night not technically being horror, and Rings being the 2nd worst movie of the year so far, Annabelle: Creation wears this year's crown for scary movies, at least for now. We'll have Jigsaw, Flatliners, and Happy Death Day up to bat soon enough. But c'mon, you and I both know that Pennywise will float right to the top of that list come September. Until then, Annabelle has a story to tell. 7.25/10",Annabelle - Creation

First of all, it is too focused on having jump-scares throughout, and not in the story. I mean, it made me actually jump a few times, particularly at the last 20 minutes, but this made it look as a typical horror movie from the 21th century with nothing really special in it: only scares and no story-line.However, the photography is very good, the locations are excellent, the performances were excellent, mostly the ones of the little girls, and it isn't bad as a horror movie, but for me it is of the less recommended horror films of the year.

179,iamjacksmoviechannel,Better than the first...asterisk,6,10 August 2017,"""Annabelle: Creation"" is a prequel to ""Annabelle"", the doll from ""The Conjuring"". And you've probably heard that this is better than the first a lot already. Well it isasterisk. The movie centers on a nun and some orphan girls who soon realize the doll maker who took them in has a hauntingly dark secret hidden away. This movie wisely dumped the predecessor's director for David F. Sandberg, who if you take away all the flaws from last years ""Lights Out"", you can still see it's one for atmosphere and jittery menace more than gore or kills. ""Creation"" actually does make the title character make a lot more sense and I think it may actually make the first piece of crap make sense too, which is no small feat. As far as the other characters go, they're well acted but also somewhat bland. The lead girl has polio, that's her character. The lead guy is a doll maker. There's a nun. The rest get dialogue like their in some kind of horror movie version of ""Annie"". These girls also must have come from the Lindsay Lohan school of decision-making. Much of the movie is them playing Nancy Drew in this haunted house, when really they should probably know what they're going to find. One of the oddest things is when someone does get killed, the Nun still keeps them in this house. At that point I felt like screaming ""No, you idiot. Get the hell out, run away now.""Part of the problem here is that these investigations done by the girls take up a bit too much of the movie, and we mostly do get hit with a few too many jump scares before the ending really packs in the thrills. This is a pounding, pounding, pounding horror movie and if that's what you want, that's what you'll get. Chances are if you're a fan of movies like ""The Witch"" or ""The Babadook"", this will just come across as kinda stupid to you.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Annabelle - Creation
180,akoaytao1234,Should have been,7,5 September 2017,"Annabelle: Creation (2017) tells the story of how the titular demonic doll from the famous Conjuring films came to be. I would not lie, Annabelle: Creation does not offer anything new to the table. It has everything expected from horror movies these days. Jump Scares, a tragic back-story, an impenetrable villain and an idiot to push the narrative. But to say this film is pure trash is is just wrong. Annabelle: Creation, whilst very typical story-wise ,is one of those rare horror sequels that do not divulge to the pure excess of its genre and its own origin. Its willingness to stay sublime and wait for proper build-up is intensely admirable especially comparing to the tons of lesser horror flicks that came out of the 2000s. I personally did not expected that it was made by the same director who did Lights Out, which on my own opinion is all over-the-place and intensely patchy. In addition, its non-reliance to CGI (with few exception towards the end) and creative camera work were welcome surprises.Also, I would also like to commend the film acting especially Stephanie Sigman as the warm Sister Charlotte, and duo of Talitha Eliana Bateman and Lulu Wilson as the best-friends/orphans/outcasts. (sequel with them please..)Overall, the film is a wonderful enjoyable romp that is able to rise from its own failings. Worth your time.

This ""Annabelle"" prequel failed to meet my liberal standards.The plot of orphan girls moving into a large farmhouse, although contrived, was promising. However, the movie dragged for me. I kept waiting for it to be over. I think far too much time was spent on the orphan girls' personality development and exploration of the new environment, and far too little on the origin of the evil/threat and what had happened to the Mullins, which was not revealed until the third act. The repetitive scenes of bloody violence and torture were unnecessary. I think the film could have been accomplished successfully with only the two youngest orphan girls and Charlotte the nun, and more screen time with the Mullins. It was hard to be invested in the characters when so much run time was spent on the other girls, who did little to move or affect the plot.The last few minutes were eerie and satisfying, with a nice connection to the first film.

184,TheJohnnyPHreak,Tense And Decent Horror Sequel/Prequel,6,9 March 2019,"James Wan has created two decently successful horror series in the last few years. One, The Conjuring series a bit more profitable and well regarded than the Insidious series. I've only seen one Insidious film, I didn't like it but I know the story of the series. The Conjuring on the other hand I love. The first film is Wan on display with his camerawork, character work, and storytelling in one of the best-haunted house horror films in a long time. Like many horror franchises, there are sequels and spin-offs to go along with the original film. I have yet to see Annabelle, the first film. (It's on my list) But after hearing so much praise about the sequel to the prequel (a mouthful) I had to sit down with it just to see what people were talking about.Years after the tragic death of their daughter a toymaker and his wife (Anthony LaPaglia, Miranda Otto) open their home to a nun (Stephanie Sigman) and several orphans (which include Lulu Wilson and Talitha Eliana Bateman). What they don't know is that the family have unbeknownst to all of them fed the creature that has made a home in the toymaker's doll, Annabelle. Once out, all of the household has been targeted but for what, that is something that needs to be uncovered. It's a pretty simple standard setup. There is a tragedy that befalls a good family. And in their grieving to get closure, the let loose something they can't explain nor control.Directed by David F. Sandberg (Shazam!) and written by Gary Dauberman (IT, Annabelle) the film plays out like a normal haunted house film but much more entertaining than it should be. It's a slow start to the film but that's because the filmmakers are building us characters to latch onto. The opening tragedy is swift but emotional. We get to see our cast of characters each with a type personality that's at times more than cardboard. There's a good twist on the 'final girl' situation that most horror movies deal with. I didn't see that coming and was pleasantly surprised in the way the film sometimes subverts normal haunted house horror tropes. It does use a few good ones to build tension. I really never knew where the film was going or where it would end up.I'd not say it was terrifying but it's thrilling. There are great moments of tension and the use of sound is done in a good way. It very much uses all that worked in The Conjuring to its advantage. The difference is when the horror comes it's brutal. I very much am happy to see an R-rated horror film about a demon actually give us some horrific imagery and gore. Being a gorehound, I was excited to see some truly awful after death FX. I was not expecting the film to go all out but it did which was a nice change. The pace is up and down building mostly to an ending that was swift but fun. When chaos reigns, it comes fast and loud. I was expecting more of a body count but it seems the villain of the film acted more personally than anything else.LaPaglia and Otto play the grieving parents well. There is a relatable quality in their expression of loss and just wanting their child back. But it's their naivety is their undoing. All the child actresses are good but Bateman and Wilson standout. Not only do you feel their chemistry as friends but when things go sideways it cuts deep. Bateman, have to play different types of roles in this film is a credit to her. This is the type of yell at the screen horror movies because a lot of horror cliches to occur but they don't hurt the film that much.Annabelle: Creation was quite entertaining for a sequel of a prequel or a prequel of a prequel. I think the second one is correct. With good, convincing performances for the child actors, vets like LaPaglia and Otto putting in the work, the film works as a haunted house horror film that has a story to tell. The unexpected gore and well laid tense sequences help push this film above the general cash grab prequel and or sequel horror fare. For fans of the series, this is a must see. Horror fans in general, I would recommend checking this out. I'm hoping that we continue on the upswing of good films in this series. I've not heard good things about The Nun, but maybe every other film in the series can be good. Because there is an Annabelle 3 coming which will feature The Warrens. Hopefully, the filmmakers follow the path of giving us decent characters to follow with some unexpected terror and gore. Give me that and I'm in.",Annabelle - Creation

Now, to be completely fair, until the final act, I actually wasn't having a terrible time in this movie. I'm not saying it was ever good, but the plot was at least interesting enough to hold my attention, the tone, although relying way too much on jump scares and fake-outs, was intense enough to at least scare the casual viewer and the acting was more or less what you'd expect from this kind of movie (okay except Lulu Watson, it seems this kid based her entire performance on the filmography of Shawnee Smith; Lulu, take it from me, Shawnee Smith was never a great actress, she was just hot enough for people not to notice). One thing that did bother me throughout was that the film was overall scarier when nothing was happening because as soon as it did...urggg...and that brings me to the final act, what the hell were they thinking?? Seriously, did a 12-year-old write this? Try to picture someone throwing together 'Poltergeist', 'Exorcist' and 'Amityville Horror' and then deciding, no this isn't enough, let's throw some elements of 'Friday the 13th' in there as well. The final act throws at us every bad horror movie cliche that has ever existed, it's not scary, it's not intense, the actors obviously didn't know what to do with it either, because they completely stop trying and overall, what could have been a passable horror film becomes something that took effort to sit through. There were only 6 people in this theatre, and I can say, they were laughing hysterically at how ridiculous this had suddenly gotten, me: I just felt sad. So can I recommend this film? Well, no, not at all. Even though I did find the majority of the film passable, it simply wasn't enough to make up for that final disaster of Roland Emmerich proportion.*Light spoiler*One little thing I did enjoy, right at the end, was the inclusion of the original Raggedy Ann doll, which if you know the actual history of Annabelle, was how the original doll actually looked/looks. I'd always thought it was something of a cop-out that they based this franchise around supposedly factual events and then took such a huge liberty by completely redesigning the doll, so I'll give it a very weak high five for that...even though it did throw the franchise's continuity right out the window, but, if this is becoming the standard, then who cares anyway?",Annabelle - Creation

191,mt-95256,"Despite some bland characters and a predictable story, Annabelle: Creation is still fresh and scary for all horror fans. Sinister dolls are still scary!",6,13 August 2017,"In terms of modern horror, I've long thought James Wan to be something of a master; a genius at reinventing a genre so vulnerable to becoming stale, he's made modern horror classics like Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring, all spawning very successful franchises. The latter is the one in which Annabelle: Creation has come from, elaborating the backstory of the creepy doll Anabelle from the first film. The Conjuring series currently encompasses the two main films with a third in the works, with Anabelle being the first spin-off, followed by Anabelle: Creation with The Nun and The Crooked Man not far off. Whilst The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are strong films rife with scary horror and inspired filmmaking, the initial spin-off, Anabelle, was very weak in comparison, with a forgettable story, unengaging characters and few original scary scenes, resorting to cheap jump scares. This didn't bode well for the following the spin-offs. However it's a huge relief that Annabelle: Creation puts the franchise back on course; a much stronger film, this lives up to the reputation of the main Conjuring films and is a vast improvement.Whilst certainly a stronger film than its predecessor, it still has its flaws; namely characters and story. Whereas we have Ed and Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, there isn't a stand out character to remember fondly here, no character being particularly well- developed. Samuel is understandably dower and awkward after what he's been through, but disappointingly nothing of any interest is revealed to be hidden underneath; his wife Esther too is very underwhelming; most of the girls too are generic and devoid of character. Perhaps with a bit more care to writing, genuinely interesting characters could have been developed. Fortunately the central trio are more interesting.While Sister Charlotte was a missed opportunity, it's nice to have a voice of reason grounding the film and progressing both the plot and characters of Janice and Linda. It's these latter two girls, engaging and likable with impressive chemistry for such young actresses, who are much more interesting in terms of characterisation, the former particularly due to her disability. Unable to walk well, Janice's struggle to run away is reminiscent of those nightmares where you try to run but your legs just won't let you. It's refreshing to follow the young girls, their curiosity and childish fear much more appealing than a cynical adult. It's just a shame they seem unbalanced, the main character switching from Linda to Janice and back to Linda; this inconsistency unbalances the film as a whole.As is common with scary films, emphasis is not on story. There is a basic set-up and the rest of the story is easy to follow, all just an excuse for scares. The best aspect of the story comes at the end, where it ties perfectly to its predecessor (only making sense if you've seen the other film; otherwise the ending will be very weird and unexplained). The ending aside though, the story is dull; the set-up is quick but the scares soon come. They come slowly, initially a few cheap jump scares. This changes around half-way, where there are good build-ups to strong horror scenes, some long and unrelenting, immersing you in terror. It's worth mentioning not all shocks come from the doll; yes, it's often used to increase the sinister atmosphere and scares you, but it's employed more sparingly than the previous film, allowing a more diverse variety of frights. Of course there are horror staples to enjoy too; where would we be without chilling music turning on by itself, locked doors, peeping through keyholes and rocking chairs? These are scary films' bread and butter and really do their job well here.Hiring director Sandberg was a good call; although mostly just doing horror shorts and underwhelming Lights Out, this is proof that he can do big horror well (especially with Wan producing), making the most of the scares and set-ups, the use of cinematic devices inspiring. Part of the joy of horror films is audiences and directors competing; the audience tries to guess what will make them jump, while the director tries to surprise them with the unexpected. In Annabelle: Creation's most terrifying scenes, we are constantly competing and it's an absolute joy. Often we can predict things and see jumps coming – hardcore horror fans may find some elements laughable and not particularly scary – but it is still enjoyable. Not that this has terror levels akin to films like The Exorcist; though not massively terrifying, but this is definitely scary and jumpy enough to satisfy most.Although the characters may be a little bland and the story predictable and flat (up until the end), Annabelle: Creation is a strong horror spin-off, easily able to stand on its own without its franchise. Though not the scariest film you'll see, it's undoubtedly frightening enough to satisfy all fans of horror, using horror cinematic devices old and new to continue making a generation of cinema-goers scared stiff of sinister looking dolls. The Conjuring (or Wan-verse as I like to call it) has its first good spin-off – bring on The Nun!",Annabelle - Creation
192,roblesar99,Yet Another Reminder of Just How Creepy Dolls Can Be,7,9 August 2017,"The fourth entry in The Conjuring universe, Annabelle: Creation serves as a prequel to the 2014 spin-off titled Annabelle, which served as a prequel to the original Conjuring film. And considering the critical drubbing that Annabelle received, this film makes for a delightfully horrifying time. Twelve years after the death of their young daughter, a former dollmaker and his wife decide to let a group of six orphaned girls and a nun move into their home. The film primarily follows two of these girls, Janice and Linda. There, strange events begin to occur that eventually lead to the creation of the eponymous character. Director David F. Sandberg, who made his directorial debut last year with the micro-budget horror feature Lights Out, crafts an atmospheric thriller that genuinely surprised me. Despite the generally positive critical reception that Lights Out garnered, I was underwhelmed upon first viewing. Despite some inventive scares, the film failed to take full advantage of its premise. However, that isn't the case for Sandberg's latest.Perhaps the film's most surprising attribute is the strong performances from the predominantly young cast, despite their relatively weak development. Lulu Wilson, who starred in another prequel-to-a-prequel (last year's Ouija: Origin of Evil) that received generally positive reviews, turns in a solid performance as the young Linda, who must contend with the haunting presence of the Annabelle doll manifesting itself into her best friend Janice. Wilson powers her way through any questionable character choices solely on the strength of her work. On the other hand, Talitha Bateman, playing the polio- afflicted Janice, handles her character's progression nicely, turning into a genuinely chilling presence as the film progresses. And despite being underutilized, Miranda Otto, who plays the Dollmaker's wife, gets some of the film's more shocking moments.While Sandberg is a bit too content to play around with genre clichés (we get the requisite amount of scenes involving possession of inanimate objects, crucifixes, praying, and characters opening doors that they probably shouldn't have opened), the film's R-rating feels liberating. Considering that Lights Out was rated PG-13, a lot of its scares never reached full intensity as they were often obscured or otherwise cut short. Sandberg doesn't use the R-rating to deliver heapings of gore and blood, but instead to fashion the film into something that feels refreshingly more atmospheric and intense when compared to his previous work.Indeed, Sandberg manages to (ahem) conjure up some shocking imagery as he uses some of these genre conventions in refreshing ways. In one particular scene, we painfully watch as an unseen entity breaks someone's fingers one-by-one as they clutch as a crucifix. This scene makes for one of the film's thrilling highlights, amplified by the atmosphere that Sandberg has established. Thankfully, Sandberg takes his time to establish these characters, refusing to rush into the scares without first making us care about who will be in the crosshairs. And we do care about these characters, especially Janice and Linda, whose friendship serves as the film's emotional core. While Sandberg unfortunately substitutes a bit of the build-up with a few cheap jump scares, by the end of the film the tension is palpable.Additionally, one of the better aspects of Sandberg's film is that it just feels well-made. Obvious care went into making a believable period setting (the film is set sometime in the late '50s) and it shows through every frame of the film. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre's camera work also surprised me. In particular, a long take early on in the film that shows the young girls running through the house upon arriving shows that Sandberg cares more about crafting a solid horror film than most of today's horror filmmakers. While Annabelle: Creation ultimately doesn't break any new ground or reach the high bar set by the film that inspired it, it still makes for a solid summer horror outing as the summer draws to a close. Featuring strong performances, a delightfully eerie atmosphere, and its fair share of scares, the film delivers on more of the potential that director David F. Sandberg exhibited on his debut feature. I will say, however, that I strongly dislike watching horror films with a big crowd. Keep the commentary to yourself, folks.Rating: 7/10 (Good)",Annabelle - Creation
193,scandinavianmail,Conjuring franchise saves itself from itself,7,8 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is a thoroughly well-executed and thought-out medium budget horror in a creepy house with a creepy doll. It is also a borderline comedy at times, cleverly realising that the doll is not only scary but also rather ridiculous. Moving from scares to laughter and back was done with outstanding precision and taste.The effect where something first happens with thundering sound and action, followed by a deafening silence in anticipation of potential further threats, is somewhat overused, but excellent actors and overall professional production let this kind of small issues pass without much distraction.As a prequel to the previous movie which was also a prequel, the story is eventually tied to the previous Annabelle vehicle, which felt not only unnecessary but quite clunky and rushed.

I don't even know where to begin.First of all, little things like gorgeous, obviously made up nuns annoy me.Secondly, what a disjointed, cliché-riddled movie. It didn't take me long to just wish it would end. The plot is a joke. There really isn't one, surely not a proper one. It's the arrival of the girls, exploration of the house, scary scenes, more scary scenes, then the owners of the house reveal everything, and then more scary scenes. Throughout the film, incredibly bad, unbelieving acting. Anthony LaPaglia was the only upside for me. He managed to portray a character that was obviously grief-stricken but who would seem quite scary to young kids.There is so much that didn't make sense. One minute there is electricity and the next it's back to match-lit lamps and darkness. There is no reason presented to why the wife can't walk. And what the heck kind of a reaction was that to Samuel pointing out to Sister Charlotte a fourth nun in the picture, that she had never noticed before?And finally the pace was SO slow that I was soon yawning and even the scary scenes had absolutely no effect on me. By that point I was simply numb.I cannot recommend this movie. Watch it if there is no alternative and if you don't have to pay money for it.",Annabelle - Creation

197,rs403404,"Don't be scared off: ""Annabelle: Creation"" not a bad flick",6,23 August 2017,"The original Annabelle from a couple of years ago was a movie that literally made no impact on me whatsoever. It was bad, but not the worst movie of the year type of bad. It was essentially just a 2 hour period of my life that is gone and I'll never get back. I was dreading this second Annabelle movie. Watching a bad movie is one thing, returning to watch a sequel (or prequel in this case) to a bad movie feels like I'm just asking for punishment.I have to say this movie isn't remotely as bad as I expected. I wouldn't go so far as to call it good, but it was at the very least a step up from the previous Annabelle. This film has some solid atmosphere, scenes that are very tense, and horrifying visuals. It also has quite a few moments of comedy that I assume are intentional. Additionally, the direction by David F. Sandberg is strong.Notice, I have yet to praise the story. The script is by Gary Dauberman who also wrote the original Annabelle. It goes like this, the Mullins (Miranda Otto and Anthony LaPaglia) lose their daughter (Samara Lee) in a tragic accident. Cut to twelves years later and the Mullins have opened their home to six foster kids and their caretaker Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and that's where most the movie sits at for awhile. People are forbidden from entering the room of Mrs. Mullins and the daughter's old room. These rules go as well as you'd expect in a movie. Throughout we largely follow the children as jump scares happen to them and little else. It takes until the film is almost over to get to any real answers to the questions the audience had. Why does Mrs. Mullins isolate herself? How does this in any way relate to that creepy doll that hangs out in the house? Why is Mr. Mullins always such a downer? I know his daughter died, but that was twelve years ago. Surely life has gone on. These are massive plot points that the movie takes entirely too long to answer.This leads to another problem with the film, and this is a big one. The demon that haunts the house seems to have no rules. One moment is will tear a person in half and the next it has trouble getting someone who's trapped in a barn. It can teleport anywhere at anytime and sometimes even seems to occupy more than one location at once, but for some reason can't quite seem to catch those nosy kids. It's a demon skilled at jump scares, but rarely seems to actually accomplish anything it's shooting for.This movie is an excellent example of a poorly written movie handled by a skilled director. He can't quite make it good, but at times it almost seems like it had a ghost of a chance.",Annabelle - Creation

Supernatural creature with creepy backstory? Check! Annabelle: Creation makes up for the first Annabelle movie a dark page in the brilliant Conjuring franchise if you ask me and manages to give the audience what it wants with good jumbscares combined with a scary plot. The movie itself might not be so scary for the horror movie experts among us but scared or not you have to admit it: The filmmakers had a very strong card in their hands: The creepiest doll in the history of creepy horror movie dolls in my opinion. You were not scared by a demon terrorizing little orphan girls? BOOM! Annabelle is here to give you a heart attack when she appears on the screen.

203,mathijsschaap,A Very good movie!,7,26 August 2017,"Expecting nothing after the lame 2014 'Annabelle' movie, last night we went to see 'Annabelle: Creation'. I love it! With echoes of the 'The Conjuring', it delivers. Of course, this has nothing to do anymore with the 'true' case of the Annabelle doll, but it pays trivia to the real doll with showing the Raggedy Ann doll.But of course, everything within The Conjuring Universe is fictional. Even though Ed & Lorraine Warren claim otherwise, we must not forget they are catholics to begin with, which means they literally believe in talking snakes, talking donkeys, unicorns and seven-headed dragons.I've read the book 'The Demonologist' and Ed & Lorraine really believed the stupidest things, that one would think of as 'medieval beliefs'. They believe in the real existence of werewolves and ghosts transporting money through walls. Yes, ghosts can steal your wallet, if you believe Ed Warren. Ghosts are not likely to rob a bank in that way (which would be the most logical choice) but your wallet.Ed & Lorraine Warren are romanticised way too much in the movies. In real life, for example, they barely were involved in the case of The Enfield Poltergeist, which the second Conjuring-movie was based on. The only reaction Ed Warren gave tot hat case, was that he could gain good money out of it. The Warrens had practically no involvement in the Amityville case and The Warrens have been criticised tremendously in real life. But they make up good stories for movies. Their stories are not real, of course, but as Don King would quote: 'Only in America!' Now, today The Conjuring Universe is expanded in a similar way like Superhero franchises, like Marvel or DC.But this IS a good movie! It does not contain Ed and Lorraine Warren, so we can easily distance ourselves of any 'true story' claim.

A horror film so generic, after seeing it in the movie theaters, I have already forgotten the most content of this supposed ""good horror movie"".So selfish and so poorly executed (for a budget of 15 million, better Filming locations could be found).We have a handful of generic characters written in the most generic way possible. The traditional sick character of the horror movies (Janice), the only friend (Linda) that is with her and the traditional characters that are basically irrelevant to history. Why this movie has so many characters, but only 2 characters are relevant to the story (the two girls - Janice and Linda), and for what, does the other four girls exist?In that, the only thing that make this movie is to have a useless sub-plot and the remaining girls are to be scared by a useless scarecrow ,by the way, this demon has nothing to do with the one that control Janice. Unnecessary, I know.That leads to the conclusion why this film have so many characters and the only way to insert them in the main plot of the film was to create this irrelevant sub-plot , that only serves to distract the public from the main story, even if from since the beginning there was never interest of the writer to develop and create a relationship with the public and for this to the public, if these characters die or live is so irrelevant as the film itself.The reason why films like The Exorcist and Ringu proved and were a success, it was because the filmmakers are focused on a single central character and created the story around this same character. A large number of characters never meant quality. Having a lot of useless people to the story adds nothing to the quality of the movie. Not to mention the poor acting of the main casting (especially from Stephanie Sigman). Not to mention again (without success or quality) that the filmmakers tried to copy some shots from films like The Exorcist and Ringu (just look especially when the kids went to pay a visit to the water well). A horror movie that will only satisfy the genre's weekly fans, but for the rest of the public, just another generic, poorly executed and passable horror film, with nothing new to bring.

Depending on the person of course. I see things or ways of movies in the horror area. As many are very picky and stuff i have a little unique side.To me you got this great movie. Many say in here the characters are lame or so, but to me what i saw is typical girls of all ages in here and they each act and be just like normal girls. As a guy who don't normally jump in a movie i admit i was glued to it very strongely and that is really good for i write horror for fun and and i was really glued to this movie, sucked into it in other words. I jumped a few little times, knowing what was coming but did anyway and didn't realize i did because i normally didn't happens when glued to much into it you become like trapped into it.I liked the Linda girl and Janice a lot the Linda girl reminded me of the girl on SAnta Clause the Movie. They were the cooliest and main real characters in the movie. Somehow the creepy black face and the black hands and the creepiness of the doll and the way things happened in the background and just everything was done really good for me. Not a lot of movies interest me anymore its why i got 3 due to movie amount, for this time aroundi wanted to try out and i haven't seen a new movie in ages.

That's what a horror movie is supposed to do, right?Annabelle: Creation was a rather different experience for me. While I was able to appreciate it on a cinematic level, there wasn't a single scene that had me freaked. Some scenes were all too familiar (the movie even borrowed from the last Child's Play TV movie), others were outright ridiculous. And on five or six occasions, the whole movie theater laughed - not in relief but because the doll looked funny instead of creepy or because of the way characters reacted (when a major character dies in a completely implausible way, the hero tells the kids to go back to the crime scene to have a good night's sleep.)Like all perception, mine is of course very subjective. From the audience's reaction, I guess I'm not the only one who feels this way about Annabelle: Creation, though.But to end on a positive note: I really appreciated much of the cinematography and was quite impressed by some of the young actresses.I'm definitely in for the next one.",Annabelle - Creation

212,ahsawesa,A Decent Prequel,7,19 October 2017,"Unlike the first film which was terrible and a wasted opportunity to establish Annabelle in Conjuring universeAnnabelle Creation does a good job at establishing the scariness of the Annabelle dollThe two lead characters are like-able and the film is overall well made, it doesn't bring anything too new to the table when it comes to horror but it does what it is supposed to do right in some innovative waysThere is a decent story to support the scares that happenAnd since the characters are decent, you care about their well being when stuff hits the fan There are some very creepy well directed scenes Another thing i really liked is how well it connected with the rest of the Conjuring universe without being a gigantic setup or anything, it is its own film while being part of a bigger universeDavid F Sanberg, the director of another good horror film LIGHTS OUT, knows how to make a good horror film and im excited to see what he does in the futureAnnabelle Creation makes up for the first disappointing ANNABELLE filmThough it doesn't break any new ground, it's a good time if you are looking for a decent horror film to watch",Annabelle - Creation
213,meganmarie-19902,Annabelle Brought Back To Life,7,17 November 2018,"In 2013, horror geeks and regular movie fans were left trembling with fear after The Conjuring was released. A sequel was released soon after and then followed by a disappointment spin-off that was Annabelle. So, what could David F Sandberg do to reinstall the fear this occult franchise gave us at the beginning? Well, he gave us back what we remembered, a solid story, questioning throughout and that grip your seat scares.
The film begins in 1943, where we meet Samuel and Esther Mullings who are grieving the loss of their daughter Annabelle after a road traffic accident. Twelve years later, the couple opens their home to a nun and six children left homeless after their orphanage closed. The focus of the film is mainly around one of the children called Janice, crippled by polio she becomes obsessed by the locked room which stores the eerie porcelain Annabelle doll. Unknowingly, Janice has released vexed demon who is free to terrorize everyone in the house, but the demon has a fondness for Janice's soul.
The best thing about The Conjuring franchise is that whilst each movie has its own story, they all interlink at the ending which has us going ""omg I remember that"". We got exactly that with Annabelle Creation, it was basically a prequel to Annabelle itself but the interlink at the ending I did not see coming and the way it all works out to bring it back to how the demonic doll got into the hands of Ed and Lorraine Warren is quite spectacular.",Annabelle - Creation
214,farmeglio,Slightly scary and mostly fun,7,11 September 2017,"If you are a highly religious person, I suspect this movie will scare the ""bejeebees"" out of you. It has all the trappings of a vampire movie without the vampires: holding up the cross to fight the oncoming threat; a display of the eternal battle between personified evil and personified good; sadistic acts done apparently for the pure pleasure of inflicting emotional pain on ""good"" people, while inflicting actual physical violence on those good people who come back to further investigate the awful manifestations while not deterred by fear. But if you have a moral sense of right and wrong deriving from, say, the judicial system, and not so much from organized religion, then you might enjoy the film because of its surprise jump-out-at-you scenes and the fact that there is an internal logic to the plot that holds up through the end. The writing is decent, in other words. Except for the question of why any semi-rational person would go back into that house in the first place. Speaking of the end - don't leave the theater during the credits because right after them, there is another scene that is quite illuminating and scary which will explain how children cannot compete with adults in terms of crafting evil.",Annabelle - Creation
215,jmarinko925,A very middle of the road addition to the Conjurverse So SO,5,19 August 2017,"Annabelle creation is the origin tale of the excellent lead in to the conjuring. I enjoyed the previous Annabelle film more than this it's predecessor. A lot of jump scares and a first act that seems to take forever and a day to get underway. The middle to conclusion does pick up nicely. There is a discouraging after credit scene that is as flat as after cred scenes come. If you have high expectations of your horror films and expect this to serve as a worthy companion to the conjuring films you will not be satisfied. Well seasoned horror fans will be suspicious immediately of the teen and preteen cast. Unwritten horror film rule is kids always survive horror, (In most cases). This leaves very little room for actual horror outside possession and kidnapping. So when you see this film start with a bus full of kiddies from an orphanage your intuition is correct. This would be good to see only when watching the other movies in a conjuring marathon. Unfortunately forgettable in years to come unlike it's predecessor's.",Annabelle - Creation
216,nickijjohnson,Another Conjuring wannabe,2,3 September 2017,This was a movie that added absolutely nothing to The Conjuring franchise. I think Annabelle was a pretty decent scare and I think the main reason why is because the majority of that movie was happening to one person whereas this film is happening to a house full of people thus making it not as effectively scary. Much like The Conjuring 2 I felt most of it was pretty predictable and what made it truly futile was the fact that they still never say exactly where the demon that possesses the doll comes from in the first place. It was basically as though their daughter died and ta da demon appears. Usually there's a Ouija board or some sort of seance that brings a demon forth but this movie thought they'd bypass that. Then you have to watch a child actor pretend to be possessed most of the movie which I think most will agree after The Exorcist every director wants Linda Blair but never gets one. Personally I was not a fan of The Conjuring 2 and I was not a fan of this film either. Annabelle was not as good as The Conjuring and what really makes The Conjuring worth watching in the first place is Ed and Lorraine Warren. Those characters based on the real- life people are about as realistic as these films can get. The film had its moments most of what you see in the preview but let's be honest this was simply pointless.,Annabelle - Creation
217,GeorgeX125,Annabelle: Creation,8,1 September 2019,"Annabelle creators are coming back!

218,davidsaid,Where's the climax?,6,16 September 2017,"The Conjuring movies have given some great cinematic edge of your seats endings but here comes Annabelle and she not offering us the same onslaught!The film got me pretty gripped and i was actually enjoying it, i was being a little forgiving for some of the poor dialogue and imagery snatched straight from the cradle of other horrors but suddenly the movie was over. The pace of the film was good but the the ending came with no climatic tempo and simply ran from the scene before. What should have really been a monstrously spooky take down was in fact about as hefty as putting the cat out for its final nights stroll, a few scratches and that's about it. I have no idea why the director chose to leave the film with such little gusto but it certainly didn't work for me. Funnily enough i had been totally convinced this was gonna be fantastic so bravo to the media team behind pushing this one they certainly managed to pull the wool over my eyes",Annabelle - Creation
219,suganthram,Neither good nor bad,6,23 August 2017,"So the ruins of Annabelle 1 was handed over from John R Leonetti to David Sandberg who previously directed 'Lights out'.Annabelle wasn't an utterly bad film.It just failed as a horror movie with too less scare scenes and more melodrama.So coming to the sequel,I wasn't expecting it to be a masterpiece like the Conjuring,but was expecting some scares.Sure,they were lot of scare scenes,but almost every one of em is predictable,which took the excitement out of the equation.And the one man I missed badly was Joseph Bishara(as composer).He carried the entire below par 1st movie on his shoulders with his amazing score and made it somewhat memorable.It wasn't found in this movie.Clearly David Sandberg needs to take a few lessons from James Wan as to how to generate the suspense,build up and tension which is the major weakness of Annabelle:creation.And the positives include the writing;I liked the way they linked this story with that of the 1st movie in the end.And the cinematography was great.Overall this ended up as a good popcorn entertainer.If you are expecting a movie like conjuring,you'll be disappointed",Annabelle - Creation
220,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,A spooky and faithful entry in Wan's 'Conjuring' universe,7,10 August 2017,"I first want to gloss over Ouija: Origin of Evil, as Annabelle: Creation is heavily inspired by that film. It's a 1960s R-rated horror prequel to a lackluster origin film starring Lulu Wilson based on possession & exorcism, ultimately tying in strongly with its predecessor. As I felt Origin of Evil had strong plot development, acting (though Wilson isn't the standout here that she was in O:OoE), cinematography, and overall eeriness, I could say most of the same things for Annabelle: Creation, though I find them all just a notch below.Given the time period that this film takes place, the technology that was present served this film very well in the throwback sense, either because it doesn't make the characters too idiotic to not rely on their technology more often, or it doesn't allow the supernatural to manipulate their technology too much to the point of ridiculousness. Even traditional items like a bell (similar to The Uninvited), a well (similar to The Ring), or a dumbwaiter (many horror films) work because of the particular time period that it's in and add to the atmosphere the film builds up. Several elements like this were heavily in play and made for a fun setting.Here's where I have a mixed bag of positive/negative, and it has to do with the direction. James Wan is clearly a heavy influence for David Sandberg (Lights Out), but part of me feels like Sandberg and crew watched Wan's Conjuring films, created a checklist, and tried their best to check all of those boxes. It makes for great horror, but part of it makes me feel like I've seen it all before. If Wan was directing, I think he would find a new way to shoot certain scenes and present certain items. Given the setting I was referring to before, I saw all of the foreshadowing coming into play a bit too easily. It's like it was all on-the-nose. You also can telegraph all of the jump scares. That doesn't mean they weren't still effective and that the film wasn't still scary on its own (trust me, there are plenty of non-jump-scare moments that are still very good), but I feel like I just saw a Wan copycat instead of Wan himself is all. I mean that's not a bad thing, because I considered Wan as the new master of horror before he decided to become an action director. Just food for thought is all.Now I will give Sandberg some credit. He played with out-of-focus scenery more than Wan had in the past, making us look in the dark areas or the background to see if something was lurking about. I also think he included more shock factor regarding when things can occur (daytime, early stages of the film) and how at-risk all of the children really were, making them all vulnerable to victimization by injury, possession, and/or death. I also think that without a star-studded adult cast it was a lot easier to give the child actors a lot of limelight, to the point that I knew all of them really quickly (in The Conjuring, I couldn't tell you a single one's name as they were more pawns for Wilson and Farmiga). Every so often he would let the camera cut away for the scary thing to appear/disappear/move and such, but then sometimes he would just say ""screw it"" and do it right in the shot just to mess with the audience, who was thoroughly engaged in this film from start to finish.The thing I think most people have to remember about this film, which I sometimes forget myself, is that Annabelle is just a doll... creepy looking, but just a doll nonetheless. She's not like Slappy or Chucky, where the doll is the soul in and of itself. The doll may act as a conduit for the demon however; we have known this since The Conjuring. However, this demon can also do it in its own form, or into a human, or anything else that it wants to... even more than one place at a time. Makes it kind of strange that Annabelle still remains the highlight of the film by the title, but these films are less about the doll and more about the entity, and that's fine with me. I just have to keep reminding myself that.I want to close by saying that these films (Conjuring 1 & 2, Annabelle & prequel, Ouija & prequel) remind me a lot of the Paranormal Activity film franchise: despite a different setting and finding new ways to try and scare the audience, the story largely remains the same. Big family in big house dealing with possession and finding a way to exorcise it. Personally, I dig them all, but they aren't reinventing the wheel, so don't assume this is a fresh new take on the genre. However, given that Annabelle was so poorly received, you had to assume that if they were making this film, they likely said: ""Let's make sure that doesn't happen again, so what can we do differently?"" They found it, and it's called Annabelle: Creation. Very good, though I've kind of seen it before. That's okay though, because it ain't broke. I just don't know how much longer it can last and still bring in myself and other audiences.",Annabelle - Creation

However, Annabelle Creation failed miserably to live up to its first film. The biggest problem was the children's responses to the paranormal activities. A child who is afraid of ghosts does not go out the way to experience the scariness of ghosts. I had to convince myself that I am watching a comedy in order to finish the film. Annabelle Creation is highly overrated. I know sequels tend to have one low point, but I never expected it this soon. It is quite ironic that Annabelle is about a doll, but adults carry the film better than children.",Annabelle - Creation

Did they ""pray"" for it? Is the devil only in the doll or, as it seems, everywhere? Why does it need a soul if it's already that powerful without it, how does that lady keep her mask on?The film relies heavily on jump scares that are only scary because of how loud they are compared to the film.

This hunk of junk has all the bad over used things you'd expect from a modern day paranormal horror movie.Bad acting, check. Horrible forced jump scares, check. over use of children, check. Poor blatant CGI, check. I can go on but I think you get the point here, avoid this movie like you would a leper. I also want to mention that I feel like the R rating here is not merited outside maybe one scene that could have been cleaned up for the PG13. I believe the R rating was a hoax tactic to get more horror fans who generally shun PG13 movies as well as younger crowds who want to see it just for the sake of seeing an r rated movie in the theater.

230,Skaigear,Solid horror film that you will enjoy at the moment,6,18 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is the sequel to 2014's Annabelle and the fourth film overall in the Conjuring universe. The first movie was an unremarkable foray, as I have forgotten about 80 percent of what happened, thankfully however, Creation is actually a prequel so knowledge of the first movie is not necessary. It also makes this movie a prequel to a prequel based off of real events, which does not exactly scream 'quality'. Everything about the movie before release indicated it will be terrible, but the man behind the camera, David F. Sandberg, not only made sure it was not a train wreck, but was able to create a prequel that surpasses the original.Creation is a fine, watchable horror movie with some very good scares. While it is not as good as Lights Out, Sandberg's previous horror effort, his terrific direction still permeates throughout. Once again, he makes good use of darkness and blurry backgrounds to unsettle viewers. The presence of the monster in horror films is always a tricky issue: show too much of it, it may become a joke like Freddy Krueger; do not show enough, the audience will feel cheated. The film balances the appearances very well, resulting in very satisfying terror. There were some legitimate creepy scenes in the movie too, with my favorites being one involving a scarecrow and another involving herky-jerky movements.I was having déjà vu of Conjuring 1 and 2 during the movie since it draws so heavily from those two James Wan films. Once again, a group of young girls are terrorized by an entity in an old house with each night playing out like episodes; starting with a girl hearing a noise and ends with a jump scare and then fade to morning. It is effective, but predictable by now, so I felt the film should have disguised itself a little more to distinguish from the parent series. Nonetheless, Annabelle: Creation is still a solid horror film that you will enjoy at the moment, but probably will not care much about a year from now.",Annabelle - Creation

The scares are predictable. The characterisations are predictable and dull too. I wasn't made to care about the central couple at all. They are creepy to the extent of being ridiculous. The nun was silly. The kids - best thing about this but still not great. The doll and the demon are a scary concept but the set pieces are old and tired and unintentionally funny. I laughed out loud on three occasions rather than being scared. Its not awful, there are many worse films. But its not brilliant either.

Not only was it a good horror movie, it was also actually a good movie! The story line was solid and made sense. Far more creepier than the original Annabelle, yet I found I didn't jump as much as I did in the first film. Yet the atmosphere it created left me on the edge of the seat the whole movie. Which to me is far better than jump scares! The movie also had very few slow/boring parts if any. Some characters do make stupid decisions which can be frustrating, but same goes for all movies. All the actors in the film were really good, which surprised me since most are so young. They're are a few hidden easter eggs throughout the film that fans of Annabelle and the Conjuring series will probably notice, which was really neat/surprising to see! This movie also ties in perfectly the the first film in a very surprising way that made the crowd of the theatre actually gasp in shock.Anyways a great horror movie and a great addition to the Conjuring Universe! Will definitely see again when it officially comes out! One of my favorite movies of the year.",Annabelle - Creation
238,bseaman-20248,"Give this a pass, unless you've watched everything decent in the Netflix horror genrre",4,23 June 2019,"""Annabelle: Creation"" started out strong. Cinematographically, the first few minutes of the movie foreshadowed that a small family's otherwise simple, peaceful, rural life in Depression Era America was about to be changed irrevocably by something sudden and tragic. That event a few minutes in would come to be for me the only truly frightening part of this move. Frightening, because the event was all too plausible in the eyes of anyone who has had to care for a young child.The acting was commendable enough. There were enough bumps in the night and eerie little hints that all was not as it seemed in that big, old house on a hill to keep me intrigued. However, things fell apart in the second half. Had the scriptwriters stayed with the story arc which the first half strongly suggested, i.e. a simple, eerie haunting made all the more disturbing because the lives of most of the dwellers in the house were already damaged in varying degrees, then this could have been a much better movie. As the credits rolled, my assessment would have been this is decent Netflix fare but I'm glad I hadn't paid $12 to see it in a theatre.Unfortunately, the writers decided to take their story instead into familiar, dumbed-down territory with a cliched Good v. Evil religious motif involving possession. Cheap tricks involving black smoke and snarly demonic voices simply do not work any more, unless perhaps your viewer is 12 and hasn't watched a lot of horror movies. The actors had to work to script and they did a credible enough job working with what they had. But the script could really have profited from serious rewrite.",Annabelle - Creation
239,tiefirst,Some good scares. Some bad decisions,6,19 October 2021,"I read that this was one of the better Annabelle movies. I'm kind of done with the Conjuring/Annabelle act, but I gave this a shot.I wasn't disappointed for the most part. The movie paces pretty good and does have some quality creep and scare factor going for it.I think my criticisms about it would be with the character's decision making throughout the film.For one, why would a grieving couple, not to mention them being an introvert and a bedridden spouse decide that opening their home to orphans is a good idea? Why, also would they do so knowing that they are harbouring a demon spirit? Those questions should have been enough, but there's more.Why would these timid young girls keep breaking into the forbidden bedroom when the man of the house, in his cold unwelcoming manner specifically said to stay out?Why would the youngest girl, after already witnessing ghostly activity, continue to stay in a room by herself?Why does no one light a candle or turn on a light switch upon entering a dark room?Why after the handicapped girl is brutally attacked by the demon, is she brought back to the house and left unattended to?Why after the man of the house is very brutally killed, does the nun and orphans continue to stay in the house?These are fairly normal cliches and poor decisions made in horror movies, but they really hit home in this movie.Again, the scares aren't bad, but the decisions that set them up are beyond stupid.",Annabelle - Creation

241,eliza_gaskell,That's once creepy doll.,8,4 August 2019,"Firstly, David F Sandberg is living the dream - a Youtuber who made short films now directs a Hollywood movie for Warner Bros. Can't get any better than that, and in Annabelle Creations, it is event what Warner Bros. why they chose Sandberg.Although the budget was estimated $15 million, looks top notch. It was a refreshing change to the norm of the modern standard junk horror film. It is reminiscent of horror films of the 70's and 80's were the use of sound design and cinematography is put to good use to create an atmosphere of suspense. James Wan is exceptionally good at this which is evident in The Conjoining (2013).Basically it is Annabelle Creation is a haunted house story with a demon, but is directed in a way that is creative and enjoyable. And yes, it is enjoyable. The story is straight forward, focusing on the friendship of 2 girls; what tears they apart is pure evil.The cast is exceptionally.. The adults actors Miranda Otto,Anthony LaPaglia and Stephanie Sigman were brilliant although this must be, by far, Miranda Otto's easiest acting gig yet - all she had to do is pretty much lie in bed or turn up when her scene was ready. An young Lulu Wilson will be one to watch, she is simply amazing as LindaLastly, the demon was not discriminating with its victim. it picked out the most likeliest, curiously stupid girl character in the bunch of orphan girls who go to theNow for the negatives - way too many jump scares in the first act. It's annoying and it's a ploy too many 2nd rate horror directors use to create a scare.Next, the decisions made by some of the characters, for example a person is killed in the most unnatural and gruesome way and the sister said let's get ready for bed? Really? I'd screaming at the cops to take me with them. Another dumb decision is a ghost is standing in front of Janice, in sheets, and she just stands here....No screaming, no yelling nothing and them she goes back, the next night for more....why?Now although the Annabelle is a freaky looking doll, she essentially does nothing, the demon pretty much does everything. So yeah, Annabelle is lazy - Chucky had to work for his living.In conclusion, Annabelle Creation is a hell of a lot more better than it's predecessor.

244,Kendich89,"Absolute nonsense, but scary nonetheless",6,19 November 2017,"It's like one of those non sequential nightmares which make no sense, start in one direction, following a marginally established context and premise, then, oh hell, all of a sudden and without the faintest interlude take a complete turnaround and shift to something nonsensical and just as awful and depressing as the feverish moments prior.Annabelle: Creation is the product of something relying not on sense, or even slight coherent guidance, but of exploration of scare devices.There are so many things with this awful little movie that just plain make no sense or even attempt to make one. Things apparently happen for no reason at all but to attempt to frighten the viewer, putting faith in the chance that he/she maybe so distracted and driven out of their comfort zone by the jump-scares and those poor little girls' innocent lives at stake, that maybe they may not even notice how ridiculous the whole thing is.In the course of the movie there were explanations, scarce as they might have been, revealed untimely and purely out of necessity as to allow further progression of the story.The problem, however, lies not in the explanations, the lack of once therein, but in the very contradiction they impose. Funny thing is, if you drive all logic and sense out of the equation, the effect is pretty strong. It is a scary and hair-raising, heart beat accelerating film.",Annabelle - Creation

246,adean81,Annabelle Creation Review,7,26 August 2017,"While Annabelle: Creation may not be a great horror movie, it is not a bad movie. It is better than the first Annabelle movie, but not quite as good as The Conjuring. Even though I liked the first Annabelle movie, this one adds more elements of horror. It shows more of the demon that possesses the doll and brings a more haunting atmosphere than the first movie did. For those that have seen The Conjuring and Annabelle, you may be wondering why we needed another origin story for the doll. Didn't the first Annabelle movie explain that? While we may not have needed another Annabelle movie, this one is better than the first and *spoilers* it does tie in with the first movie at the end. What this movie does is explain the origins of the doll and when it was first possessed. The movie literally opens with toy-maker finishing the doll. What the movie does not do, is over explain the demons. All we know is that it needs a soul, but the demon itself is a lot more menacing and scary in this movie. Unlike the first movie which just relied on the creepiness of the doll.Another element to the horror setting is the house on the farm. The whole movie takes place in this big house out in the desert grass hills, miles away from the town. This is a great setting because the demon needs a vessel to be able to travel and keeping the doll in the house is what keeps the demon there. There is some excellent shot inside the house, some great aerial and tracking shots, as well as nice scene transitions. The movie is very well directing, however, there are a few spots in the movie that are lacking. The pacing slows down, and there's no dialogue which doesn't hold the audience's attention.There is one scene in the movie that I thought had a great line, from any horror movie. One character asks what is after them and the little girl replies, ""Who cares? Run!"". Haha. What a smart little girl, no time to ask questions, just run away. So there are some good and fun moments in the movie. Is it one of the best horror movies ever, or even in the last year? Probably not, but it's worth a watch and fits well in with the rest of The Conjuring movies. If you're into these kinds of movies then you will enjoy it.",Annabelle - Creation

250,davebest2001,Some jump scares but unsatisfying overall,4,3 September 2017,"Meeeaahh. I was looking forward to this based on the trailers that I saw. The reviews were more positive than the first Annabelle film, which I found so-so. I feel that Annabelle:Creation is more of the same. That tacky black demon with the big teeth, once again makes an appearance, as does Marilyn Manson dressed as a nun. It started well, but it slowly went downhill from there. Annabelle the doll didn't move a whole lot for starters. And as for the cast, the young girls were very good actors, but Anthony LaPaglia sleep walked his way through the film. The role was quite undemanding for him. The usual camera trickery meant that you were prepared for the jump scares when they came e.g. a terrified young girl is shown on the right of the screen, while the object is dark and blurred in the background. Of course the object is going to move...and sure enough, when anyone looks under the bed, the presence is going to be not under the bed, but directly behind them, when they turn back. Sadly I've seen this all before. It's not a patch on the The Conjuring first film. It's about on a par with the first Annabelle film. I don't think I'll be visiting the cinema if they decide to bring a fifth film to the franchise. I believe there is a new one about the Marilyn Manson nun. Yawn. I don't think I'll bother",Annabelle - Creation

252,Constantine306,Breaks all the rules of the Conjuring universe,6,4 April 2020,"The problem with this film is that the Conjuring, Annebelle and the Conjuring 2 exist. Those films establish rules that are broken in every way during the course of this film. For example, a demon has to have permission to take a soul yet in this it takes one by force. Then there's the fact that in the Conjuring films, specifically, these demons (Annabelle and The Nun) meet their match in the form of the Warrens who by comparison easily best these demons, yet we're supposed to believe these same demons prior to meeting the Warrens were able to defeat nuns, priests and other faithful believers without pause or issue. I mean one literally lived in a convent for heaven's sake. This is where my mind won't stop thinking about the faulty plot and logic of the prequels. Because this means that in the prequels the demons from this and The Nun are disproportionately overpowered compared to their later selves, which kind of breaks the continuity of the Conjuring universe. However the upside is that the actors, particularly the children, in this film are very good. It's very hard to find good child actors and these ladies hold their own throughout. So while this isn't a terrible film it is the weakest and I tend to skip it upon reviewing the franchise.",Annabelle - Creation
253,farchettiensis,A good surprise,7,20 September 2017,"Having seen the first Annabelle movie, I was rather hopeless for this one. No person who takes cinema seriously should waste time with the first movie, that's all there is to it. This one is on a different category, and one cannot but admire the ingenuity of working a poorly conceived story into an actual decent movie.Being obsessed with horror movies, I'm rather bored by writers' lack of inventiveness, and Annabelle is hardly an exception. I guess the Catholic Church does have a use for movie makers, after all. But I cannot but help feeling tired when I see the same symbols being evoked to elicit fear: Beelzebub, inverted crosses, the hour of the devil mocking the trinity, evil nuns, and so on.There is merit to this movie's story, which is to provide an actual explanation to the whole thing. And the denouement is patiently held back from viewers for the better part of the movie. For me, this is what this movie does best, despite the typical American lack of subtlety - they just cannot resist the temptation of explaining in clear and unambiguous words what has happened. Anyways, it's hardly original, but it is pretty decent.",Annabelle - Creation
254,IMDbUser1002,An well-crafted and worthy addition to the Conjuring universe,8,30 August 2017,"""Annabelle: Creation"", is the first event on the timeline of The Conjuring universe. It tells an interesting and unexpectedly unnerving tale of the creation of 'Annabelle'. (A character know for its frightening role as one of the most malevolent presences throughout the franchise) The story revolves around the dolls physical creation, along with the dark events that lead it to becoming the conduit of an unnamed demon, who is the most recognizable character from the franchise. The movie itself, was definitely better the I expected it would be. The movie was significantly better than the directors previous work, and is easily his best movie yet. What I liked most about this movie, was the portrayal of the mysterious antagonist. The supernatural thriller genre almost always leaves out enough details about the antagonist so that it is easily viewed as a force, rather than its own character. This franchise often deviates from that norm by providing their antagonists with personalities and characters traits to the point where they are seen as villains rather than just antagonists. My favourite part about The Conjuring universe is that the villains often purposefully evince themselves in an uncanny and sinister fashion, which makes the villains unique in the way that they are obviously intelligent. This franchise however, uses religious ideology as the base explanation of their supernatural characters & events. Religious ideologies always a powerful theme. So, the villains are in fact unholy spirits, also known as demons. This franchise portrays these unholy spirits as intrusive beings that always have some kind of malevolent goal. Although they are not human, over the curse of this movie along with the rest of the movies, we clearly see the demons display things like personality, and even emotions like anger, and frustration. Unlike the other unholy spirits in the franchise, the unnamed presence using Annabelle as a conduit seems to desire nothing but havoc, and is just trying to acquire either a soul or a human host. The other villains seemed to have a more reasonable motive. Bathsheba, wanted people to stay of her land. As a dangerous & malevolent spirit, she still sort of minded her own business unless you provoke her curse. Valak, a demon with immense power, who is easily the most powerful character in the franchise, orchestrated the events of 'The Conjuring 2' because he wanted one specific person dead, because he saw them as a threat. Annabelle however, just wants to cause chaos and disruption wherever it can.The villains, (being unholy or inhuman spirits) posses previously angelic powers, that they salvaged in their transition from angels to demons. (Assuming the franchise includes that section of the religious ideology) Their powers are complicated and hard to explain. They often seem to have telekinetic control over anything within the area, while being able to either manifest otherworldly sights, or psychologically manipulate what you're seeing. In this movie, the demons rather creative exploitation of the human characters fear, leads to some frightening jump scares, and powerful suspense. The filmmakers display the villains powers very well, delivering the experience as closely as possible to what the characters might be experiencing. Another feature of this movie that I really enjoyed was the plentiful amount of references to the previous movies. (Since the previous movies are based before this one, the references come as foreshadowing.)But this movie was definitely great, a supernatural movie like this is rather uncommon these days. I'd totally recommend this. 9/10",Annabelle - Creation

The problems arising with this type of universe building leads to misdirection and mediocrity within the genre, and within the world the foundational film has already established. While the original ""Annabelle"" falls short in almost every way, ""Annabelle: Creation"" succeeds by presenting rich thrills, genuine scares, and an origin story that serves as a worthy addition to The Conjuring universe. Director, David F. Sandberg is truly making a name for himself within the horror genre, all while continuing to prove that universe building is truly capable if the source material is placed in the correct hands. #annabellecreation",Annabelle - Creation
265,hearthstoneivan,"Enjoyable classic horror movie ,that doesn't elevate the genre and that's okay",8,17 August 2017,"7.7/10 - Annabelle: Creation is the fourth entry in the ""Conjuring"" Franchise. It tells the story about a dollmaker and his wife making their countryside home into an orphanage ,after the tragic death of their little daughter Bee. Yeah there are a whole lot of name puns in this film. The movie is surprisingly much better than its predeccesor. The child actors are great, which is not often the case in horror movies and the other actors ain't half bad. The atmosphere is authentic and the scenes are memorable. While there are plenty of jumpscares, they feel natural and earned, not cheap like in most horror flicks. Yep, the characters make dumb decisions,but not too dumb. Yep, plenty of horror tropes like knee-dragging, ""villian"" teleportation,blanket spooks and locked doors opening by themselves are present ,but they are embraced and done with full capacity. David F.Sandberg delivers a lot of fancy and cool shots across the table ""no pun intended"". We actually do not see Annabelle move, she does it only when we are not looking and it is is very subtle. Darkness plays a big role and it is used very effectively. The third act delivers on the R-rating of the movie through the use of some pretty disturbing imagery,that will be amusing for gore fans and not too over-the-top for others. The only major flaw is that this flick brings nothing new to both the Conjuring universe and the horror genre.Everything is traditional in the best way possible. Conclusion: Annabelle: Creation manages to improve upon the first movie through a decent script, memorable scares and remarkable directing. While not elevating the horror genre, it feels like a classic,fun movie guaranteed to scare the crap out of you every time. SPOILERS AHEAD:Although not making perfect sense, the tie-in to the first Annabelle movie is appreciated. The handicapped girl changes her name into Annabelle Higgins ,which is the psycho woman who possessed the doll in the first movie,explaining that the devil himself is the one we battled all along. Talitha Bateman does a fine job of playing the little-girl-impersonating-demon thing.The demon busting out of the scarecrow manages to be one my favourite moments in this movie,not with being overly creative,but with looking *beep* awesome. Everyone except the parents manages to live through the events,but not without some bruises. The deaths of the parents feature some impressive body horror,ranging from snapping fingers to mutilating whole bodies. The visuals themselves are noteworthy. The subtle references to Valak (from ""Conjuring 2"" and the upcoming ""The Nun"" movie) were small,but effective enough to remind us that this is indeed a shared universe,without getting bogged down in it. And the song ""You Are My Sunshine"" will never be the same.",Annabelle - Creation
266,mom-29-22843,spoilers,6,9 September 2017,"Annabelle Creation is the second movie in the Annabelle saga. However, truly it is a prequel of sorts. The story starts out with a family who loses their daughter in a car accident. The man who loses his daughter is the man who also created the ""Annabelle"" doll. Surprise surprise her name is Annabelle. Cut frame to a group of girls on a bus from an orphanage going to live in the same house with a nun from the convent to guide and protect the little tykes. So, of course Annabelle picks her poison and chooses a little girl made lame by polio. The story goes on and I'm not telling you anything else except there's a lot of jump scares, terrified running, screaming, and general horror mayhem that goes on in all horror films. Jump to the ending where the director thinks ""oh yeah I have to connect this to the first story."" so you get a short scene where they move twelve years ahead. My thoughts. While I liked the movie there was too much action around the girls and the connection to the other film seemed flimsy at best. Why not tell the story about the girls and spend the last twenty minutes connecting it instead of the five minute scene. It would have been good to bring the story full circle and would have made it meatier for the whole Annabelle loving crowd (as I am one of them). I am hoping the writing will be better as the series progresses IF the series progresses. I give this one a 6 at best for the story line and individual acting performances however I'm taking four stars for the flimsy ending.",Annabelle - Creation
267,bottomsgaming,A Frustrating Collection of Generic Horror Tropes,4,8 September 2017,"I'll admit that I don't like the average, typical horror movie. I find most of them to be generic, regurgitated jump-scare fests that forego any semblance of storytelling or good writing for cheap thrills and loud sounds. I am, however a fan of a few of the ""horror renaissance"" movies that have become popular in recent years. It's an obvious namedrop, but I found The VVitch to be excellent precisely because of it's focus on atmosphere and its ability to encourage the audience to think, and not rely solely on jump scares for entertainment. I didn't expect Annabelle: Creation to be that. Of course not. I did, however read some of the good reviews and thought, ""what the heck, I'll take a flier on it,"" despite finding director David Sandberg's other feature ""Lights Out"" to be rather silly and mediocre. Sad to say, all Annabelle: Creation delivered was more of the same tired tropes that have been plaguing average horror movies for the better part of 20 years. To put it simply, the entire final hour of this film consists of the ""plot"" forcing the dumb and pointless characters from one contrived setpiece to the next, all while typical haunted house jump-scares and loud noises attack the audience at every turn. I'll quickly address what I did enjoy about this film. The first half-hour or so is watchable. Some of it is actually very well done. It does its job, setting up a good atmosphere around this gritty, creepy 1950s farmhouse and the darkness surrounding it and the husband and wife continuing to live their after the death of their daughter. I understand that a lot of this is also your run-of-the- mill horror setup, but I like that it takes its time, and demands at least a little bit of patience from the audience while it focuses on said atmosphere. For a little while, I actually thought that the movie knew what it was doing. This is capped off with a great slow- burn of a scene in which the main character and one of the orphan girls, Janice, releases the demon from its closet prison. The scene takes its time, is well- shot, and has some deeply unsettling moments, culminating with - not a jump scare or a monster popping out as the tension increases - but with more of an anti-scare, as the sheet falls off the doll, revealing that it's not actually there. It's a great scene that actually opens up possibilities of other psychological elements being in play for Janice. But guess what? From here, the movie throws it all right out the window.From this point on, it feels like the filmmakers remembered the 100 jump-scare quota that the studio required them to hit, and just decided to cram it all into the final hour. It feels like a different movie from here. I'll try to avoid talking incessantly about the jump- scares, but it bears repeating that from this point on, every other scene I criticize has too many jump-scares in addition to the other problems. Every one. First off, the demon's powers in this movie are ridiculous and inconsistent with what the plot needs. In addition to the doll itself, which is just its conduit, it can seemingly possess anyone it gets its hands on (which is somehow only Janice), as well as any inanimate object it so desires. It can also manifest its own demonic presence anywhere it wishes, at any time. It can turn invisible whenever it wants, teleport itself or the doll (and presumably other objects) to anywhere else at will, and also has telekinesis. Yep. How anyone survives more than five minutes against what is basically a god can only be explained by the demon being grossly incompetent with its own powers, or by it not wanting to kill any one else (other than the parents, which it does kill, with ease), in which case this is all pointless. Either way, who even cares at this point?Scenes that could be decent atmospheric scenes are ruined by this terrible power paradox and the filmmakers needing to cram sounds into every possible void. An otherwise well shot scene of one of the girls running the doll out to drop into the well is ruined by these flaws. The scene works just fine with her anxiously looking off into the empty fields, then back at the house, as she quickly tries to make it to the well. This would build the scene perfectly. But no, we can't have 30 seconds of good tension anymore. Gotta edit in loud, obnoxious footsteps following the character that comically cease when she turns around. It's like an episode of Scooby Doo. And really, what's the point? The demon gets off on scaring little orphan girls and doing nothing else? Why am I still watching?My favorite bit of ridiculousness is when Janice gets possessed (check that off on your horror bingo board) and turns from a sickly, shy, scared young girl into a walking, grinning, sarcastic maniac that cares more about delivering clever one-liners than doing anything of importance. It's as though she's not possessed by a demon, but by an MCU cast-member as she tries to deliver stupid mic- dropping lines while slowly chasing people through the house and doing nothing. Possessed Janice dicks around while other pointless characters get scared by a possessed scarecrow, while another girl gets scared by a possessed dismembered torso, while the audience gets scared by their life choices. Each of these scenes is, again, saturated with endless loud bangs and monsters assaulting the screen. In the end, nothing happens. The last hour is generic trash. It gets tied into the first Annabelle movie, which is somehow supposed to be worse than this? I won't be finding out.",Annabelle - Creation
268,talizen,Such an outstanding horror flick David F. Sandberg delivered,7,15 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation is the first horror movie I ever watched in cinemas and it was scary as. It was definitely better than the first Annabelle film which wasn't that great at all, scary but bad. At first when Warner Bros. started working on the sequel/prequel to the first Annabelle, none of us wanted it after how bad the first one was but after watching this film the sequel to the prequel, it was surprisingly very good. David F. Sandberg delivered such an outstanding supernatural horror flick in the Conjuring universe James Wan started since the first Conjuring film. The film showed a lot of jump scares with such scary tones every second of the film when it comes to night time. It gave us great story and plot to show us that a ghost of a little girl that was taken from a family turns out to be a demon and took possession of the doll and then wants a soul of a girl who was suffering from polio.

270,SciFiandScary,"Much better than the original, but still nothing original.",5,22 September 2017,"Annabelle: Creation was significantly better than it's predecessor. Yet, it still somehow managed to be completely unoriginal and almost completely reliant on jump scares. That doesn't really seem like it should be possible, butLulu Wilson, who stole the show in Ouija: Origin of Evil, is likely a big part of what makes Annabelle: Creation a decent film. Her role in this movie is a bit different than in Ouija (which I'm glad of). She's a charismatic little girl, and can communicate quite a bit with just the widening of her big blue eyes. She's almost completely believable in her role. I hope she avoids being typecast as she grows up, because I'm looking forward to seeing her refine her skills. I have a feeling she's an actress worth paying attention to. Talitha Bateman's performance wasn't as captivating as Wilson's, but she still did a decent job.It was directed by David F. Sandberg, who gave us Lights Out in 2016. I didn't recognize his name going in or I would have had higher expectations. Lights Out wasn't exactly groundbreaking film- making, but it did give us a very powerful ending and an intense atmosphere. Both of which are absent in Annabelle: Creation. The director of photography was Maxime Alexandre, whose work we've seen in Silent Hill: Revelation, The Crazies, and the Hills Have Eyes. And if you've seen any of those films and can't remember anything special about the cinematography in them, you won't be surprised by the lack of any memorable work in Annabelle: Creation.One of the things I did like about the movie was the reveal of the couple's story. It's sad, but touching, and I definitely empathized with them. It would be very easy to do what they did. I can't blame them at all, even if it was extremely stupid. And I do like the way they tried to fix things. But, once that type of evil has made itself known, I'm pretty sure you can't permanently fix it. I should note, though, that yet again there was nothing original here. I guess that means extra kudos to the actors for still making me feel for them. Annabelle: Creation ties very neatly to the beginning of the first Annabelle film. Not as well done as Insidious 2 to the first Insidious film, but it works. It also includes a nod to the original Annabelle doll (hint: Looks nothing like the movie Annabelle). Overall, Annabelle: Creation is forgettable, but not horrible.",Annabelle - Creation

Pathetic acting, a very weak and watered down story line, massive amounts of CGI thrown in and overused for bad measure and you have Annabelle: Creation.It is almost as though this was made for children, and the director tried to maintain a PG13 rating throughout the whole thing, but then we see a dismembered body hanging on a wall - Make up your mind - which is it??The backstory was not explained in detail, things were only hinted at very slightly, and it was one of those horrible films where you get up to leave, thinking that it's finished, when there's...painfully STILL MORE to go. Several times this happened. Even after the credits rolled, there was...still more!!If I could rate this no stars I would, it deserves it. NO effort or love went into this film, no passion for the genre, no authenticity, just MONEY MONEY $$$.Avoid it at every cost.This film and it's creators (if you can call them that) does not deserve your time, money or sanity, so save it for the small selection of horror filmmakers who are still trying to keep this genre alive.",Annabelle - Creation
276,gewizardhire,Surpringly good for a 'spin off',7,28 September 2019,"It is definitely not perfect, and there are some tedious bits to the movie, but overall if you like the 'Conjuringverse', as I've seen some calling it, I definitely think it is worth a watch. It is the best of the Annabelle movies in my opinion (and some of them are just trash lol).Predictable? Sure, but well done and has some good fright moments and works on suspense more than the rest of the Annabelle movies.",Annabelle - Creation
277,criticadelcinema,A prequel of a prequel has no business being this good.,8,20 July 2017,"A prequel of Annabelle, which was the prequel of The Conjuring. Absolutely nobody asked for this. Nobody wanted this. No one. But, thankfully (surprising, right?) we got it. Annabelle: Creation has no business being this good. Funny enough, the same can be said about 2016's Ouija: Origins of Evil. It is strange that these two bizarrely similar films were released within a year of each other. Both follow up on terrible first films. Both are prequels of those terrible first films. Both shouldn't have been made. Both are extremely effective horror films. Oh, and both star the excellent child-actor Lulu Wilson. The similarities don't even end there. After the film ended and I saw who directed this, everything made more sense. David F. Sandberg has the reins here–who you might remember from directing Lights Out, another surprisingly great 2016 horror flick. The work done in that movie with the use of lighting and repetition is just as suspenseful here (if not more so, in some scenes). Sandberg thankfully stamps what could have been run-of-the- mill horror scenes with his signature creativity. Horror largely relies on the talent of the director, and this is a case of the direction only elevating the film. While Lulu Wilson is a definitely a standout in her second straight horror movie role, her counterpart Talitha Bateman also gives a great performance. As in most horror movies, most of the scares are seen through the eyes of the children in the film. Luckily, the two youngest actresses here–Wilson and Bateman–practically act circles around the rest of the cast. In fact, there were quite a few moments when I felt as though these two actresses deserved a better script. The pair definitely do the best they can with what they are given however, adding a great deal of character to this film. The bar is low when it comes to horror film scripts. Even the best of the genre still have the occasional cringe-worthy line or plot hole (The Conjuring 2, I'm looking at you). All this to say, I'm going to go easy on the faults of Annabelle: Creation's script. The writing here is not bad by any means. There are cringy lines here and there, but that is to be expected. The characters make extremely poor choices, but even that is to be expected. The problem rests almost solely in the dull first 30 minutes of this film.Look, I'm all for slow burn horror movies. But when the star of your horror film is an inanimate object, you just can't afford to have a slow opening act. However, once this film starts picking up with the scares in the latter half of the film, much of that first act can be forgiven. The film goes in some unexpected directions towards the end of the film which adds some surprising creativity. No spoilers of course, but the way the first Annabelle is tied in to this film is outstanding. So outstanding that it almost makes up for the 90 minutes I wasted sitting through the garbage that was that first film. Almost. Credit to director David F. Sandberg for rescuing this franchise from a tedious first film. Annabelle: Creation is legitimately scary, which is all you can really ask for from a horror film.",Annabelle - Creation

282,originalgrooviemanncomic,Amityville II: The Possession at least is entertaining as a Prequel and Sequel!,7,1 October 2017,"I've seen the Conjuring the year Annabelle came out, the Conjuring was excellent. Well written, acting is spot-on and it keeps you on edge. Annabelle however was not as interesting as the real-life story. Especially with the fictitious creativity they had. The Conjuring 2, excellent like the first and really gives you an urge of just researching ""England's Amityville.""Annabelle: Creation in my belief, was alright. I like the idea from the first few minutes--if they developed it around the first few minutes, probably it would have been interesting to see the couple haunted by the doll! But it is an entire fiction-base of around orphans! I love how the actors and actresses did, but I felt the idea of being a prequel to Annabelle sounds intriguing. With practical effects neglected it's more digitality for true stories that won't be portrayed the way they happened. And they'll always tell us: ""The Truth, is stranger than Fiction.""Annabelle: Creation, a gimmick more than a creation. Amityville II at least had creation with it's confusing affirmation of being a Prequel or a Sequel.

284,rafaelsimer,A must see...with someone (avoid being alone)!,9,1 November 2017,"I enjoy horror movies. But the good ones, not those that begin with ""five youths go on vacation, but end up finding death"".Both ""The Conjuring"" movies were good. Very good, I'd say, for today's standards. Good cast, serious acting, a good, dark and compelling story. They were elegant, but not scary.Yes, yes, I've heard the rumors of people being frightened in the theaters, leaving before the movie ended and being horrified of the nun. I think it's only that, rumors. Usually made up as part of the marketing for the movies. But they were respectable movies, because they respected the audience.But this one, this was better! It was sad that that Warrens don't appear, since it's set many years before they found the doll. Pity, both actors were very good. This story is darker, is about pain, suffering, loss of faith. The scary bits are good, well developed. And the kids acted very well, I must say.Another good think about this movie is that, even being connected to the other 2 ""The Conjuring""s (being their prequel), you don't have to watch any of those before. You can watch this one and then go to those; or just watch this one and stop there. It's a good story on its own.I wasn't expecting a lot of this one. I knew it'd be nice, since it's Annabelle-related, but it managed to be the best one of the saga...in my opinion, of course.I recommend: watch it, enjoy it, thank me latter.",Annabelle - Creation

-> the demon is immune against crosses and prayers, as shown in the middle of the movie
-> the demon can be imprisoned in a room if bible pages are glued around it
-> the demon can easily escape from said prison at the end of the movie
-> the demon can teleport
-> the demon cannot teleport

-> the demon needs permission to go into a puppet

-> bonus demon appears out of nowhere in scarecrow. or is it the same? did he get permission?
-> demon can appear as ghost girl and demon nun as well as he pleases, doesn't need to stay inside the puppet that it is bound to
-> demon is extremely strong, can rip people in half, but a girl stepping on its fingers causes too much pain to keep following herseriously, make up your mind.* how stupid are the characters?-> the demon is clearly dangerous, but let's enter the house again for no reason.
-> let's absolutely not make sure the demon stays inside the room by putting a layer of concrete around it. no, a wooden door will suffice.
-> let's not talk to each other. we must absolutely experience the scariness one by one.
-> let's not believe each other, even though nobody has a reason to lie.
-> demon: let me stay in puppet form and let myself be thrown into the well and only then transform back. why? because i want it to last longer.""Despite the fact that absolutely NOTHING made sense in this movie, there were some watchable scenes. The only scene I liked was the part with the girls in the car and the scarecrow/one of the older girls inside the shack with the scarecrow,
and it only lasted until the thing in the scarecorw decided to shift into it's original form. Seriously why do they always mess up and thinking that demonish, develish appearance is supposed to be a scary yet alone a highlight.

286,mooviesuniverse,'Annabelle: Creation' is a dollicious genre flick,7,18 September 2017,"Pinocchio's evil cousin is at her absolute worst in 'Annabelle: Creation', the latest installment in The Conjuring Universe. While the final product isn't a very original horror movie it does scare the bejeezus out of you from time to time.Dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) lose their daughter after a tragic accident. Twelve years later the mourning couple decides to take in sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a group of orphan girls. By helping out the orphaned girls the Mullins' hope to bring a little bit of life back into the house. One room in the house, the bedroom of their daughter, is off limits. When Janice (Talitha Bateman), one of the youngest orphans, who's suffering from the consequences of polio does enter the room things go south really fast.Young Talitha Bateman, who plays the lead, does an admirable job. Her BFF Linda (Lulu Wilson) is less convincing. The other characters are underdeveloped and serve no real purpose. Not to mention their decision making is questionable at best. Clichés are an often recurring problem in the horror genre and it's no different here.But despite its obvious flaws the movie does work. Director David F. Sandberg, who directed last year's horrorhit 'Lights Out', really knows how to build up tension. He uses light and sound in an effective manner and the setting (old creaking house in the middle of nowhere) is great. It's not an edge-of-your-seat movie but there's definitely a sustained sense of threat and there's some really good scares that'll make you jump out of your seat.'Annabelle: Creation' isn't nearly as good as 'The Conjuring' but it's a huge step up from the original 'Annabelle'.",Annabelle - Creation

Pace is slow after 35 minutes I was about to give up it gets good but slow to get there. Some scenes were really dark so had to turn out the lights to see the scenes.

289,jalkazar,Annabelle: Creation provides competent scares but tries to be too many things at once,6,9 September 2017,"Many good horror movies rely on a gimmick - the clap clap from the first Conjuring, Freddy existing only in your dreams from Nightmare on Elm Street etc. - and clear rules that the monster/creature/killer follows. The gimmick entices the viewer and gives us a hook or perspective on the story and the rules creates the foundation of this world and this is where Annabelle struggles.First of all there's no clear hook or gimmick and much like how the second Conjuring decided to throw in the crooked man this movie decides to throw everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. It's also very unclear what the rules are since the ""presence"" (we'll call it that) is sometimes prohibited by mere physical obstacles but teleports around at other times as well as somehow being in two places at once with no explanation. I'm fine with a creature essentially teleporting but you can't mix and match features the way they do in this film without it losing some of what makes it endearing. The child actors are mostly fine as are the whole crew but the writing does little to necessitate such a large amount of kids. We get to know very few of them and it's not like they're treated like cannon fodder for the presence either. Actually I think having so many kids somewhat subtract from the horror since I subconsciously know that are major studio won't run around killing children in their movies.The ending of the movie is perhaps the worst part. It doesn't work because of three reasons. Since there's no set rules there's no clear end game scenario and the horror just kind of fizzles out because the run time needs it to, secondly the very last part of the movie just don't make sense to me and thirdly the beginning of the first Conjuring movie don't add up after what is set up in this movie. With that said you'll get a few scares out of Annabelle: Creation and it's a perfectly passable horror movie that is going to rake in money and put further faith into The Conjuring cinematic universe even if it does very little to add any depth to said universe.",Annabelle - Creation
290,deadgirlsamara,"A good movie, which surprised me",9,21 September 2017,"So this will be like the 192nd review of Annabelle:Creation, one which no one will read, but I have to post anyway.I was highly skeptical when I first went to see it. Annabelle sucked, the Conjuring was not bad, but I got tired of all the Ed and Lorraine Warren where the first 15 minutes is hype for which ever movie was up next. I expected that on this one. I was more than pleasantly surprised when that didn't happen.Love the kids, Lulu Wilson was her usual great self portraying Linda. But I was amazed at Talitha Bateman's performance, her Janice was spot on. The only who seemed lost was Anthony LaPaglia's Samuel Mullins. I think it was part of who he's become rathe3r than bad directing for the rest of the movie was directed well.Here come possible spoilers.The opening sequences show a bus full of young girls from an orphanage. They are headed to the house of Sam Mullins where they will be staying as their orphanage closed. We are brought in to Janice and Linda sitting in the back of the bus talking about possible futures and promise to stay with the other no matter what.Not long after their arrival at Mullins' house the other girls want to go exploring and ask if Linda and Janice wanted to go with. Janice was hesitant because Janice has polio and cannot walk. So Linda leaves her in spite of the promise on the bus. This happens a couple times. Eventually, Janice takes to exploring inside the house and enters a room, one forbidden to them to enter. In this room she finds a secret, locked door. She opens it to reveal the doll that would be Annabelle.Once Annabelle is awakened the paranormal happenings in crease exponentially. Janice is drawn in more and more. Annabelle was the name of Sam Mullins' daughter who was run over 12 years earlier. the entity in the doll assumed the name Annabelle. As we learned in The Conjuring Annabelle doesn't want to possess the doll, she wants to possess Janice. Will Janice survive or will she be Annabelle?",Annabelle - Creation

This is one of the few rare Hollywood movie that made me sad. utter sadThis was straight out from Bollywood who make mindless horror movies that have no plot, no logic and never explain and show anything that shouldn't be there Anyways, This was very very poor on all levelsI would start with plotPicked up straight from Indie or low budget movie called "" WAKEWOOD"" where upon an accident the couple somehow manage to get the dead girl back to visit home so that the parents can spend time or be with the deceased. Thats the plot told in 1 straight line by the mom in second half !!!Logic !!The most irritating thing about this movie was the way the characters or people in those circumstances behave !!!I would call it paradoxical.. Read, might be interestingThe scares, horror, blood and all that was meant to scare the audience right? Thats the purpose of a horror movie and we get to feel what the on screen character is feeling !! the better we feel or real we feel in sync with the on screen characters, better the movieNow assume this, 90% of the movie screen time is by 2-3 little girls and they get to experience the horror in that houseAnd Guess what ??? None of them are scared a bit !! They all have a over aged or over matured kids expression on faces and face all the scenarios with utmost care, logic and perfection !! None of the get scared by the antics or jump scares or watching the doll or its tactics !!! They just simply run n hide !!The NUN or the leading lady, one of the worst written character for a movie with a wooden face all along.Imaging the stupidity: You stay in someone's house and he gets brutally murdered in a horrific way possible and this NUN's reaction in the next scene/frame is...Girls lets go to bed !!!Cut to next scene !!The girl tried only once to explain to the NUN about the ghost in house and she is cut before she could start explaining and that's it !!As if nothing happenedThe little girls behave, act and respond to the ghost as if they do that on daily basis !!!Annabelle died due to an accident and came back as a deranged spirit which serves no logic and why is her anger or anything is never explored nor explainedThe Father lives in the house cold blooded since scene 1 when the daughter was alive and whats the purpose of doing what he is doing throughout the movie makes no senseThe attention of the response to stimuli of the residents is so so cringe worthy that i made it look utterly gibberishYou know you would hate the movie when they start showing 5-6 year old kids talk/behave/express/work like 20 year old people !!!Thats just plain stupidityAnd again the climax which was utterly forced, speedy and nothing worth talking about as they wanted to end asap as everything needs to beUtterly disappointing and pure evil in terms of movie making. They just made it as it had to be made to en cash the sequel-prequel thing which is ""in thing"" in Movies now. Never expected such a loosely, forced horror movie which is full of plot holes, illogical scenes and pure stupidityThis is no Hollywood movie which retains mot of the logic or I Would say as much as possible within the boundaries of entertainment and make it more worth watching.Conjuring 1 and 2 were well made and little to non such things as this one is abundant of themDon't go by the hype, wait for it to come on VOD or rent it at the max.",Annabelle - Creation

The movie looks good and does contain some decent scares and tension-builders, but it ultimately leaves you with a sense of having seen nothing new and once again with a ton of questions about the 'rules' that define the power of the doll/demon. If this demon can rip the old lady in half at the end, then why is it farting around slamming doors and disappearing from under a sheet for an hour? If you have a doll that contains a soul-hungry demon locked in your back bedroom, find another form of penance other than inviting half a dozen curious, largely unsupervised children into your house.What I did like was the tie-ins to The Nun and the first Annabelle film, both done well without being a huge nudge in the ribs.In summary, nothing new to see here but a pretty enjoyable horror movie if you take it at face value.",Annabelle - Creation

I'm conflicted on how I would rate this...The two young girls both did awesome jobs in the movie... although I suspect they are older than whatever they acted in the flick... by having them as the main characters... I think it did a great job of adding tension / suspense... ie, ""yes, a little girl would run into a closest and hide..."" etc... I tend to get more sympathetic about kids having to deal with this stuff over adults, so yeah, the idea worked... I enjoyed the movie...The downside is, the effects were for the most part were really kinda cheesy and predictable... and the plot falls into the same category...I'll let you guys make up your own mind... but for a $15M budget...

302,steve-679-850526,Another cliché horror movie,2,25 September 2017,"This will contain spoilers, although if you've seen any horror movie ever, none will be a surprise.First the little girl dies and they flash forward a dozen years when the grieving couple open their home to some orphans. Then for a while they make out the dad to be some sort of creeper without any explanation as to why. The mother is mysteriously hidden away in a bedroom ringing a bell.Of course there are the token characters who make up the cast. A young crippled girl is the ""first"" to get the scary feeling. Like that's never been done before.Then the first major plot hole surfaces. The little possessed doll has been locked in a closet for a dozen years. The walls and door papered with pages from the bible to keep the demon at bay. Again, a blind man with a cane could see this one coming.All of the sudden for no reason whatsoever, the locked closet, the bible covered walls and the locked bedroom no longer hold back the demon. It leaves a note on the floor for the little girl to find. Magically the bedroom door is unlocked.Giving them a little credit, the girl did have to unlock the closet. Of course once she locked it again, the demon can now unlock it at will.Like every demon in every single horror film ever, the demon/ghost is able to levitate items, throw items, possess people, etc. but if you run into a bedroom and lock the door, the demon/ghost is powerless to get in. This happens more than once during the movie.Again, like all modern horror stories, the demon/ghost can easily kill people with just their powers (like the dad in this movie) yet needs a knife or some other object to kill the little girls. That way they can escape of course and be ready for the next movie.So after an hour or so of regurgitating every bad thought in a horror movie, we see the little possessed girl get thrown into the closet with the walls that are covered in pages of the bible. The demon/ghost goes wild, knocking things all over the house over, blowing out lights, and shaking the entire house, but supposedly cannot get out of the closet.Low and behold, instead of getting out and slaughtering the survivors, the possessed girl does in fact get out of the closet and finds her way to the next orphanage. Major surprise there right? This isn't the worst horror movie, just nothing new, nothing original, and follows the cliché horror script throughout.",Annabelle - Creation

304,StiflerAtem,James Wan is a horror master.,8,17 March 2018,"The first Annabelle gave the doll some basis and established her deadly legacy, but it lacked any true backstory of her creation! The prequel, as so titled, helped fill in the creation story and establish the origin, something that the first movie couldn't do!
The scare factor in my humble opinion is at his best in this movie, continuing the Conjuring's legacy!
Annabelle is creppy by herself, a creppy creppy doll, it's deceiving smile still gives me chills!
Moving to the second-rate part, the protagonists of the film held a lot of potential to develop as characters, but unfortunately they didn't; Scares are getting easier to predict in this day and age and Annabelle: Creation almost escapes this trend, while there are some moments that were pretty good ties, the tatics got a little repetitive for a few times!
Overall, Annabelle: Creation is one of the best horror movies of the year so far and perhaps it will indeed be the best of 2017 ( I think Saw 8 which has also been created by the master of horror James Wan will have a word on this topic), it is dark, creppy and keeps you invested in the movie for the two hour run time!
And its never too much to remember everyone that James Wan is an absolute genius and a freaking horror master! And we still have 3 more movies incoming from this amazing brain, Conjuring 3, The Nun and Saw 8!

305,carlos-glz026,Average horror flick,5,21 August 2017,"Annabelle: Creation, is the latest film from The Conjuring franchise. It tells the story behind the creepy doll from previous movies.The movie, in my opinion, is not as good as people and critics are saying, but not as bad as the first Annabelle movie. On the positive side, we have good acting. The lead girl, who played Janice, was excellent. The cinematography added to the creepy atmosphere, and there's at least a couple of very well done creepy scenes.On the negative aspects, well, the movie does nothing different to stand above it's predecessors; i knew when a jump scare was coming, every single one of them is predictable. The story is very simple and the execution was, well, not bad, but it made the movie feel very familiar. And i think the movie is just a little overlong, the final sequences really broke the eerie atmosphere it set in it's first act.It's not terrible, and it can be a fun time at the movies but, the movie is just so average that i don't know if it's really worth it.

I don't want to spoil anything, but I highly recommend watching this movie, and preferably alone to get the full horror experience.You will get scared but most of all, the child actors in this movie are so damn good, that you cannot help but actually care if they live or die. That's something a horror movie rarely managed to do.I wouldn't call this a perfect horror movie, but it damn well comes close, would it not be for the last couple of seconds attempting to glue the two movies together.

308,LoneWolfArcher,I liked it but could have been better,8,22 November 2017,"I have been a fan of The Conjuring universe since the first film. I think as far as horror goes they are among the most well done films in the genre.Before I get into the review of this film, I'd like to address a common criticism of Annabelle. ""It just just like Chucky."" That is so wrong. Chucky was an animated doll with snarky one-liners. Annabelle, as is the case in The Conjuring universe, is much more sinister and foreboding. Other than rocking in a chair, you never see her move. That adds to the fright factor. And the doll is just beyond creepy.Now that that is out of the way, this film doesn't deserve the ratings it is getting here. I felt it was fairly well done and written. The best criticism I have heard of it is the poor decisions of the characters in the film. Yes, they do make some bad decisions, but then who hasn't? It isn't like the young ladies in the film were expecting their to be an evil doll locked in the closet of the house.In fact, this is the biggest criticism I can think of for this film. Why the Mullins didn't explain to the orphans that they had a daughter that died, and that for sentimental reasons her room was off limits is beyond me. The secrecy of it all leads to juvenile curiosity, and the unleashing of the banished evil in the doll in the closet. Still, the movie is pretty well done and I love (minor spoiler alert) the way it was tied into the first Annabelle movie. Definitely worth a watch if you are fan of The Conjuring and its universe. (Note, one other tie in I enjoyed was the picture of the nuns with the evil nun from The Conjuring series showing on the right.)",Annabelle - Creation

I did not particularly enjoy the predecessor 'Annabelle' but I did like 'The Conjuring' where the eponymous doll is first introduced.

I decided to watch this because the first billed star is Miranda Otto and then Anthony Lapaglia. Miranda Otto has less than 5 minutes total screen time, embarrassing these two stars would be associated with such crap.

Sandburg was directing it my expectations further rose and then what I saw was contrary to what I expected. I mean, the movie lacks a good story. It has unwanted characters and is not at all scary.

It does a nice job of filling in the back-story for this evil-looking doll (why would anybody even keep one of those in their houses?!). Though the characters are too many and underdeveloped, the leads do their job quite well, considering their age.The lighting and the soundtrack blend together perfectly to give the audience some great scares, evoking many-a-scream and edge-of-the-seat action.

Much of the horror released these days insists scaring the audience with cheap, while effective in my case, jump scares. While Annabelle II has a fair share of these moments, it is also full of what makes great horror movies; tense slow panning shots that follow characters through hallways and straight up horrific imagery. For this I give the movie credit, it's more of a slow burn than say the Conjuring 2, which is always appreciated in my book when it comes to horror. Performances are perfectly acceptable and service the movie well enough and the same can be said for the CG effects. Maybe the most terrifying point of the movie is the brief, albeit effective, cameo of the terrifying demon nun from Conjuring 2, a character so scream-worthy the production studio that she's/its getting a standalone title.

It is true, that there were moments, in which you were afraid. But suddenly, another take of the movie has changed your expectations, unfortunately not for the better.

The strong points is definitely the build up suspense and jump scares. One of the best in recent years. The young actresses did great also along with the father who takes them in.

Oh there is a dead man all fd up... let's go to bed girls, in the same house... who ever was looking over the script could of made it stronger. Not the first time, after 3 or 4 times they could of escaped, oh let's go upstairs.

334,buenoschiches,How is this movie getting such good reviews? Have our standards really plummeted this much?,3,17 August 2017,"Originally, I had gone into this with very low expectations as the last Annabelle movie was a complete flop for me. Ultimately, my tune changed a bit when I saw that this one was actually getting decent reviews, which is rare for a horror movie altogether. I feel as thought there has been a MAJOR drought in quality, domestic horror movies over the past 15-20 years, but I am always keen to check out movies that are loosely based on real-life stories. Enter here- the origin story of Annabelle, although I think that this was likely not at all coherent to the real Annabelle's origin story... but who knows.With Gary Dauberman on board, I don't know why I expected this film to be superior than Annabelle, but the trailer looked decent enough for me to check this one out (with a Groupon- THANK GOODNESS).Firstly, how in the world is Bea a derivative of Annabelle? GAH. Okay, next.I don't want to get into an entire synopsis, because so many others will be able to do that for me. I'm happy to just be a total Grinch about it all, as I really just wanted the movie to end almost 30 minutes into it.As you know, these movies are tied into the other Annabelle and The Conjuring movies as Lorraine Warren, one of the protagonists in The Conjuring (Vera Farmiga's role) is the current owner of the real Annabelle doll and investigated that case (as well as Amityville, etc.) But the way that these are tied in together was done with almost zero consideration and thought and makes it all seem so incredibly cheesy- not at all an eye-opening moment of WOW... more so, a "".... really?"" type of connection. Alas, what grinds my gears in no particular order: 1. Timing. I assume this was supposed to be in the 60s? In a house with electricity and modern flashlights, why were lanterns with matches used as sources of light? 2. The mother's face got attacked (and the doll mask was SUCH a wasted touch) -- why couldn't she walk? 3. If a possessed doll can break out of a covered well, why couldn't she break out of a locked closet? Obviously she could because she kept unlocking it from the inside, right? Why did she just chill in there for so long and only go after her mother- was her dad's soul not cool enough? 4. If Annabelle had been quiet for so long, why did they even bother opening their house to orphans (even though it was sought as penance)? Mrs. Mullins can't even take care of herself and her husband took literally zero interest in any of them.5. What was the point of having 4 additional orphan girls? They literally served zero purpose.6. If Annabelle was in the doll and then Janice-- who the heck was in the scarecrow? 7. When Sister Charlotte (who was a horrible actress BTW) stabbed the doll, why did that even matter since Annabelle had possessed Janice? Shouldn't she have stabbed Janice instead for it to have any effect? 8. Had Sister Charlotte never noticed that nun in the photo before? What was even the point of bringing that up for it to not be visited again at any point- really just another lead-in to The Nun movie or The Conjuring 2? WEAK.9. Is it assumed that Samuel stopped making dolls altogether after his daughter died? What did he even do then for a living? He had already boxed Annabelle up-- what was the point of unboxing her and keeping her? Sounded like he was an up and coming toy maker and had a big order to fill, but instead his daughter dies so he holds onto the one doll that he made (which has no correlation to his daughter in any way) and that's the vessel she chooses to inhabit. Right.10. WHY DID THIS MOVIE SUCK SO BAD AND WHY ARE THE RATINGS SO GOOD? The acting was atrocious (other than Talitha Bateman), the story was garbage and the tie-ins were forced and pathetic. It's disheartening that people are calling this a good movie. Have better standards, people! It is ""jump"" scary-- I'll give it that. But that's literally it. Nothing more.

338,akkusosman2,It Gets Scarier and Scarier Until The Very End,7,5 September 2017,"I didn't watch the previous films but this movie was enough to convince me that they must be pretty scary. I went into this movie alone with no expectations and i had a good time. The film opens with the creation of a toy doll. It is then found out that the maker of these dolls has a daughter. As soon as we find this out, the daughter gets killed in a car crash. 12 years pass and we see when the family home being used as a orphanage for Sister Charlotte and the children for which cares. Step by step, everything goes downhill from here. Each scene depicts something going wrong in the house. first a creaking door, footsteps, feeling the presence of some unseen being. Its always dark and we the audience just stare at it until something scary happens. My favorite scene is when one of the orphans finally sees the dead daughter innocently staring out the window.The dead daughter asks the girl if she can help her with something. The alive girl says ""what do you need?"" To which the innocent dead girl responds by turning her head 180 degrees while her face miraculously transforms into a demon screaming ""YOUR SOUL"" The movie always got me with these scenes because it was always quiet until something explainable happened. A couple of the kids just having a conversation under the sheets and all of a sudden a bell start ringing. The ringing gets closer and we can see from within the blankets the shape of a woman bending down ringing a bell. Then she disappears.when you're relieved and think its over, an old,dead looking purplish hand covers one of the girls mouths and pulls her out of the blankets. It was pretty intenseAll in all if you go into this movie without expectations, you will have a good time and enjoy the scary pop up scenes. It is dark, creepy, and builds up the tension by showing a scary scene and then letting you breath then intensifying the scary scene by the minute.I recommend watching this movie just or the jump scares.

Soooooo baaaad.....,2,16 October 2017,"WHATALOADOFCRAP!!!I was genuinely surprised when I saw the good rating and like other users pointed out - I actually thought I was watching a different movie. I do not know how people can blow a movie with a budget like this....Plot holes, plot holes, plot holes!! (I was surprised IMDb only listed 3 'goofs'). I see a lot of them mentioned here, but nothing in this movie makes sense... and so inconsistent. I do really not even know where to start since there is just soooo many flaws. The demon (who is a spirit - no feelings) is hurt when the girl stomps on its fingers. The demon/spirit have to ask permission for possessing the doll, but then just possesses the girl without trouble... and the scarecrow, and becomes a monster with claws and a girl who looks more like something from the grudge whose legs seems to be broken and can transform in to a nun who she pushes the wheelchair..... no real need to possess something, but also able to transform. Nobody hears her scream... Almost at the end of the movie the orphan girls seem confused when they are told that the Mullins's had a daughter. They are surprised and ask 'Did they have a daughter', but there are pictures of her all over the house... why is this a secret. Her room is still there - untouched. Why are some victims cut in half and pinned to the wall? Why does the girl not burn her fingers when trying to keep the bulb screwed in. The 2 little girls have a very deep and sentimental conversation and dreams of being adopted and how much they care for one another and wish the other the best - that I don't think most adults are capable of having, - but the older girls make fun and fool around under the sheet - not able to have a real conversationAnd what the hell is up with the end? I do not understand why she kills her parents... is it the 12 year demon - maybe they should have named the movie that rather than that of the doll.Weirdest movie I've seen in a while and so very pointless....I can continue, but I think then I'd be here all night...Do yourself a favour and don't watch this sh*t - EVER!P.S.

341,mmjnr10-71-780778,On par with the first Conjuring movie magnificent!,9,23 September 2017,Right let's get straight to business. I happen to be a horror movie expert and until the Conjuring came out I actually thought this genre was frankly dead but the Conjuring managed to make quite an impression on me until the 2nd one came out and the spoiled the whole thing. Coming back to this one I actually never saw the first part simply because I'm not a fan of something quite unbelievable like a doll being possessed by a demon I find this story line quite lame to be honest and even this one when I heard they where making it I thought nothing special out of it until a friend that I trust saw it last week and advised me to watch it so I decided to watch just to see what thrilled him so much and boy was I thrilled!! The movie is a genuine frightening experience with all the right ingredients put together to make it a scary masterpiece out there with the very best in this genre and the doll thing didn't become an obstacle anymore as they gave it a good reason to be there. I am writing this review for those die hard horror movie fans who want an honest opinion from a trusted viewer's opinion this movie is solid and will scare the hell out of you just don't be too tight about it and enjoy it for what it is because sadly some people watch movies to challenge them after and come out and say crap stuff about them it makes them feel good that way but I'm not one of those people despite being very analytical and quite hard to please but this movie really is good and did the job on the subject the best it could and would love to see a follow up to it of the same standard but not like that Conjuring part 2 which was frankly a joke,Annabelle - Creation
342,stuckiseanpimacollege,Most generic movie i've watched since Titanic,2,22 July 2018,When my mother told me about a new horror film she wanted to see I thought it was this one. So I bought the film for 3.99$ at the redbox & I believe other than that time I accidentally watched a child drown this was the biggest mistake of my life. A boring plot with some doll that wasn't scary. An orphanage where they some-how could afford a mechanical chair to drive up and down the stairway and a doll house with real working lights. Give me 10 breaks. All of the characters are painfully boring. I thought before that girl got hit by the car at the beginning that the haunted doll was driving but it wasn't.......The dude that looks like disco inferno just angrily stares at all the girls the whole film and when the action sequences come into play it's already too late. My father was on his chair falling asleep and I had to keep getting up from the kitchen table to walk around because it was really that boring. I thought Children of the corn: Runaways was bad but let me tell you. When I watch movies like this it just reinforces my ideals that President Donald trump needs to continue to make America great again because believe me. This movie exists and that means America ain't great.,Annabelle - Creation

345,adfaster,"For your own sake, I suggest you believe the poor ratings",1,23 September 2017,"The first Annabelle was a horrible waste of time. I gave the second one a chance, due to the hype. Stupid me!You're led to believe that this entry in the Annabelle series (I see it's becoming a spin-off franchise of the very good, in my opinion, CONJURING one) is 'better' than the previous or that it does justice to CONJURING (1 and 2). Well, you'll be the judge of that.I can only say that it REALLY does justice to the below-par ANNABELLE 1, in the sense that it's just as poor, if not worse.ANNABELLE 2 (this one) will give you plot holes aplenty, very poor character development and lots of jump scares where the increased sound volume will just distract your attention from your popcorn, if ever. And the repetition of this 'brilliant' directorial technique will just wear away very soon into this jump scare carousel.Watch this film if you want to get more bored than you are already - and just appreciate the value of popcorn as a franchise in itself.The film itself would be worth a 4 out of 10 in the genre. I'm giving it 1 star to counterbalance the hideously high rating it has here on IMDb, which distracted me from my popcorn!",Annabelle - Creation
346,geag-44662,A good prequel.,7,4 October 2018,Considering its genre I must say it was a good movie. It is of course a typical horror movie with ghosts and spirits and jumpscares but the story behind that is interesting. I think that compared to the nun it's way better and the story actually makes sense.,Annabelle - Creation
347,leeledwith,It just got better,8,21 August 2017,Always wary of sequels and prequels to a prequel felt like an accident waiting to happen. Not this one! The film was cleverly constructed and flowed logically into what had gone before(after?) It avoided many of the clichéd sudden shock sights and sounds and relied upon developing an sense of discomfort in the audience and this it did well. Not many films have an atmosphere in these days of massive CGI but this one does and makes it a worthwhile watch.,Annabelle - Creation

I am craving for a movie that can get me scream but Annabelle: Creation is done well to make my heart beat faster.

352,boycalledmullins,The Prequel Movie that the Creepy Doll Deserved,8,12 June 2021,"It's no secret that the original Annabelle movie fell woefully short of the lofty hype that the Conjuring set for it. Fortunately, however, this prequel-to-a-prequel arrived to defy the odds and right that wrong! Not only is it one of the scariest instalments in the franchise, but it actually manages to do a very satisfying job of connecting this origin to the first Annabelle movie (despite the relative lack of interesting plot there).The young cast perform incredibly well and form a very endearing band of characters throughout, complimented by the performances of Anthony LaPaglia as the tragic maker of the original Annabelle doll and his wife (Miranda Otto). Having the demon prey on a bunch of young orphans with nowhere else to go is immediately unsettling, and the film proceeds to take a far more brutal approach to the demonic torments than we've seen in the franchise thus far. This combination makes for some truly frightful viewing.If you were turned off by the original film, it is definitely worth giving the series a second chance with this outing, it will not disappoint.",Annabelle - Creation
353,ANAMARiiEE,Scariest movie I've ever seen.,10,11 September 2017,"This movie does not give you a break when it comes to getting your heart beating fast out of your chest. Once the first scary part is shown, you will be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie and I promise you something is always coming next. There's something to look forward to in every scene. This movie is scary whether it is daylight or night time in the scene. No amount of light or crosses will help you feel comfort. The demon loves tormenting not only the characters, but you in the audience as well. I've seen the conjuring and I thought it was pretty scary but it didn't compare to this movie for me... This movie had me jumping several times, it gave me chills down my spine more than any movie ever has, and I even had nightmares afterwards. I definitely recommend this movie if you're looking to watch something that will actually scare the hell out of you. A grown man sitting in the row behind me verbally said he couldn't take watching it anymore and got up to leave with 30 minutes left of the movie... I never saw him come back either. After you watch it the first time, you'll find yourself questioning every tiny sound you hear at home, every dark corner, every opened door to a hallway or closet, and you'll probably catch yourself looking for a demon behind you when you look in the mirror.",Annabelle - Creation

At one point I moved two rows down to get away form it & the little brats moved as well. During the movie a guy that was there before me kindly asked them to quiet down which made them even louder so he ended up walking out. I really felt like shouting STF up but that probably wouldn't of ended well. Don't get me wrong I'm all for a good scream or funny comment when appropriate. But this was just to much.

Close up details that show how great work is done. Carefull dialogues, simplistic but cosy background setting of the house , nature environment , very smart use of camera rotation to close up the face of the girls who apparently for their age they have a sweet and mature face expressions.Miranda and Anthony their doing great for their small part on the movie. Lulu and Talitha , their could be no better choice for this movie. even when the camera turns left to close up little Lulu's face you can see the magnificent work is done there. colors and shape of the face perfect haircut and that cute face! :-) Sister Charlotte is another success of that movie. she tries hard to maintain that naive and humble nun look despite the fact that she is so hot . one of my favorite scene is the one of Carol and Nancy play under the white sheet in the middle of the room .

367,jchckn13,"Better than average horror, but terrible characters",7,9 September 2017,"Annabelle: Creation wasn't close to being as great or terrifying as The Conjuring 1 or 2; proof that Ed and Lorraine Warren are fantastic characters.The film had a playful and fun haunted house horror movie feel to it rather than a serious vibe where tension builds to the point where you actually feel scared. This vibe will work better on people that don't scare easily; others will likely be frightened often.However, there were a few moments, including 2 or 3 sequences, that were unforgettably creepy in a unique way; so it did have some good thrills. The acting was solid, but the dialogue was very unconvincing. Also, a pretty generic plot for a horror film. The Conjuring 1 and 2 worked well with their generic horror tropes, but very effectively developed tension and story with good dialogue.Annabelle: Creation was definitely better than Annabelle, and offered a nice connection, but neither have been able to live to the greatness of the aforementioned main movies. We'll see what happens with The Nun (which I think I saw a brief allusion to in one scene) and The Crooked Man.P.S. James Wan better direct The Conjuring 3 or I'll be unhappy.",Annabelle - Creation

369,ttpro,Great at jump scare and sound effect,6,4 September 2017,"It first, Annabelle: Creation (2017) was good at creating creepy atmosphere by combination of plot, scene writing and visual (well, jump scare). THe sound effect was so good that we can feel what is going on when closing your eye (in cinema only). The scene writer know how to build up the tension, then jump scare, then let the user relax. However, there are a some case, the horror come when we are unexpected. We think it is safe, then we relax. Let me give you an example. When Jannie was let in the sunlight by sister (nun), we think she is safe. Because sunlight give us relief. Other kids play not far away and laughter also bring relief, too. However, something is not right. Sister (nun) leave Jannie along. Furthermore, others kid is too far. Something is not right. Then, it is coming. Let the fun begin.The plot is not very special at all. However, there are some good point. The beginning, the family, the church, the little girl make me remember ""Little House on the Prairie"".

370,fablecastella,Anna what?,3,13 September 2017,"I never have high expectations for a horror movie, and thank goodness i did. This movie makes me question more instead of awe. So many elements in the story that i felt unfinished or just rushed. It felt more like ""oh lets just say they did this and that and then we can get on straight to the ghost"". Bruhh... as scary as any ghost, without a proper storyline and build-up to the 'scary scene'... what's the point?From the very beginning they showed the grumpy Annabelle dad accepting the orphan girls in to his house, what for?! And when the movie just literally focus on the 2 main girls, what is the meaning of having 4 more extra girls? The poor souls have so minimum screen time.The funniest to me was when le grumpy dad was told that the girls went to Annabelle room and saw the dool. He mad and salty about it, he then go inside to check on it, but got caught up in seeing Annabelle at the dining table, died. Poor dad.Then the scene where le Annabelle mom told the story of how they called their daughter soul and at 1st was happy about it, after a while it got creepy until it attacked her and4 left a scar on her face. Yikes! Oh and she died a while later after telling the story. Poor mom.And then yadayadayada it turns out Annabelle is actually not Annabelle, but one of the orphan girl possessed by the evil spirit. Yadayadayada and it brings us to the 1st conjuring movie.The end.All in all... i feel like the whole origin of Annabelle is actually because an orphan kid went into a room she's not supposed to. Got her self possessed. The ghost is mad salty af, killing everyone (just like me mad salty cause i really did not enjoy it. At all.)But if you like to watch horror movies with awesome scary music and okay with shitty storyline etc. Then this is a fine horror movie to watch. Once in your life.",Annabelle - Creation

374,Rainbowpug,Scary for my generation,8,21 June 2018,"Okay, I'm a horror junky, I admit it. Being as that is, I don't scare easily. Slasher movies most often suck unless they're based in some form of reality, and ghost stories have to have a strong, psychological aspect to get me good. Dolls...something about them is just the peak of terrifying. My generation grew up with movies such as ""Magic"" and ""Trilogy of Terror's Amelia"", which were subtle, yet psychologically dismembering. Imagine my disappointment when Annabelle came out in 2014 and didn't give a single shudder! I left the theater more disappointed than I'd been in a long time. There was nothing scary about it, at all. When Annabelle Creation came to theaters, I avoided it like the plague. When it finally came on one of the pay channels, I decided I'd suffer through it just so I could say I did. Okay, wow. Annabelle Creation was scary. More than just the scary doll that almost completely lost its scariness because of the first movie, was that skinny, black creature you barely see, but is always there in the dark with glowing eyes. The isolation and darkness of the movie being set in the 1950's/60's, is probably what got me the most, though the sounds of incorporeal footsteps trailing behind them and getting louder each time they turned to look, sure did it's job in building up the terror. Most, not all, of the acting was impressive, too, though I didn't think the main character showed enough of a reaction to many of the things she was experiencing, I can only attribute that to possibly the naivete (or stupidity) of the character, or poor directing. I only know for sure how I would've reacted if something like that happened to me and there's little doubt I wouldn't have stroked out during the first encounter, even as a child. If I happened to survive that first encounter, there would've been NOTHING preventing me from running down that desolate dirt road like a banshee with its hair on fire. But if all the characters reacted like I would've, then there wouldn't be much of a story, right? All in all, this movie produces enough terrifying events to make you think before turning out the lights at night, and definitely before you do something stupid like getting into antique doll collecting.",Annabelle - Creation

385,bentaycanada,4th time round is not the charm!,4,8 September 2017,"I am a fan of The Conjuring series. I liked the original, its sequel even more and I fairly enjoyed the prequel 'Annabelle'. However like its predecessor, Annabelle Creation isn't the prequel the fans were expecting. By this I mean that in the original Conjuring film, where the Annabelle doll made its first appearance, it was told in the form of a short flashback. When the studio announced the Annabelle spin off, it was largely believed we would be getting a feature length based around that story (i.e. the nurse's story and how the doll came into the Warren's possession). Alas this was not the case and we were presented a new story that predated the one told in The Conjuring.One can only speculate as to how this came to be, but if I were a betting man, I'd say it had a lot to do with potential revenue from making it into a franchise, rather than a straight prequel. By having a fresh prequel that predates the one expected, it guarantees that no matter what comes before it, when they actually make the prequel based on The Conjuring story, fans will flock to see what they were craving all along.This is starting to feel more like a Star Wars prequel review, than the Annabelle series. Being sold two prequels we didn't need, while eagerly awaiting the one expected.On to the movie itself, it started fairly competently with good pacing. However immediately it becomes clear that regardless of the first Annabelle story, we're now being sold another backstory to the very same doll. Regardless if the last installment told us that the name Annabelle came from another character a generation later. So a new girl has involvement with the doll, as it's made by her father, followed by tragedy. Nothing new here, except it's at odds with its predecessor.Fast forward 12 years, and the story follows a bus of half a dozen orphan girls being moved to an isolated farm house, for no discernible reason. The farm house is the same house with the family that made the doll. They have taken them in, along with their resident nun. No, not the nun from The Conjuring 2. From this point on it's the usual medley of ghostly voices, bangs, shadows moving, the Annabelle doll appearing in random places (etc..) that we've seen play out twice already. I also should mention that the audience is treated to a volley of jump scares, surpassing a dozen by the 45 minute mark. Far more than have ever dared before.The film is not short, coming in at nearly 2 hours in length. This along with the story line is where the film falls apart. From the outset the story featuring nine characters; six orphan girls, one nun, plus the man and his wife (not including the doll) is a bit much. The gaggle of orphan girls comes across as a bit unnecessary. If this were a slasher flick then you could see them being offed one by one. However this is not the case with Annabelle Creation. At times it's a little too much to keep up with them, and they have little to no development, outside of the main two girls.With all the different elements that feel out of place in what should be a fairly simple story, it's no wonder that the Annabelle doll itself is barely part of the story. Simplicity is what the film lacks, and the story should be just that. It looks to have done well at the box office, which is good for the creators and studio, but for this viewer it felt empty.",Annabelle - Creation

Don't waste your dosh people, just go and buy yourself a bucket of white emulsion, a new paint brush, find the biggest wall you have ever seen, paint it, get yourself a comfy chair, place it in front of the wall(facing towards of course), sit on it and stare at the wall until the paint has dried and I can guarantee you will enjoy it more than Annabelle 2.",Annabelle - Creation
387,kennedyaaron,Absolutely terrible.,2,27 August 2017,"I never write IMDb reviews, but after seeing Dunkirk in the same week, and yes, it is a masterpiece, I decided I had to write a review of this film. This film is lazy. It's predictable. It's shallow. It's just stupid. I went into it with low expectations, and during the opening scenes of the film I was having fun, laughing at the films stupidity. If it had carried on down that road it would have been fun, but as someone who studied horror movies for roughly 9 months, I can confirm that this film uses EVERY SINGLE TROPE AND CLICHÉ OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL YOU DESPAIR. This is the least scary horror movie I've ever seen that has no imagination or creativity and is just a cynical crash grab on the part of James Wan. Honestly this film is pathetic, and the saddest part of all is its rating demonstrates a massive slide in standards for audience satisfaction. Anyone who gave this movie money should be ashamed, as ashamed as I am, as now were doing nothing but funding the inevitable sequel. 2/10, abysmal, do not go and see unless you want to see the pinnacle of laziness.",Annabelle - Creation

391,abhichemudu,Decent prequel to Annabelle!,7,15 August 2017,"First part of the movie was a bit slow paced, but the second part more than compensates for it. There were a lot of quality jump scares, it kinda reminded of the 1st part of The Conjuring. The plot was okay, but it doesn't justify the title, I mean, the movie's supposed to be about the creation of Annabelle, but that part wasn't portrayed in detail, however, the continuity link to the 1st Annabelle movie was revealed.

395,alyssasalcido,"It's Not Perfect, But It's Scary",7,1 April 2020,This movie is not perfect by any means. I have a problem with a few plot points:1. The crippled girl who kept going into the Annabelle room despite everything that happened to her before2. The girls not communicating with the priest about what they saw and not believing each other from the beginning3. Holy objects known to deter demons did not work when they should havesAnd there are of course more imperfections but even so this movie still managed to scare the living daylights out of me.,Annabelle - Creation
396,juehokim,Bad as Transformers!!!!,1,9 December 2017,"Annabelle creation is a terrible movie. It's as bad as Transformers. I'd give it a 1 out of 10. Here are the reasons why.First is the plot. The plot in this movie makes no sense. Even though this is a horror movie and house is haunted,ther needs to be at least some logic of how the doll is possessed. The only logic I see is religion. It's that there's a devil inside the doll which now possesses some kind of superpower and can be stopped by religion. But that doesn't explain how the doll cracked the man's fingers even though he held tje cross.Second are the characters. The characters in this movie are all stupid. Throughout the entire movie I keep wondering why go inside a room when specifically told not to? Why create an orphanage even though he knows it's dangerous? And why stay there for 12years? Why shoot a toy gun at a doll whi can snap you in half? I know why, because they're idiots. I mean there were even adults but they seem to be even more dumb than the kids.Third is the horror. I was expecting a very scary movie filled with a lot of jumpscares. But honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Every time I thought something scary would happen all I see are flash images with pathetic screams. The horror was less satisfying.Last is the music. Whoever who did the music did a bad job. Usually, horror movies are unexpected like it comes to you like a bang. However, in this movie, it's very obvious thanks to the music. At first, the music is quiet but then ita gets louder. Obviously you think something is going to happen and it does. It's so obvious the doll is going to scare the heck out of them.Overall, the directer was too focused on the horror in my opinion. He probably didn't care about the other important aspects like the characters or the plot which explains why the movie was bad.",Annabelle - Creation

Theres a point where (i genuinely cannot remember any of their names) the blonde one is screaming downstairs and literally no one comes to see whats happening. I came to the conclusion that everyone just f**king hates her.
Also the part where we see the demon first (""yOuR sOuL"") made me laugh harder than anything has in a while.

399,profkosmosic,Waste of time,1,24 June 2020,The characters make some of the most nonsensical decisions I have ever seen being made in a horror movie. It relies heavily on really bad and predictable jumpscares that are stupidly loud compared to the rest of the movie's sound design.

I felt that the target audience must be people who are just getting into scary movies, and need something very lite. The concept is decently scary, but the execution of the concept was bad. There were many ""jump scares."" And the CGI demon looked pretty silly to me. I felt like I've seen this movie a thousand times, wasn't anything special.",Annabelle - Creation
404,jsl1475,Bone Chilling,9,15 August 2017,"A good horror movie makes your heart leap out of your chest while simultaneously tugging at your heartstrings. And we're happy to report that Annabelle: Creation, the fourth installment in The Conjuring franchise, is emotionally potent and downright scary.In pre-Barbie America, doll maker Samuel Mullins (LaPaglia) lives on a ranch with wife Esther (Otto) and daughter Bee (Lee). The Mullins's happiness is short-lived; they're desolated by Bee's sudden death. Twelve years pass, and Samuel decides to turn his empty home into an orphanage for six girls. Even before the girls can settle in and play house, the house starts throwing new horrors at them every night. Best friends Janice (Bateman) and Linda (Wilson) become the first victims of Samuel's strange-looking locked-away doll, Annabelle.The Conjuring movie universe grows inward and outward with prequels and sequels, each one delivering a terrifying new nightmare. The makers stick to old-school tactics of haunted houses, little-girl ghosts and jump-scares, but deliver coherent and effective movies.Director David F. Sandberg, a master of anticipatory horror (you must see Lights Out), builds a tense atmosphere even while working with a banal plot. The formula is so plain that you'd think you know the movie, but Sandberg infuses jumps and starts so creatively that it becomes a dangerous game of peek-a-boo. With a huge house and six girls in the forefront, there's an unmissable The Conjuring vibe; a great reference to the previous (and undoubtedly inferior) Annabelle movie connects the universes perfectly. There are several sub-plots worthy of a spin-off.The story of Janice could be especially interesting. Talitha Bateman is a scene- stealer; her cold stares and measured madness make you wary of Janice. As helpless parents, Otto and LaPaglia bring a tenderness to this terror-fest.Having watched the previous films will help, but the movie is a legitimate standalone chiller. If there were a Horror For Dummies guidebook, Annabelle: Creation would make for a good chapter in it.",Annabelle - Creation
405,DziemiW,More Comedic than Scary?,6,3 August 2017,"Had the luck of catching an early screening of this, and having enjoyed the first Annabelle we were looking forward to the prequel. The atmosphere and tone were set very well throughout the film, definitely more 'creepy' than 'scary'. There are of course, several moments that will make you jump and keep you in suspense, but unfortunately also several occasions where the audience (myself included) laughed during what I imagine was intended as a 'scary' scene, because the acting and setup was completely off to the point it was just comical. No regrets to having seen it, especially if you enjoyed the first, but you aren't going to have nightmares from it.",Annabelle - Creation

I do not understand the sudden loud noises to try and scare you when there is nothing there to scare you.

408,jowyblight,"One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, don't waste your time",2,23 September 2017,"I have no idea how this movie has a decent score here, but it clearly doesn't deserve it. As a horror fan I've seen most of the English language ones, both the good and the mediocre (I don't watch the ""bad"" ones with a score below 6), but this movie is far below even the ones that are usually considered mediocre.Why? It's far too long with nothing really happening throughout a good ~70 minutes of it except for jump scare after jump scare. Apparently the director thinks that People Looking Scared + Horror Music on Full Blast at the same time = horror. Sorry but that just doesn't work for me. If you muted the movie during the jump scares you'd easily see how comically bad the scenes are, because they have no substance at all and just rely on the high volume of the screeching sound effects to trigger a fear response from the viewer. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean.This movie is seemingly supposed to be scary because of the atmosphere, but you can't have both broodingly creepy + bad jump scares over and over, it doesn't fit at all. And if you really want to go for jump scares, limit them to a few that are actually meaningful, instead of how many there are in this movie that have absolutely no impact. After the first two, I saw how bad they were and I was like, ""what?"" I'm not kidding: you could literally make a drinking game out of it and take a shot every time a jump scare pops up in this movie. You'd be smashed at the end of it.And when the creature is finally revealed, it's laughably cheesy and not scary in any way.If this movie was like 20 or even 30 mins shorter, I might've given a 5 (below average and I probably wouldn't have watched it), but with how long and boring and outright low quality it is, I gave it a 2 (unwatchable and an utter waste of time). Many, many movies with a score of 6.0-6.3 on this site are MUCH better than this, so I can't help but think there is some vote manipulation going on.Do yourself a favor and skip over this one. Even as mindless entertainment it's not suitable, it's an exercise in boredom. You'd be much better off watching any other horror movie that actually has some substance, even if bad.",Annabelle - Creation

431,mellergaardm,Movie of the decade,8,12 October 2017,"David F. Sandberg's second creation of the coveted Annebelle story. The Christian family, Mullins, comes out of an accident and their daughter is killed in an accident. In the grief of their daughter, Anthony and Miranda seek her in the spiritual world. With luck from their side, they come into contact with a demon of pure evil. They allow the creature to occupy the doll Annabelle, in the belief in their daughter coming back.A Christian children's home for girls gets a new home at the Mullins family, 12 years after the accidents. With new life in the house, it's messy in the past, and Annabelle comes to light from many years in hiding. Evil comes to life and nourishes the children's fear.The movie delivers the classic thrill of what it means, the creaking doors, scary dolls, scary music and most importantly, a dark house with a past. Annabelle 2: Creation binds the entire The Conjuring universe together perfectly. It is in line with the two Conjuring films. The film lives up to its expectations after the first Annabelle was struggling with ""real unhappiness"" And yes, and because that's a prequel to the Annabelle movie, it's also quite important that this movie works as a feature of the well-known story. It does! In fact, the story runs in Annabelle 2: the creation, all the way to the beginning of the previous film. Therefore, it would be smart to see Annabelle before seeing Annabelle 2: the creation. This is not a necessity, but in its opinion, it works better.If you're the person who likes a good horror with supernatural creatures, it's a movie to watch. Time is spent on showing the physical and emotional framework of history, which helps to make the film better. There has been a lot of time spent focusing on the children, as it has been known in the previous years to be a great success. There are two pages through stories. The cute polite girls against evil are wondering in the dark. This makes the contrast extra violent when exposed to pure evil.The actors in the movie make it all lively and give new energy to the Annabelle movie, which takes place before the original Annabelle takes place. The film has many good scenes. What makes the movie good, within the horror genre, is the narrative and the in-depth details of the actual evil that lurks in the doll. I immediately expected Miranda Otto to have a bigger role in the film, which is being told and talked about her. But it's only at the end she appears. Anthony LaPaglia is a talented actress who also lives up to the film. His character uses more physical features, which made him feel good. He delivers both unhappiness and mystery over the house and the past.""A good story is the basis for a good horror"" - Marcus Mellergaard",Annabelle - Creation
432,louispomp,Tracy Beaker The Horror Movie,6,14 October 2017,"Storyline was very predictable coming from a veteran horror movie watcher. Nonetheless, very scary in parts, despite the predictability. A good one to watch with friends and family. Pointless at times I must admit and annoyingly obvious solutions kept cropping up but were ignored.",Annabelle - Creation
433,mharrington-50458,Very suspenseful and entertaining,8,26 October 2017,"I see a lot of reviews complaining about how awful they think the movie is. I will say up front what constitutes a good movie for me: it needs to be entertaining, and it need to be fulfilling for its genre. This was one of the more suspenseful horror movies I've ever seen. Sure there were the occasional jump scares, but I was more thrilled by the many scenes that had my heart racing wondering what was going to happen next. I felt the film does a fantastic job of keeping you on the edge of your seat because of that. Other than the supernatural aspects, everything seemed quite believable. I'm not going to argue semantics or nitpick about a how you don't think a character is making the right decision. This is a horror movie after all, but they've come a long way from the days of Mike Meyers.I will say that the connection to the other films was harder for me to realize (other than recognizing a certain someone at the end) unless you're very familiar with The Conjuring films. Might be best to watch them all before seeing this!",Annabelle - Creation
434,ameerchehab,"horrible movie, don't waste your time!",1,10 November 2017,I wish I can rate less than 1!this movie doesn't make any sense......It doesn't even have spooks..silly effects and silly scenario. How could this movie gate a decent rating on IMDb! I cant even anything positive about this movie. The only thing I got afraid of is losing more time watching movies like this....,Annabelle - Creation
435,josemoonriver,An excellent version of Annabelle,10,11 November 2017,"Annabelle was a movie that wasn't so bad, but it wasn't so good, the sequel which is a prequel is pretty good, one of my favorites movies! The movie is well directed and have a pretty good story plus some good visual effects, i recommend it a lot. Annabelle Creation is a good addition to The Conjuring universe.",Annabelle - Creation

437,howadari,Better than I anticipated,8,10 January 2018,"I wasn't a fan of the original Annabelle film, so I was hesitant going into this one. Much to my surprise, it exceeded the original. In general, it's a well made horror film. What makes it work, though it could be just a personal preference, is the exploration into multiple characters and their experiences with the demonic entity. You don't fully know who the main character is and that actually serves as a relief because the suspense is heightened that much more. Furthermore, that's what I've always felt has lacked from horror films in order to catapult them to something greater. The lack of characteritzation and exploration into minor characters. We need to care if they get hurt, and this film provides that emotive element. The directing/acting team did a superb job tapping into childhood fears and worries and usually, I'm not one to watch films starring children, but this kept me successfully engrossed. Additionally, settings like the farmhouse and well, really lent themselves to creating a more unsettling atmosphere. The young actresses portraying each character did so believably and without over-exaggeration.There were a few things in the plot that didn't quite deliver or were elaborated on, but overall, it's a solid horror film with horror and human elements mixed wonderfully throughout. The ending - leading up to the original Annabelle film - is shocking and extremely somber. 8/10 overall.",Annabelle - Creation
438,burstntoran,Storyline fails to accommodate the suspense,6,11 February 2018,"The director mixed several kinds of scary scenes in his mind to scare the audience, which entertained the appetite of horror fans, however distracted himself from telling the story that goes along with the horror. As an audience, I can clearly feel the gap. 
I still covered my ears pretty tight lol",Annabelle - Creation
439,kazeminasio,poor story...poor directing....and poor ACTING BY talitha bateman and stephenie sigmam,1,21 July 2018,"Well.. the two little actresses, i mean talitha bateman and lulu wilson,posted every creepy scene before the movie released to the cinemas...the first one was the best... the second one was the worst...",Annabelle - Creation
440,ashleyeberly,Nothing like the last Annabelle..,6,14 March 2018,"This movie wasn't nearly as scary as the original Annabelle movie. Not that that one was terrifying, but it had more jump factors. I like the history of this one, giving the doll and the girl a back story was an interesting take on it but it didn't have me personally enveloped in it.",Annabelle - Creation
441,nirman-07284,I'm satisfied. but..,8,16 April 2018,Not the best horror movie. Story-line is kind of weak and some scenes do not make any sense. Not a scary movie. But I like the movie may be because I did not watch any horror movies lately. And I like the acting of girls. That is a plus point.,Annabelle - Creation
442,fonsecabernardo,Annabelle: Creation By: Bernardo,10,22 May 2018,"Annabelle was directed by David F. Sandberg, it was recorded in 2017. 
It´s a really good horror film because when you are watching it you never will expect what is gonna happen. Besides that the characters are interpreted by really good actors staring Anthony LaPaglia(Samuel Mullins), Samara Lee(Bee), Miranda Otto(Esther Mullins) and Lulu Wilson( Linda). The movie is set in a farm, and its about a family who loses their daughter, and after 12 years of her death they offer their house to an orphanage and some shuttered girls and a nun went to their farm. But what they didn´t expect is that there is a demon haunting the house who possessed a doll Annabelle.
 If you like to see a good horror movie and get a lot of scares you must watch this film, But if you are fearful, i really don´t recommend you to watch Annabelle:Creation.",Annabelle - Creation
