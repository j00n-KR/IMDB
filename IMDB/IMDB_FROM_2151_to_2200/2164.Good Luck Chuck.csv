0,SnoopyStyle,Dane Cook not that bad in this but the movie is still not funny,5,29 March 2014,"Charlie Logan (Dane Cook) has been hexed by a disgruntled girl since a childhood game of spin the bottle gone wrong. He is now a womanizing dentist. His best friend Stu (Dan Fogler) since childhood is now the plastic surgeon next door. Charlie gets a reputation as a good luck charm. Every woman he sleeps with finds their dream beau immediately after splitting up. He is enchanted by bumbling Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba). Cam is leery of Charlie's womanizing reputation, and Charlie doesn't want Cam to find her dream man.There is something about Dane Cook that annoys me to no end. It's some kind of annoying smugness in his persona. At least, Dan Fogler is outdoing him on that front in this movie. Cook isn't that bad in this movie. And there is the adorable Jessica Alba. However it's still not a good comedy.",Good Luck Chuck
1,kosmasp,Smell what Dane is cooking,7,18 August 2021,"There was a particular point in time, where Dane Cook was cast as romantic lead ... in raunchy comedies mostly. And I was a bit surprised Netflix had this in the uncut/unrated form. It's not that much longer, but has a few more bits ... to show. No pun intended.Although if that offends you, do not even think about watching the movie. Sensibilities be damned, but the movie has more than a couple of scenes that might make you cringe to say the least. Be it the crazy (cursed) individual of your choice (the bad luck Alba or the only once a woman getting lucky Cook) or the best friend of our male lead ... who seems to share the title ""creep"" with his buddy.Again there is much to hate, but there can be also much to love. It all depends on how much slack you are willing to cut the movie ... because it is a movie or if you are not able to go there and just plain hate it for the cliches it serves up for a laugh (or tries to serve up for a laugh) ...",Good Luck Chuck
2,jboothmillard,Good Luck Chuck,4,22 November 2010,"This was exactly the same story as White Chicks, I expected to loathe it entirely, but surprisingly I found myself liking quite a lot of it, I kind of wish that wasn't the case, but oh well. Basically in 1985 during a game of spin the bottle little Charlie Logan (Connor Price) was forced to go into a closet with Goth girl (Sasha Pieterse), and when he refused to show her his penis she cursed him with a witchcraft spell. In the present day, this curse is still upon the now dentist doctor Charlie 'Chuck' (Employee of the Month's Dane Cook), every time he sleeps with a woman she soon after finds her true love and gets married. One day he meets the girl of his dreams, the accident-prone and extremely clumsy penguin based marine biologist Cam Wexler (Razzie nominated Jessica Alba), who is lightly refusing a date. Many women are approaching Chuck recently having heard about what has happened after women have slept with him, starting with Carol (Chelan Simmons) and following with secretary Reba (Ellia English). Chuck's sex-obsessed and jock-like friend Dr. Stuart 'Stu' Klaminsky (Balls of Fury's Dan Fogler), who has his dream career doing boob jobs, convinces him that if all these women are coming to him asking for his ""services"", i.e. sex, he should take advantage and have as much as he wants, so he does. Then he decides to give up this ""guilt-free sex"" with numerous women to concentrate on try a serious relationship with Cam, who finally agrees to a date with him. They have a very nice time, and it comes to the point where it looks like they will have sex, but a phone call from Stu confirms that every single woman Chuck has slept with has indeed got married, so sex with Cam is a no go area. While deliberately avoiding Cam for a while, Chuck wants to really test out this theory that anyone woman he has sex with will get married, so he finds the most hideous morbidly obese woman to do the deed with, and asks Stu to ask her out after. After Stu claims that he did ask the woman out, Chuck goes back to Cam and they allow themselves to have sex with each other, they seem really happy, but then Stu confesses he didn't ask the fat woman out. On the news the woman has got married, and Chuck is fearful that Cam will find her next love and get married, so he over actively showers her with gifts, and goes to see Anisha (Michelle Harrison), the girl who cursed him, to try and remove it. Cam thinking he is stalking her announces it's over, and thinking that he now has no chance with his true love, he makes an arrangement for her to meet renowned marine expert Howard (Steve Bacic) thinking he is her next man. In the end, on the plane heading for Antarctica it turns out Howard is already married, and convinced by his plea for forgiveness and saying he loves her, Cam and Chuck have their final kiss. Also starring Lonny Ross as Joe Wexler and Case 39's Jodelle Ferland as Lila. Cook is reasonable as the male lead, Alba is rather annoying with her over-the-top accidents, but you can forgive her a little for being very fit, but for me the one who stole the show was the Stifler style antics of Fogler. There were some quite funny slapstick scenes, a forgivable amount of nudity, and a nice love story format, I guess there are some small moments where I agree with the critics' one star rating, and you can tell this is one for the blokes, but for me, not a bad romantic comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screen Couple for Alba and Cook. Okay!",Good Luck Chuck
3,michaelRokeefe,"Women, women, women....what a curse.",2,4 February 2008,"This isn't that good of a comedy, let alone a good movie. Charlie Logan(Dane Cook)as a child was supposedly put under a curse by a goth schoolmate. As a successful dentist, Charlie seems to always be the guy that loses the girl to marriage. He has women lined up to jump in bed with him, because afterward they find the man of their dreams. The curse is a blessing in ways, but when he meets Cam(Jessica Alba)...he'll do anything to break the curse. Love is strange that way. Charlie's best friend Stu(Dan Folger)is a ""boob"" doctor and is hardly any help when really needed. It gets raunchy and outrageous when the two try to break that damn curse. Cam waits with wounded heart. If it wasn't for Miss Alba, I would not have watched this dud. I have yet to find Cook funny, let alone an actor of any repute. Sorry. Sure there was sex, nudity and various degrees of crude dialogue and sexual comedy...but the combination didn't work for me this time.",Good Luck Chuck
4,dbborroughs,Vulgar comedy is sunk because the cast and script can't get together,3,14 October 2007,"Cursed as a teen by a goth chick with whom he refused to have sex, Dane Cook is doomed to have every girl he sleeps with find true love with the next guy they are with. While at a wedding Cook meets Jessica Alba with whom he falls in love. Not wanting to lose her things he does what he can to keep her in his life and out of his bed-which is filled with hundreds of women all looking for Mr Right.Vile vulgar and very tasteless this film probably could have worked with better leads. There is something about the low brow humor here that should have worked in a completely filthy sort of way, but doesn't because the leads Cook, Alba, and a really piggy Dan Folger, are never really believable nor do they ever meet the level of the material. What I mean is that Jessica Alba at times seems more like Julie Andrews before SOB made her able to work blue. What is such a sweet girl doing in this film? I have no idea. Never mind that she is of limited acting ability, proving once again that other than as eye candy she has no presence. She's great until she opens her mouth and then, while its not bad, she somehow manages to disappear from the screen. Dane Cook, also a person of limited presence (but who's great in the right role), almost manages to do something here, but isn't really given anything to really do but have sex and look bewildered. Certainly not the disaster that many reviews have called it (its close), it does have some really piggy laughs that are probably best viewed late on Saturday night on cable after a beer or two.",Good Luck Chuck
5,zardoz-13,Bad Luck Chuck!,1,26 September 2007,"""Good Luck, Chuck"" qualifies as the kind of uninspired, R-rated romantic sex comedy that gives a bad name to inspired, R-rated, romantic sex comedies. ""Good Luck, Chuck"" is nowhere as hilarious as ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Knocked Up"" and ""Super Bad."" This misogynistic, lowest-common denominator nonsense establishes its idiotic premise with a prologue set in 1985. Amorous 11-year old Goth chick Anisha (Sash Pieterse of ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl 3-D"") puts a hex on our 10-year old hero. It seems that the two were playing a spin-the-bottle kissing contest. Young Charlie (Connor Price of ""Cinderella Man"") refused to put a lip-lock on Anisha after she cornered him in a closet, tore his shirt off, and then raked her nails across his chest. Incensed by his rejection, Anisha condemns Charlie by casting a spell on him that dooms him to a life of perennial bachelorhood. Single women flock to Charlie Logan because they believe that he is their surefire, good luck charm. After these dames share their love with our hapless hero, they find true love with the next guy and live a life of matrimonial bliss! Reportedly, first-time scenarist Josh Stolberg based his shallow, tasteless, pedestrian screenplay on the experiences of ""Good Luck, Chuck"" associate producer Steve Glenn.Now that he's a grown up, Charlie Logan (stand-up comic Dane Cook of ""Employee of the Month"") practices dentistry. As Charlie explains to Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba of ""Sin City"") in a later scene, he couldn't cut it in medical school, so he went into dentistry, much to the chagrin of his parents. Meanwhile, Charlie's chubby best childhood friend with an X-rated mind, goggle-eyed Stuart Klaminsky (Dan Fogler of ""Balls of Fury""), earns a fortune as a plastic surgeon that specializes in breast reconstruction. He wheels himself around in a decked out Hummer, while Charlie cruises about in a vintage Thunderbird convertible. Charlie and Stuart's offices face each other on the same floor in a high-rise medical building. Stuart's fixation on breast culture is so obsessive that he owns Pam Anderson's former breast implants. He maintains these artifacts in pristine condition in an oak trophy case in his clinic. Unlike Charlie, however, Stuart has zero luck with the ladies. Meanwhile, Charlie has girls lining up constantly for him after the word gets around that girls can find Mr. Right after an evening with him. Eventually, Charlie tires of being treated like a sex object, especially after he meets Cam and falls madly in love with Cam. She works as a penguin caretaker at Aqua World, and her friends have nicknamed her ""Murphy"" because she is such a klutz. Like Charlie, Cam has a sidekick, her slacker brother Joe (Lonny Ross of TV's ""30 Rock"") who smokes pot. All of the wisdom that Joe imparts to his sister comes from using the pages from a philosophy textbook as rolling papers for his marihuana. Charlie grows so attached to Cam that he refuses to sleep with her. Our hero fears that Anisha's hex on him is genuine and that Cam will fall in love with the next knucklehead that she dates. Charlie is so upset that he tries to prove that the curse is all in his mind. He dates a girl so grotesquely fat that nobody would have anything to do with her. Unfortunately, Charlie discovers that even this obese girl discovers true love. Ultimately, Charlie tracks down the now grown up Anisha (Michelle Harrison of ""Paycheck"") and tries to persuade her to remove the hex. Amused at his misfortune, she assures Charlie that she didn't know what she was doing when she cast her spell.""Good Luck, Chuck"" scrapes the bottom of the barrel for inspiration. This 99-minute cinematic eyesore portrays women as numbskull nymphomaniacs. They are either sexually driven opportunists who use Charlie as a stepping-stone stud to the next guy or, as in the case of leading lady Jessica Alba, are accident prone buffoons. Alba gets her best laugh when she walks smack into the pole and knocks herself flat on her back. This scene made me laugh in the trailer, and I laughed again at it in the movie. Basically, ""Good Luck, Chuck"" amounts to the contemporary equivalent of a stag party. Guys will split their sides laughing hysterically at Dane Cook's amorous antics as well as ""Balls of Fury"" star Dan Fogler's lewd, crude, scatological humor. In sum, Fogler steals every scene as the hero's smutty-mouthed sidekick. Guys, after you see ""Good Luck, Chuck,"" you'll chuckle every time that you see grapefruit.Veteran film editor-turned-director Mark Helfrich and Stolberg leave little to the imagination. After all, the audiences for this politically incorrect, chauvinistic sex comedy like their humor as low brow as possible with a nod to frontal nudity. No, image conscious Jessica Alba maintains her dignity without stooping to frontal nudity. Unfortunately, Helfrich and Stolberg do little to make the Charlie & Cam romance memorable. Later scenes where Charlie stalks Cam to keep her from dating the next guy are more witless than witty. Mind you, Charlie and Cam both are likable, goofy characters, but they are not very interesting. ""Good Luck, Chuck"" lives up to its R-rating with split-scene shots of gratuitous soft-core sex acts, persistent profanity, and the inevitable bowel & groin humor. Apparently, the only reason that the producers made Cam into a penguin caretaker was to cash in on the current penguin craze created by movies like ""Happy Feet"" and ""March of the Penguins."" Altogether, this lame lascivious comedy peters out of laughs long before its happy ending. ""Good Luck, Chuck"" deserves a nod for its last minute homage to the Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi movie ""Total Recall"" for those who like to stick around and watch the end credits.",Good Luck Chuck
6,neil-476,I haf good news und I haf bad news...,6,2 December 2010,"Dentist Charlie is cursed as a child: the curse means that every woman he has sex with finds true love with the bloke after him. This means that he is hotly pursued by women eager to have unemotional clinical sex with him as a quick fix for their long-term plans. For a while this suits Charlie just fine, but then...OK, so this is a promising set-up for a comedy - now what shall we do with it? Let's introduce a potential love interest for Charlie - let's make her Cam, a gorgeous penguin keeper, let's make her initially reluctant to enter a relationship with Charlie (even though they like each other) and, in a stroke of genius, let's make her an accident-prone klutz. And then, when they fall for each other, let's make Charlie scared to make love with her because he is scared that the curse means he will then lose her.This movie has a fair amount going for it. Dane Cook and Jessica Alba are engaging as Charlie and Cam, Jessica Alba has quite a lot of fairly funny slapstick, much of what happens is quite sweet, and Jessica Alba in skimpies is always welcome. And, in a surprisingly touching moment, when Charlie is approached by his portly (and lonely) practice nurse, his response is unexpectedly kind and gentle.Then we have the not-so-good. The multi-partner sex montage is perhaps a little too long and a tad overdone, but maybe that isn't really an issue given the subject matter of this movie. If that was all....But there is a descent into unbelievable behaviour about halfway through. There is a deeply unpleasant little sequence featuring an encounter with an obese woman of unattractive demeanour and habits (which contrasts drastically with what might otherwise be thought to be a similar encounter with the practice nurse).And, worst of all, there is Charlie's ""best friend"" Stu (Dan Fogler) who serves the purpose of Greek chorus, and is the most repellent character I have seen in a film since Jonah Hill in Superbad and Rob Corddry in Hot Tub Time Machine. When a film makes you want to kill a character who fulfils this sort of function in the story, it's getting something badly wrong.A shame, as this film so nearly got so much right.",Good Luck Chuck
7,anaconda-40658,Good Luck Trying to Laugh at This.,4,24 November 2015,"Good Luck Chuck (2007): Dir: Mark Helfrich / Cast: Dane Cook, Jessica Alba, Dan Fogler, Annie Wood, Chelan Simmons: Vulgar comedy about pursuing relationships for sheer thrill. Chuck is hexed by a goth chick at a birthday party when he was young and as a result every woman who sleeps with him finds love with the next guy. This leads to numerous offers until he meets an accident prone penguin expect whom he falls for. Fine setup nearly destroyed by predictable story telling and insincerity. Director Mark Helfrich does his best but the material despite potential, just isn't as funny as it should be. Dane Cook does a fine job as Chuck who ends up warding off Alba in hopes of keeping her while also becoming a test object for the gratification of others. Jessica Alba is miscast and the accident prone aspect seems to disappear. Eventually Cook's pursuit becomes creepy as oppose to funny leaving an ending that lacks sincerity. Dan Fogler has his moments as Cook's perverted best friend but the role is standard and typical at best. Annie Wood is also featured among supporting cast, as well as Chelan Simmons playing an ex- girlfriend of Chuck's who ought to have her head examined. The film seems poised as a bad sexual escapade that might have sounded great as a pitch idea. Otherwise viewers are wished good luck in watching it and urged to chuck it. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Good Luck Chuck
8,movieman_kev,the road to banality leads through Chuck,1,25 September 2007,"Dane Cook stars as Charlie, a man whose been cursed since grade school by a smarmy little goth girl to never find love but those women that ""date"" him will find true love with the next guy. Charlie falls for the accident-prone penguin loving Cam (played by Jessica Alba) but the same curse that inadvertently makes him extremely popular with the ladies causes him not put off getting with Cam. The comedy is supremely stale and endlessly predictable. I didn't even chuckle once much less laugh while watching the film. Furthermore Dan Fogler as Charlie's best friend Stu, is not only terribly unfunny, but horribly annoying of the most cringe-inducing kind. This movie is strictly for die hard fans of Dane Cook (if he still has any left) The film clearly wants to be the next ""Wedding Singers"", but winds up in the same nauseating un-funny level as ""not another teen movie"" My Grade: D- Eye Candy: Carrie Fleming, Tammy Morris, Jessica Olafson, Chelan Simmons, Zara Taylor, Yasmine Vox, and Annie Wood all get topless, but Vox is most memorable (hopefully she'll be in a watchable movie one day)",Good Luck Chuck
9,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Had potential, but the cast was all wrong, if you ask me",4,29 September 2007,"I was pretty scared seeing Good Luck Chuck after seeing all the bad reviews on IMDb, the rating just seems to be going down and down. But my friend wanted to see it today, so we saw it, while I didn't think it's the worst movie I've seen, it's definitely a flop in some ways. I'm not trying to be mean or anything like that, just that the plot did have some great potential for a fun comedy, but I think it was the cast that blew it. Dane Cook was alright, but he's not believable as a sensitive male and his character at the end of the film wasn't that likable or funny. Jessica Alba doesn't work well in comedies, she's the looks, that's it, her character was just a ditz and made you wonder why she was supposed to be so perfect for the role of Charlie's girlfriend. And who ever the heck decided to cast Dan Fogler as Charlie's best friend was sorely mistaken, because I just wanted to smack his character to death, he was so obnoxious.Charlie is only 10 at his first girl/boy party and when he doesn't do a goth girl a favor by kissing her, she hexes him to make him where if he sleeps with a girl, she breaks up with him and moves onto the next guy to marry him. Now grown up, Charlie and his perverted best friend, Stu claim it's just an urban legend. But when it's proving multiple times that every girl he sleeps with is getting married to another guy right afterwards, Stu encourages Charlie to just take advantage. But that all changes when Charlie meets a clumsy girl, Cam and of course because of the hex, he can't sleep with her until it's put to the ultimate test of if he's really cursed or not.The main problem with Good Luck Chuck isn't just the cast, it's the characters, they were not well written and not that likable. Stu was just plain annoying and so not funny. Jessica was just alright and Dane wasn't believable. Also some of the jokes were a little out there and not really that funny, like the joke with the ""fat and mean"" girl, it was stereotypical and pretty rude. I'm not that sensitive, but it was just a little low in my opinion. Good Luck Chuck is a below average comedy that is more of a rental than a watch at the theater, so I suggest you just wait.4/10",Good Luck Chuck
10,KineticSeoul,"Stupid sex comedy, but has it's moments although very few. It's watchable.",4,2 November 2009,"There has been some good Rated R comedies, this isn't one of them. Chuck(Dane Cook) has a curse on him by some goth girl so every time he has sex with a girl, the girl finds the man of there dreams the next time they go on a date. Some may think of this as being lucky cause just about every girl wants to have sex with Chuck, but soon he comes across Cam Wexler(Jessica Alba) who is the girl of his dreams. Dane Cook plays a sweet guy that has respect for women, which I highly doubt he is in real life. Cause just about every girl in this movie is shallow and dumb, superstitious slut including Cam Wexler who is Jessica Alba's character. She tries to make her character seem clumsy, cute and a bit ditsy but she just comes across as clumsy, ditsy, dumb and a bit psychotic. Chuck is a dopey dentist and works in the same building as his best friend Stu(Dan Fogler). I never found Dan Fogler to be that funny and he tries to go with the gross humor in this one but just ends up being gross than funny and is a bit of a annoying character, which is okay if he is funny, but he is not funny. There is a scene in this film where it shows Dane Cook having sex with multiple girls since the screen gets split up into multiple section while he is performing the Kama Sutra, which was unique but not that tasteful. And the best scene in the whole movie besides the parts that show off Jessica Alba's assets is the scene where Dane Cook gets bit in the crotch by a penguin. I get the feeling that the creators knew that sex sells so they just tried to go with what they thought was going to be a big hit. Plus the jokes aren't even clever, they just throw in bunch of repulsive nonsense and expect the audience to laugh. Despite it having a lot of flaws it did somewhat have it's moments and was somewhat entertaining, but nothing is special about this film. With it's slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes, which is cool if it was funny or at least amusing. 4.8/10",Good Luck Chuck
11,MLDinTN,the idea behind this movie had to come from a guy,6,6 April 2009,"If there ever was a film you could say was made for guys, this one is it. One could say it's every guy's dream. Dane Cook plays, Charlie, a respectable dentist that was cursed as a child. Any woman he dates finds true love and marriage with the next guy after him. Soon, it seems the entire female population of where he lives, finds out about this and he is pursued by all these very hot women. At first, he doesn't want to take advantage of them, but at the urging of his friend, Stu, Charlie decides to let the women have what they want. So, he has all these one night stands, which soon become unfulfilling for him. He decides to ask out again a girl he really likes, Cam, played by Jessica Alba. They get along great but when it comes time to go further, he doesn't really want to because of the curse. Will Charlie break the curse and get the girl of his dreams? What do you think? Some scenes I would like to mention for their shock/gross/comical value are: Charlie goes out with this obese, acne faced woman in order to disprove the curse. Did we really need to see that? Or how about when he's basically raped by his huge secretary. Perhaps the most shocking scene is when Charlie walks in on Stu in a compromising position with a grapefruit. There's the 3 boob woman. Plus this movie has a lot of gratuitous nudity and sex for a film starring some famous names.FINAL VERDICT: All of the things I've mentioned lead this movie to be geared toward guys. I found it funny at times. This movie is sort of like a raunchier version of the American Pie genre.",Good Luck Chuck
12,The-Sarkologist,"Interesting concept, but painful to watch",3,5 July 2021,"This was a pretty dreadful film, even though the concept actually did have some merit. I guess in part it had a lot to do with Chuck's friend, who happened to be a plastic surgeon that specialised in breasts, was one of the sleaziest people known to humanity, and even then couldn't get laid. As for Charles (or Chuck, even though he is never called Chuck in the film), he is just one of those guys that seems to have an awful run of bad luck, if you consider it to be bad luck. In a way you could describe him as being a hopeless romantic.The story goes that when he was a teenager, they were playing a game of seven minutes in heaven, where you are locked in a cupboard for seven minutes with a girl and basically anything goes. Well, Churck ended up in the closet with a witch that had the hots for him, but he didn't like her, so she placed a curse on him, namely that he will never find true love. The curse manifested itself in a way that whenever he sleeps with a girl the next guy she meets is her one true love.Fast forward to when he is a successful dentist and suddenly word gets around and all of these women want to sleep with him, because they know that if they do they will find their one true love. At first Chuck, at the behest of his friend, takes advantage of it, but the problem is that sex without love is, well, just sex. In fact, this is probably the major theme of the film, and while his best mate is insanely jealous of Chuck, you get the impression that Chuck is more into the romance than he is into just the sex. Okay, some people may like the idea of lots of sex, but in the end empty, meaningless sex is just that, empty and meaningless, and for a hopeless romantic like Chuck, it just isn't all that good.I'd have to agree with him on that in that sex without the love is just sex, and sex is, well, pretty bland to be honest with you. Mind you, it does show us that there are constrasting views of the topic, and that is clearly show with his friend, who will go to insane lengths just to get laid. However, you see that Chuck is clearly a hopeless romantic in that he has this ideal concept of love, but it never seems to work out for him that way. Mind you, there are probably a lot of people who would love to be in Chuck's position, except that he doesn't seem to envy it all that much. The fact that he has met a girl that he really likes only adds to the problem.You can sort of tell that this is an earlier film namely because there is an awful lot of T&A, something that you simply don't get in films these days. Still, while there were some interesting concepts in this film, it simply got too annoying. For instance, when Chuck started smothering the girl that he liked she told him to get lost, but they ended up having that typical Hollywood ending where everything is forgiven and they end up getting together. Seriously, that never ever happens in real life. Sure, he goes to absolute extremes in this film, but I guess in the end I do appreciate some realism, but I guess we can't expect that to come out of Hollywood, can we?",Good Luck Chuck
13,Floated2,A shortage of laughs and entertainment,6,18 October 2010,"Good Luck Chuck contains many sex scenes with a lot of crude and gross humour at times. The film is pretty bad. Its starts off okay but then it just becomes crazy and the ridiculous stories pile up. It goes downhill when Charlie (Cook) gets untrue word from Stu (Fogler) that the hex is broken meaning that he can sleep with Cam (Alba) and she wont leave him. he then becomes a huge stalker and the film turns hard into a cheesy romantic film. The film really is only worth seeing for Jessica Alba and a few scenes of topless females. In general the film just isn't funny.The story arc, which is really more of a story dot, doesn't even make sense. Why would any guy with an IQ greater than his inseam believe in a dumb curse? Since the consequences of striking out with the girl are the same as the consequences of not trying, why would Charlie spend a long section of the movie avoiding her (towards the middle to end)? And the cure for the curse turns out to have nothing to do with anything we've seen in the movie. Overall the film isn't funny and really not meant for everyone. I blame the marketing and trailers, completely misleading. As a rewatch 12/25/20' and over 10 years since the initial watch this film seemingly seems better on the second watch. Perhaps as a reason in comparison to more recent comedies, Good Luck Chuck has some enjoyable moments. Rating changed from 3 to 6.",Good Luck Chuck
14,leplatypus,Good job Chuck ! (DVD),7,6 March 2009,"From all the Jessica Alba's movies I saw lately, this is my favorite, but once again, if Jessica plays fine, she doesn't leave a great impression: she is always in her cute, sweet, gentle character who lacks something passionate inside! So it's easy for her partners to steal the show as Joy Briant did in ""Honey"".This time, it's this Chuck! Honestly, I didn't know this actor but he wins me over: great in comedy, excellent for drama and it isn't the good face with nothing inside ""à la"" Brad Pitt! He reminds me much of Chevy Chase, a big heart in a big body! The tongue-in-cheek flavor of this movie is a good surprise because it's a real breathe in those all sweet, nice romantic movies! It pushes the envelope very far and men take as much blows as women! And the idea of being a lucky-charm is original and well-exploited up to the ultimate example! A really good movie!",Good Luck Chuck
15,mattkratz,good yet gross,6,13 January 2008,"This was a comedy that tried to make the most of its subject material. When the title character is a kid, he is at a party playing a ""dare game."" When he refuses to kiss a goth girl, she puts a curse on him, saying that every woman he sleeps with will find her dream man immediately afterwards.After he grows up and becomes a successful dentist, he finds her curse has come true. Every woman he sleeps with immediately breaks it off with him and finds Mr. Right soon after. He is desperate to reverse this trend after he meets Jessica Alba.I think the premise is good, but the portrayal and humor got too gross. It seems to have been written by a sixth-grader going thru his ""dirty mind"" stage. Lots of scenes were funny and well-executed, but all the nudity and sex scenes got to be too much. Under some other circumstances and if it hadn't been a comedy (and other basic plot elements and ""normal scenes""), this probably would qualify as a porn movie.I thought the film was OK. It wasn't nearly as good as other sex-themed comedies and sitcoms. It might remind you a little bit of shows like Married with Children, Night Court, and Two and a Half Men.** out of ****",Good Luck Chuck
16,davispittman,"Offensive, unfunny, awkward comedy",1,7 April 2017,"Good Luck Chuck is so embarrassing for everyone involved. Oh my goodness this film is bad. I feel so sorry for Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and the all the supporting actors involved. This film is just so below amateur and full of middle school humor that it's embarrassing. It reminds me of a typical straight middle school boy's brain. Random naked women bouncing on top of Dane Cook, an absolutely terrible male best friend who is the most offensive character ever, and disgusting crude humor. The script is filled to the brim with poor humor that just falls flat and doesn't amuse or entertain in the least. It's also got very lazy dialogue that does nothing to make the audience want to stay and keep watching. I will say that I actually don't think Dane Cook is a terrible actor, I just think that he wasn't getting any other offers and this came across his desk and he took it because it was work. I think the same is true for Jessica Alba, I mean just think about it, why would any actor or actress that is doing well with their career choose this project to work on? They wouldn't. And I know they wouldn't because this is a sucky movie that is boring, disgusting, lazy, poorly acted, and very unfunny.

When he refused to make out with her. She puts a curse on him to make other girls he sleeps with him, break up with him and his ex's always marry the next man they meet. More than 20 years has passed... Chuck (Dane Cook) has become an successful dentist. Which he shares the building with his best friend Stu (Dan Fogler), who's a plastic surgeon. When Chuck has been invited to a wedding by his ex-girlfriend. Chuck slowly realized that the Curse that Anisha spelled on him is true. Since all his ex's are married or planning to get married real soon. Now every single attractive female after Chuck for one night stands to find true love. Until Chuck finds himself attractive to a cute but sometimes extremely clumsy young woman named Cam (Jessica Alba). But Chuck is scared to sleep with her, since the hex seems to be true and he tries to find ways to break the curse before it is too late for him.Directed by Mark Helfrich, who's on top film editor in Hollywood. I do enjoy the funny premise in the movie but there's too much gross-out gags to be really sweet. It's one of those features that is depending on a certain personal taste. Cook isn't bad in the movie but he seems out of place in the movie. Seeing Cook and Alba as a couple in the picture are certainly mismatched. Still it has an some good laughs here and some unforgettably disturbing gags involving with extremely overweight ugly woman that is a good thing is kept brief. But for those, who enjoy good romantic comedies will look elsewhere here. Die hard fans of Cook and Alba will be more forgiving with this misfired effort. Watchable but nothing special.

18,Enchorde,Surprisingly funny,8,8 September 2009,"Recap: Charles has a problem with love. He haven't just met the right one yet. But it seems that all his exes does and soon he is the talk of the town. He is the lucky charm that guarantees that your next date will be with the right one. As such he is the most popular guy in town. Until he meets the girl of his dreams, literally a walking disaster, and he will do anything to keep her.Comments: A real fun comedy with two main plots that are really funny. Charlie's lucky charm thing is a good idea and a base for many jokes and surprises. And Cam, the walking accident, is just plain fun, fringing on schadenfreude. Combined the bring a fast paced, twisting and surprisingly fun plot.I admit that some jokes are a little cheap, and definitely under the belt (if you don't want to explain some really awkward stuff keep your kids from this :) ). And admittedly some little too long stretches seem to aim on teenage boys with both a lot of nudity (I got the point long before that cavalcade ended) and some jokes are far below the line of decent. But it's still very funny.Dane Cook is surprisingly good and Jessica Alba shows she can really carry a comedy. Only Stu, Charlie's friend is over the top. Seemingly he changes between a little and very disgusting. Not actor Dan Fogler's fault, but a bad call from the writers. Maybe they got a little too overenthusiastic here. It's unfortunate, because they have done a good job with the most other parts.A good surprise. Very funny, much recommended.8/10",Good Luck Chuck

No. He plows through women like Moses parting the Red Sea, and promptly loses everyone of them. Finally, he meets the girl of his dreams (a very skinny Jessica Alba), and does his utmost not to sleep with her. Funny, no? No. Most of the movie is just frat boy humor. My 30-something nephew, who wanted me to watch this with him, and his 60-year-old father laughed their fannies off at every gross comment and situation. Both have the mentality of eight year olds. I was ready to hide under my chair. Alba, who is not much of an actress but is cute in an odd sort of way, keeps me from giving the movie no stars.

22,Matt_Layden,No Chemistry and No Laughs,4,18 February 2008,"Charlie Logan is hexed as a kid after he denies a Goth in the ""7 minutes in heaven"" game. Years later the hex catches up with him and every woman he sleeps with finds their true love in the next guy they date. All is good as he has sex with dozens of women, until he falls for one. Now he has to resist the sexual urges, or she will find someone else to love.Seems like a funny premise, has a beautiful lady and a funny guy for the two leads. Why doesn't it work? I don't really know why, all I can say is that it doesn't. If I were to take a guess though, it would be the next to no chemistry from Cook and Alba and the feeling that the film is purposely trying to push the bad taste button down our throats. Most of this button pushing is done Dan Fogler, Cook's best friend.Let's get the most obvious reasons out of the way first. Alba cannot act. Sure she looks good in penguin underwear, but for the life of her cannot act. Seeing her in an R rated comedy is so out of place that is distracts the viewer fro getting any enjoyment out of it and since she has that no nudity clause, you know the only nude females you will be seeing are no name extras. Her character has a clumsy aspect to her, she destroys everything in her path. None of these gags work either, you know they are coming and are overdone throughout the film. For some reason she also has an obsession with penguins. I guess they were trying to get some kind of character arch here. Instead it comes off as a tail coat riding of other successful penguin films. I can see someone sitting in the office looking at ""March of the Penguins"", ""Happy Feet"", ""Surf's Up"" and thinking that throwing penguins in here will also get butts in the seats.For my money, I think Dane Cook is a funny guy. Unfortunately he has yet to see a film to connect his stand up to the big screen. Employee of the Month could have been a great film but with a bogus plot, Andy dick and another pretty face who can't act in the lead it failed. Here Cook has the R rating to get his comedy style flowing, but it never works. Sure he gets a chuckle here and there, but he mostly looks bored. So does Alba, but she always looks like that. So far Cook has had two chances to shine in the lead and has failed on both accounts. I think he should stick to supporting roles like in Waiting, he'll be much better off.Seeing Alba and Cook on screen together is like watching cousins trying to kiss. Completely awkward and wrong. Not once did I ever believe these character would be together, not even in bizzaro world. Add onto the fact that Dane Cook is a dentist. What in the world? When would this guy ever be a dentist? How about his best friend working right beside him...as a plastic surgeon who specifies in the breast enlargement area. Here is a guy who is more hornier then a 16 year old virgin on Viagra and he is able to become a plastic surgeon? At least 50% of the time I watched this movie I was thinking to myself that they only made it to show breasts.Saying that, there is a montage in which all that happens in sex. Dane Cook has sex with dozens of woman and it is shown all at once. While this might sound intriguing, it is nothing of the sort. It's nowhere near as bad as critics have made it out to be. Nor is it funny. Sure you might snicker when most of the woman want to do others things while having sex, like read a book or pray, but snickering is all you'll get.With every other romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck is structured. Boy meets girl, boy and girl fight, boy loses girl, boy fights to get girl back, boy wins girl. How many times have we seen the same thing over and over again? Will somebody....anybody....give us something new and fresh? If this film was made to push boundaries and be in bad taste with all the sexual acts and jokes, then why play it safe with it's conventional structure? Mix it up a bit, Alba should have fallen in love with someone else. If you think this is a spoiler, it's not, even a blind guy can see it coming.Good Luck Chuck is funny on paper, not as a film. Fogler gets the most laughs, but they are few and far between. His character would have been a lot more interesting to watch in the lead.Hell, they could have even had some kind of emotional shift in this character. Here's a guy who loves naked women, have him change at the end because of the hex. Nope, they wanted an unfunny Dane Cook. Tis a shame.As far as bad films of 2007 go, Good Luck Chuck makes the list.",Good Luck Chuck
23,fntstcplnt,Good Luck Chuck (2007),1,14 March 2020,"Directed by Mark Helfrich. Starring Dane Cook, Jessica Alba, Dan Fogler, Lonny Ross, Ellia English, Chelan Simmons, Michelle Harrison. (R)Cook plays the obsequious ""hero"" of this high-concept collision, a young man named Charlie that was ""hexed"" when he was a pre-teen to forever be the last person a woman is involved with before she finds her true love. Enter Alba, a cute, colossal klutz who's constantly inflicting pain upon herself by running into things, falling down, hitting her head (how else to explain the brain damage needed to find Cook's character lovable?); when sparks fly, what is Charlie to do, knowing that he's doomed to be passing her off to the next lucky guy? Crass, juvenile and profane rom-com layered with snickering sex comedy raunchiness and lots of bare breasts and trampy babes; not necessarily an awful combo (though a rickety one). What sinks this pic to the risible depths is just how hateful and plain mean it often is, cruelty aimed downward like the worst kind of frat humor imaginable. Neither Cook nor Alba can rise above the material (never a good thing when a rom-com has leads that you hope end up unhappy by the end of the movie), and Fogler's ""best pal"" role is an even more heinous individual than Charlie, whose every appearance summons dread and nausea. If one must watch (and it should be stressed that no one must), occupy the mind away from the idiotic main plot to notice things like how the lead is never actually called ""Chuck"" or how the name of the building he works at is ""Beatles"" spelled backwards.7/100",Good Luck Chuck

25,Sirus_the_Virus,Becareful what you wish for... really don't watch this.,2,16 September 2009,"Good luck Chuck is a stupid film experience that I am surprised didn't get a lower rating. Good luck Chuck isn't a comedy. It's a disaster from start to finish. I had many problems with this piece of junk. Is it just me or do you hate Dane Cook? It's not that he is not funny it's just that he is so irritating and that movie My best friend's girl looked terrible. I have only liked a few of Dane Cook's films. I liked Dan in real life and Waiting, and that is about it. The only exciting thing about this film is that you get to see Jessica Alba in her underwear. That is probably the only reason why it got 5.6.Dane Cook plays Chalrie, who while playing seven minutes of heaven was about to be molested. By a Gothic chick. So she put a curse on him. That curse was that after every person that he had sex with, when they left, they would get married. That has happened every time. Now Charlie has grown up and is a dentist. One day at a wedding he meets Cam(Jessica alba) who is the unluckiest son of a bitch on the planet. She chips a tooth, bumps into poles, you name it. So Charlie thinks that if he dates her... I am going to stop right there. I hated this film. There are constant sex scenes which will make guys horny. The film is just incredibly crude and gross at times and this is like a lot of comedies nowadays. Only moronic guys will enjoy this film. The only reason why I gave this film a 2 is because of Jessica Alba. Who will get guys attention and try to save this film. Jessica alba, she's the hottest woman on the planet besides Megan Fox but every film choice that she makes is horrible or flops with other people or critics. I feel sorry for Jessica Alba because it is not her fault that this film is such a mess. Everything about it besides her is a mess. Big, big, big, big, big thumbs down. It is only worth seeing for Jessica Alba and the scene where she is in her underwear. There is another problem with Good luck Chuck that I left off the list. Throughout the film you see Dane Cook have sex with tons of women and you see their tits. Well, you don't get any of that from Jessica Alba. Perhaps if you did, this film would be a 3, but it is still a 2. Because of the underwear. Skip Good Luck Chuck.

26,fwomp,A Decent Matinée Diversion,6,9 October 2007,"Dane Cook is funny but Dan Fogler is hysterical. This is what makes most of GOOD LUCK CHUCK a worthy matinée diversion for the 18-and-over crowd.Director Mark Helfrich of the RUSH HOUR movie franchise pulls in a mediocre comedy with plenty of trashy jokes, lots of sexual innuendo (and quite a bit of flat-out sexage and breastage), and a surprising character study of sex in the 2000's.The story is that of Charlie (comedian turned actor Dane Cook), a dentist who is suddenly seen as a good luck charm of sorts. What he does is have sex with women and then the very next person that that woman dates, she falls head-over-heels in love with and marries. It happens without exception, and women flock to his dental office hoping to get into Charlie's pants just once so that they can find their true love after him.Aiding Charlie in this discovery is buddy Stu (Dan Fogler, BALLS OF FURY), a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast augmentation, and who also has an office next door to Charlie's dental practice. Stu is the consummate 'guy who's never grown up,' thinking only about when and where his next sexual exploitation might happen (this includes lonely nights at home with grapefruits warmed up in microwaves!) Charlie initially follows Stu's advice and has sex with just about any attractive woman who comes knocking. But then Charlie meets Cam (Jessica Alba, FANTASTIC FOUR) and Charlie is immediately smitten. Wanting to follow his heart, Charlie fears that by getting intimate with her he'll lose her.Stu and Charlie eventually rig up a test run to see if Charlie's good luck powers are real or if they're just extreme coincidence. Initially everything seems to go Charlie's way, but soon he discovers that they aren't. The test run fails and Charlie remembers a childhood curse put on him (which is how the film starts).Amongst this mix is another great character named Joe (Lonny Ross) who is Cam's brother and a technician at a water park. He and his sister help out with the penguin exhibit, and it is during their conversations about work, love, and obsession that many funny (and occasionally profound) moments come spilling onto the screen. Joe is a stoner who likes to play jokes on the penguins and this is hysterically funny. But he also helps out his sister in unique and surprising ways (i.e., by giving her insights into her life that she'd overlooked, etc.).But without Dan Fogler, this film may have flopped big time. His Stu character is undoubtedly the funniest of the cast. He's got all the great lines (from ""man-chowder"" on up) and finally gets what he wants when he discovers the breasts of his dreams.The jokes are often sinfully gross and there's plenty of sex scenes to stir the loins of every pubescent male out there. Even the ending credits hold a crude yet laugh-out-loud moment, not willing to let the audience leave until they've hit upon every sexual depravity known to man. Even so, this is a good diversion for a slow afternoon, and it's one that's sure to make you wheeze and laugh at its ridiculous nature.",Good Luck Chuck
27,jon.h.ochiai,Pulling for 'The Next Guy',8,1 October 2007,"""Good Luck Chuck"" is outrageously crude, hysterical, and surprising on a couple counts. Dane Cook is going to be a big movie star. Cook plays Charlie, who suffers under a perplexing curse: Any woman who has sex with Charlie, the next man she meets will be her true love. I have seen Dane Cook in other movies previously. He is one the hottest stand-up comics around. Thankfully in ""Good Luck Chuck"" he plays against persona. Cook has this goofy sweet-hearted every guy's presence that is genuine and smart. Cook is handsome with a borderline neurotic and endearing charisma. I think Jessica Alba has discovered her distinct talent: she is a great straight man and a gifted slapstick comedienne. She could be a young Lucille Ball. Alba is stunningly beautiful. However, up until now being pretty is all she plays in movies. Alba is completely hilarious and game as the klutzy Cam, whom Charlie falls in love with. I about died laughing when she did a face plant into a lamp post. She also demonstrates great comic timing. When her Cam first meets Charlie at the wedding of his former lover, he does not believe that Cam (Alba) is a penguin researcher. She replies, ""Okay, I'm really a serial killer"" Granted not all of ""Good Luck Chuck"" is clever funny or possessing astounding repartee. But it is just out right funny. The screenplay and story by Josh Stolberg and Steve Glen is bold in your face sexual comedy. The audience never wonders, ""What did they really mean here?"" Director Mark Helfrich expertly incorporates unexpected romantic elements in this hysterical sex comedy. Writers Stolbeg and Glen also offer strangely inventive and wacky contexts. Who would have thought you could combine penguin research, voodoo curses, and plastic surgery in the same movie? Dane Cook plays Charlie, who is a successful single dentist. His childhood buddy is the oafish Stu (funny Dan Fogler), who is a very successful single cosmetic surgeonhe does killer boob jobs. As kids during a game of spin the bottle gone awry, Charlie is cursed by Goth Girl (Sasha Pieterse). Anyone who has sex with Charlie will find their true love in the next guy she meets. After attending a wedding of his former lover, where Charlie also meets Cam (Alba), women soon leverage this curse to their benefit. Charlie is even dismissed as an Urban Legend on the Internet due to overwhelming evidence. Soon hot women are lining up to sleep with Charlie, so that they too can find true love with ""the next guy"". Initially abhorred about being objectified as a tool, Charlie acquiesces to Stu's advice that he revel in vapid sex with hot women. Stu pleads with Charlie, ""Sex without love is still SEX!"" ""Good Luck Chuck"" to that end has a slick montage of beautiful naked women having sex with Charlie. This is not a complaint, rather deferring to the genius of Director Helfrich. Amidst all the glorious meaningless sex Charlie remembers Cam. After assisting Cam with a dental emergency, enduring stab wounds from dental instruments and severe electrical shock, Charlie sees something special in Cam. However, Charlie knows that if he sleeps with Cam, the next guy she meets will be her true love. What can Charlie do to be the ""next guy"".I laughed my butt off in ""Good Luck Chuck"". Here may be an insight into its amazing broad appeal. I saw the movie last night, sitting next to two couples. There is a scene that comes telegraphed with Charlie and his receptionist Reba (bold Ella English), but the effect is totally unexpected when Reba says, "" Imagine I'm beautiful."" Both women in the audience sighed, ""Ohh.."" in unison. Dane Cook responds gently, never cheesy. Later on there was a similar reaction when Charlie confesses to Cam, ""I want to be that 'next guy'."" Keep in mind there are no taste boundaries in ""Good Luck Chuck"", particularly in Charlie's mind bendingly stupid tests of his curse. To director Helfrich's credit, ""Good Luck Chuck"" plays it both ways: in your face slapstick sex comedy with a romantic subtext that works. This primarily has to do with Cook and Alba's phenomenal chemistry. We are all for them living happily ever after. Also as outrageously crude as Dan Fogler is as Stu, we want to see him hook up with someone, not just a grapefruit (see the movie). Dane Cook is amazingly good in ""Good Luck Chuck"". Jessica Alba may have found her true calling as a classic comic actress. ""Good Luck Chuck"" is wildly hysterical and strangely endearingvery strangely. It is among the funniest 100 minutes you could spend at the movies.",Good Luck Chuck

32,DonFishies,"Has a few mild laughs, but otherwise atrociously bad",3,16 January 2008,"Seeing the trailer for Good Luck Chuck, I almost automatically knew that I would dislike it. It just had that mildly amusing, incredibly terrible aura about it. And sadly, despite giving it a chance, that aura turned out to be correct.Starting off with a hopelessly ridiculous (albeit rather chuckle-worthy) scene involving spin-the-bottle and a hex in 1985, the film quickly jumps to dentist Charlie (Dane Cook), who has a little bit of a phobia towards commitment. He goes to a wedding of an ex-girlfriend, and during an impromptu toast, the single women around the room find out that he has the special ability of leading them to their future husband right after sleeping with him. He does not buy it at first, but after getting to know the clumsy Cameron (Jessica Alba), he begins to have his doubts.Without even attacking the idea of a guy sleeping around with dozens of women, I can tell you that the film just gets nothing right. It has an intriguing idea on paper, but seeing it on film jumping around quickly from silly and ridiculous to vile and disgusting is another story. It just does not work, and after a few moments of seeing Charlie beginning to succumb to the idea, the film grows tired. Yes, it has the single most outrageous montage since Wedding Crashers (another film with an intriguing concept but flawed output, albeit one that crashes and burns near the final act, and not right at the beginning), but watching just feels like an exercise in bad taste. It is not necessarily softcore porn-like like some early reviewers made it out to look like, but it becomes a little excessive and needless very rapidly.What is worse is the little to no effort put into giving any of these female characters Charlie encounters (save for Alba's Cameron) a personality or some sort of amusing trait. Instead, we are treated to more than a handful of sex slaves, a few women simply there to throw a loop into the sex scenes with bizarre sex positions, and a few women with an inane trait (such as a Catholic much to interested in praying than having sex) meant to be funny, but comes off as some fratboy's attempt at drunken humour. Yes, I smirked a few times at the sheer foolishness of some of these actresses (with way too many simply here to show off their breasts) and the tomfoolery of the clearly bored Cook (whether this is an attempt at acting or just him not having any fun in the role is not immediately clear), but the majority of the time I just sat feeling a little foolish myself, wishing I had not even bothered with this movie. And that feeling came before I sat through the disgraceful attempts at comedy involving a morbidly obese, rather cruel woman Charlie just has to sleep with (God help us if this woman was not created through the joys of special effects and makeup).The script itself, when it is not looking for ""fresh"" ways for Charlie to have sex with women, is pedestrian at best. It introduces the idea for the film very close to the beginning, and after the subplot involving Cameron begins to kick in, it just falls flat on itself. It has a few genuinely romantic moments (and a small handful of laugh-out-loud moments, unfortunately most of them were also found in the trailers), but when it is not throwing one inane plot device after another (many of which have been overdone in much better films), it is just limping along struggling to find itself a pulse. Did screenwriter Josh Stolberg think that the film would just write itself after penning the opening set-up? Is the one-trick idea of the curse and corresponding results just that? I found myself more bored than anything after awhile, and I lost almost all interest late in the film when it turns from a raunchy R-rated sex comedy into something else entirely. It does have the nugget of a great idea (maybe one that should have endorsed safe sex a little bit more clearer), but its methods of expression are far from great.Cook and Alba do not fare much better either. While they have some fairly solid chemistry when they are conversing together (some a little too out of character for my tastes), they just do not do well on their own. I was not expecting much from Alba, and she did not deliver on almost any cylinder, so I can ""forgive"" her for that, but I expected a whole lot more out of Cook. Seeing him held back in the lead in PG-13 fare like Employee of the Month and negated to a barely there supporting character in the surprisingly effective Waiting (and sadly, not much else), I was actually looking forward to seeing him spread his foul wings and lay out some R-rated schtick. But there is next to none to be found here. Yeah, he does some fairly R-rated things, and he drops a few R-rated lines, but never to the same degree as his stand-up material. Any other time, he just looks confused and totally alien-like, almost as if he wandered onto the sound stage from a different movie entirely. Not once does he try to convince us his character would ever become a dentist, and not once does he even make us try and feel for his character. Would a little more slack for Cook be totally out of the cards Hollywood filmmakers, or are we just going to let him waddle around until he gives up? While Dan Fogler does some very strong work as Charlie's plastic surgeon buddy (and woman/breast obsessed) Stu, it comes far too late in this total mess of a comedy. It has a few moments of greatness, but it is bogged down by far too many atrocious ones.3/10.",Good Luck Chuck
33,dave13-1,"Weak romance, unfunny and occasionally annoying.",3,9 February 2008,"What do you get when filmmakers who have no conception of either romance or comedy decide to make a romantic comedy? Exactly. This.Jessica Alba's character is klutzy, but gorgeous and this is supposed to be both funny and endearing. It's neither. I cannot remember her character's antics making me laugh even once. Dane Cook's character sleeps with a different woman every night thanks to an urban legend that every woman who does the deed with him finds her soul mate in the next guy she dates. But he longs for true love. Aww. The best friend character is a breast obsessed jerk who talks like a letter to Penthouse, which, I guess makes Dane Cook the sensitive one by default. In addition to unlikable characters, the romantic chemistry is weak and the jokes are lame when they are not actually offensive. (This one comes in behind Norbit when it comes to fat woman jokes, which is nothing to commend.) There were long stretches in this film that lacked warmth, charm, laughs, anything that makes the romantic comedy experience enjoyable. The minor players, mostly a parade of indistinguishable marriage minded young females, have no depth and little reason to exist other than to have some soft core sex.

I know it nicely avoids saying what year the ""present day"" is but he'd be at least 33. He doesn't look over 25, he doesn't look old enough at all.Dane Cook just isn't famous enough to be playing this kind of lead role. I know him from Employee of the Month where he wasn't the star there, that guy out of Scrubs was. Jessica Alba is the big name in this movie and that's real sad. Because she just is not famous enough to be playing a female lead in this kind of movie either.I know they said Jennifer Love Hewitt (whoever she is?) turned this down, but this struck me as a kind of Reece Witherspoon or Heather Graham kind of role to be honest. It almost reminded me of Heathers role in ""The Guru"".I'm guessing this is aimed at couples or 20 somethings. It's a bit heavy on the gratuitous nudity during the really awful and pointless sex montage scene. Obviously the eventual outcome of this movie is predictable that they hook up and even the horrendous best friend gets himself a girl as well.If you took the worst parts of ""Wedding Crashers"" and either Van Wilder film, you'd be just about in the right ball park for the script of this movie.Alba brings nothing to her role, likewise Cook. Best avoided, it's destined for the DVD bargain bin I hope.",Good Luck Chuck
35,acedj,A guy's rom-com,7,15 May 2020,"This is the story of Charlie, a dentist and all around guy's guy. He convinces himself that he will never find a woman to settle down with and that he is little more that a stepping stone for women to meet their soulmates. This of course becomes a running joke for a goodly part of the movie.At a wedding for one of his exs, Charlie meets Cam, a nervous, extremely clumsy woman, and he sets his eyes on her. She plays hard to get, and the audience is left hoping that they connect and end up together.This is a pretty funny movie with A LOT of sex in it. The sex is related to the good luck charm feeling Charlie has, and some of the scenarios in which he finds himself are funny. This would have been a better movie with a different actor in the lead role. Dane Cook is a funny comedian, but not the best actor.Anyone easily offended should avoid this movie, which is what, like 75% of the world that is under 30 years old???",Good Luck Chuck
36,diac228,Good luck surviving this one...,2,23 September 2007,"To make a good romantic flick, you must include a nice blend of humor, heart, romance (obviously), drama, and realism. Good Luck Chuck contains none of this. Packing in excessive nudity, pointless scenes, unnecessary crude humor, and predictable physical humor in a matter of 90-something minutes, this film flounders from the beginning, flops mostly throughout, and begins to reek towards the climax and the ending. Missed opportunities are much more common than laughs in this heap of disaster, which also includes a very generic musical score, wooden acting, and borrowed material. Perhaps the only good that comes from this is Jessica Alba, whose sexy and innocent charm keeps this movie afloat, albeit barely.Good Luck Chuck is a totally different movie from the one advertised. The ads showed that this movie was going to be a charming romantic movie featuring plenty of Cook and plenty of Alba. Unfortunately, we get crude Dane Cook and very little Jessica Alba, and then plenty of preventable boobs. The story here revolves around Chuck (Dane Cook), a man who from a young age receives a hex that allows for him to get with women, but whenever they leave him the next man that female meets will be ""The One."" He takes advantage of this curse until he realizes that he will become love-deprived as long as the hex exists. In the middle of the crisis he meets a beautiful penguin expert Cam (Jessica Alba) whom instantly brings out the best in him.Explaining why the film fails would require a lot more words than allowed, so let's just point out the major issues. Let's begin with the writing. It was a good idea turned sour with filler material, terrible jokes, and no heart. Our main character isn't exactly likable until he is on the brink of destruction over our lead female. Chuck's best friend is an even more disgustingly awful character in more ways than one. The lack of chemistry between everybody in the movie is a major concern, but between the two best friends is far beyond awful. The only consistently likable character once again is Cam. Attempting to reach the college crowd, we see plenty of cleavage, undressing, and Frat pack-style humor. Unfortunately, it fails to bring in the heart and good content that the recent Frat Pack movies contain. Unlike the adult comedies we've seen recently, this movie tries much too hard to earn the ""R"" rating, and it only takes away from its appeal. Has too much crudeness to be considered a date movie, even with its romantic plot entangled.Dane Cook is overrated on stand-up, and not any better on-screen. Perhaps with good direction, we can see a decent romantic comedic lead out of him, but that is about it. His improvising fails, his line are sometimes delivered flat, and he just doesn't have the charm that we see in Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, or Seth Rogen. On the other hand, Jessica Alba pulls a nice performance as the beautiful yet hard-to-get Cam. A noteworthy oddity is that in the previews it shows that she is very clumsy, yet in the film it's a trait that becomes quickly forgotten. She handles herself well with the little material she is given, as she gives the movie its bit of energy that it desperately needs time and time again. Every other female in the movie was in it only because her jugs were a respectable size or in order to be ridiculed by everyone else.The main issue of Good Luck Chuck is that it is totally unaware of what it is; it is unsure of what kind of movie it should bethen it winds up failing on every genre it tried imitating. Trailer shows it's a quirky romantic comedyfailure. Then in the movie we see an attempt to gross us out, an attempt to arose us with all the nudity, then tries to teach us about love by offering a bit of sentimental valuefailure. Fires on all cylinders but miss every single time. It is extremely hard to take this movie seriously in terms of the lovey-dovey material when we see an entire montage of Dane Cook sleeping with different women or there is a moment dedicated to seeing a penguin eating his own feces.First-time director Mark Helfrich should know better than to riddle this good idea with clichés, explored ideas, and Dane Cook material. Helfrich has been in the business for a very long time, and could have really spun this short story by Steve Glenn into a creative romantic comedy. Instead, it tries much too hard to be like Old School, Wedding Crashers, 40-Year-Old Virgin, and other R-comedies that have helmed a good amount of money. To be able to predict the next several scenes in the movie is never really a good sign either.Bottom Line: A mess from start to finish, we once again see Dane Cook trying to transfer his success from the mic into the movie screens but with no success at all. It does not help that he has an untalented cast of writers and cameramen behind this trash, but Cook's inability to expand his brand of humor isn't exactly easy to work with either. Besides Alba, there are no admirable traits in this movie, and that even includes the grotesque amount of nudityand the critic reviewing this is a male. It takes guts to destroy a film that has beautiful women in almost every scene, but Good Luck Chuck does exactly that. If it had stuck to what the trailer was presenting, there could have been some hope. Good Luck Chuck ends up being like the best friend in the movie: crude, offensive, unworthy, pointless, and just all-around an annoyance. Skip this pile of fish droppings.",Good Luck Chuck

She puts a curse on him which makes everyone who has sex with him find her dream partner very soon afterwards. The rest of the film takes place in the present day.

The story about a guy who has a cursed of never falling in love and that the girls he dated would meet their true love after going out with him, was entertaining and enjoyable but also a little weak. The plot is not very well developed. The cast is good with decent acting from almost everyone. the majority of the actors are new talents except for Dane Cook and Jessica Alba, I never expected she was so funny. Dane Cook is also very good. In conclusion, its a decent movie with some funny moments, but if you really wanna see it, you can wait for it until it comes out on DVD.",Good Luck Chuck

Dane Cook has and never will be well liked outside of his subset of fans. On top of it this movie is so extremely misogynistic, vulgar, and crude. That if it came out in this day and age. It would be 100% cancelled by current culture.However those were the things I LOVED about this movie. You just can't find movies like this nowadays anymore. While the film was defintely not perfect (the acting wasn't great by all parties). There was good amount of comedy and romance to carry it along.I definitely recommend this film for teenage to younger male adults alike.

But even so the idea is wrong, how to sleep with him and after that find eternal love? They can not do this without making Chuck happy? Love parties and nudity scenes bring a minus, the movie can be considered one of bad taste, but even so I was amused. Phases with Jessica, how she was in an embarrassing situation due to inattention to the wedding, the dentist, on the street when the pole head on, there were some funny scenes that anyone can be amused. I liked Chuck's sense of humor, knows how to make a girl laugh, every time they were talking he had one reply which amused by the situation.

The plot is about a guy named Charlie who has the power to have sex with someone, and then that woman falls in love with their next date, and they marry.Let me rephrase with made up names. If Charlie has sex with Barbara, Barbara will break up with him, and meet and date Tony. Tony and Barbara, because of her sex with Charlie, fall in love, and happily marry.That may work for the women, (and yes that is plural-there is a montage of him banging 20 different women, in different positions. One is outside in a wheelbarrow), but if they are falling in love with other men, how will he find his own love?Then he meets Jessica Alba's character, named Cam. She's gorgeous and the perfect woman for him, but he has to resist having sex with her...or he will lose her forever.I watched this alone without my Grandma, whom I live with. I am so glad I did! That would be awkward. I think you should be 16 or older and perhaps ALONE to see this.Faithful readers of my reviews will know I don't like pre-marital sex in movies. I let it go for this one. Even with pre-marital sex, Charlie and Cam get to know each other and actually fall in love. That's part of what makes it work. It also shows why pre-marital sex may not be the best idea.Is the movie a masterpiece? No, far from it. But it has it's funny moments and I enjoyed it.

43,jemps918,manic and forced,6,8 November 2007,"Dane Cook (Waiting) plays affable dentist Charlie Logan, who has what other men would not call a problem. Single women eagerly sleep with him because the next guy they meet is their true love, a hex cast upon him by a spurned Goth girl he refused to kiss when he was ten years old.He takes advantage of his extraordinary situation until he falls in love with Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba), a hot girl with a penchant for penguins who strangely isn't interested in him. While Charlie is good luck for the ladies, Cam is incessantly clumsy and plagued by bad luck. Despite this, Charlie pursues her but has to hold back from sleeping with her lest she falls for the next guy she meets.There is a LOT of sex and nudity in this movie, but if you're expecting a naked Jessica Alba you will be disappointed. One would think that putting a reasonably attractive man like Cook together with the hot Alba would be enough to create chemistry but on screen, their acting is manic and forced. Cook is reportedly a good stand-up comic, and it's a shame that the script seems constrict his touted talents. Alba is simply not funny and she does a lot of overacting in a desperate bid for comedy. Even the supporting cast is weak; Charlie's best friend who plays a plastic surgeon obsessed with breasts is so repugnant, which is a mortal sin since sidekicks are meant to be likable. The jokes are few and far between, so if you're fine with that, watch Good Luck Chuck if only to pass the time.",Good Luck Chuck
44,GirishGowda,It is not as bad as they say,5,27 May 2010,"I don't understand why many people found this not to be entertaining. From what my friends were telling, I thought it was gonna be a horrible movie with dumb jokes - well, it has some dumb jokes. Except for Dane Cook really not looking good, this film had plenty of hilarious moments. I rented this yesterday and I laughed through it. Though for an R-rated comedy it did fall short of expectations, you should give it a try.When Charlie Logan/Chuck was a 10 year old kid, an emo girl had cursed him for not making out with her. All his life the girls he dated, after breaking up immediately got married to the next guy. In order to keep the woman of his dreams, Cam (Jessica Alba) from falling for another guy, Charlie Logan has to break the curse that has made him wildly popular with single women: Sleep with Charlie once, and the next man you meet will be your true love. His only friend, a breast surgeon, Stu (Dan Fogler) tries to help him in his endeavour.Although it is R-rated, it is still a romantic comedy and all of us know how it will end. Cam is a penguin lover and works at the zoo taking care of penguins. She is also very likely to fall while walking, or hit her head into something and generally unlucky. Jessica Alba tries her best to portray this goofy girl, but it seemed incredibly fake to me. But, she was very sexy. Dane Cook really looked bad in some scenes, but he was funny. Stu is the worst friend anybody could have. Breast surgery is his job, still why did he have to be such a pervert and disgusting guy? And the scene in the park where he throws frisbees at all the passerbys is boring. Its not funny to hit people in the face with a frisbee. The film makes fun of itself and every other romantic comedy film and that is a good thing. The mandatory run to the airport and proposal is also there. Still, worthwhile to watch it once. Just don't expect much.5/10",Good Luck Chuck

However, it does deliver exactly what it says on the tin (or in the trailer) and you can hardly complain about being misled if you hand over your pounds, dollars, rand or groats to see it.""Good Luck Chuck"" is gross, crass, sexist, probably misogynist, has lots and lots of gratuitous nudity (even if the lovely Jessica Alba's no nudity clause just about manages to stay intact - boo, hiss!), fat jokes, slapstick comedy and penguin porn.Actually, thinking about it, ""Good Luck Chuck"" has a pretty good setup for a porno comedy. Dentist Charlie is cursed in that every woman he sleeps with eventually leaves him and finds true love in the arms of their very next partner. Women flock to Charlie and that's great, but then Charlie meets his perfect girl. Can Charlie break the curse?'Course he can. But you knew that.As romantic comedies go, ""Good Luck Chuck"" isn't bad.

If you want to watch a clever flick, this is not for you. Well, you may get some laughs, it is not bad but it is not good; that means it is just an average movie. Basically, I thought I would have fun watching it as the hot Jessica Alba stars in it.The story is dead simple, Dane Cook's character was chosen to sleep with a girl but he did not want to and this goth girl cursed him. The future comes, those girls who slept with him will find their true love but not him. Chuck ( Dane Cook) wants romance and meets Cam ( Jessica Alba) he soon falls in love with her, the rest of the story is the usual type of romance. The amusing parts are when Cam seems to be always a careless girl, like when closing the door of a car and then her skirt gets stuck in it and the she pulls....her skirt gets ripped. The funny thing about this movie. It tries hard to get people laughing with its sexual contents and the usual banging into items. You got a choice to watch this. Whatever your taste is, Jessica alba is still hot. Jessica alba is starting to be a famous actress, her upcoming movies- Awake and The Eye. If you think you will laugh at all funny sexual contents and dumb scenes, you will laugh at it.

Whatever film I see him in I always feel like he's trying to help make the script funnier, but sadly a dud script is a dud script no matter how much sex you put in it. Whilst Jessica Alba is likable enough, too often I was feeling like the film makers wanted other people for each role and that in desperation they plumped for the cast we have here.Whilst the film features occasional funny moments, too often the jokes fall flat with no real insight or emotional connection for you to want to move forward with the film.Overall this was a disappointing experience and one that I was glad I wasted an orange Wednesday on, I think if I'd paid full price I'd have shaved a couple of points off.",Good Luck Chuck

50,flapdoodle64,Up Chuck,2,29 July 2009,"This amazing movie combines the intellectual rigor of your typical gross out movie with the unblinking realism of a Lifetime Original Movie.If that statement leaves you somewhat uncertain as to my opinion of this movie, I will say it another way: This film attempts to combine the virtues of the typical male slob comedy and the typical gushy chick flick. The precedent for this attempt is in the long and hugely successful line of Judd Apatow male comedies, and also in the successful comedy 'Wedding Crashers.' Unfortunately, the creators of 'Good Luck Chuck' do not succeed at anything other than wasting a couple hours of your time and sending a paycheck to Jessica Alba. Speaking of Jessica Alba, she must be the patron saint not only of male virgins, but of males-who-have-never-talked-with-a-woman-more-than-30-minutes. She is pretty, in a Barbie or Love Doll sense, and seems just as real.Dane Cook as Chuck is not much better. It's not good when you wouldn't mind seeing the protagonist fall to his death 15 minutes after the movie starts. The ugly fat guy who plays his friend is a little better, but never even gets as funny as, say, Martin Lawrence.In short, this is an unoriginal, unfunny comedy, aimed at 13 boys and emotionally retarded men. If I thought it actually was enjoyable to a sizable portion of men beyond those 2 groups, I would give serious thought to having my Y chromosome removed.",Good Luck Chuck
51,jimakros,"funny idea,good stars, but badly done........",6,7 January 2010,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS This is one of the ""could have been great rom-com"" movies.The premise is really funny,of a guy who is ""cursed"" at childhood by a little girl he rejects,to never be able to find true love,because all the women he will meet in his life,will find true love with the next guy they date after him.This not only creates serious problems to his love life,but also,once women get to believe that about him,they go crazy looking to take advantage,so they can find the love of their own lives after dating him. The stars are likable,Dane Cook is convincing enough as a playboy women find attractive,Alba is not really good at comedy,but here the part demands of her not so much to be funny,but to be more of a girl who inspires real passion,which is down her path. So ,all the ingredients were there,if only the script knew how to develop this.Unfortunately,the script drowns into needless extreme profanity and then goes into an unfortunate excursion into soft porn.They could have easily shown the same story without all the needless nudity.The nudity,sex scenes and extreme profanity just destroyed this movie. The situation the lead character finds himself is funny enough,showing women chasing him was enough,without having to show the sex. All the sex could have just easily been hinted at.Just showing the character going out with women,or just being exhausted the next day,is enough for the audience to get it without having to show the action in his bedroom.I guess they just didn't believe in their own story and thought they needed these scenes.Bad mistake.The other bad mistake is how they wrote the character of his friend,whose profanity is overdone to a ridiculous degree. To a lesser degree i didn't like the accident prone character of Alba,i didn't get it why that was necessary,and the point when Cook's character goes berserk was really out of place.So,all in all,too may things went wrong in this movie.Its really a shame because one gets a feeling that with a few but serious script changes this had the makings of a classic romantic comedy.",Good Luck Chuck
52,simonparker1990,Chuck has more Luck than I expected!,6,21 November 2007,"I went into Good Luck Chuck expecting to hate it, the trailers didn't make me laugh, the premise sounded stupid, and Dane Cook's last attempt at comedy, the dismal Employee of the Month, still stuck firmly in memory. In fact I went into Good Luck Chuck expecting a repeat performance of I Now Pronounce you Chuck and Larry and Epic Movie. Lame, immature humour that thought it was funny but really wasn't. A movie that chavs would laugh like hell over, but I would sit and roll my eyes over. So what a surprise to say Good Luck Chuck actually isn't all that bad, its still not brilliant, in fact it only just scrapes above average, but the fact this has got a 6/10 rating rather than the 1/10 rating I expected to give it is a great shocker. The movie just is surprisingly funny, in fact I burst out laughing at least five times properly in the movie and I was smiling for the majority of it, although the scenes with Dan Fogler, who plays Chuck's friend, did start to feel very tiresome and more irritating than anything else after a while. Sure the movie does have its flaws, it is way too long and there are some moments that aren't funny and just plain disgusting. Thankfuly for the majority of this light hearted rom-com it has gentle laughs with some surprisingly competent performances. Dane Cook proves he can carry a movie very easily and Jessica Alba seems more at home in this kind of movie than anything I've seen her do in the past! In fact had this been a shorter movie and had the annoying friend been kept to little more than a cameo this could have been a very, very funny movie. Unfortunately with the length issue the movie just scrapes above average, but still I am in complete and utter shock this is getting such a good rating off me.As I said the performances in this movie are surprisingly competent. Most namely Dane Cook, whose only past movie experience I've seen was Employee of the Month. In that movie he was pretty funny, but the movie as a whole just irritated me so I never really appreciated his performance. Here he proves he is the next big comedy star! He carries the movie very well and seems to have a natural charisma that makes his character likable even when he is doing an unlikable thing. He also has a great chemistry with Jessica Alba, the other big star of the movie. Alba herself left me shocked. In Fantastic Four its safe to say she's the worst thing in it. She's bland, boring and lifeless. I haven't seen any movie with her to prove my thoughts otherwise. However in Good Luck Chuck she's actually pretty decent. Her character is nice and bubbly, if a bit poorly written at times. She also seems to feel more at home doing a rom-com than a superhero action movie. With her good performance in this movie hopefully we will see more of her in this sort of movie. Unfortunately for the audience the next big character is Chuck's friend, Stu, played by Dan Fogler. While he does get some funny lines at times, the character just seems so damn irritating after a while! When the movie seems to soar he randomly ops up just to drag the movie to rock bottom. His character is unlikable and annoying and Fogler's performance makes him nigh on unbearable after a time. The big surprise of the movie for me, and perhaps the big reveal, had to be Ellia English as Chuck's secretary, Reba. She features in the movie very little, but she features in the movies most memorable scene, and it isn't even a comedy scene. She plays a woman who practically begs Chuck to sleep with her so she can find her love. It sounds corny written down, but the scene is actually very touching and English plays her so well you actually feel genuine sympathy for the character. The two big scenes she features in are very memorable and hopefully we will see her in many more roles in the future.The comedy of the movie did catch me off guard. Despite the initial premise of the movie I really didn't expect it to be as raunchy as it was. We have a seven minute montage of sex, and I mean sex! Thousnda of different positions, thousands of topless women and jokes galore. The entire movie focuses on sex pretty much, so its a surprise the humour still works as I am not the biggest fan in the world of sex comedies! There is also quite a bit of slapstick humour in the film, some of which is funny, a bit involving Jessica Alba and a penguin, some of which is uninspired, a bit with Alba and a lamppost. Thankfuly the writers seem to get the point that the audience don't find this sort of thing that funny after the halfway mark and so seem to abandon it. Unfortunately, despite the sometimes ingeniously witty dialogue, we also get some truly grotesque humour. The morbidly obese woman, Elenor, is perhaps the least funny thing in the film. In fact the scene isn't even that funny, apart from the finale of it. Instead the scene just looks disgusting and made my stomach churn more than any thing I have seen in the Saw and Hostel series! Good Luck Chuck falters towards the end because of the length issue. The movie is simply twenty minutes too long, and when I look back at the movie. Still this is a pleasant surprise of a film and is sort of worth watching. Not the best film ever made, but it is a laugh at times and will hopefully propel Dane Cook into greater things.",Good Luck Chuck

The surrounding plot, such as it is, is simple: A guy who was ""hexed"" in his childhood after a misbegotten game of spin-the-bottle to never love a woman finds the love of his life, a dippy, klutzy Penguin trainer named Cam (Alba). The upshot of this hex is that he ends up--supposedly--being a good luck charm. Women who sleep with him immediately find the love of their lives after him and get married.Cut to literally a hundred predictable mini sex scenes on split screens with Dane getting down with hot chicks who only want him briefly for his... uh... parts. Living in the Tom Leykis dream fantasy world--surprise!--leaves him empty and unfulfilled. He goes back to try to build his relationship with Cam, who at first put him off.This is the unfortunate flipside to what might have otherwise been an amenable romantic comedy: Loads of T&A (save Alba, who had a good contract so we only get a brief shot of her in her undies) coupled with a ton of truly crass scenes, mostly courtesy of his utterly disgusting buddy, a chubby plastic surgeon who, appropriately, treats women like pieces of meat but rarely actually scores. Why anyone would be a friend to someone whose mouth is constantly spewing a freight train of misogynistic vomit is beyond me.There are too many others crass scenes to mention but at least two of them involve fat chicks, including one continent-sized monstrosity with open sores. If this is what passes for comedy, I'll, well, pass.For this and many other groan-inducing reasons, it's impossible to recommend this movie to anyone with an IQ above 50. And that's an insult to retarded people.To his credit, Cook parlays his personal charisma into a believable and pretty funny on-screen character. Alba is improving as an actress and actually pulls off the physical comedy very well. And I liked her pot-smoking brother who lapses occasionally into philosophical brilliance.None of this, however, saves this movie from the sewer, where it prefers to dwell. Save your $8-$12 and let this unfortunate waste of celluloid be reconciled to the obscurity where it belongs.And please note--I saw several small and teenage children in the theater. I think far too many were sold on the trailer which spins it as an innocuous rom com and dismissed its ""R"" rating. Don't be fooled and don't you dare let your kids into this movie.",Good Luck Chuck
57,jaroddfinch,A pretty funny Dane cook movie,6,15 August 2021,I seen this movie twice and it's pretty funny Dane cook is pretty funny I like him a lot I seen some of his stand up and it's pretty funny. And his movies are funny too. Jessica Alba is really hot and she a great actress so if you like Dane cook you will like this movie .,Good Luck Chuck
58,simplysoda_19f,Dane is hilarious...,6,9 May 2008,"K, guys, I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this movie, and like, what's up with that? Personally, this wasn't my favorite Dane Cook movie, but it wasn't the worst, I really liked him in this movie. My brother has Dane Cook's CD and I heard it, and I was like....this guy is kinda offensive...but funny, in a way. However on the screen Dane comes out looking good. I'm not going to spoil the movie for ya, but I will tell you it's great.A lot of women didn't like Dane Cook, and I don't know why, I saw him in a magazine and I was like...this guy is kinda cute. My husband he disagrees obviously, but he likes Dane Cook now, and he says he's a pretty funny guy.I'm not a huge fan of Jessica Alba, but I liked her in the Fantastic Four movies and thought she did a really good job, but could she do a chick flick, duh.I liked the connection between the two actors, you can really feel it as an audience member and it made you believe that they could actually be in a relationship that works. I got to tell ya, the whole curse thing, that would creep me out, but I guess Dane's character is alright with that, is it a chick thing? 6/10",Good Luck Chuck
59,keyope,Some laughs but an unfunny plot,5,1 April 2019,"On paper this must have looked like a good comedy. It sounded okay when I read about it, but overall it doesn't work very well. It's a shame because Jessica Alba in particular shows great comedic skill. Many of the highlights of this film involve Alba smashing her face into lampposts or metal signs. Her physical comedy is probably the best thing in this, and provided most of the laughs. Dane Cook is lumbered with the daft plot, which others have gone into in depth. Unfortunately, because Cook is in impeccable physical shape he's kind of wrong for the part. It would have been better in the hands of someone like Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler, but then, it would also be less believable if either of them hooked up with Jessica Alba. Cook's buddy sidekick gets to make a few good jokes, but Cook himself doesn't really get many funny lines. He's relying entirely on his likeability (which depends on whether you like him or not). But it's hard to believe that he would pass up the chance to sleep with Jessica Alba because he's worried about a curse that would make her marry someone else.Overall, the film starts off okay with a few good laughs and a very funny wedding reception. But after about half an hour the jokes dry up almost entirely. The obly laughs in the last hour come from the occasional moments of physical comedy from Alba, but she's not in it enough unfortunately.",Good Luck Chuck

Not that I would know about this , you know.I do have to say I didn't care much for the fart and crap jokes in the movie.And yes his friend was a bit annoying with his obsession for women with big breasts.What it really boils down to is this. You can meaningless sex which is empty and shallow. But when you find the right one it touches you in such a way that your focus is there. Sometimes it can be a bit scary to the other person. So you pull back and give them breathing space.Oh and the bevy of beauties marching through the film was awesome.

63,Listen_to_the_Law,Fun sex Comedy,7,1 October 2007,"Good Luck Chuck (GLC) is certainly one of the more low-brow movies of the season. On paper, GLC seems to have most things going in it's favor: it stars stand-up comedian Dane Cook and the very attractive Jessica Alba. GLC by all means is not a poor movie; I just feel like, with some better writing, the movie could've had more sophisticated laughs. GLC was good for what it was-- a raunchy sex comedy with laughs sprinkled here and there.The plot of GLC is intriguing yet simple: women find their true love once they sleep with Chuck (played oddly well by Cook). When women find out about this ""curse/charm"", they try to hook up with him, have sex, and then leave. It's a loose-win-win-loose. Or something like that. When Chuck meets a girl named Cam (Alba) at a wedding, he realizes that he loves herso much, in fact, that he wants to sleep with her. (And who wouldn't?) Problem- if Chuck sleeps with Cam, he will loose her forever.GLC does a good job of going about how to end the curse. The best (and perhaps most vile) way Chuck tries to reverse the curse is by sleeping with a acne-filled 600 pound woman. She eats garbage bags stuffed with donut holes and eats lobster legs faster than any human could. This woman's facial expressions while Chuck and her are eating are quite humorousand disturbing. The sex scene? Let's just forget about thatit's beyond gross, even though it doesn't show much. If it were more revealing, the movie would be rated NC-17.I enjoyed GLC. Sure, director Mark Helfrich is a poor man's Tom Shadyac, and Cook is a poor man's Jim Carrey. But in all honesty, nearly every comedian comes up short when compared to Carrey. Dane Cook is a good actor. Sure, at times he comes off as stale, but he has clever facial expressions and made the most of the script here. Reviews are not going to help GLC (eyeball the 19/100 on metacritic.com and that awful 3/100 on rottentomatoes.com). Do yourself a favor and ignore the critics (once again) and watch GLC. It's silly, perverted fun.Good) some good laughs, surprisingly disgusting Bad) surprisingly disgusting, not all that deep",Good Luck Chuck
64,hellokristen,"Better luck next time, Dane",5,13 September 2007,"A very uneven comedy. If 3 out of every 10 jokes working is enough for you, then go ahead.If you're hoping to see Dane Cook (nearly) undressed, you won't be disappointed. He strips more in this movie than Demi Moore in ""Striptease"".If you're hoping to see Jessica Alba undressed -- too bad! Scanty attire is the best you'll get.If you're hoping to see Dane be as funny as he is in his stand-up -- you'll be disappointed.If you're hoping to see Jessica be funny -- what are you, nuts? She's got no comedy chops! And that old tired ""pretty girl falls down a lot"" shtick wasn't funny when it became a movie cliché about 5 years ago.The only funny moments seem to be when Dane is improvising. When he's doing the written parts of the script, it clunks hard. (Him dressed in a penguin costume? Yikes.) The two leads try SO hard to show us they have chemistry (a lot of shoulder wiggling and cutesy facial expressions mostly) that it backfires.There were a lot of gross-out moments that just weren't funny -- the fat sidekick scrubbing his backflap with a scrub-brush for sexual pleasure, a penguin eating his crap, two seduction scenes with obese women (straight out of ""Norbit"" -- also unfunny).The sidekick is so foul and obnoxious he throws the movie completely off-balance. You feel like the movie needs a sorbet after one of his scenes to get the bad taste out of your mouth.The only likable person was the guy playing Jessica's brother (Lonny Ross of ""30 Rock""). I actually think he might have made a better romantic lead, than Dane -- who was somehow off-putting.Maybe Dane will have more input into his next comedy movie. Maybe that will help.",Good Luck Chuck
65,The_Matrix_Rocks,Dane Cook Returns To Form,4,25 November 2008,"If FHM magazine were ever made into a movie, then ""Good Luck Chuck"" would be it. It's pure ladsy fun with plenty of eye candy and testosterone-fueled humour.In what is surely an unintentional homage to Steve Martin's brilliantly manic dentist-with-issues character from ""Little Shop Of Horrors"", Dane Cook also portrays a dentist with a curse that, although different from Steve Martin's, makes falling in love equally problematic.He meets excessively-penguin-loving Jessica Alba, which kick starts an hilarity-filled set-up towards an eco-friendly ""if you love something set it free""-type crescendo.Cook has much more scope in this film to do his signature ""Dane Cook"" thing than he had in the previous, more restrictive ""Employee of the Month"". And for the most part it works well, especially with the able support of Dan Folger as his obligatory sex-obsessed colleague/buddy/side-kick.And staying true to the FHM theme, invoked earlier, I'll conclude with some remarks about an ironic reflection of the movie's title: poor Dane must surely be cursing his own frustratingly bad luck after doing this movie. Remember that in ""Employee of the Month"", he got nowhere near pneumatic leading lady Jessica Simpson's... umm... ""fun bags"" (especially ironic, considering how hard they were to miss in that movie).Things get worse in ""Good Luck Chuck"", because despite getting to share ample screen time with lots of boobies (especially in one montage that's sure to be one of the year's top downloads), he fails yet again to get to celluloid second base with an even hotter Jessica (Alba, this time).And as if that wasn't enough of a kick in the nuts, the outtakes reel shows Folger relishing some fortuitous naked-Alba action.So, assuming Dane is now cursed with similar bad luck as the titular Chuck, then any future role opposite supremely-hot Jessica Biel will surely complete the unfortunate Mr. Cook's tragic trifecta of missed ""opportuni-titties"".",Good Luck Chuck

And the fact that frat boys' all across the U.S. mimic him makes his whole persona even more unbearable.Unfortunately, I was proved wrong when in walked Jessica Alba as Cook's love interest. I think her terrible acting gave me diarrhea. With her caked-on silver eye-liner and her orange-tinted fake tan, she was also pretty hard to look at.None of the jokes were very funny. While the idea for the plot was somewhat interesting, the movie was actually very predictable. The only thing I can't figure out is why anybody would find Dane Cook charming.They also try to make up for the awefulness of the movie by showing a lot of nudity - which is fine... but, unfortunately, hot, naked women can't make a bad movie good.If you're a big fan of Cook, go see this movie - you will probably like it.

72,Jothos,OMG they ruined this flick mid-movie!!!,3,21 April 2009,"(semi-spoilers) OMG, you ever watch a movie that isn't that bad, then halfway through, for NO reason, they throw some insane RETARDED plot twist in in the middle? This movie is the epidemy of that. OK, so he is hexed, in that every girl he sleeps with will find their soul mate in the next guy they date. So he meets Jessica Alba's character, and falls for her. and he doesn't really believe in the hex, and they get along great, and end up sleeping together. Then his fat friend gives him all this info on how the hex is true, and they put it to the test with a humongous blob chick, and it turns out to be true, cuz she finds her true love. The movie is OK...up to this point. Chuck then is sooo afraid she is gonna fall for the next guy she meets, that he COMPLETALY goes insane, and smothers her SOOO far beyond belief that it's not even funny. it is so amazingly annoying the things he does while trying to hold onto her. Not funny annoying. just plain annoying. We're expected to believe that he really believes buying her thousands of dollars of flowers, hiring a barbershop quartet to sing to her, decorating her car with a big ribbon and a ""almost married"" sign is going to keep her from leaving? When ALL he had to do was explain what he was afraid of (losing her to the curse) instead of going annoyingly ape s*it. Another cliché example of a movie going into the ""completaly far-fetched"" category, when it could have been avoided by just telling the truth. And if anyone is saying ""if he told the truth, there would have been no where else to go with the story"", you're dumb. there are literally 187,234,655 better way this story could have gone than what they went with.

Her gesture, facial expressions, and dialogue supply are so good. When she talks as looks she normally communicates with a person not doing any acting. Acting is just naturally come out. I am impressed with her acting. Whatever is the role is she maintains a good versatile view for the audience.If we talk about this movie it's an 18+ movie. Romantic but some bad seen have it. If we forgot the bad scene in this movie this movie is so good. Exceptional love story. If you view this movie in our culture it's not a good movie. But in eastern countries, it's so much a good love story. Many critics say that this movie is good in its new thoughts and idea. But always love looks like this movie. When really a boy fall in love truly he forget all things. He started a new life with this girl. What he did in the past but he dreams future with the girl whom he loves. Boys don't know when they fall in love? If anyone falls in love his life full change in one thing that if I am alive I will be your soul mate.

Yes, there's a time for sex. After all, God invented sex. But what irks me about this movie is that they had to include a nude sex scene with a large cross on the wall in the background. The female character in the sex scene has a naked religious argument with the protagonist, a spiritual conversion, and then sits on a park bench reading a book entitled ""Jesus."" She then falls in love with the new guy who sits next to her who happens to read a book entitled, ""Christ."" She then decides to marry him instead. ""Sacrilege"" is the profanation of something held sacred. ""Blasphemy"" cranks the profanity up a notch. For the genre of soft core porn, the budget and production values for the film are very high. I guess that someone who wanted to take a shot at Jesus decided to do it with big bucks and give it the illusion of class. Classy A-list actress Jessica Alba is wasted in this soft core porn romantic comedy sendup. I hope to see her in future productions that have better taste.",Good Luck Chuck

He is actually the lucky charm, the public service :) I think Dane Cook is an excellent actor. I saw him first at Ryan Reynolds' movie called ""Waiting"" and this film blew me away with its jokes, humor and the Game. Dane played one of the chefs in the kitchen. He was an idiot, an provocative asshole but we loved him anyway. Next, he was in the movie called ""Employee of the month"" and that movie was good but not excellent. The most important thing - it was the first lead role for Dane.Now this movie is his best comedy so far. I really liked watching him with his humor, and his human personality which he represented in Good luck Chuck.Jessica Alba is the most beautiful girl on the planet.

The lead stars she is gorgeous and he is cool.It's the writers they went a little overboard with the sexual plot of this movie it seemed offensive to a lot of straight good people but you can see why it was there for the plot sort of... If the movie would've been a little more discreet it would not take away of here it comes the best part. The comedy was phenomenal and the casting perfect the chemistry perfect I'm talking a smash hit. So funny at times you will fall on the floor and the romance you can't help but fall in love with the characters it's amazing.so the movie is kind of offensive and fantastic at the same time but overall the movie will leave you with a good feeling lots of laughs and you're going to enjoy the good parts and there is enough of it to make this movie worth the watch if you can get past some of the lowbrow stuff the writer put in. I know I've never seen a movie where it had such contrast but the parts I loved I really loved and somehow it made up for the bad in this movie. I gave it a 7 but that's because I fell in love with the chemistry that was in this movie it was really fun. So I'm not so much looking at the bad kind of well you know...

84,nik963,Horrifically Bad,1,23 January 2008,"I approached this film with an open mind. The reviews had been bad but I films of this genre generally do. Besides any movie with Jessica Alba is worth a try in my opinion!The concept is good enough and should form a strong comedic element but I laughed about once throughout the movie. I don't know if it's just me but I found the opening kind of wrong and uncomfortable. The kids looked about 10 or 11 and the goth girl asks Charlie to show her his penis! She then forces herself onto him and curses him thus setting up the movie. I just found it unlikely that an 11 year old girl would act or talk in that way. Despite this weird opening I was still confident it could be a decent movie. I was wrong. Problem? Dane Cook. I saw Employee of the Month (pretty poor but not as bas as this) and Dan In Real Life (good apart from Cook) and found Cook to be intensely irritating. If you think Ben Stiller is annoying with his constant 'I'm a good guy who's unlucky in love' then you should see Dane Cook. He can't act, he isn't funny and his gormless expression which is intended to show emotion just grates after awhile. So basically every girl who is with him then goes onto meet Mr Right after they split up with him. Predictability ensues and his thoroughly unlikable friend makes the film drag with few jokes capable of raising a laugh. The shame here is that Alba is sweet and the scenes around the penguins are amusing with her brother and her clumsiness raising this film to acceptable. Also the scenes with Alba and Cook before they date are funny with Alba's incredible bad luck with accidents. This is where the film peaks however, it then steadily declines into absolute trash. It is impossible to care for the relationship. All I was thinking was that Alba should get a new agent because this is atrocious. Cook takes the movie to absurd levels with an over the top display of love in which he seems to become more of a stalker than admirer. I doubt that many of you will last long through this movie. Believe me the ending isn't worth waiting for. And a warning to you all is do not stay for the credits. I was greeted by the most disgusting and distasteful image that you'll see. Good Luck Chuck is basically a rom-com with a nastiness to it. It's like the makers were trying to make a trashy sex comedy with a heart. They failed. This movie would have been far more successful had it cut out all the lewdness and Dane Cook! I don't mind a sex comedy which has outright lewdness and isn't trying to give it any heart. American Pie presents Beta House for instance is pointless but fun because it is meant to disgust and amuse in equal measure. It doesn't have a story and you don't care about the characters, but at least it's not trying. With Good Luck Chuck you feel as though they were trying and this is the biggest tragedy of all.",Good Luck Chuck
85,jaredlallatin,My wife and walked out.,1,23 September 2007,"This movie was unbearable! It not that it didn't have it's funny parts in the first third of the movie that we saw, it just was so overboard with all the offensive sex and crudeness. The parts that were funny were all classical physical humor scenes, and we laughed at those scenes. It's just that we felt bombarded by the sex and nudity. A final note: Hollywood's apparent obsession with naked guy's bare rears is pissing me off. I've seen The Wedding Crashers and The 40 Year Old Virgin, both of which could have been just as funny with out the crass scenes. I know that some people say that these lewd scenes are what define these films, but in my opinion the good old comedy that has been in films from the days of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin is what makes these films work. Cut out most of the gratuitous sex and over the top raunchiness and these films would be just as funny. Good Luck Chuck was a shame of a film. It could have been funny just building on the plot lines of Alba's character was a sweet but clumsy girl and Cook's character was a guy who was always the last relationship for lots of girls just before they meet Mr. Right. He should of been a guy that had an actually relationship with these girls but instead they made it all about sex as if that was what constituted a relationship. After the second sex montage we couldn't take any more of the filth and walked out.",Good Luck Chuck

Or your favourite Aunt/ Uncle/ Lesbian Godparent.Not unless you *like* awkward silences.On the other hand, I watched it alone, and laughed myself silly. And was touched by the love stories, for they are plural. And, no, did *not* 'touch myself'. Not that kind of movie.The crucial thing about it is, it's not a plot I've seen before, although if an anorak insists the same film was made in 1948 with James Cagney & his sister playing Jessica Alba & her brother - well, I'd believe it. A lot of weird stuff was made that year... And I have known a couple of real-life 'catalysts', so it's nice to see the notion get recognition.Some people only like to see the stuff they've seen a thousand times already - me, I hope I never get *that* old.I'd watch this as a triple bill with Happy Feet & The Thing - this would be the sandwich filler.

89,Kiryl_verenich,Exciting and funny,9,19 August 2010,"I think it's a light-erotic comedy addressed to young guys who don't understand that love is not just in the pants. The rising plot is quite exciting and comes to culmination right in the end of the movie. Short erotic insertions are making you watch as if it were a scandal video. Both Dane and Jessica do quite persuasively in this movie. Jessica didn't reincarnate. Sometimes you even mix down the scenes from this movie with '""Dark Angel""' (qv). But anyway she's very funny. 'Dan Fogler' (qv) created another vivid and amusing character. He plays Dane's character best friend. In some sense he is an alter-ego.

90,RussyPelican,The Worst Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,1,2 October 2007,"I went to Good Luck Chuck with the lowest of expectations. I knew that Dane Cook would be in it, so how good could it possibly be? I only went because I had a small window of time in which to see a movie, and GLC was the only movie that fit. Even so, it was far worse than I had anticipated, and my time would have been better spent Googling ""Jessica Alba"".The movie begins with a scene that is borderline child pornography and involves a preteen girl tearing off her shirt and demanding sex from the preteen version of the eponymous Chuck. He denies her, and she curses him to be always a groomsman but never the groom.After that we are subjected to annoying characters and unfunny jokes. Cook is irritating. Alba is beautiful and winning but not very funny. And Dan Fulger, who plays the best friend, made me cringe time and time again with his terrible delivery of terrible lines.A small bright spot is brought by 30 Rock's Lonny Ross, who plays Alba's stoner brother and manages to milk a chuckle or two from an awful script. And as long as you have Alba to look at things can't be all bad . . . but other than that this film is atrocious.",Good Luck Chuck
91,ValleyOfScarletFever,Made of Retard,2,1 August 2009,"My Mom and I watched this movie after watching an other romantic comedy, ""The Breakup."" I didn't really want to watch ""Good Luck Chuck"" after hearing how terrible it was, but there was nothing else on TV and my Mom was bored and it didn't cost any money so we figured, ""Why not?"" It was a terrible mistake. Very. Terrible.First problem; who is this movie marketed to, anyway? You'd think it was marketed to women (because it's a romantic comedy), but you'd be wrong. There are more topless women in this movie than in any porno ever made, and I don't even need to see a porno to know that. So, why would women want to watch a man have sex with various topless women? So maybe it's marketed to lesbians. Again, it can't be. There are so many homophobic and fat-phobic jokes that I can't even count. (Okay, probably about seven.) So maybe you're thinking, ""So it's a guy movie, like Wedding Crashers."" Wrong again. First off, Wedding Crashers, although not perfect, was a funny and entertaining movie. This however, is not. Although there is some ""dude humor"", there are also many juvenile slapstick jokes. Can it be marketed to teenagers? No, because it's rated-R. So who is this movie trying to reach to?! Retarded older men? Then comes the actual writing and movie- well, guess what folks, it's terrible. There is no cliché that isn't used; The Sassy Black Woman, The Annoying Womanizer Best Friend, The Perfect Yet Imperfect Woman, The Guy Stud That Rivals The Main Man, The Crazy-In-Love Main Man, etc. Not to mention any woman that isn't perfectly skinny and photo-shopped is automatically a scary fat woman. Almost without fail, my Mom and I could predict the entire movie's plot and exactly what would happen. And we were nearly always correct. Besides not guessing the stuffed penguin sex-scene at the end (which was disgusting and strange, by the way, if not slightly funny) almost everything went the way we thought it would. Dane Cook's creepy stalking of Jessica Alba's character in real life would automatically turn a real woman off and get a restraining order, but of course because this is Hollywood they (SPOILERS) get together at the end. Shocking, isn't it? And now the acting. Well, Jessica Alba is flat as always. The kids in the beginning are okay, if not over the top. And of course Dane Cook plays- well, himself. I guess the acting is over the top, but that might be the director's fault, so I don't know.One more complaint; the colors in this movie were incredibly bright. Everything was brighter than life and very hard to watch.Honestly, I shouldn't have to put a spoilers tag seeing you can predict this movie just by the trailer, but I must for those who might actually care. Don't waste your time on this movie; go out and watch a more decent romantic comedy, like ""Music and Lyrics"" or ""Wedding Crashers"", something that is actually romantic and funny.",Good Luck Chuck
92,FlippanTadpole,Here's how I woulda done it,3,13 October 2007,"What I liked: 1) Dane Cook and Jessica Alba. Conner Price (young Chuck) - I totally recognized him, but couldn't remember where so I looked here and vwala! He plays the kid on the Dead Zone, one of my favorite shows :). 2) Clumsy-ness of Cam, humor. 3) Penguins.What I didn't like: 1) Sex scenes. 2) Obsessiveness at the end. 3) Cheesy ending.There were a lot of funny parts and great one liners, but the movie as a whole wasn't that great. Take out the sex scenes because you know what, not everyone thinks that way. Take out the obsessiveness towards the end, that was terrible. The cheesy ending where they end up together and the plane scene? Come on. Have them not end up together! Or kill one of them off. The movie was funny, though, I'll give you that.",Good Luck Chuck
93,debums,"Maybe 30% to 35% ""GOOD"" content",3,9 October 2007,"When I saw this movie, I gave it a 3 to 4 rating in my mind. However, I was just discussing it with a friend who went with me and my rating of it is dropping, so I thought I better go ahead and comment on it before it gets to ZERO. The ""R"" rating was too generous. The only thing that keeps it from being X rated is that no actual genitals are shown (although the beach scene gets close).*** 30% to 35% GOOD PARTS: It had funny parts (Cam's clumsiness, especially) and touching parts (how Charlie was with Cam). As the relationship between Charlie and Cam progressed, she got less clumsy, so the ""good"" diminished significantly as the movie went along. The penguins were cute and I liked Cam's brother's scenes. *** 65% to 70% BAD PARTS: It reached critical burn out for me about half way through with the same physical type jokes (sexual). OFFENSIVE MATERIAL - PARTIAL LIST IN ORDER FROM MOST TO LEAST OFFENSIVE:STU CHARACTER: I realized that I was bored with him about half way through the movie, and grew to detest him about 15 minutes after that. He was highly shallow and crude. Very sexist and hypocritical. He was an awful friend, and did not render endearment as I think the writers intended. Not that it matters, but I can't really see him having many clients in real life with his crude perspective and total lack of respect for women and the female body.FAT JOKES: Hate 'em. I do not find it humorous to use people's physical weaknesses to garner laughs. Not a big fan of short, tall or handicapped person jokes, either (no short, tall, or handicapped jokes in this movie that I recall).CASUAL SEX: This movie went way beyond casual sex and presented it as a community service..... yeah. I think had Charlie been getting paid for it, it would have made a little more sense with the plot and theme of the movie. I guess since he WASN'T getting paid for it, it was supposed to make him seem compassionate and caring.... Sorry, but that was just too much of a moral conflict for me.BREASTS: I'd be interested to know how many breasts were on the screen per minute. STU's office ""art"" got incredibly tiring. I guess they ran out of prop money to spend on sets because they just spent so much time in his office with his ""art"" and visual aids - or whatever that was supposed to be.**************** IN SUMMARY: *************** I guess if you like the things I list as offensive, then this movie may be worth the price and trip for you, and you may find it hysterical. I just wish I hadn't seen most of it at this point. I'm still trying to get most of the images out of my mind. I think had it been the 30% to 35% ""GOOD"" material in about half the time frame, I'd have liked it (maybe a 5 or 6 rating. Not too high because even the good stuff was mostly predictable). I like Jessica Alba and I like Dane Cook and they did what they could with the roles. It may be a while before I'm able to eat another grapefruit without flashbacks - used like the APPLE PIE was in American Pie (which I didn't want to see, either).",Good Luck Chuck
94,d_man1890,If you're looking for comedy look elsewhere,4,16 December 2013,"This raunchy sex comedy seems to have all the right ingredients: An interesting premise, Chuck was cursed to be the last guy a girl will sleep with before meeting her soul mate what leads to him becoming very popular with the ladies, but what happens when he meets the girl of his dreams and is scared of losing her? A solid leading cast, Dane Cook and Jessica Alba who looks hot as always. And an R rating that has a lot of female nudity and even Dane's cheek shots. What this movie lacks is direction, the talented cast is wasted with a half baked script that goes all over the place, relying on too many clichés while completely forgetting about character development or a coherent plot. The supporting cast is a one dimensional joke, Chuck's friend is a perv with a boob fetish, Cam's (Alba's character) brother is a stoner and that's about all you can say about them, seriously. What's so bad about this movie is that it could have been so much better with a polished script and a more competent director. In the end I'd say it's a waste of time and unless you're looking to see Jessica Alba in underwear, don't bother with this one. **** of of 10",Good Luck Chuck
95,narrowfilm,one of the worst movies i've ever seen,1,19 September 2007,"first off, i don't understand why or how dane cook became so successful. there is nothing funny about him. he doesn't tell jokes - he relates ""stories"" with very animated facial and physical gestures. and, often, looks like a monkey. dan fogler, too, is quite possibly the most annoying human being on the planet... especially his character in this movie. he is a disgusting, misogynistic pig. i would love for lionsgate to make ""hostel III"" starring dane cook and dan fogler - that would be a movie i would pay to see twice. now, on to the movie itself: the concept is ludicrous and makes absolutely no sense. seriously, this film must have been written by and made for people with nonexistent IQ's... because anybody that can tie their own shoes would realize how absurd this movie is and would never plunk down $10 for this piece of cinematic tripe. to even suggest that hundreds of beautiful women could never find a decent man on their own, and would have to resort to sleeping with a d-bag like dane cook to find a husband, is an offense to women everywhere. this movie is so incredibly misogynistic... where women are depicted as clueless, desperate pieces of ""t+a""... that even i, a man and non-feminist, was offended by it. and we're supposed to like this schmuck because he agrees to sleep with his overweight secretary out of the goodness of his heart and says, ""i'll only think of you (when we have sex)."" please. please, please, please, if there is any justice in the world this movie will make $2 at the box office and garbage like this will STOP BEING MADE! this movie is not funny - it is an insult to anyone with a brain or a heart. just see ""knocked up"" or ""superbad"" instead, to see how to actually make a comedy that is both hilarious and heartfelt.",Good Luck Chuck
96,pretty_inpink19,"A Silly, Raunchy Romantic Comedy",7,26 January 2013,"I first saw Good Luck Chuck in 2008 and found it to be a stupid, yet somewhat funny romantic movie , most comedies rely on sex scenes, dirty jokes and charm to make it work.Dane Cook's performance as Charlie Logan an unlucky in love dentist was comical here he was in one relationship after another with the woman moving on to finding her true love after having intercourse with him. Jessica Alba as Cook's love interest Cam is charming and adorable, her character is a clumsy yet beautiful woman who wants a committed boyfriend and not a one night stand type of love. Dan Fogler also steals the screen as Chuck's sex starved boob doctor friend Stu Klaminski who encourages his buddy to except his gift to service women.At a birthday party in 1985 10 year old Charlie Logan (Price) refused to make out with with a Gothic girl named Annisha (Pieterse) during a game of seven minutes in heaven. As punishment she places a curse on him stating that he'll never be happy and that all his girlfriends will marry the next guy they meet.Years later Chuck (Cook) who is now 32 runs a successful dental practice in the same building as his buddy Stu's (Fogler) breast surgery business. After his latest girlfriend Carol dumps him he begins to notice that women have gone on to marry another man after being with him, at the wedding of one of his ex girlfriends he meets Cam Wexler (Alba) a clumsy yet attractive aquarium employee who loves penguins. From then on it's a hilarious quest as Charlie does anything he can to get the woman of his dreams and break the curse that made him a hit with girls.For fans of raunchy & romantic fun I recommend Good Luck Chuck it's hysterical on a scale of 7 to 10",Good Luck Chuck
97,mikal9300,"Comedy, Alba and Boobs ""Oh My""!",6,18 October 2007,"GOOD LUCK CHUCKGood Luck Chuck is at it's base your typical guy meets girl, guy falls in love with girl, guy messes it up and girl gets mad, guy has to try and win girl back film. But it is funny.The basis of the film and the belief of the main character Charlie Logan (Dane Cook) is absurd. Charlie believes that as a result of him sleeping with a girl, the girl then finds true love and gets married to the next man she meets. Hey it's a comedy and this is Hollywood so it serves it's purpose. The problem arises however when Charlie meets the cute and clumsy Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba). Cam has her guard up at first but lets it down to Charlie and the two have a good old time that is until Charlie can not help himself from sleeping with Cam- and who could. After sleeping with Cam, Charlie is afraid he will lose her so he goes balls to the wall (stalker style) in order to show his love and affection for Cam. This in turn pushes her away and we then have the protagonists struggle to win the girl back.This is an overall good comedy with funny parts throughout although it does suffer in certain areas. Alba is a feast for the eyes, especially in her underwear and her acting helps hold together the very poor performance of Cook, who's performance should have changed the name of the movie to ""Good Luck Dane"" for his likelihood of ever getting an acting gig again. But again, this is a comedy so we aren't excepting an Oscar dance from him. Alba's clumsiness at times gets a bit much and overdone however it doesn't quite get to the point of annoying. The standout in this movie other than the adorableness of Jessica Alba is that of Stu (Dan Fogler). He out shines Cook's performance both comedically and acting wise, which will surely land him in many more buddy comedies. I would definitely recommend this movie for a good laugh, Jessica Alba and how could I ever forget the barrage of boob shots (unfortunately none of which are Alba's). My overall score considering this is a comedy is 6 out of 10.",Good Luck Chuck

Good Luck Chuck has more in common with many of the ridiculously bad 80's comedies than more contemporary films.The jokes are stale and lame. Dane Cook and Jessica Alba have about as magic on screen as an ass full of colon cancer. They make Jim Varney/Ernest P. Worrell seem like Patton Oswald in comparison.In summary...there's fun, low brow humor and there's lousy film making...Good Luck Chuck is the yawn inducing result of the latter.

104,cdemw,Unchallenging & Uninspired Comedy,5,19 November 2007,"Let's be honest, with 'Good Luck Chuck' I wasn't expecting a high-brow comedy with a cutting critique on society. At the same time, I was expecting slightly more than just rude words and nudity. I was disappointed.The starting sequence with young Chuck is amusing enough, the humour being in small children not understanding adult terminology - we've all been there - and setting up the plot of Chuck as someone unable to find love. As an adult, however, Chuck isn't particularly likable or dislikeable which is a slight problem: Dane Cook's character doesn't invoke any strong feelings either way.Jessica Alba, as Cam, is undeniably beautiful and at least half of the ticket sales to this movie will be young men hoping to get a glimpse of her naked, or at least in her skimpies. Her comedy acting was adequate although the impression I got was that she was put in the film solely as eye-candy.My main problem, however, is that this film isn't disgusting enough to be a gross-out comedy, it's not clever enough to rely on its dialogue and it's not fast-paced enough to be carried by the physical humour. It seems that the producers thought they'd get away with this film by putting more breasts in this than a KFC Family Bucket, and unless you're a 14 year old boy that's not really going to cut the mustard.In the guise of a saviour and curse of the film is Dan Fogler as Stu as the comic relief. Whenever the dialogue might come close to meaningful he comes out with an obscure and filthy euphemism, which at first is funny but then weighs him down (in this film) as a one-trick pony.Ultimately, don't go to see 'Good Luck Chuck' with high expectations, they're not going to be met. Take it as it is, don't question anything and you might just enjoy it - bubble-gum for the eyes. And if anything justifies it's existence, the scene over the closing credits was the only thing that had me laughing uncontrollably.

108,Matt_Hecht,Not So Good Luck,2,20 February 2008,"Spoilers abound. Good Luck Chuck was probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I used to think Dane Cook was funny, but his latest film just hit the wrong chords with me. The film is about Chuck (Cook) who is cursed as a boy to get with a woman, only to have her leave him and find her soul mate next. The basic premise is Chuck scoring with women, while his vile friend, the plastic surgeon, plays the annoyingly clichéd fat friend who talks sex all the time but never gets any. Basically a more annoying version of the fat kid from Superbad. The sex scenes went on for way too long, to the point where it felt like they were just trying to take up time by saying, ""oh look, now Dane is banging this hot girl in this position, oh wait, now in THIS position!"" Chuck finally finds a girl he likes, but she knows about all the women sleeping with him to find their soul mate (it gets posted online, so only hot women, not normal women, try to get with him). To balance the fact that he sleeps with mostly supermodels, he sleeps with not one, but two overweight women. This takes place while is is interested in/talking to the girl he is really interested in. As a viewer with some degree of morals, the movie made it seem okay to have sex with someone even though you might love someone else. I was kind of revolted by this, and felt as if Chuck didn't deserve to be happy. Chuck, in fear of losing Jessica Alba's character, acts crazy, smothering her and driving her away. In the end, go figure, he gets the girl, so according to Hollywood you can be a jerk and still get the girl. Another thing that bothered me about the movie was the ad campaign. It was sold as more of a romantic comedy, with Alba's character being real clumsy. These were the best parts of the film, but I felt as if the trailer misrepresented the tone of the movie. If you're thinking romantic comedy, it's the opposite. More like a trashier version of Something About Mary, but not as funny. Very disappointing (to me), and had the potential to be a much funnier and more endearing movie.2/10",Good Luck Chuck

111,aquanorth,Absolutely Awful!,1,27 December 2007,"This is the worst movie of 2007. The premise was so completely overdone that after 15 minutes into the movie I was completely bored with the idea. After 30 minutes I convinced myself to keep watching to see if it would get better or worse (out of morbid curiosity). After 35 minutes I had to turn it off. For a romantic comedy I thought the basic premise sounded pretty funny and I used to like Jessica Alba. But the problem with this movie is that it is a one liner- the guy who is a lucky charm for women to meet their match after dating Chuck. A lot of movies are one liners but what makes this one terrible is that has no depth. It simple reiterates the premise over and over again until the viewer is losing their will to live or at least keep their eyes open. This is the most superficial, irritating, simple minded, and poorly acted/written movies I have ever seen. I wish Jessica Alba wouldn't have gotten involved in this project. I thought she had more potential yet she is taking terrible roles and doesn't have enough talent to pull movies like this one out of trash bin (few actresses would). The way the script makes her constantly trip all over everything is another excruciating aspect of this film. Do not waste your time.",Good Luck Chuck

In Guantanamo they use this film!,1,27 October 2007,"The thing is I like shitty films, I like films with tits, I like some bad humor, but i definitely did not like this film. Poor acting, crappy dialogue and shitty jokes, which i think my 4 year old nephew from Alabama could not even laugh about. Where the main character is a dentist it reminded me of my next dental appointment which i will find less excruciating than this flick. The storyline as the Germans say is just pure scheisse! The film does contain some fine samples of quality breasts however i believe there is better porn with better acting and with funnier jokes on the market = more value for money = overall satisfied customer. Maybe it is time that we should start demanding more interesting and better executed comedies from Hollywood, till than the only thing left for me to do is to proclaim a holy war against heinous films like these!!!In conclusion i am not a happy camper!",Good Luck Chuck

Seriously, I didn't laugh one time during the movie. I watched it with my mom and this was more disturbing and embarrassing than anything I've ever seen.

Oh and a really fat chick that made me gag every time I looked at her. I can't believe anybody thought that was ""cute"". I think the movie made me gag more then the fat chick.

120,AdamHurrell1991,Why would Anyone make a film like this!?!,2,10 November 2007,"That is the last time I trust my friend to choose a film to go and see! I must be thankful I have a cinema pass because to think I may have actually paid full price to see this utter nonsense is unthinkable! The film is a complete travesty from start to finish. It must have got the Hollywood book of Rom-com clichés out and taken every single one out. At times (particulary near the end where the film really starts to grate) I actually was cringing at the appalling performances by the two leads and what they were saying. I was literally banging my head against the wall when I had predicted the next thing that was going to happen/be said for the 50th time in the film. A six year old could have written the script. It must have been written by someone who thought ""Uh-Oh! I cant write anything funny, so I'll just get the amazingly clichéd Jessica Alba to fall over, hit something or perform another act of sheer moronicness!"" The plot itself is useless and was probably dreamt up by some stoned college kids. The premise of a guy who has sex with a woman and then after, that woman finds the man of her dreams and gets married, is one of sheer stupidity. I know its not meant to be taken seriously but even so. I hope the latest strike by Hollywood writes brings an end to films like this ever being written, let alone considered by Film studios.As for characters, the two leads have zero chemistry. And come to that, zero acting ability as well.Dane Cook looks like a man who feels he is above the role comedic-wise, but as an actor, even in a film this bad, his performance is appalling.Jessica Alba is performing at her usual low standards. She is in this film to flaunt herself to the male audience and is merely a marketing tool in the film. It is quite simply pathetic that this had to be done for the film to sell itself. Also no good actress in her right mind would sign up for this.I think the most interesting thing while watching this film was turning around and looking at other peoples expressions. To my disgust people were enjoying the film and laughing at the most inane and childish things. This shows how the society in which we live in is one that clearly is overly influenced by over done marketing campaigns and useless, childish slapstick humour. For the planets sake please stop making these kind of films! So, in general, the film is too long, too clichéd, too moronic, too poorly made and too badly acted to be classed, in my opinion as a film that deserved to be made. I am genuinely disgusted that this film was actually created and then shown to the world because it caused me great pain to watch.But by all means if you like to see womens breasts a lot, shoddy performances, the usual high to low to high plot and people hurting themselves in almost every scene then by all means see this film. but, if you pay full price, then you are contributing to the downfall of movies. Also if you watch this film and enjoy it just think of what you were just laughing at and then look at yourself as a person. It will be a sad result.",Good Luck Chuck

I have the sort of morbid sense of humor that is needed to truly understand Dane Cook as an actor. I couldn't wait to see the hilarity of Dane Cook at work. I was deeply disappointed. The movie was very vulgar and didn't really have a plot. I thought that it would at least have some purpose. From the beginning to the end it was all about sex and that's not a movie that I want to watch. The scenes were way too graphic for the R rating and the acting sucked. It was truly not worth the 10$ I spent to see it and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to go see it. I wish that I could have walked away with something besides a few nice shots of Dane Cook's rear end. I guess as a comedian he rocks, but he's just not an actor. What a disappointment!

Grandma's boy was funnier than this. balls of fury was funnier.and they were both pretty bad. Gandhi was funnier. schindler's list was funnier. some other very heavy dramas have more laughs than this. these comments may actually be funnier than good luck schmuck(what i call it now) i am a lover of comedy. I have figured this out. Dane cook is not a comedian or an actor. he is a salesman/motivational speaker. can we get him this role? Jessica alba is pretending to be as dumb as Dane is naturally, and she can't even pull that off. i want to say something positive though- i am an actor but i think Dane cook has inspired me to do comedy. I used to be frightened of comedy. After watching this guy I think it's within my reach. i wonder how much dough was spent on this stuff. i will watch Dane cook straight to video or payperview. i would say that with this movie comedy has finally hit bottom, but I'm sure something will come along to replace it, probably the next Dane cook movie.",Good Luck Chuck

The plot behind it was pretty generic but I think the idea of Dane Cook having a curse that potentially allows him to get laid all the time is great, but what was good is that they show him in his ""prime"" so to speak, but then also show that he's finally found someone , as cheesy as it is, that he loves for once. With the constant misfortunes of his new found love, and his inability to act upon his feelings for fear of losing her, Good Luck Chuck does a good job at getting the message across while still making you laugh.

130,misunderstood_reine,A Degrading and Sexist Film,1,25 October 2008,"I am not a feminist, I'm normally very laid back with most content and humour in films but this movie Good Luck Chuck is an enormous insult to women.Starting with Jessica Alba's character who was the oh so typically clumsy, awkward, cutesy damsel in distress female lead. She had no appeal at all, offered no wit or substance to the character other than to smile sweetly, giggle and fall down - oh and of course, have her skirt accidentally ripped off.Worse still was the endless and unnecessary montages of women having sex with Dane Cook's character. Again here we witness the usual double standard of breasts and female ass fully exposed while the male reveals no more than his bare chest. The women are depicted as desperate, men-obsessed idiots who would actually believe having sex with this man will get them married.One scene in particular made me angry; when Dane Cook's secretary, like the other inane women characters in this movie, comes onto Dane Cook so she can sleep with him and thus be married. Stupidly, Dane Cook's character instantly switches from being freaked out to being loving, which of COURSE his secretary falls for immediately because she's a woman and is so easily convinced by pretty words.The men in this movie have the jokes and what little wit is in this movie while the women suffer the stereotypical and offensive image of easy, dumb and men-obsessed desperado's.I absolutely loathe this movie. It is a vile, festuring pustule on the face of cinema and I do not recommend it to anyone and Jessica Alba and the rest of the cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for being apart of this movie.",Good Luck Chuck

I'm a fan of Jessica Alba's, however, her performance in this film reflected more of an actress that was looking for any role and a paycheck. I was unimpressed with Dane Cook's performance. The way this film was edited made the director and writers seem to be males that obviously don't get enough sex and/or are infatuated with sex. My advice to them is to get laid a little more often and then they won't be so obliged to spend countless hours filming footage on humping scenes. It surpassed the ridiculous point.

I sort of gave it a chance since I'm very much aware of the many jaded movie goers out there who think Godfather is the only good movie ever made by man. I am always open-minded to every genre of film I watch. I try to see to it that I adjust to the level of intellect and maturity of the film I'm watching so that I wouldn't be disappointed when it turns out to be sub-par among its counterparts.I am not cruel, and I do not dismiss movies without any valid reason...

I counted maybe 2 or 3 out right laughs, and a few giggles.This was my first movie that I have seen with Dana Cook, which is surprising by the number of movies I see, I was not really impressed. I felt that many times his acting was forced or over the top, very unbelievable. I hear he is a really good stand up and so I am going to try and see him in that type of venue.His buddy was funny in a very juvenile way, it got old very quickly.Alba was very cute, I wish there had been more of her on the screen.If you are a man and want to take someone that your are trying to impress, avoid this movie, it will create a very uncomfortable situation.

I personally enjoy Dane Cook's humor and I thought Employee of the Month was....decent. I was hoping Good Luck Chuck would be a hilarious smash hit but throughout the advanced screening I kept thinking to myself ""Okay well this is funny but it's so typical."" Now I don't want to give anything away but let's just say if you've seen at least one romantic comedy in your life then you know the entire story of Good Luck Chuck already. Don't get me wrong, I laughed pretty much all the way through the movie although there were occasional points where it died down a little. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though. Most was just slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes. The humor in Good Luck Chuck was by far raunchier than Employee of the Month but then again that was PG-13 and this is R. I mentioned that the movie was typical and when I say typical I mean every romantic movie cliché possible was used. It was like they took a blueprint for a love story and then just added Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and then made them do funny things. Granted there are moments where they stray a little or add a funny twist to the formula but it definitely didn't take long to come up with the progression of love in the film.If you want your next dose of laughter after Superbad then go see Good Luck Chuck but don't expect anything new or inventive in terms of storytelling. It is however something to note that there are tons of sex scenes, lots of boobs, extremely raunchy jokes, and Jessica Alba does not reveal any body parts although some side boob can be glanced for a brief moment in the movie.

138,daveandthomas,Nothing special,4,18 September 2007,"Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy 'Good Luck Chuck.' Overall, the movie is generic and predictable. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper-thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. However, this is also one of those movies where most of the best punchlines are in the trailer which is disappointing.Expect lots of nudity from everyone including Cook but not Alba. 'Chuck' comes well stocked with lots of naked girls and breast jokes. However, be warned if you're trying to make this a date movie and know there are some very crude parts to this movie. 'Chuck' definitely earns his 'R' rating.Cook doesn't evolve much from 'Employee of the Month' here but he is enjoyable. Alba is decent at the comedy. Together they have a alright chemistry but the movie is so typical it takes away from the overall experience. One last note. Cook's sidekick, played by Dan Fogler, is extremely annoying and ruins the momentum of the movie on more than one occasion.",Good Luck Chuck

So we rented it and saw it and it was one of the funnier movies I have seen this year. After seeing it I went on IMDb to see what other people have said. And this movie was given an overwhelmingly large pile of bad reviews. The one main complaint that I saw was that there were too many sex jokes. But what people don't understand is that the sex ties in with the premise of the movie. What I mean is the movie is about a guy that has sex with women and then they get married. So if that doesn't sound interesting to you then why would you pay $10.50 to see it. Another factor is that there is not only one kind of comedy. This is a raunchy comedy and on that point it delivers what it said it would. So maybe you should rent it instead.",Good Luck Chuck
140,ashnee_c,Ignore the pessimistic critics!,7,15 November 2007,"This movie has received a lot of negative comments from IMDb.com, and many people believe that this film is awful and not funny at all. Whilst it's fine that they can express their opinion, I would have to disagree. Then again, the reviewers on this website are older than me, and we have different tastes. People who have submitted positive reviews about Good Luck Chuck have mentioned that if you liked Superbad, you'll like Good Luck Chuck. However, I hated Superbad. The only thing that made me laugh was the whole 'McLovin' scenario. I liked - no, loved - Good Luck Chuck. The pace of the movie was good, there were no slow moments and nothing went too fast. The jokes were funny, I laughed many times, and there are a few memorable scenes.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending. It was rushed, not realistic, and not how I would have liked the film to end. Other than that though, this movie is really good. There were a lot of sex scenes, mostly tits, and I know some people complain about it, but a lot of people want to see the movie based on the amount of nudeness. It's a really great movie if you're not scared of a little sex.I did say that it's fine for people to express their opinions on how they think this movie sucks, but I can say that it really doesn't. You just have to have an open mind, a bit of imagination, and a sense of humour. It's as if people watching the movie want it to fit into a certain genre perfectly and they'll have a fit if something isn't quite fitting as to what the genre should be. These people are taking the movie way too seriously, taking minor flaws and exaggerating them beyond proportion.Because Dane Cook is a comedian in real life, some people watched the movie expecting him to be as funny as when he's doing stand-up. Tell me how this is possible, when film and stand-up comedy are two entirely different media? Considering that this film is Cook's first lead role, I think he did a really good job. Jessica Alba fans shouldn't be disappointed either, she was beautiful in the movie and had some funny moments.If you have been thinking about seeing this film, then see it. Ignore the bad reviews. They raise some debatable topics, some valid, but their pessimistic and imagination-lacking minds restrict them from seeing the humour and overall good structure of this movie. Some funny moments to look out for are Joe, the elderly singing quartet... and stick around during the credits.",Good Luck Chuck

The guys were especially loud laughing at the hilarious plastic surgeon friend. I am a female, and I was not offended, but I guess you have to be up for this type of comedy.Yes, there are a lot of sex scenes, but if you pay attention to the whole plot of the movie, it makes sense. If you get easily offended at movies, then don't see it, but remember, it IS entertainment. You have to have liked some other movies with similar humor such as ""40 year old virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" and definitely ""Superbad"". Maybe the other viewers need to get a sense of humor. If you have one, this is a great movie!",Good Luck Chuck

It was refreshing to watch such a funny movie. We laughed out loud. We were both disappointed with 'Wedding Crashers'. We love physical comedy, and this has a lot of it. As far as the nakedness went, it definitely was adult content. We didn't decide to rent the DVD until my friend complained about the sex scenes. We appreciate movies just for adults and not watered down for kids. The naked fight scene in 'Eastern Promises' was a shock to me, but the movie was great. It's not like we haven't seen naked people before. So maybe it won't win any awards, but it was great entertainment.",Good Luck Chuck

If I'd known even HALF of the disgusting things there were going to be in this movie, I would never have gone myself to see it, let alone take my 14 year old brother!!! I was HUMILIATED! Having a hormonal teenage boy in the seat next to me through all the graphic sex scenes was bad enough, but come to find out there was an elderly couple in the seats directly behind us! When the movie ended, she got onto me for bringing a young boy into that kind of movie! How the hell was I supposed to know? It was an absolutely disgusting film, demeaning women, obese people, even animals (did anyone stay to see the final scene with the stuffed penguin--OH MY GOD)! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone on the planet.

In fact, this movie is pretty funny. Sure, there is an awful love story attached and Alba is nothing to write home about, (although she does look cute) but I laughed out loud many times. I am assuming that the majority of bad reviews for this movie are from women, and as we know, a woman's sense of humor is very different than a mans. So guys, this is a lot better than 99% of those terrible romantic comedies your girl drags you too. It's not ""Old School"" or anything, but I was expecting something not funny at all like ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"" when I got cond into going, but trust me, you will laugh",Good Luck Chuck

If it weren't for the slapstick physical humor, this movie probably would not have been funny at all. Quite frankly, I have not heard of most of these actors (except Jessica Alba) and now I know why.

Terrible acting (oh, let me think, was there acting), no substance, and such a large quantity of sexual scenes, nudity, crude language and innuendos that I had to think-what am I doing here! I was visiting my niece of 17 and one of the things we always do is go see a movie and she had requested to see this one. BOY was I embarrassed!!

This movie was just simply drowned by an insane amount of smut! However, like I said, there were some great parts to this movie, and the characters were good. When I was watching this movie, I said to myself ""this is pretty good"" but then it happens...three or four minutes of Dane Cook going crazy doing 100's of chicks in so many ways...I just didn't need to see it, and the movie just didn't need it.

I know a lot of ppl put bad reviews up for this movie, but both me and my roommate, and everyone else in the theater, were laughing really hard.

Perhaps I should have expected a somewhat vulgar movie considering Dane Cook was in it, but it simply wasn't advertised that way. Jessica Alba could have been a lot better in the movie also. Her character was very simple and her clumsiness could have been illustrated better. I think a lot of viewers will not be prepared for what they are about to see and will leave the theater disappointed. This movie wasn't worth $7, or even $3 for a rental.",Good Luck Chuck

From the previews it looked like a light comedy that would just put you in a good mood and make you laugh a lot because Cam, Jessica alba, was supposed to be so tremendously clumsy that you couldn't STOP laughing..... she was clumsy for like 2 minutes total in the movie. Prepare yourself for a TON of sex scenes and random boob shots through-out the movie. Like I said, it had a good idea- but just didn't pull through.

Everyone I knew who watched it really liked it..I reckon Cook played his role well and hes that sorta character that grows in u. Jessica Alba on the other hand, is hot as usual !! Many of their jokes, yes, i agree some are crude, but If you're in for a good laugh regardless of any morality standings or any crap like that, I promise its money well spent.You'll come out of the cinema feeling light hearted and happy.. Beware though, it has jokes which are very funny to most people but downright offensive and idiotic to some others - particularly, (no offense meant) over-weight, unattractive women. Well, either way, I guess the viewers should just watch the movie with an open mind and not take it too seriously. After all, its meant to be a crude comedy.

I think all people should have a chance to watch this so that afterwards they can agree with everything i have written above. 4 out of 10 jokes were funny and only 1 joke in the whole movie actually made me laugh so much that i was rushing for the bathroom. I seriously had more fun watching my friend falling asleep next to me: it may sound desturbing but it was better than watching the side kick badly act his way through the movie 1 rediculas joke after another!!!

When the movie should have ended it drug out far too long to beat a dead horse. Dane & Jessica had an OK chemistry, but it was Dane's sidekick that made the movie lackluster and overdone like a bad steak. There were about 10 minutes total of humor that cracked a smile, that deviated from the sex and teetas jokes which were ever-present. It was nice to see Dane Cook a little more buff since his earlier performances. Eye candy aside, this movie is tops if you enjoy gutter-speak and an overzealous amount T and A.

160,notjohnnydepp999,The real Hex is on you,5,17 January 2008,"Man I HATED Jessica Alba in this movie. Let me just start this review by saying that. For the short version synopsis, a guy named Chuck (played by ""Dane-Train"" Cook), gets a hex put on him as a kid and as a result every girl he sleeps with (sexual intercourse, for the kids reading this) ends up marrying the next guy she meets... so as you have probably guessed, it's clearly based on a true story.The movie begins with what only borders on child pornography with children playing spin the bottle and a young girl and young guy ending up in the closet in some weird fetish laced kiss session. When the 11 year old girl (or however old she was) rips off her shirt and reveals some goth training bra I thought the FBI was going to kick down my door and arrest me for watching such indiscretions.Put it this way, nothing offends me, like ever, and while this didn't offend me, I am going to have nightmares till I am 45. I was so disturbed I ran upstairs to my neighbors apartment and had them wrap me in a warm blanket and console me on the couch as I was shivering the next 36 minutes.Anyways, ""Chuck"" grows up to be Dane ""B & E"" Cook, who is now a dentist and learning that yet another one of his ex-girlfriends is getting married. It is here where he meets Jessica- My Janitor Has More Comedic Timing Than Me- Alba, as a clumsy girlfriend to be. This is where I started getting frustrated. For one thing, Chuck's friend is more annoying than the Energizer Bunny, popping up about every 3 minutes in the movie to say ""Boobs"" and run off screen, only for the audience to apparently think it is funny that he is saying a female body part and he is overweight.Alba is worse though. For the record I used to like Jessica Alba, and by used to I mean WAYYY back in the ""Idle Hands"" days. (Google that for some family fun). This movie tries SO RIDICULOUSLY HARD to make her clumsiness adorable that it made me want to jump off a cliff with a grocery bag as my parachute. I above anyone else think a woman's flaws are nothing short of adorable, but 'Good Luck Chuck' takes it to an extreme where the only thing they left out after Alba slips and falls down is the Director of the movie walking on screen and saying to the audience, ""Isn't it charming when the pretty girl gets a bruise?"" Dane Cook is pretty funny, in fact his funniest stuff is improvised, but roughly 3 out of every 10 jokes in this movie work. For awhile I thought they changed the name of the movie to ""Good Luck Penguin"" because there are so many scenes dealing with Jessica Alba's love of penguins that I thought I was watching the Discovery Channel with nudity.Of course this, like every movie in the last decade for some reason, has the obligatory, ""oh he didn't just hook up with a 300 pound woman now did he?"" scene that has never been funny once in the history of the universe. A man thrown on a table by an overweight woman who then jumps on it only to break the table, really? That is what the audience is craving these days? When was the meeting when people in the United States got together and said, ""you know what would make life a hell of a lot better? Scenes involving a big character tackling a littler character... THAT is comedic gold."" I guess I overslept when everyone was having that discussion.Perhaps the weirdest part of this movie happens in the last third when inexplicably it changes from a romantic comedy to some suspense filled stalker movie. After Chuck feels like he is going to lose Alba forever he begins stalking her at every turn showing up at her work dressed as a penguin (I thought I was high at that part, because how that ended up in the movie is beyond me) and writing on her car in addition to chasing her through airports.I understand in romantic comedies that it is all about the 'chase' to get the woman of your dreams, hell I've done it myself, but the difference is I wasn't foaming at the mouth and using spy satellites to accomplish it, which is the only thing they left out in this movie.For the 2 or 3 people in America that are into sex with animals, the end credits have Dane Cook molesting a penguin, so if you're into that then you're golden. By the end I thought the only person that got a hex put on them was me, because the whole thing was giving me a headache.Anyways, there you have it, if you need me I'll be at the BK Lounge.Laters. myspace.com/not_johnny_depp",Good Luck Chuck
161,host-35,Worst Movie of the Decade,1,26 January 2008,"Since the other reviewers have done such a good job describing the plot (or lack thereof), I will only add a comment about my emotional reaction to this so-called film. I was tricked into watching this movie and very much regret it. This is among the worst movies I've seen since... well, ever. The plot is a non-starter, the writing is dumber than juvenile, and the directing is pathetic. Nothing about this movie makes sense; it wouldn't even make sense to a very disturbed viewer. It could have been a sit-com but is too trite. It could have been pornography but no doubt didn't meet the low standards for that genre either. I was as sorry for the actors who surely wasted some portion of their lives, as I was for the viewers, some of the younger of which may come away with a distorted view of human kind and the basis for normal relationships. Even beyond all the non-plot and non-characters in the movie, none of the interactions between the actors resembles anything real about life. In an alternate universe, if such people could exist (which is doubtful), they would be horribly miserable. My main regret is that by renting this DVD we contributed two bucks to the incomes of anyone involved in making this movie. We've made a list of those and will never rent another movie that involves them.",Good Luck Chuck

However, if you are out to see a funny movie and enjoy yourself, this movie will provide you with good entertainment. If you are uptight, you may want to pass. Yeah, there are boobs in the movie, so what, big deal. Dane is always funny and Jessica was cute in this movie. In fact, I thought they were good a good couple in the movie. The guy that plays Stu is a little annoying and not very good, as was the guy that plays Jessica's brother, but other than that I give this movie a great review.

Dane Cook did a good job of capturing the obscure humor of the real-life character. There were parts that had me reaching for the remote, but I waited it out. Cook came across as generally likable. I'm not a very big Dane Cook fan, but a friend of mine suggested this movie and I thank him for it. Of course, Jessica Alba was gorgeous and funny, as well! She never ceases to amaze me.

Of course there were many funny parts, most of them were however from Jessica Alba's character's brother. There was way too much nudity to a movie of this kind. A little bit unnecessary and sad, because none of it was between Dane Cook and Jessica Alba, who were the main characters. It was a normal ""comedy romance"", where we know from the beginning how it will end, but still pretty nice. I find the cast OK, it's only not bad because I like Jessica Alba's performance in almost every movie. Her character is also very interesting because it combines a pretty girl with a very clumsy one.",Good Luck Chuck
167,crimmers,Great movie if you are open minded and not afraid of a little sex,10,25 September 2007,"This movie marks, bar none, the greatest departure I have ever come across between the response from both professional and IMDb critics and my own personal opinion. This striking dichotomy has prompted me to post my first ever IMDb review. Literally every professional critic I could find gave this movie a terrible review, which I can only attribute to closed mindedness and a lack of imagination. Apparently every movie must fit neatly into a certain genre, and cannot deviate from standard and infinitely repeated tropes. This movie was supposed to be a ""romantic comedy"", a genre which I generally do not care for, as they tend to be sappy, depressing, and just generally boring. Nonetheless, virtually all reviewers seem to decry that this movie refused to take out all the ""smut"" and revert itself into another in a line of bland and lifeless romantic comedies. An oft repeated line I found in reviews was that ""this movie is much closer to Caligula than Sleepless in Seattle"". I personally cannot think of any higher praise for a movie.Other IMDb reviewers stated that the only people who would like this movie are college frat boys who want to see ""boobies"". Well, I can tell you that I and my girlfriend both have postgraduate degrees, and both of us loved it. The movie is funny, cute, sexy, fast paced, and never takes itself too seriously. All of the characters are good-natured and fun, and display realistic responses and a great deal of humanity in reacting to an unusual and very funny situation. Dane Cook's character is a good person, in a realistic (non-Hollywood) sort of way. He tries to help people, but certainly doesn't turn down sex with attractive women when it is, quite literally, thrown at him. When he meets the ""love of his life"", he ignores all of her (quite significant) flaws and pursues her vigorously. Jessica Alba's character is sweet, funny, and believable in the progression of her relationship with Cook. She is refreshingly understanding and non-jealous about Cook's rather unusual malady. Troy Gentile's character is criticized on these boards for being misogynistic, but is certainly no more so than Jason Alexander's character in ""Shallow Hal"". Gentile is often extremely funny, generally well intentioned, and a good friend to Cook.Many have commented that this movie is crude and disgusting. I honestly do not see this at all. The humor is significantly less low-brow than, say, ""Superbad"", with all of its crude penis jokes (and drawings). Yes, there is nudity and sex, but I don't see why this should make a movie disgusting. I also found it refreshing that the main two characters in this movie were a dentist and a doctor, both educated, successful, and well spoken. In just about all of the recent comedies I can think of, the main characters are reject losers that the audience can enjoy laughing at, rather than laughing with. In Good Luck Chuck, we don't feel especially sorry for any of the characters, but we empathize with and relate to them, and can laugh at their antics and escapades in a good natured and fun way.Do yourself a favor and ignore the critics. Go see this movie!",Good Luck Chuck
168,GTRrocker,"Homophbic, yes, sexist, yes, but still watchable.",5,18 January 2008,"First off, I want to make clear that I don't even like Dane Cook. I liked his first 2 comedy cd's when he first came out before I found out he stole jokes and whored himself to be in horrible movies, also I saw his true personality on his HBO tourgasm show. What a complete and utter dick.But this is by far his best film. He acted kind of like a dick in the movie, not in how he slept with a lot of girls, or dialog-wise, but just his personality. You can tell he really isn't a nice guy like portrayed in the film, especially after what Jessica Alba has come out saying about the ""porn like"" atmosphere of the set, disrespecting women, etc.There were some really dumb parts, but other really funny parts that made up for it. Jessica Alba's brother in the film is hilarious. The parts when dane and his fat friend were kids were good too. The plot isn't realistic like a superbad type film, but its a comedy so what do you expect? I laughed out loud hard like 3-5 times. The rest was semi funny, but enjoyable jokes. I laughed at Dane like only one or two times. Once when he got hurt and another when he was having sex with a fat woman with back acne. Funny camera angle on that one.",Good Luck Chuck
169,ctlady060262,I need a bath after watching this filth-fest,1,10 March 2008,"*** BEWARE - SPOILERS*** There's a scene in the movie where Chuck showers, scrubbing his nether-regions with a scrub brush and cleanser, after having sex with an acned, obese woman. That's pretty much what I felt like doing after watching this movie.My husband and I rented this last night on pay per view, thinking it was a lighthearted romantic comedy with Jessica Alba featured as a klutzy, but lovable girl. What it turned out to be was soft porn-fest suited for teenaged frat boys than a 'couples movie'. There were boobs, boobs and MORE boobs, Dane Cook portrayed having sex every which way with numerous woman (all shown at once in a 'Brady Bunch' intro 'tic tac toe' format because showing him having sex with only two girls to get the point of the movie across just wasn't enough). I mean, the movie opened with a topless girl giving him oral sex on the beach! The sidekick, though hilarious comedic timing, had some of the skeeviest dialogue. When Alba's character spills a burning candle on Dane's character during a wedding scene and the melted wax hardens on his pants, the sidekick friend (Stu) proclaims that it looks like male ejaculate, however he used the slang term. ICK, did I really need to hear that?? Oh, lets see....the sidekick masturbates into a grapefruit while stimulating his anus with a vegetable scrubbie (I am NOT kidding!), a woman with 3 boobs, the sidekick, who's a plastic surgeon, calling Cook's character into the exam room to check the symmetry of a patient's boob job (which absolutely violates doctor-patient privacy laws), countless euphanisms for sex and even more for the female genetalia, and a VERY disturbing ending showing Dane performing oral sex on a stuffed penguin. I don't know why, but that just disturbed the bejesus out of me. After 11 years of marriage, I have never been more uncomfortable around my husband after I move as I was after this one. I could go on, but I would need a shower after I'm done reliving the skankiness of that movie.Ms. Alba (who was adorkable in the movie) should crawl under a rock to have associated with this movie. And, to the reviewer who commented about Dane's pocked face - WORD! How is this guy a leading man? He's positively FOUL.This movie was absolutely gross. It made American Pie look like a Jane Austen novel. I swear! Unless you're an uber-horny guy looking for something to circle jerk with your friends to, rent this. Other than than, skip it. Run.

Kills more brain cells in half an hour (thats about how long i prolonged each blink through the movie - the human senses have limits) than standing with an exposed brain under a tanning lamp made of plutonium.Dane Cook needs to quit acting quick. The dude who played his buddy needs to be put away for good. As for the harvard grad screenwriters who wrote this piece of crap to make some quick money for wtever the fk studio put this out, kudos! how you managed to get paid for this i will never ever understand. All in all, this insults men, women, children, and even penguins!This is the kind of movie that makes you want to take a shower in Lysol.",Good Luck Chuck
171,scott884,Not good.....,2,27 October 2007,"The directing and performances are amateurish, parts of the film border on pornography, and most of the jokes misfire. If you think this is a cute romantic comedy you're in for a big letdown. Not for couples, definitely not for kids, in fact not really for anyone. Bad move on Jessica Alba's part to even appear in this film, I wonder if she even read the script before they started shooting. Jessica, fire your agent and anyone else who told you making this piece of crap was a good idea. Then take a look at the movies Drew Barrymore makes, that's what you should be doing. Dane Cook will hopefully never make another movie in my lifetime.",Good Luck Chuck
172,badgee,Funny Movie if you're not expecting the 2nd coming of Beaches,9,17 September 2007,"I saw this movie at the Boston film festival. I have to say, there were some really funny lines and gags in this movie. It has the typical Hollywood ending.I can see why some of the comments are on the negative side, but this movie isn't in the same genre as The Holiday. Sure they're both Romantic Comedies, but one is funny and the other is not. This is more of a guy's version. I think this was also much better than Knocked Up. I got a few chuckles from that sappy movie, but there was some laughing till it hurt scenes in this one.I give this a 9/10. I had to deduct a point for the cookie cutter formula of screen writing. Why do suits have to ruin movies. Why do we have to see such dramatic character arcs when life is never like this. Go see this if you want to laugh. The scene where the credits are rolling is hilarious. Did that girl really have three?",Good Luck Chuck
173,serdarcc,America is a Bunch of Prudes,6,26 September 2007,"First off, the commercials for this movie were awful. It looked like this movie was about Jessica Alba making like Jerry Lewis for 2 hrs. The commercials and the actual movie couldn't have been more dissimilar. I don't make comments on this site but for some reason I got bored and had to defend this movie. WHY do people equate nudity with how bad a movie is? It's just like equating how good an actress Jessica Alba is based on her beauty. This movie was okay and I gave it a 7 because Dan Fogler was really funny. Although he gives all the male plastic surgeons out there a bad name. Dane Cook? not. Jessica Alba? hot but not. OK, there's my comment.P.S. I like to see more nudity in romantic comedies in the future. Maybe more guys like me won't have to hang out in the food stand too long.",Good Luck Chuck
174,bkeen-84743,Adam Sandler would have been a better lead actor...,7,5 July 2017,"So this movie is pretty good. I mean the story is pretty clever, hard to come up with, I mean it really makes you think. Speaking of thinking... I think Dane Cook did a pretty good job with this film... my only issue is I truly think that Adam Sandler would have been a better actor and more believable lead character. I mean Adam Sandler is so funny and truly a ladies man. That guy can do it all.... other than that, the movie is good but it would have been GREAT! had Adam Sandler been the lead actor.

175,mfgirl-95490,"Misogynistic, shallow, obnoxious. Just no",1,3 April 2020,"This movie is like a car crash. It's completely awful and for some twisted reason one cannot stop watching. Jessica Alba is cute, but kind of a one trick pony when her roles are concerned. This movie is shallow, completely unrealistic, is objectifying women and is not aimed at anyone really. No wonder critics absolutely butchered it and that it got nominated for all those Razzies. Don't watch. A total waste of time.",Good Luck Chuck
176,polaca_mdq,waste of time,1,21 July 2008,"This movie is just awful. All I could think of throughout the movie was ""what was Jessica Alba thinking?!!"" Too many unnecessary nudity, sex scenes, unfortunate fat jokes, and above all, that terrible character... the surgeon... my God! A total shame.Bad directing, awful lighting and sets... not much money was put into it, luckily... but I hate to see that someone helps financing this garbage instead of a good idea. So many good things can be done with little money... not this!!!!To sum up: It's not even worth downloading it for free.",Good Luck Chuck
