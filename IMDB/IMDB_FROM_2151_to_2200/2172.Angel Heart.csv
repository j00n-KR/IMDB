0,Leofwine_draca,One of the best American horror films of the 1980s,9,19 May 2015,"As dark and brooding a slice of American Gothic as you could wish for, ANGEL HEART is one of the best straight horror outings to come out of the late '80s – a time when most genre offerings were cheesy, rubbery outings of stupidity. ANGEL HEART is in essence a mood piece. Set during the 1950s, it chronicles the efforts of a private detective to track down a missing person who soon finds himself in some very dark places. With a string of unpleasant sex and violence scenes, excellent direction from the always-good Alan Parker and some quite wonderful performances, this is a real classic. There aren't that many films that deal with modern-day voodoo in a non-biased way so this one's a real treat.Parker is adept at crafting atmosphere and you can almost smell the cigarette smoke in this seedy, grubby little film. Mickey Rourke, in a career-best performance, is Harry Angel, the protagonist. Angel is a pretty unpleasant guy who thinks nothing of using violence as a method and yet Rourke embodies him with a raw humanity that makes us warm to him from the start. Although he's the archetypal tough guy he projects an air of bruised vulnerability that makes him riveting to see on screen. He has some great supporting actors with him, too; Lisa Bonet excels in a layered performance as the voodoo-practising Epiphany Proudfoot; Charlotte Rampling as a fortune teller; finally Robert De Niro, as great as ever as the sinister Louis Cyphre.The film is pretty slowly paced but laced with moments of action and violence that breathe life into it. My attention never wavered for a second. There are occasional missteps – I could have done without the 'glowing eye' stuff that takes place at the climax, that only serves to cheapen the effect; good when used in films like FRIGHT NIGHT, but not here! But the handling of Rourke's gradual realisation as he pieces together the mystery and his final understanding of the true horror of his situation is top notch and the film then ends on an unforgettable piece of imagery. Altogether a great work and a film I thoroughly enjoyed.",Angel Heart
1,SnoopyStyle,hard-boiled modern noir,6,17 December 2016,"It's 1955 New York. Private investigator Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) gets a missing person case from Harlem boss Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro). He's looking for Johnny Favourite who is a vegetable suffering from shell shock. He has a mysterious contract and wants to find out if he died. Dr. Fowler had released him to some unknown people years ago while maintaining his records at the clinic.It's a hard-boiled noir. It's stylish. Director Alan Parker may have concentrated too much on the style. The movie moves too slowly. Mickey Rourke has a hard sensitivity that works well. De Niro's appearance is memorable but fleeting. This movie needs more intensity and more consistently. For too many times, the movie slows to a crawl. This has the style and a lead actor, but it needs to be tighter. This has a supernatural ending which would be better with some special effects.",Angel Heart
2,mark.waltz,A masterpiece in spite of the fact that it sends me into places I desperately want to stay away from.,9,16 July 2021,"When I watch this film many years ago, I ranked it as a five because as someone who believes in the power of God, I didn't want to give the devil any credit whether fictional or for real. But seeing this again 30 years later, I am astonished as to what a great film it is, a genuine piece of artwork that is more powerful with the passage of time and of course the onslaught of maturity, and I can look at it for the cinematic masterpiece it is. That doesn't mean that I'm not creeped out by the themes or many of the twists, but not remembering anything about it, I knew right away what that twist would be.If Mickey Rourke had never been in another movie, he would be an icon like James Dean today simply for having appeared in this. Likewise, Robert De Niro is outstanding, an example of pure malevolence as a mysterious client of private investigator Rourke searching for a certain rock singer who has betrayed him, leaving a debt to pay behind.Rourke starts off in Coney Island where he interviews people who knew Johnny, the rock singer DeNiro is looking for, and then ends up in Louisiana where further investigation either has him asked to leave or treated with a gentle welcoming and the information that helps him and putting the pieces together.The beautiful Lisa Bonet is unforgettable as the fragile looking young woman who plays a key role in finding Johnny, but she's involved in something dark as well which Rourke witnesses but for some reason isn't shocked by. Charlotte Rampling guest stars as a former New Yorker now in New Orleans who refuses Rourke any type of information, her brief scene powerful and revealing. Followers of the catholic faith might skip this though as there are references to certain elements that connects the church to the Faust legend.This was obviously too disturbing for many viewers at the time and obviously the academy found it went against many of their secret moral laws of the type of films that they would or wouldn't acknowledge. That created controversy in 1988, and looking back, I can say that this is just as good if not better than any of the best picture nominees for 1987 even though it is a difficult subject to want to give accolades to. The combination of mystery, horror and even elements of film noir helps this stand the test of time, and time has indeed been a witness to many nightmares. This would be a good companion piece to the same year's ""The Believers"" which is another masterpiece of the macabre that deeply disturbed me.",Angel Heart
3,claudio_carvalho,"Classy, Dark and Creepy",10,23 May 2013,"In 1955, in New York, the smalltime private detective Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke) is summoned by the attorney Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) to meet his client Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro). Angel learns that a popular pre-war crooner, Johnny Favorite, had a contract with Cypher and vanished; Cypher offers a large amount for him to seek out Johnny. Angel heads to a clinic where Johnny was last seen and visits the addicted Dr. Albert Fowler (Michael Higgins), who tells that Johnny was shot in the face and arrived in the clinic with amnesia and dysfunctional. One day, a man and his daughter took Johnny with them and he was paid to forge the records. When Angel visits Dr. Fowler again, he finds him dead. Then he visits Johnny's former lover Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling) expecting to find the location of Johnny and later the woman is murdered. Then he visits the musician and former partner of Johnny, Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee), and the man is killed immediately after. Angel leaves a blood trail behind, but when he meets Margaret's father Ethan Krusemark (Stocker Fontelieu), he finds the doomed fate of Johnny Favorite. ""Angel Heart"" is a classy, dark and creepy horror movie by Alan Parker, with a scary Robert De Niro in the role of Lucifer and Mickey Rourke in the top of his career. This is one of my favorite movies ever and I had seen it at least three times before today, last time on 14 October 2001.The explanation about the fate of Johnny Favorite is quite confused and many viewers do not understand what happened to the crooner. In order to understand, there are two capital moments in the story: when Angel talks to Dr. Fowler and to Mr. Krusemark. Spoilers ahead:My understanding is that Johnny conjured Lucifer and made a pact to become famous; in return, he would deliver his soul to the devil. The also Satanist Mr. Krusemark is impressed with Johnny and introduces his daughter, who also worships the devil, to him. Margaret and Johnny become lovers and find a means to lure Lucifer in a black book. Johnny and Toots kidnap the soldier Harold Angel in the Times Square and Johnny sacrifices him in a ritual and assumes his identity. He delivers his identification to Margaret inside a jar but he is summoned to fight in the war. He is shot in the face and arrives in the clinic where Dr. Fowler works with amnesia and dysfunctional. Margaret has never had the chance to see his new face since he is covered by bandages. Margaret and her father remove Johnny from the clinic and leave him alone in the Times Square, expecting that he recovers his memory by himself. Years later, they assume that Johnny has died. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Coração Satânico"" (""Satanic Heart"")Note: On 27 December 2014, I saw this movie again.",Angel Heart
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A superb movie.,9,30 October 2020,"Such an impressive movie, if like me you're a fan of noir, or neo noir, then you will absolutely love this movie.The first thing you will be struck by is the appearance of the film, it is a visual masterpiece, the attention to detail is flawless, you could actually turn the colour off, and imagine this being made in 1955.Secondly, the atmosphere, smoke filled rooms, the clothes, music, accents, just awesome to behold, they got the tone spot on.It's a great story, it takes a few moments for you to know what's happening, and get the direction, but you will.Finally the acting, Rourke is at his absolute best, one of the best films I've seen him in, he is tremendous, it's so nice to see him in his handsome pre surgery years. De Niro, what can you say, he's just incredible.Captivating, 9/10.",Angel Heart
5,gavin6942,Very Captivating Detective Story With a Voodoo Horror Twist,7,26 May 2011,"Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) has a new case, to find a man called Johnny Favourite. Except things aren't quite that simple...First of all, I am used to seeing Mickey Rourke as a deformed mutant humanoid beast. So, as much as I should be embarrassed to admit it, I cannot even recognize him when he looks like a normal and handsome younger man. He is also a good lead actor (though I suppose we know that by now with ""The Wrestler"").I think of this film as a cross between ""Chinatown"" and ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"". It has the detective angle of ""Chinatown"", with people turning up dead, questionable connections and a private dick who may have to hide from the cops himself (well, that could be ""Maltese Falcon"", too, I suppose). ""Serpent""? Well, just the voodoo aspect, and both films came out about the same time -- this being the better of the two (sorry Wes Craven).I have seen reviews calling this the creepiest performance of Robert DeNiro's career. I will not agree or disagree, but accept it as possible. I mean, I do not normally think of him as a creeper, so what do I compare this to -- ""Cape Fear"", I guess. Or ""Little Fockers"".Roger Ebert says director ""Parker's films are always made with great gusto, as if he were in up to his elbows and taking no hostages"" -- he uses ""The Wall"" as an example, which is nothing like this film, but they both do have an intensity that any moviegoer ought to appreciate. Ultimately, Ebert calls the film ""an exuberant exercise in style"" and gives it a bold three and a half stars... I am hesitant to match that, leaning more towards a solid three. But yes, this is that rare good movie that gets overlooked by the target audience.",Angel Heart
6,jboothmillard,Angel Heart,5,15 June 2006,"From director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone), this mystery thriller might not look like much, but with two big stars you can sort of think it is. Set in the 1950's, private detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by Louis Cyphre - get it, ""Lucifer"" (Robert De Niro) to find a man called Johnny Favourite. He is following all the clues he has concerning who knew him and where he went, and ending up in more strange situations. Things to expect are one or two dead bodies, a controversial sex scene where the lovers get blood from the ceiling dripped on them, and De Niro with long fingernails. Also starring Enemy of the State's Lisa Bonet as Epiphany Proudfoot, Charlotte Rampling as Margaret Krusemark, Stocker Fontelieu as Ethan Krusemark, Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, Michael Higgins as Dr. Albert Fowler, Elizabeth Whitcraft as Connie, Eliott Keener as Det. Sterne, Charles Gordone as Spider Simpson, Dann Florek as Herman Winesap and Kathleen Wilhoite as Nurse. Besides the bloody moments, and the acting of Rourke and De Niro, this film isn't really much, but it isn't terrible. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!",Angel Heart
7,ccthemovieman-1,DVD Transfer Enhances This Sordid-But-Intriguing Movie,8,21 January 2007,"This is a very sordid film. I usually don't go for that sort of thing, but there are a lot of other good things about this movie that made me add this to my collection.There is very good cinematography and camera-work in here, made even better by the special edition DVD transfer. I liked the old film-noir type atmosphere in the story, which is an interesting one overall.There are no really good-guy characters in this film. Mickey Rourke plays the star of the movie: private eye ""Harry Angel."" He's somewhat of a low-life but so is everyone else. Lisa Bonet looks spectacular and has a steamy sex scene in here. Robert De Niro gets big billing but he doesn't have that many lines in this film.The ending of this movie has a very unique twist to it, but it's certainly not a satisfying ending. It is one I should go back over after the next viewing and check for credibility. That's all I can say without using spoilers.Overall, a sleazy but very intriguing story, with great atmosphere, that I enjoy watching every five years or so. Some would call this movie a modern-day ""film noir.""",Angel Heart
8,rmax304823,The Fifth And a Half Sense.,6,29 March 2007,"It opens with Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a bummy kind of private eye in a seedy office in Brooklyn in 1955. The black plastic phone rings. It's a potential client, a law firm. ""Do I know what an attorney is? Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer but the bucks are bigger."" The lawyers names are Winesap and Macintosh -- two apples. A long-forgotten crooner is missing. He owes the lawyers something and they want Harry to track him down. A missing person case. Harry meets the client in the loft of an Evangelical black church in Harlem. It's Robert DeNiro overly decked out and trying on an elegant accent. The story soon gets complicated. People begin to turn up with oddball names -- Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite, Evangeline Krusemark, Toots Sweet.So far, we feel we're on pretty normal ground here. A Raymond-Chandleresque mystery will follow, during which we'll lose sight of the original problem while we meet eccentrics, goons, and pre-verts, and we'll be taken down colorful paths into mansions and down into spooky basements and people will be knocked off for reasons we don't understand.Well -- yes, but with two or three twists. One twist is that the next thing we know, we and Rourke are out of Brooklyn and into New Orleans and environs. Another twist is that the story moves into the orbit of the supernatural -- voodoo, black magic, mummified hands, pentagrams, Satanism, selling one's soul to the devil, and all that -- and it's meant seriously. I mean the devil is real and is a real character in the film. (Why he insists on meeting Rourke in a Catholic church and warning Rourke against using the F word in such a place isn't entirely clear.) The third twist I won't reveal except to say that the people who made ""The Sixth Sense"" might have seen this ending.It's a weird movie, overall, teetering on the brink of being arty. Off-kilter shots of ventilator fans slowly creaking to a halt. Rain turning into blood for no apparent reason. Murders committed for no apparent reason either. And not only that, but the victim's heart is cut out and left on the floor. There's a thin line between beauty and baseness, and at times this film and its editing go beyond atmospheric into plain sloppiness and self indulgence. Much is made of the voodoo thread that leads Rourke to Louisiana but in fact it has nothing to do with the central event of the story, which might just as well have taken place in the apartment of Rosemary's baby.DeNiro is a great actor but he's in the wrong role here, or rather the role is wrong for him. Whatever else he is, DeNiro is always grounded. But here his lines are written as if meant for somebody like Clifton Webb or George Sanders. Mickey Rourke -- whatever happened to HIM? He's very good in this, as he was in many of his earlier films. The next thing we knew he had a new raggedy haircut and a pair of boxing gloves. What a loss for us. Lisa Bonet is beautiful and sexy and demonstrates how well suited she was for a television sitcom. The musical score is pretty good except at times, during moments of dread, we get a booming heart-like sound that's guaranteed to induce at least a headache and at most a gallop rhythm.There's another loose end to the plot that keeps nagging me. I can't understand why any of the murders were committed.And another. Why does Mickey Rourke wind up having to pay his dues when in fact he's not the same guy who signed the contract? He has a different face and a different brain and a different set of memories. He doesn't even KNOW he's the guy who first made the deal. Is he held to the contract because he happens to have the same set of fingerprints? Somebody tried to ploy the system once in Connecticut after a sex change operation and were foiled because of that simple dermatographic fact.At times it's a little tiresome but it's worth catching if you haven't seen it, especially if you're unfamiliar with Mickey Rourke's talent, curious about Lisa Bonet's bosom, or a fan of the occult.",Angel Heart
9,BA_Harrison,It must be better than I think it is.,6,4 April 2014,"Set in mid-1950s America, Angel Heart stars Mickey Rourke as tough New York private detective Harry Angel, who is hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphyre (Robert DeNiro) to discover the whereabouts of Johnny Favourite, a famous blues musician who has apparently reneged on a business deal.This is one of those films that seems to have garnered almost unanimous praise, so I feel a bit stupid in admitting that I found the narrative kinda hard to follow; a lot of the symbolism also seems to have gone right over my head, making the film a bit of a chore to fully comprehend. Angel Heart is, however, an undeniably stylish movie, with excellent visuals that make particularly good use of light and shadow (imbuing proceedings with that all-important pulp/film-noir atmosphere). So if, like me, you struggle with the complexity of the plot, at least there's lots of lovely cinematography to enjoy.5/10, bumped up to 6 for no other reason than to make me appear slightly less of a Philistine/idiot.",Angel Heart
10,moonspinner55,"Sweaty, kinky atmosphere, uncomfortably sexual violence...",6,11 September 2004,"Director-screenwriter Alan Parker keeps this gory, sexy beast grinding along like a disco dancer bathed in blood. The whole thing thump-thump-thumps in a twisted altered state in dark, seamy corners; yet, aside from all the voodoo ambiance, there's not a hell of a lot going on (although Parker is a pro at hiding this until the ending, which has a high ""oh, brother!' quotient). Mickey Rourke, rumpled and handsome, cuts a cool, shabby-chic, noir-ish figure as a detective assigned to find a missing band singer; Robert De Niro is his mysterious client. Smart viewers will figure out what's going on long before Rourke does, but there are subplots to distract you--though they don't quite add up. In supporting roles, Charlotte Rampling is scarily statuesque as a New Orleans grande dame and Lisa Bonet as a voodoo princess is eerily fragile, a lusty waif. But neither character does much to advance the plot (they're just walking targets) and the much-touted sex scene between Rourke and Bonet is just Alan Parker feeling his oats. In a brief role as a nurse, Kathleen Wilhoite makes more of a connection with the audience (and with Rourke) than anyone else. The sharp editing darts around letting you see just enough mayhem, and then backtracking and giving you more. Rourke is alert and gripping, and De Niro is cunningly rich (though the role is beneath him). Unfortunately, the plot is juvenile nonsense, cynical and corny, managing to displace mystery and conjecture with B-movie clichés. **1/2 from ****",Angel Heart
11,dbdumonteil,"Parker's peak,Rourke's finest performance.",9,12 August 2001,"I do not go much for that Parker kind of stuff(""Midnight express"" ,albeit technically breathtaking was a little racist,""Shoot the moon"" was a big bore,and you've got to be into Pink Floyd to appreciate such a work as ""the wall"")""Angel Heart "" is a different matter,because it deals with the horror and fantasy genre.Against all odds,for someone who had never tackled this difficult genre,Parker succeeded magnificently.The screenplay is first-rate,with a strong story,with an ending you'll never guess (and I will not reveal it of course!)Including drugs,voodoo,sabbath ,intense love scenes,featuring a wonderful cast:Rourke,who had never been better (and never would)and a frighteningly deadpan DeNiro cast as Louis Cipher,this movie takes us along in a meandering,labyrinthine investigation in which private detective Rourke will find so dreadful things he won't escape unharmed. The supporting cast is excellent:Charlotte Rampling stays only a few minutes on the screen ,and yet,we remember her and her tea.The same goes for the junkie doctor.I'd tone it for one thing:the elevator scene might have been borrowed from an old French movie,""Huis clos"",directed by Jacqueline Audry,from Jean-Paul Sartre's play(1956).",Angel Heart
12,Quinoa1984,"a Gothic film-noir, strange combination that works for its pulp-style and star power",8,17 June 2007,"Alan Parker doesn't necessarily have a masterpiece on his hands here; he's sometimes a little uneasy when it comes to storytelling devices like a voice-over repeating details from a previous scene, or in actual visual devices a few times (notably for me is the tap-dancing cut-away scene, with those few cut-aways distractions from what is otherwise a powerhouse scene). But it is a truly absorbing effort nonetheless, and one that I wouldn't pass up if it arrived on TV at some random moment in time. For all of Parker's dips into the kinds of montage-style editing that he perfected in the Wall, it's also in some small bits with a documentary feel, and in the most part a mood that melds together those dark crevices and corridors and alleys and shadows that one finds in the best of the film-noir period with the same dark tendencies of the supernatural film. It's even got a very typical 'noir' set-up- gleefully typical in actuality- as private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is sent by Louis Cyphre (ho-ho, though not as such played by the totally dead-pan De Niro) to seek out a man who welshed on a contract signed with him. It leads him through Harlem, then to New Orleans, into a whole web of black magic, voodoo, and sinister figures on his trail, and other skeletons in the closet to find.Parker's style is meant to ratchet up the questions raised in the viewer as the film progresses, and as any good twisty thriller goes it deepens these questions by the complexity of the protagonist, leading to the final twist that one may have seen done in quite a number of films since, but does retain its power as something of a dark catharsis for this character. Parker's success here rests on two facets: his blending of a mood of the nature of the people and of New Orleans in general, how people on the street, or in the voodoo dance at night, aren't overdone into some cliché but are shown as they are, as figures in this quasi-limbo Angel has gotten himself into. The other being the casting or Rourke and De Niro. The former gives Angel Heart much of its appeal: it's almost too easy to see Rourke as a gum-shoe, but here he plays it as a person cynical and witty, but also sort of damaged goods, hiding past wounds with a cigarette and look of the eyes. And as things become crazier all around him, little by little one sees the wear and tear on his psyche, until the final scenes when he breaks down into the other side of his tough guy act- vulnerability. De Niro, on the other hand, is so sinister in what he doesn't do. Considering how over the top his contemporaries- Nicholson and Pacinio- went with the role of the devil himself, this may be the most subdued of them all, which makes it all the more chilling (see the egg scene), with the Scorsese-esquire beard a good asset.Although the casting isn't altogether perfect- Rampling is given an all too brief role to work wit, the minor characters being reasonably well suited for the atmosphere, and Lisa Bonet being just about adequate, though not quite the same caliber as Rourke, in her role as a mysterious bayou teen who is the daughter of the suspect in question- having these two heavyweights under Parker's command is quite staggering for any movie fan to enjoy. It's a strange feat to accomplish, but somehow Angel Heart holds up since its release twenty years ago as a genre hybrid sleeper, where the hardest- and darkest- thing to find is probably right inside of oneself.",Angel Heart

14,BandSAboutMovies,More mumbo jumbo,6,14 January 2020,"Following the publication of his 1978 novel Falling Angel, William Hjortsberg began working on turning it into a film. His friend, production designer Richard Sylbert (Dick Tracy, The Cotton Club) took the book to Robert Evans, who was running Paramount and was ready to make the film with John Frankenheimer set to direct and Dustin Hoffman in the lead.That option expired, as did another attempt to get the movie made with Robert Redford. Years later, producer Elliott Kastner met with Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Midnight Express, Fame, Pink Floyd: The Wall, The Commitments) to discuss him writing the screenplay. Parker also helped get the movie funded by Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna as part of Carolco Pictures, as long as he was given creative control.Parker made several changes from the novel, retitling the story Angel Heart, including moving the second half of the tale to New Orleans and moving the time forward four years to 1955, so the story feels like it belongs more to the 40's than the coming 60's. He also worked toward making Harry Angel more sympathetic and Louis Cyphre more realistic.Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a New York City private investigator who has been hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) to track down a singer named Johnny Favorite, who has been dealing with PTSD from World War II. Even the upstate hospital where Favorite was staying can't find him, as his release was facilitated by two mysterious people and a doctor was convinced to change his records.Cyphre offers Angel a large sum of money to continue hunting for Favorite. The trail leads him to Favorite's fiancee Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling) and the discovery that he had sired a daughter named Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) with an ex-lover.Everyone that gives Angel info - guitarist Toots Suite (blues musician Brownie McGhee), Margaret, the doctor - dies horribly. This causes Margaret's father to demand that he leave town, but of course, he goes back to his hotel room and has rough sex with Epiphany while visions of blood drip down the walls.So - follow me on this - Margaret and her dad were the ones who took Favorite out of the hospital. And the former singer was a sorcerer who sold his soul to the Devil to be famous, but tried to get out of the deal by kidnapping a soldier in Times Square and eating his heart to take the boy's soul. Now in that soldier's body, he went overseas and suffering facial injuries and amnesia during some fighting.If you haven't realized it yet, our protagonist and Johnny Favorite are the same people and the none-so-cleverly named Louis Cypher is the devil himself. And everyone dead in the movie? Yeah, our so-called hero killed them all and then had sex with his granddaughter. Gulp.Although initially supportive of Bonet's decision to make this movie, America's one-time dad Bill Cosby dismissed the results as ""a movie made by white America that cast a black girl, gave her voodoo things to do and have sex"". How did that all work out?De Niro's performance as Louis Cyphere is supposed to be based on his friend and frequent collaberator Martin Scorsese. For what it's worth, it so unnerved Parker that he avoided him during his scenes and let him direct himself.You know, before The Wrestler, so many people forgot just how good Mickey Rourke can be. You should discover that for yourself by going back and watching this for yourself.",Angel Heart
15,Coventry,"Dark, complex and depressing...an outstanding film!!",8,1 August 2004,"Good supernatural thrillers with the incarnation of Satan himself as a pivot figure.we don't see enough of these films, if you ask me. Alan Parker's `Angel Heart' is one of the chosen few! Complex and confusing at times, but warmly recommended to fans of the occult and mysterious cinema. Mickey Rourke shines as protagonist Harry Angel. An unshaved, chain-smoking private eye with a chicken-phobia! The year is 1955 and the place is Brooklyn when Harry is hired by a malevolent Mr. Louis Cyphre (pronounce this name aloud a few times in a row) to find a missing crooner, who got severely traumatized in the war. The money is good and the job doesn't seem that risky, so Harry accepts. Pretty soon, the search takes him to all kinds of poverty, human misery, superstition and alternate religions. Every important figure in the search for Johnny Favorite (the crooner) finds a violent death after Harry talked to them and, apparently, our private detective is a lot more involved than he initially thought. As mentioned before, Angel Heart is a darn complex and very coherent film. One viewing is enough to understand the entire premise and main storylines, but a second (third or fourth) viewing sure isn't redundant. It would be a shame if any of the carefully worked out details and character-connections would go unnoticed. `Angel Heart' (and especially cinematographer Michael Seresin) also receives a huge plus for the dark and depressing portrayal of the film's surrounding. Angel Heart looks unattractive, vile and ominous which creates a superb horrific atmosphere. The supernatural aspects about the story are a bit overly stressed by clichés like silent and staring nuns or foggy New York suburbs. But this small negative element is largely made up by the subtle violence and compelling mystery this film features. The acting is outstanding with Rourke at the absolute top of his career. During the second half of the 80's, Mickey was the unforgettable star of several brilliant films such as `Barfly', `Year of the Dragon', `Nine ½ Weeks' and of course this `Angel Heart'. Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphre was a downright brilliant casting idea! There isn't that much De Niro content in this film but, when he's on screen, evilness nearly drips from the screen. Bobby De Niro is probably one of the only actors who can make it look eerie to eat an egg! Lisa Bonet, in conclusion, isn't the world's most talented actress but Angel Heart sure is her best film. All in one, Angel Heart is a very good film that'll be appreciated by thriller fans and the admirer of slightly more intelligent horror.",Angel Heart

The private dick becomes involved with a teen-aged mother named Epiphany(Lisa Bonet), and ends up in a torrid and graphic sexual encounter. Angel discovers he himself is connected to the missing singer. The love making scene appears to become a brutal rape. I especially enjoyed the scenes featuring the pouring rain in New Orleans. The twist makes for a hard hitting finale. Others in the cast: Charlotte Rampling, Michael Higgins, Brownie McGhee and Dan Florek.

It was adapted from the novel entitled Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg.Written and directed by Alan Parker,the story was set in the 1950's wherein a Brooklyn private eye who was hired to locate a missing pop singer.As the investigator tries to solve the mystery,it turns out that anyone who has a clue to the mystery has come up dead.As always,the critically acclaimed novel has a better story in the book as compared to the movie.But nevertheless,it was still worth the view considering that the cast involved provided a good performance from Rourke,De Niro and surprisingly Bonet.Added to that,it was twisty, erotic and definitely splendid.Too bad that it is under-appreciated by movie goers. Give it a chance and it would not be surprising that one may find it an unpopular gem.",Angel Heart
18,hitchcockthelegend,Watch out for those chickens Harry.,7,25 October 2012,"Angel Heart is directed by Alan Parker and written by William Hjortsberg (novel). It stars Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro and Lisa Bonet. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Michael Seresin.Hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (De Niro), New York private investigator Harry Angel (Rourke) goes to New Orleans in search of missing WWII veteran Johnny Favourite. But once he gets into the case he finds that nothing much makes any sense. Especially as the bodies start to pile up.A mix of detective mystery thriller laced with voodoo horror, nicely furnished with noirish photography and piped with a suitably eerie musical score, Angel Heart is a Sothern Gothic delight. The plot is a bit too murky for its own good at times, and credulity is stretched to breaking point, but the constant sense of unease and the off kilter flow of Harry Angel's journey, ensures its riveting from the start to its wonderfully twisted ending. Rourke is excellent, a ball of sleazy like confusion, De Niro isn't having to do much and he's not in it nearly enough, but never the less he commands the screen with that 80s presence he was so famed for. While Bonet lets go of all her homespun Cosby show niceties to unleash a naked and bloody woman of intrigue.Enjoy the metaphors, enjoy the hoodwinking, enjoy the cast and certainly enjoy the impressive sheen cloaked all over it. Parker has fun making it, you should have fun watching it unravel in front of you. 7.5/10",Angel Heart
19,Hey_Sweden,Immensely enjoyable mystery.,8,2 July 2012,"""Angel Heart"" is a true standout film among director Alan Parkers' filmography: a seedy, depressing, disturbing, provocative, and mesmerizing mystery with all the creepy imagery one could hope for. It begins on a very ominous note and remains gripping all the way through its serpentine story. Mickey Rourke, in one of his very best performances, stars as Harry Angel, low rent NYC private eye hired by mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro, who's fantastic) to locate a vanished crooner named Johnny Favourite. His search leads him from NYC to New Orleans, and with the story (based on the novel ""Falling Angel"" by William Hjortsberg) taking place in the mid-1950s, that merely adds to the overpowering atmosphere. Along the way, the dead bodies start piling up, and Harry finds things just getting more and more gloomy as his search moves inexorably towards its devastating conclusion. I think that a key to this films' success is that it *can* work even for the viewer who knows the major revelations beforehand, or guesses at them early on. It's the gravitas that Parker and his fine cast brings to the proceedings that make it so compulsively watchable. Also appearing are Charlotte Rampling, beautiful as ever, in the role of black magic practitioner Margaret, and the stunning Lisa Bonet, who's memorable in the role of young mother Epiphany. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Pruitt Taylor Vince, as a detective (he acted again for Parker in ""Mississippi Burning""), Kathleen Wilhoite, as a nurse, Michael Higgins as a drug-addicted doctor, musician Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, and Dann Florek ('Law & Order: SVU') as an attorney. As this story plays out, one just knows that whatever Harry finds out, it won't be pleasant, and the dark tone extends to the memorable sex scene, which is erotic and creepy in equal measure. The music score by Trevor Jones is suitably eerie and there's a serving of blues music that is irresistible, adding to the overall experience. In the end there's a strong message about the nature of living a lie, and the final confrontation between two characters is brilliantly subtle, depending on acting rather than spectacle or much in the way of cheese. This represents a solid effort from all concerned. Eight out of 10.",Angel Heart

21,poolandrews,"Everyone else seems to love this, I just can't get that excited about it.",7,13 January 2005,"New York, 1955. Private detective Harold 'Harry' Angel (Mickey Rourke) receives a phone call from a firm of attorneys's called Winesap and Mackintosh. He speaks with Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) who says he has a client named Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro) who wants to talk with him. They arrange to meet. Cypher want's to hire Angel to find a man named Johnny Favourite, Angel agrees to take the case and after discussing specifics with Cypher he sets of for 'the Sarah Dodds Harvest Memorial Clinic' which is where Favourite was definitely last seen. Once there Angel sweet talks a nurse (Kathleen Wilhoite) into letting him look at Favourite's file, the file claims that Favourite was transfered to another hospital in 1943. The evidence doesn't quite add up and Angel becomes suspicious. He goes to see Albert Fowler (Micheal Higgins) who was Favourite's Doctor at the time. As Angel digs deeper and deeper into Favourite's past he encounters violence, murder and dark secrets that have remained hidden for years, until one final terrifying revelation.Written and directed by Alan Parker I thought it was a good film, but not a brilliant one. The script, which is based on a novel called 'Falling Angel' by William Hjortsberg is intriguing, complex and rewarding overall if you put the effort in for sure. But I found the first half of the film somewhat ponderous and I was a little uninterested in where it was all going. Things pick up a little in the second half as the supernatural elements begin to shine through, and of course the twist ending. The problem is that I knew this was all leading up to something and for the most part I was just waiting to see what. The production design by Brian Morris and cinematography by Micheal Seresin is top-notch and combine to give the film a really good atmosphere and look about it. It's very well made and has superb performances from both Rourke and De Niro but as I said I just wasn't 'into' it as many people seem to be. Once you've seen the film it has no re-watch appeal at all, the whole film is just an excuse for a twist ending which may, or may not impress you. There is some minor gore but not much, there is also a little animal cruelty with a cockfight and a chicken that has it's throat slit in a Voodoo ceremony. There is a pretty steamy interracial sex scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet, and various other little bits of nudity here and there. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It's just that I was a little disappointed after hearing so many good things about it. Definitely worth watching but I personally don't think it's the masterpiece many make it out to be.",Angel Heart

If I told you the ending, you would not suffer a bit and could still enjoy this film immensely, but I won't spoil it.It is a deep and dark film, set in 1955 in Harlem and New Orleans. Cheap detectives, voodoo, murder, sex, racism - it's all there to add to the mystery.It is a mystery - a missing person case - where our hero, the two-bit detective (Mickey Rourke) goes looking for a man who has been missing for 12 years. His work takes him to New Orleans, where he gets involved with voodoo and Lisa Bonet (""The Cosby Show"") in her film debut. And, what a debut it was, as she and Rourke gave us a scene that had all the appearance of reality.The film also features Charlotte Rampling, who, while not giving us the show she did in The Night Porter, nevertheless provides a treat as she lies dead with her heart cut out.And, we wouldn't want to leave out Elizabeth Whitcraft (Goodfellas, Working Girl) who gave the most skintastic performance of her career.But, the real credit for the film goes to Robert De Niro, who plays a greasy looking character that hired Rourke, and provided the twisted ending that makes this film a horror classic.",Angel Heart
23,view_and_review,This Is The Infamous Movie,4,8 November 2019,"So this is the movie that got Lisa Bonet removed from The Cosby Show. I was too young to see this movie at the time, I just remember everyone talking about Lisa Bonet doing a bloody sex scene in a movie and that it wasn't commensurate with the values of The Cosby Show.*It looks like Bill Cosby himself wasn't even behaving in a way commensurate with The Cosby Show. But I digress.The sex scene is pretty out there. For starters, Lisa Bonet's character (Epiphany Proudfoot) is only seventeen, which makes her a minor. Add to that that it is 1955 Louisiana and the man she's banging is white. Then, for artistic purposes I suppose, there's blood coming from the walls, the dude is choking her, and there are cinematic cuts to another orgy. It was like they were going for an erotic fireworks finale: violent sex, orgies, and blood. This was some real freaky deeky stuff.That scene didn't make or break the movie, but it certainly didn't help it at all.In the end it was too convoluted. It was some overly-clever religious mumbo jumbo that was a retelling of an old theme. Very uninspiring and all the Lisa Bonet boob shots in the world couldn't help it.",Angel Heart

One of the main issues here is the rather convoluted manner in which the entire mystery is found out, which tends to run all over the place and features a lot of extraneous parts that really could've been streamlined over time as the investigation seems to go on forever without really coming to any real conclusion in most cases, being told rather than fully investigated. That said, the rest of the film is quite enjoyable with a thoroughly involving mystery that needs to be sorted out, a rather potent mixture of black magic and voodoo which creates a nasty atmosphere, an intense and ultimately shocking sex scene thrown in and a rather shocking twist that ends the whole affair nicely.

27,The_Void,Great Mix of Horror and Noir!,9,30 July 2004,"Angel Heart is the successful fusion of two great genres; detective mystery and demonic horror. However, this film is a mystery first, and a horror film second; this is shown by the way that the main emphasis is put on the mystery, and not on gory set pieces and the supernatural side of the movie. The film plays out much like your average neo-noir for the most part, in that a private detective is hired and by means of talking to several people, he is able to follow up his leads to solve the mystery. Angel Heart is no normal murder mystery, however; as within the film is a strong satanic influence, and that is where the film draws it's originality from.The story of Angel Heart revolves around a man, Louis Cyphre (a clever variation on 'Lucifer'), that hires a private dick (Harry Angel) to find a man (Johnny Favourite) that 'owes him a contract'. As previously mentioned; the film plays out like a normal mystery thriller, with the detective investigating his leads and the mystery progressing from there. Angel Heart is very intricate, and this therefore requires the viewer to pay attention to the movie. This is a quality that is admirable in any mystery movie; it makes sure that the audience will pay attention to the film, as missing a moment of the movie could result in you losing the plot. Angel Heart moves slowly and intricately, but it has more than enough to keep anyone interested, most notably an intriguing storyline, some lovely visuals and great performances from all concerned. Angel Heart features a stand out performance from Mickey Rourke; a man that made a few good movies in the 80's, and then somewhat and unfortunately disappeared from our screens (although he did have a great little part in 2003's best movie; Once Upon a Time in Mexico). Mickey Rourke creates just the right atmosphere for his character; Harry Angel is from New York, and this is shown by Rourke's thick accent, the man also has a lot of charisma, which is shown in the character. Aside from Rourke, the movie's other stand out performance comes from Robert DeNiro, in a great little turn as the Devil. Robert DeNiro is a fantastic actor, and he really shows it here; with just a small part in the film, DeNiro manages to make a lasting impression. The way he portrays the character of Satan is also pretty close to the mark of what I would expect Satan to be; it's evil, but it's very subtle evil. The Devil in Angel Heart doesn't go round casting spells or killing people, but just his mannerisms alone are enough to make the audience see that the character is evil; and that really is quite frightening.Despite the obvious openings for the movie to be over the top, it isn't. Despite it's several brutal murders, Angel Heart is very restrained and subtle; and that works to its credit. In fact, there's only one real out of the ordinary part in Angel Heart; and that's the part where Lucifer's and the child's eyes change towards the end. The only other thing of that ilk is the demonic ceremony, which isn't shown on screen. Everything else that we see in the movie stays much within the realms of the real world, and that is another frightening aspect of the film.Overall, Angel Heart is a great movie. Its story is interesting and intricate, the acting is fine and it's also very original. All in all; a great film that should be missed by nobody.",Angel Heart
28,deloudelouvain,Could have been much better. Maybe a remake in the future...,5,13 April 2016,"First of all it's not a horror movie. So I don't get why it is categorized in this genre. It's a mystery thriller, with good actors, but even though the idea of the story is not bad I thought it was poorly executed. But I can't blame the actors because Mickey Rourke is a good actor in Angel Heart, nothing bad to say about him. Normally I don't like remakes but for once I think that this movie could be much better if another director would remake it now. In this version there are actually too much things that don't add up or at least are way too complicated to understand. And to me that's not entertaining. It's too bad because the idea was really good. Even though I actually figured out the whole story after just ten minutes it was still hard to follow. I expected more from Angel Heart so I'm slightly disappointed.",Angel Heart
29,Mr-Fusion,Hard-boiled hoodoo,8,26 October 2016,"The only thing I'd known about ""Angel Heart"" before watching it was that Mickey Rourke plays a hard-luck private eye in an '80s noir. Terror noir's more like it; this thing crosses genres like nobody's business. It is a detective story, but also a plunge into the muddied waters of New Orleans voodoo culture, and the underworld plays a huge part, but to say anything beyond that is giving the movie away. A lot of this movie is creepy imagery, and its pacing is leisurely, but the draw is that you're just as befuddled as Rourke.And *then* Alan Parker hits you square in the mouth with the twist ending; unfurling in not one, but two different surprises. Words can't really describe the scares one feels when witnessing bleeding walls or a baby with Thriller eyes, but those chills are genuine.

30,christopher-underwood,Courtney Pine's wailing saxophone adds to the confusion and menace,8,14 April 2020,"This is a tremendously good looking film and Alan Parker has gone to great lengths to create believable New York and New Orleans 1955 scenes. The rural Louisiana scenes match pretty well what with the cars a wonderful train and locals in costume as well as the open landscape. Perhaps it all looks too good for I found that now and again my lack of concentration on the story left me wondering what I had missed. Mickey Rourke is very good in one of his very best films and De Niro is most effective. The rest of the cast are fine but although the story moves fairly slowly we seem to get introduced to various people in something of a hurry and are caught trying to play catch up with what has just happened. And then everything gets really fast. The major sex scene towards the end is a sensation and amid the sweaty sex there is water through the roof and blood from somewhere. Courtney Pine's wailing saxophone adds to the confusion and menace and from here until the end what has seemed fairly dreamlike turns into a nightmare. Despite all that is great here, and the voodoo scenes are particularly impressive, I'm not convinced that Parker was all that interested in the story itself and he seems to allow it to get a little buried under the extraordinary sets and effects that abound. Slightly more focus might have made this unusual tale even more involving.",Angel Heart

Nothing really works in this enterprise, except the Evergreen Legends Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke, who deliver outstanding performances. De Niro as the evil villain leaves a lasting impression in a cameo appearance. Watch the scene where he offers Rourke an egg, and that proves it all. Rourke on the other-hand is commendable.

32,MovieAddict2016,"Entertaining, thought-provoking/smart, well-acted and brilliantly photographed and directed -- what more could you ask for?",9,2 September 2004,"Angel Heart is a winding psychological thriller that -- in 1987 -- was far ahead of its time. So far that audiences didn't `get it' and the film bombed at the box office. Only now are we beginning to see endings like this one surface in horror movies. Had Angel Heart been made a decade or so later, perhaps it would have succeeded.As it is, the movie  which has a strong cult following and was recently re-released on a Special Edition DVD  is nothing short of mesmerizing. I wouldn't go so far as to call it great, or a `masterpiece,' but it is scary, disturbing, influential, thought-provoking, and a lot smarter and more atmospheric than 99% of the rip-off horror movies being made today.It stars Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a private eye from Brooklyn in the 1950s who is hired by Louis Cyphere (Robert De Niro) to locate a mysterious singer named Johnny Favorite, who disappeared in the early 40s and hasn't been seen since.Angel's journey takes him from the streets of New York to jazz clubs in Harlem and, finally, to the sweltering swamps of Louisiana. He meets a variety of characters, all of who have little to say about Favorite. All we seem to know is that he was a singer, entered the war, and was shot, had his face reconstructed, was taken out of hospital care, and apparently vanished from the face of the earth.I guessed the twist of the movie about seven minutes in, as soon as Robert De Niro appeared on screen during an extended cameo. But that's not to say that the movie won't affect you. Notorious when released for some controversial scenes (including a sequence involving Rourke and The Cosby Show's Lisa Bonet), the movie's moody atmosphere is its strongest element.The acting, too, is very strong. This is Rourke's finest performance, as Harry Angel, a scumbag detective with nothing to lose. On the new DVD, Rourke claims he wasn't very interested in acting at the time, and as a result `just showed up' and `memorized the lines.' I find that hard to believe  Rourke's acting here is Oscar-worthy. His recent descent into self-loathing has caused his career to fall apart (he was never enthusiastic about acting and wanted to become a boxer instead); he shouldn't discredit his earlier work merely because he's upset with his life.The role of Louis Cyphere (get it?) is also one of De Niro's most ambitious performances; he delves entirely into character and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer.It was directed by (Sir) Alan Parker, the famous British filmmaker (of, among others, Midnight Express). Some say this is his finest film  wonderfully crafted, beautifully shot, masterfully edited  and I'd have to say that if it isn't his best, it certainly ranks somewhere at the top.",Angel Heart

34,Red-Barracuda,"Excellent, stylish and sinister neo-noir mystery",10,21 March 2014,"Angel Heart is a film that didn't seem to get a lot of respect on initial release for some reason. I never understood that then and I still don't really now. For me, this is a very stylish and intriguing film that has many good things about it. Its story centres on a Brooklyn private eye who is hired by a mysterious stranger to find a missing singer who owes him a debt. Everywhere he goes a trail of gruesome ritualistic murders follow. The setting is a very big part of the success of the movie and one of the reasons it has aged so well. 1950's Brooklyn, Harlem, Coney Island and Louisiana are all invoked extremely effectively and give the movie a real sense of place and atmosphere. Likewise, specific settings are well used such as the creepy evangelical church in New York or the backwater bayou in New Orleans. Intensifying the feeling is a really effective, haunting jazz soundtrack. All these things combined make for a very potent mood and atmosphere. Director Alan Parker needs to be given a lot of credit here for this. His direction is excellent and the moments of cinematic style he uses are all, not only extremely well executed, but also really effective in building atmosphere and dread. Sometimes it's totally innocuous details like tap dancing feet that are edited in such a way as to signify impending horror, similarly recurring imagery of lifts, fans and staircases are given a somewhat sinister feeling. Other times, the material is much more direct such as the notorious sex scene or the psychological flash-backs that Harry Angel experiences every so often. While little details like the mysterious nun whose face Harry never quite sees are very well integrated and scary. In other words, stylistically Angel Heart is a real success.All of this would be well and good but what takes it up a level further is the fact that the central mystery is very compelling. It has plenty of noirish detail and characters but is given further value by the way it intermingles this with voodoo and jazz music. It makes for a pretty distinctive concoction it has to be said. The production values in general seem very good here and the period detail is never less than completely convincing. The icing on the cake is of course the casting. Mickey Rourke was at the height of his powers at this time and he effortlessly fits the character of Harry Angel. Robert De Niro is very sinister in a slightly unusual role for him. Lisa Bonet is pretty memorable as the girl who Angel dalliances with in New Orleans, while Charlotte Rampling's icy persona is utilised well as a sinister fortune-teller. All-in-all, there is a considerable amount of excellent things about this production and its lukewarm response back in the 80's remains baffling.",Angel Heart

You get a very uncomfortable chill up your spine, like Angel does, when Cyphre tells him that he's looking for Favorite for one and one reason only: to have him pay off a debt that he owes him and get the impression from Cyphre's tone of voice that the debt is to be paid not in money but in blood!Eerie and nerve-racking thriller with Harry Angel trying to track down and find, dead or alive, the very illusive Johnny Favorite with the leads he comes up with in his investigation back in NYC has Angel traveling to New Orleans.

36,Lejink,Devilishly good,8,27 April 2014,"One of my favourite films and yet Alan Parker wasn't the type of director I'd figure could turn in such a dark, gripping voodoo-noir as he does here.It actually hurts the film that you can work out DeNiro's character straight away from the moment he signs his name, but even so Parker ratchets up the tension as he sends 50's private detective on a wild goose (or should that be chicken) race trying to track down an old 30's crooner who, like doomed bluesman Robert Johnson that same decade, fancifully made a similar deal with the devil in exchange for his gift of music. In the end, he didn't have to look so hard, but even with the viewer knowing the denouement well in advance of the finish, still Parker cooks up a pungent gumbo of a plot, with steamy sex, incest, gory murders and diabolical undertones, filmed in a deliberately washed-out way as the film tries so hard to be the black and white noir its director wanted it to be.Extremely well cast and played, Rourke, pre-Botox, gives his face the chance to act and is just right as the persistent but perplexed down-at-heel private detective whose personal journey to ID Johnny Favourite ends with a return ticket to hell. De Niro plays his part with the requisite mix of devilish charm and beguiling charm while the very young Lisa Bonet, fresh-faced and just out of family TV show ""The Cosby Show"" gives a passable performance, perhaps just lacking that little bit of womanly experience to really have you believe she understands the part. Parker is to be commended for his vision with constantly changing background shots and the use of symbolic totems like old- fashioned electric fans and of course that ever-descending lift. I also loved the Times Square recreation, right in front of the couple kissing in that famous black and white V.E. day photograph (you know the one!).""Angel Heart"" is not for the faint-hearted (my wife hated it, for example), but for me it was an engrossing and rewarding watch and certainly made my heart pound a little faster as it reached its climax.",Angel Heart
37,ElMaruecan82,"Pervert, graphic, disturbing ... I loved it ...",8,9 October 2013,"Emulating many non-American filmmakers and American movies' admirers, such as Melville, Polanski or Kurosawa, the British Alan Parker ended up making the best tribute to the movies that nourished his cinematic dreams: a film noir.In '78, Parker proved his value as an atmospheric director with the nightmarish ""Midnight Express"", but only in the reverse year of '87, he could fully express his personal skills, because of the very requirements of the genre. Indeed, whether you expect a detective story or a horror/thriller, the result has to be highly atmospheric, and in the case of ""Angel Heart"", the epithet is a huge understatement.The film opens in January 1955, with Mickey Rourke, as a down-at-heel and down-to-earth Brooklyn detective, charming with ladies, cynical at times, but never failing to look sympathetic. On that level, Rourke embodies his role like a successor of Bogie and Brando tailor-made for the 80's. His co-star, not the least, is Robert De Niro as a sinisterly suave rich man, holding a cane under pointing fingernails and a heavy thick beard that makes him look like the evil twin of Martin Scorsese. The film is also stars Lisa Bonet, taking a risky, yet effective, departure from the family-oriented Cosby Show.The beginning feels like a faithful reminiscence of hard-boiled Raymond Chandler's stories, with the typical dark and shadowy shots of New York's streets, until it suddenly takes us to a creepy journey into a weird devil-worship and voodoo-culture in New Orleans. In the process, Angel Heart reveals his fear of chickens and avoidance of mirrors that make his presence in New Orleans even more uncomfortable. His interactions with Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) are effectively creepy but De Niro finds the right note in his performance, keeping so much coolness in a rather hot setting that we never give a second thought about his name.Angel's mission is to find a crooner and WWII veteran named Johnny Favorite, who has an old business to settle with Cyphre. Angel goes to the hospital where Favorite is supposed to be cured from shell-shock, and finds out from the morphine-addict doctor that the records have been falsified to let a man and a woman take Favorite to the South. Locking the doctor without morphine, Angel expects more information, but when he comes back, the doctor strangely turned into a corpse, all signs indicating it was quite a brutal murder. This is the starter of a series of fresh corpses punctuating Angel's track, and pointing the same accusing finger on him.Cyphre meets a reluctant Angel again and accepts to pay him 5000 dollars to find Favorite's new whereabouts in New Orleans. Angel gets in touch with all the persons who knew Favorite, professionally and privately, from a musician to a fortune teller played by Charlotte Rampling, but the closer he gets to the truth, using his street-smarts and occasionally his way with ladies, the more enemies he makes. He tries to contact Favorite's secret love, only to find out that she's dead, leaving her only child, Epiphany Proudfoot, Bonet as a precocious 17-year old mother. A strange relationship grows with a disturbing smell of deviation, peaking at the infamous love scene.Naturally, Alan Parker indulges himself to the most gruesome details like during the frenetic sex scene, when pours of rains turn into blood, as to suggest a disturbing correlation between sex and violence, as if both were the rotten fruits of the same evil tree. The sordid details don't shock either because the religious undertones that fill the story make them strangely acceptable. The merit of the disturbing voodoo-scene where an entranced Bonet slits a chicken's throat and hysterically dance with her blood-covered face is to desensitize us enough to the sight of blood to handle the ultimate confrontation.So it comes to this, ""Angel Heart"" is a film of heavy, threatening and nightmarish atmosphere, a sort of dead-trap no one can get away from it, not even Angel, and this is why the conclusion was the only satisfying one, it does provide disturbing answers but we never discuss their plausibility because we had already been plunged in that supernatural universe, made of animal sacrifices, creepy talismans, smelly herbs and heart-pounding cries. And the ending makes the cinematography's point, by highlighting the curse of a humanity carrying evil germs in its dirty womb, from the sordid streets of New York to the dirty swamps of the Bayou.""Angel Heart"" has often been praised for being a mix of ""Chinatown"" and ""The Exorcist"", but in its own way, Alan Parker recreated the 50's more realistically than Polanski's treatment of the 30's, and with its predominance of black and red, some details gets even scarier than ""The Exorcist"", I'm thinking of the sex scene with Lisa Bonet that even rivals with the infamous crucifix moment. Visually speaking, the film is a spectacular masterpiece showing how far a director can pushes the button of morbidity, almost having fun with it. And to keep on the religious vocabulary, the film is blessed with magnificent cities and stairs shot, working as a true homage of German expressionist cinema, making the color feel like it's black and white.And God, there is Rourke's performance that even surpasses De Niro during the mind-blowing last minute. Both Angel's coming-to-realization and your own understanding of ""Angel Heart"", cut straight to yours, literally. And I have goose bumps remembering his raspy scream and his repeated denial ""I know who I am"". Why, one thing you sure is, Mickey is one hell of an actor, and your performance as Angel, proves it.The most memorable shot of ""Angel Heart"" is of an old Otis elevator cage interminably descending into an unknown destination  and while watching the film, I had the feeling I was the one trapped in that cage with Alan Parker as a sadistic bellboy grinning at the anticipation of what I would find when the door opens.",Angel Heart
38,g-bodyl,A Visually Stunning Cult Thriller!,9,13 May 2014,"I have heard some things about Angel Heart, but I wasn't sure what kind of film I was expecting. What I saw is something that is a little bit of a cult horror Gothic classic. It wasn't frighteningly scary, but it sure was thrilling at times and often pretty violent. The acting is solid and this is one of the better films by Mickey Rourke. Of course, there is a bonus when Robert de Niro is involved.Alan Parker directed a film about a private detective who has been hired by a client to find a man named Johnny. But in his search, he finds many weird and unusual things that may turn out to be so much more...The acting is really good. Mickey Rourke, who makes a living playing such unclean rag-tag characters, is really good as the private detective, Harry Angel. Robert De Niro, who gets top billing, but does not have many lines, but he still is very good. In Lisa Bonet's first film role, boy she's pretty weird.Overall, this is a really intense psychological horror film. It's a strange film that mystifies all these cults that appear in the movie. As a detective film, it plays it by the book but the movie is still well-made. This has the makings of a cult classic and it seems to have been criminally underseen. The visuals are also rather striking and rich, which surprised me. I rate this film 9/10.",Angel Heart
39,kenjha,Uneven Mystery,5,9 September 2006,"In 1950s Brooklyn, private eye Rourke is hired by the mysterious De Niro to track down a missing person. Rourke gives perhaps his best performance as the two-bit detective who is seemingly in over his head as dead bodies start piling up in his wake. Parker creates an excellent atmosphere in evoking 1950s New York and New Orleans. The first two-third of the film is fairly intriguing as Rourke follows his leads. However, the finale is a big letdown, resorting to silliness in trying to explain the mystery and thereby undermining everything that has gone on before. Bonet is alluring in her film debut but this controversial role probably hurt her career.",Angel Heart

41,paulclaassen,Memorable 80s horror thriller.,6,9 July 2021,"I can't decide whether I view this all-star cast horror thriller as a masterpiece, or as an excuse for a display of nudity and voodoo.The film is set in 1955 New York. Mickey Rourke stars as private detective Harry Angel, who gets hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert de Niro) to find out if a certain Johnny Favorite, or Liebling, is still alive. His investigation takes him on a rollercoaster journey of fear, with people involved in the case dying around him.The suspense is pretty well set up. I enjoyed the sense of mystery, and Cyphre himself as a very mysterious character. Hail to the cinematographer for a job very well done. Certainly from a cinematography point of view, this was masterfully done. The performances from the entire cast is also very good and believable.There's a lot of reference to black magic and voodoo, and false prophets. And then there's the sensual element, with plenty of frontal nudity - some subtle, some in your face. My main criticism in 'Angel Heart' is the main character smoking too much - maybe because of the sponsor, Camel? It was rather obvious and a bit annoying.The film does feel a bit slow at times, but nevertheless remains interesting thanks to the mystery. There's a shocking twist indicating evil was at work all along. 'Angel Heart' is a film that will no doubt appeal to an acquired taste only, but I believe definitely deserves a watch.Would I watch it again? Having seen it twice already, I doubt it.",Angel Heart
42,Rodrigo_Amaro,All That Mystery Was Brilliant,10,20 January 2011,"This is one of the best film noir ever made and one of the most memorable released in the 1980's along with ""Body Heat"" (coincidence that both movies have Mickey Rourke starring). But ""Angel Heart"" is not like ""Body Heat"" because it follows into other direction, there's some similarities between both films. The mystery here is given to a Brooklyn detective named Harry Angel (Rourke) contacted by a mysterious and sinister man called Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro, in one of his most scariest performances ever) who wants to discover the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, a popular singer who disappeared after the Second World War. Following some strange clues the detective seems to be attracting and adding more and more deaths with individuals involved with this Johnny Favorite. As the usual films noir goes along with mysteries and charades there's also a female companion for the hero, a beautiful girl played by Lisa Bonet, who is involved in the situation and better stop right here without saying why she's important. The plot is incredibly well written, the ending is very satisfying, memorable and before you hold the mystery pieces together you'll see that everything makes sense. But if you can't figure out what happened in the ending go to the IMDb's FAQ and see the story told in order (I understood, but some connections didn't worked quite well, but after looking the FAQ's it was more interesting how the whole thing was made). ""Angel Heart"" is not only a film noir. It's a great story about fighting big and great dangers, entering in darker worlds, meeting sinister figures, powerful forces of evil, and seeing at the end how they make you stronger or weaker depending on your view. Will Harry discover who Johnny Favorite is? What's his importance? Who is Louis Cypher? (pay attention to this name). The only hint I give you, and I don't think no one mentioned this anywhere is the words/things with ""CH"" that seems to have a deeper and negative reaction on the detective: he hates chickens, churches and... if you're smart enough you'll get the third clue by watching the movie.Alan Parker directs a great film, unforgettable in every sense from the magnificent performances to the cinematography and editing, everything works great. It delivers suspense, tension, dramatical moments, sensuality and more. One of my favorite films! 10/10",Angel Heart
43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A melting pot of suspenseful genres mixed pretty well,7,9 July 2009,"""Angel Heart"" is a '50 noir-style murder mystery done in the 1980s in living -- and bleeding -- color. It's a very straightforward story that ends up being more than meets the eye, mixing in horror and satanic elements to become a one-of-a-kind thriller.Private detective Harry Angel (Rourke) takes on a case to locate an old-time crooner named Johnny Favourite, who has been missing since WWII. He is hired by Louis Cyphre (De Niro) who has an ""unfinished contract"" with Favourite. It's fairly apparent that the devil is owed someone's soul, but Angel doesn't pick up on these clues as obviously as we do. Angel goes from name to name in search of people who knew Favourite and a trail of murder follows mysteriously behind him.Other than the delightfully creepy performance by De Niro, director and adapter Alan Parker deserves the praise for the enjoyable parts of this movie, namely it's suspense. His use of heartbeats for this dreadful suspense effect and the way he intercuts the scenes of shocking discovery with normal ones (such as a boy tap dancing in the streets of New Orleans) is nearly adrenaline-pumping. His depiction of rotating objects such as the fan and elevator cable spool is a bit blunt, but stylishly effective.Being an '80s film, you definitely get a sense of movement toward the modern thriller as we know it today. The style of the film, its pacing, its tendency to sit quietly at times and be introspective -- these are things we've come to know from the genre 20 years later, but as a '50s period piece as well, there's a definite tribute to film noir in the characterization and acting. Rourke's Angel is much like those P.I.s that get in too deep from the '30s and '40s. The dialogue too is very much the same way.Not spectacular but not disappointing, ""Angel Heart"" is entertaining and certainly unique. People who are into movies that involve elements of satanism, where the devil is a character, will certainly enjoy it more, but most will get enjoyment out of its classic mystery structure and intriguing twist.",Angel Heart
44,videorama-759-859391,"Exciting 1987 thriller fare, that time in no way has changed",9,9 March 2014,"For it's time, which was 1987, here's one film that pushed the bounds of controversy and that's how I always felt it, snd I still feel the same today, looking back on it. I love this movie, it's my favourite thriller. Set in 1955, the whole cinematography, is truly amazing, honestly capturing the period, one hundred percent with such interesting sets, backdrops, and detail, down to the smallest knick knac, probably about the best period I've seen. Rourke's apparel is perfect too. Rourke, in still one of his best ever performances, plays small time PI, chicken phobic Harry Angel, who's offered a hefty fee by a mysterious and slightly menacing character, Louis Cyphre (a flawless memorable performance from Deniro) to track down a musician, Johnny Favourite, who was into a lot more than just music, and could already be six feet under. His investigation leads him through Harlem, and the dangerous New Orleans, where he encounters a few incidents with some nasty looking thugs, warning him to cease his snooping. Only everyone Harry questions, winds up dead in some bloody gruesome ways, where even the castration of one 'em, a blue singers, is inferred. The gore is actually stylish and heavy. Even at it's we seen an unrelated victim who's had his throat slashed. Too that controversial goes too far scene, with Bonet and Rourke starkers, sc..wing where blood becomes an illusion of rain running down the wall, until their bodies are showered and drenched in it, I admit, had me thinking it'd gone too far on my few view, but those are the movies our sickies love the best, and this was one of those films. Another subject is thrown into too- voodoo, which intensifies it's creepiness, an angle I loved, where you won't believe Bonet does while partaking in a dance. I must say the background work of the plot is great, where at the end, you'll learn why all of the murdered are murdered, and brutally too, and why Harry as one private dick says, ""Burns"". A thoroughly engrossing, psychological thriller, while being an unsettling and foreboding journey, for nearly all it's running time, with danger at many a turn. A bucket list movie must. A definite winner.",Angel Heart

I could go into a diatribe/editorial concerning what makes good horror, but I'll save that for the message boards. What makes THIS a good horror is a mixture of the classic Noir style, Mickey Rourke's charisma, an awesome screenplay, good direction, some decent effects, and Lisa Bonet. Yes, that's what I said: Lisa Bonet of the Cosby Show. She is an absolute delight in this production, centered around the Louisiana Bayou, ancient religions (though muddled heavily by an injection of Christian myth), intrigue, suspense, and some heavy (but great) atmosphere.If you are a horror fan, this is a must see.

46,jtindahouse,A good ending but painfully boring up until that point,6,30 March 2021,"When looking through 1987 films to find one to watch I came across a film I had never heard of before 'Angel Heart'. It had Robert De Niro, Mickey Rourke in his prime, an interesting sounding plot and an 'X' rating (which I had to look up what it meant). I immediately knew this was going to be my 1987 film of choice. The actual product was a bit of a let down I'm sorry to say.The biggest and most glaring problem this film has is simply that it's painfully boring. A mystery of sorts is set up and then we watch the character of 'Angel' going from person to person asking around trying to find a guy. We are given no reason to care about this mystery and very little along the way to mix things up and keep it interesting. Now I understand that there is more going on beneath the surface, as we later find out, but that doesn't help the 100 minutes of runtime that we have to sit through twiddling our thumbs.The only things that save this film are Rourke giving a very charismatic and committed performance, De Niro giving us absolute gold in his unfortunately very limited screentime, and also an above average twist ending. Without that ending I suspect this film would not have the positive perception about it that people seem to have. I enjoyed the ending undoubtedly but it wasn't enough to redeem the tedious runtime that leads up to that. This one wasn't for me.",Angel Heart
47,hellraiser7,The Hellbound Heart,10,3 September 2019,"The Detective/Noir genre have always been about protagonists pursuing the truth in the case they work on. It's always a rewarding feeling for both us and the protagonists once they get down to the bottom of it, which lets us know their long struggle and pursuit was totally worth it. But what if there is a case in which the truth you pursue isn't a plenty one and the pursuit leads you into someplace you don't want to be, where there's no escape.This is one of my favorite films of all time, this film really was something different in both the horror and detective/noir genre. Both genres I always felt were a beautiful combination as it helps make the horror subgenre ""paranormal investigation.Both genres in a way have similar elements, with horror there is always that touch of mystery as the protagonists don't know what danger their dealing with; and with noir the protagonist/s their hunt the truth puts them in constant danger of becoming the hunted. There was also not that many in the subgenre of horror at the time, from TV shows like ""The X-Files"" and the graphic comic series ""Constantine: Hellblazer""; this film in a way sort of predates both of them, heck the film's story could of easily of been a spin off story within the world of the ""Hellblazer"" comic series.The cinematographic and the production is great. The film is sort of a period piece as it's set in the 1950's and we see a version of Brooklyn and New Orleans and everything in them from a time long gone, the cars, building structures and even styles all to a tee.But I also like how the film really creates this foreboding atmosphere, from the beginning where we see Brooklyn enveloped in darkness and cold, which not just invokes the throwback feel to the noirs but also an almost supernatural sense as you feel there is something unnatural about this darkness as if a force of evil has it's hands on the city and all the creatures that stir within it's sight.There is also the grim and grit you see throughout this as we see in some locations it looks as though the interior and exterior of them look like places that have seen better days. As well as in some places there are some strange and unfamiliar decorations around. This not just adds to the atmosphere but also helps present a world where there is danger at every turn or shadow, but also how nothing is what it seems.The music is excellent, the music is done by one of my favorite movie composers Trevor Jones. Really like how some of the score seems to be a mix of some of the saxophone, piano but also just eerie somber tunes that really reflect the mix of both genres. But really give the film the feeling of danger as well as mystery.The characters are pretty good, Mickey Rourke whom at the time looked like Bruce Willis, he's an underrated actor and this to me is probably my favorite role from him. His character Harry Angel is a likeable protagonist and somewhat sympathic. He's the typical old-fashioned detective from the noirs of yesteryear. But I like that he's charismatic he's got a lot of good lines like my favorite is ""today is Wednesday, it's anything can happen day"" that I've always believed is true and that's my day from my astrological personal profile.But there are some emotional layers to his character as he's a man that has been worn down from the war, even his own occupation and residence as he's seen so much or too much all around him. He's a guy that's on the loner side, he's not a person that has big dreams though he might have once, he's more a person that is always looking for something in life anything. Unfortunate he might find more than he bargained for.Robert De Nero is just excellent as Louis Cyphere whom despite not being in the film that much, he really invokes a great presence throughout beginning to end. The scenes when he's there are just excellent. I really love how his character just has this sharp calm charisma to him which makes him likeable.But he's enigmatic, hence his last name Cyphere, you can see from some of the dialogue and in his eyes this guy knows more than he's letting on. There is also you sense something sinister and unsettling about him, there is one scene where he then makes a religious reference about the egg representing the soul and then suddenly eats it but maintains a stare at the main protagonist. I'll admit that scene gave me a small chill as it seems like he's eating Harry's soul.But what really drives this film is in the thought provoking and constant developing mystery and suspense. Throughout the film Harry and ourselves are just going from one place to another, one thing leads to another.As we get much deeper in the mystery things just get more intriguing and even stranger, which results in more questions than answers. From some quick clips of a flashback on Harry's experiences we wonder how is Harry's past connected with the current case or even the identity dark mysterious figure in what looks like black funerary outfit with a heavy black veil we see in spots throughout the film.I even like how throughout the film you see Harry is always looking into the mirror, he always has that same look which asks the same question ""who are you?"" this is the same question we start to ask latter in the film.The suspense in the film is great as we get deeper into the mystery, our sense of doom and dread grows more and more. Everything that Harry and we find out or occurring are all adding all up to something, but we know in the back of our mind that it's not good. What makes this all the scarier is that it may already be too late to escape.I really like how religion comes into play in this film, all three of them to be exact from voodoo, satanism, and Christianity. In a way all three of them have one think in common which is in the pursuit of truth, a higher one that exists.But I like that the film in a way is a bit of a Christian film, as we do see the Christian faith along with a familiar figure come into play in the film. And there is a little them about sin and how it can really destroy people just as it destroyed some of the people Harry interviewed. Or people that have tempted fate or messed with powers beyond their own control and eventually payed the price.And of course, it comes down to the twist reveal which I'll admit was something I honestly didn't see coming a mile away. However, what really makes this revelation even more powerful and scary is that it all makes sense.Beware in your pursuit of whatever truth you seek, it could cost you your soul.Rating: 4 stars",Angel Heart
48,strong-122-478885,A Sleazy P.I.'s Search For Himself,4,4 September 2014,"Movie quote - ""Someone cut his dick off, stuffed it in his mouth, and choked him to death."" To me, I saw Angel Heart as being director Alan Parker's statement about his deep-rooted hatred towards blacks.I mean, Parker certainly went well out of his way to emphasize racism, big-time, in this picture and make blacks out to be the most clueless, most gullible, most voodoo-loving idiots imaginable.Personally I view voodoo & religion as being, pretty much, one and the same thing. To me, religion is clearly whites' idea of ""civilized"" voodoo. Nothing more. Nothing less.And, once again, (just like in 9 1/2 Weeks) actor Mickey Rourke proved that he needed neither good looks, nor likable screen-charisma, nor any noteworthy talent to be one of Hollywood's top-ranking stars of the 1980s. (With Rourke I still remain completely baffled by what brought about his vast popularity in the movies during the days of his youth) Angel Heart is clearly one of those frustratingly confused and convoluted stories that (in all of its demented confusion) gives away its surprise, twist ending far too early in the show.And, actor Robert De Niro as the drab, soul-collecting Lucifer (with his immaculately manicured fingernails) was a bore of the highest order. Like, as though Satan, himself, would be the one going after the ones who had welshed on giving over their souls when their contract expired. That, I'm sure, would be a job for one of his henchmen to deal with.Yeah. OK. Angel Heart did contain some very striking imagery, at times, and the fairly explicit sex scene that took place between the Epiphany & Angel characters was quite startling to behold - But, in the long run, this film was a certified limp banana as far as its ""Noir"" aspect was concerned.And, yes, it fell flat on its face when it came to the impact of its horror element, as well.",Angel Heart
49,ianlouisiana,Here comes Mr Jordan - or Trans - Stygian equivalent..................,9,11 October 2008,"A couple of nights back I saw Mickey Rourke interviewed on TV by Piers Morgan.Mr Morgan's essential English politeness and unwillingness to offend actually brought rather more out of Mr Rourke than a more direct in your face approach might have done.Mr Rourke's slightly bizarre appearance - the result of some ill - judged cosmetic surgery - was completed by his sporting that absolute adjunct of 1980's celebrity the pony tail as he shambled into his favourite New York bar to answer,or in many cases not to answer,Mr Morgan's courteously put questions. In respect of his early experiences in the Actors' Studio Mr Rourke was open enough,but it became clear that,further down the line in his career, having got what he wanted he no longer wanted it,so to speak.His ill - advised political comments about ""A prayer for the dying"" alienated most of his large British audience,and he has been ""forgotten but not gone"" cinematically speaking for many years here in the UK.Prior to Morgan's interview I last saw Mr Rourke on the small screen he was apparently coked to the eyeballs at the Cannes Film Festival,unable to string two sentences together.He had obviously made a tremendous effort to get his life back on track,which is good news both for him personally and for admirers of his peculiar intense but internalised style of acting. This reached its height in ""Angel Heart"",a splendid Alan Parker movie which looks deeply into the question ""Do you really know who you are?"" Starting within the conventions of the 1940-1950s Private Eye pictures it neatly changes between genres as it progresses.Mr R.de Niro plays The Devil incarnate on earth to claim a soul long past its sell - by date.

50,dee.reid,One of the creepiest thrillers ever made,10,15 December 2001,"Harry Angel(Mickey Rourke) is a sleazy private detective in 1955 New York. One day, Harry is approached by a mysterious lawyer named Louis Cyphre(Robert De Niro).  Louis also has unusually long fingernails and needs help in searching for a former client of his who disappeared mysteriously without ever paying him back.  So Harry begins his investigation which takes him from the dark alleys and streets of New York to the hot, musty bayous of Louisiana.  While there, he meets up with Epiphany Proudfoot(Lisa Bonet) who is a voodoo priestess and soon enough Harry becomes caught up in voodoo mysticism.This is the first movie directed by Alan Parker that I've seen and is also the movie that introduced me to Mickey Rourke.  The movie has a really dark atmosphere and I really like the heartbeat on the soundtrack that helps to build the tension.  ""Angel Heart"" ranks up there with those really twisted supernatural thrillers like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"".  Why this movie hasn't gotten much attention over the last fourteen years I'll never know.  What really makes this movie good is probably its 1950s setting which gives ""Angel Heart"" some originality.  The film's ending just gives me the creeps because it just comes at you from out of no where and there is nothing that hints it.  Viewers should also be cautioned when watching ""Angel Heart"" because it is extremely bloody and then of course there is that love scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet which stirred up a little bit of controversy when it was first released back in 1987.

52,mjneu59,supernatural noir,4,3 November 2010,"By comparing it to both 'The Exorcist' and 'Chinatown' the makers of 'Angel Heart' have painted themselves into an awkward corner, admitting they don't fully trust their own feature to succeed on its own (admittedly slim, and in this case purely cosmetic) merits. Spurious similarities aside, the film has little to offer other than a few atmospheric occult thrills with Film Noir pretensions. The plot follows a stylishly seedy New York detective named Harry Angel, hired by mysterious 'businessman' Louis Cyphre (say the name aloud fast) to track down a missing person in debt to Cyphre for more than just money. The bewildering trail of clues introduces Angel to various pagan rituals in and around New Orleans (including an interlude of voodoo sex with Lisa Bonet), leading finally to a macabre and gruesome conclusion that spoils the moody air of unease by its over-explicit reference to the film's title. If the giveaway character names aren't obvious enough, consider Mr. Cyphre's shaggy hair and sharpened fingernails; the only details missing are a forked tongue and cloven feet. How Robert De Niro became involved in this oddly compelling piece of crap is the strangest mystery of all.",Angel Heart
53,Lechuguilla,It Oozes Thick Atmosphere,8,30 June 2013,"Mostly a detective story, with a little voodoo and supernatural thrown in, ""Angel Heart"" stands out from other films for its style and thick atmosphere. Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a two-bit private detective who takes a job that requires him to find a mysterious and famous crooner from the past, named Johnny Favorite.The story, set in 1955 and mostly in New Orleans, is fairly convoluted, with important events taking place a dozen years before 1955. As such, the dialogue contains an enormous amount of exposition, combined with some flashbacks. I think the script could have been improved by including a prologue set in 1943, showing generalized events without giving away plot twists. In so doing, all that exposition could have been avoided.Despite a somewhat weak script, the film veritably oozes heavy atmosphere. Sultry music; interior shadows and muted colors; and those 1950s visuals, with its hairstyles, old cars, and drab clothes combine to create an eerie framework conducive to murder and spiritualism in the bayou country of Louisiana, a delicious cinematic cocktail of mystery and suspense.Nonprofessional actors fill some roles, which heightens a sense of realism, as does the filming of most scenes in real locations instead of built sets. A few scenes are too violent and bloody for my taste, but are mercifully rare.In the role of Harry Angel, former boxer Mickey Rourke gives a really good performance, physical and spontaneous. Indeed, most performances in this film are above average.The script is the film's somewhat weak link. But it is more than offset by potent imagery, atmospheric music, on-location filming, appropriate casting and good performances. ""Angel Heart"" is a fine detective thriller with an atmosphere that's as thick as homemade jambalaya.",Angel Heart
54,smatysia,Rourke's (and Bonet's) best work,9,4 July 2004,"Really loved this film when I first saw it. I'm not one who goes to great lengths trying to anticipate the ending, so I wasn't way ahead of the game when the big revelations came. I discovered them at the same time the character did, which made the film much more enjoyable than otherwise. This was Mickey Rourke's best work. I thought that he had a huge future ahead of him, but it really didn't pan out. Between this and Barfly, I figured him to have a lot of range, but apparently I was wrong. As for Lisa Bonet, I thought she was very good here, too. I never saw her TV character, but it didn't seem surprising that she would want to play against type in her first big film. Too bad it didn't work out for her either. De Niro looked to be having great fun with his role. Good marks to Charlotte Rampling, also. I never understood why Angel had his ""problem"" with chickens, unless it was just to set up that one little throwaway vignette in one of the chase scenes. I also do not understand the repeated motif of fans. But anyway, this is a very good flick, even with its convoluted plot. Grade: A+",Angel Heart

56,yusufpiskin,"""Mise-en-scène""",8,2 April 2020,"Stylish, steamy Southern Noir that ups sticks early on, leaving behind the shadows of the city for the slow heat of the Louisiana bayous, where the gumbo is always on the boil, voodoo is in the air and life moves at its own pace. Into this mix comes Brooklyn PI, Harry Angel; a small-time investigator with a hot missing persons case on his hands. The mysterious Johnny Favorite disappeared 12 years earlier with a debt to pay and Angel's client has decided it's time to settle his account.The film isn't without its faults - some of the supporting acting is pretty wooden, the script isn't exactly an exercise in subtlety (Louis Cyphre? Cummon now) and I could see a lot of the twists coming from a ways off - but one thing Alan Parker really excels at is style. So much style! He never misses a beat, with the pitch black shadows crawling across hyper-stylized sets, hard-boiled attitude in the DNA of a skittish jazz soundtrack whose saxophones bubble away darkly in the background, occasionally boiling over at the critical juncture. Aesthetically, this is Neo Noir done right.Mickey Rourke is good in the lead role too, dishevelled and underhand but roguishly charming with it; there's something of the John Constantine about Harry Angel - a dark-hearted antihero trailing a helix of cigarette smoke behind him on his way down to hell.",Angel Heart
57,barnabyrudge,Very strange thriller with a twist ending that you will either love or hate.,5,12 July 2006,"Alan Parker crafts a weird, absorbing, but ultimately rather silly mystery-thriller with this film. Taken from a novel by William Hjortsberg, and adapted for the screen by Parker himself, this movie undeniably contains its fair share of intriguing moments and ideas, but it stumbles at the very death by providing a twist revelation that stretches all the credibility that has gone before. I know of people who rather like the ending, but in my eyes it just doesn't quite fit. The film unravels as an engrossing and perfectly well-crafted mystery, but the final scene slides off into the realms of Faustian horror and fantasy. It's an ending that you will either love or hate. I hated it. Having said that, there is enough in the earlier sections of the film to admire, and it would be unfair of me to dismiss the whole film simply because the final few minutes don't work in my opinion.In 1955, New York private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a missing man. The missing man, a big band singer called Johnny Favorite, seemingly broke the terms of a contract with Cyphre and is now sought by the latter for his deception. Angel quickly establishes that Johnny Favorite went to fight in the Second World War and was severely injured during the fighting. However, Angel also discovers that Johnny was mysteriously taken away from the nursing home where he was under care after the War, and no-one seems quite sure of his present whereabouts. Angel follows a trail of clues to the voodoo community of New Orleans, where he meets poor bayou girl Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and finds himself lusting after her. Gradually, Angel becomes more and more aware that he is involved in a very sinister mystery indeed, the solution to which may affect him more personally than he could ever imagine.The good points include strong performances by Rourke and De Niro, the former holding the film together with his edgy interpretation of the scruffy, moody hero; and the latter doing well in his handful of scenes as the creepy client. Thrown into the mix are various bloody murders, elements of satanism and occultism and lots of doomy dialogue, none of it remotely convincing although it DOES lend the film a suitably nightmarish atmosphere. Staying on the plus side, Trevor Jones provides a good score which adds a degree of creepiness to the proceedings. On the negative side, Parker gets rather too sidetracked by what he perceives to be the seedier aspects of his film. The violence is deliberately  and excessively  unpleasant, and there's a bizarrely pretentious (and controversial) scene in which Rourke and Bonet have sex, somewhat vigorously, while blood drips down onto them from the ceiling. At 113 minutes, the film feels slightly overlong, or at least certainly too lengthy for this particular story. And the twist ending is a let-down too, as noted already.Angel Heart remains worth watching for its intriguing elements, but on the whole it is a rather flawed film which falls agonisingly short of its potential.",Angel Heart
58,dworldeater,Great film!,9,25 August 2016,"Angel Heart is a sharp looking, well acted, tightly directed dark thriller that is quite complex and well made. Director Alan Parker blends mystery private detective story with supernatural horror very well, with lots of atmosphere and suspense to boot. The cast is excellent with Mickey Rourke as the leading man and scruffy faced private detective and employed by the mysterious figure Louis Cypher to track down crooner Johnny Favorite. Deniro is great as the prince of darkness and throw in Lisa Bonet of Cosby Show fame to provide the audience with some great eye candy. Angel Heart is quite violent and contains a lot of nudity as well, but pulls off being a classy production as the subject matter and story demands the level of sex and violence contained here. Angel Heart predates the somewhat similar Devil's Advocate and in my opinion Angel Heart is a superior film and is ten times better. That, I must digress is a matter of personal taste, but this is a platform to express ones opinions and that is exactly what I am doing. Awesome movie by the way, Angel Heart is great stuff.",Angel Heart
59,Jonny_Numb,"A Profusely Bleeding ""Heart""",7,12 July 2008,"Alan Parker attempts to adopt an atmosphere of Lynchian unease in a period setting with ""Angel Hert,"" a Noir thriller with strong (yet mostly subdued) horror overtones. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a private dick in 1955 Brooklyn who is haunted by dreams of a descending elevator, his own blood-soaked visage, and...chickens. He is enlisted by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to locate an allegedly-dead-but-not-dead Jazz musician by the name of Johnny Favorite; what ensues is a trip through gritty locales and offbeat characters (including a guy who has a year-round hobby of ""biting the heads off rats""), with Angel winding up in New Orleans, a steamy land of mystery punctuated by intense jazz numbers, voodoo rituals, and bizarre sexuality. Parker creates a wonderfully involving atmosphere and infuses a sense of dislocation into a period that has been trivialized in other films, with Rourke a capable, engaging leading man (at times looking like a Bruce Willis doppleganger)--his oft-unusual verbal inflections (his pronunciation of ""Evangeline,"" for instance) make Angel that much more a stranger in hostile, mysterious land. De Niro conveys a sense of subdued menace that (up until his final scene, at least) makes his ambiguity all the more intriguing; and Lisa Bonet has a small yet complicated role as the woman who may have the key to Favorite's whereabouts. While ""Angel Heart"" eventually comes to a point where the 'twist' ending is pretty apparent, the mystery of the initial 90 minutes was enough to keep me hooked until the baffling, open-ended final frame--while Parker seems to panic in giving the audience a coherent explanation, it winds up feeling rushed and a little out-of-place. And the ""evil eye"" effects that recur near the end look laughably bad today. But still, ""Angel Heart"" is a refreshingly mature horror film that requires some brainpower to enjoy.",Angel Heart
60,ShootingShark,"Atmospheric, Scary, Twisty-Turny, Unwitting Private-Eye Mystery Chiller",6,17 May 2008,"Harry Angel is a small-time private-eye in Brooklyn in 1955, hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre to find Johnny Fontaine, a forties crooner who owes Cyphre a debt and seems to have gone missing for twelve years. Angel starts looking and the trail leads to Louisiana, but all the people who knew Johnny seem to be dying all of a sudden ...This is a chilling, weird amalgamation of private-eye / period-drama / horror-movie made during a terrific streak by the talented Parker (his two films which bookend it, Birdy and Mississipi Burning, are also excellent). I love the way it starts out as a completely straight mystery thriller, and slowly brings in the satanic elements, until by the end it's become a full-on horror movie with our hero literally descending into hell. How much you like it I guess depends on how much you buy the big explanation at the ice-house in the end, which is amusingly rushed and hysterical to catch us off-guard. I think it's great; what other private-detective movie ends with the gumshoe discovering he's the killer and he didn't even know it (even The Big Sleep isn't that cracked) ? What sells it for me is Rourke's solid blustering performance - he steers a great course through smartass, out of his depth, bewildered, disbelieving and resigned as he's manipulated through the story by forces he can't control. The rest of the cast are good, with DeNiro in the plum role as The Lord Of The Flies himself, subtly underplaying it to great creepy comic effect. There's also a terrific score by the underrated Trevor Jones (Runaway Train, Labyrinth), which pops and spits all through the action, skilfully underlining the trouble our hero is in. Shot on authentic and great-looking locations in NYC, New Jersey and Louisiana, and based on the book Falling Angel, by William Hjortsberg (who also wrote Ridley Scott's Legend). I almost always find I enjoy movies which mix genres up, and this is a fine example of a well-written and stylishly made such hybrid. A great horror thriller.",Angel Heart

62,rosscinema,Murky but well made and acted,6,29 March 2004,"It has been a long time since I first viewed this film in the late 1980's in an edited version to get that ""R"" rating but it's finally available for everyone to watch in the original version that the director wanted. Story is set in 1955 where a sloppy and dirty private eye named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is given a call for a job and he heads to a church in Harlem, New York where he meets Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) who gives him $5,000 to try and locate someone named Johnny Favorite. Angel heads to a mental hospital where Favorite was a patient and there he learns that a doctor was given a large sum of money to make it look as though he stayed there longer than he did. The trail leads Angel to Louisiana where he meets Epiphany Proudfoot.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) tells Angel that her mother knew Favorite but now has no information on whether he's alive or not. While in Louisiana some of the people that knew Favorite start to die suddenly and it usually comes after Angel has interviewed them and the local police start to wonder how he is involved. This film is directed by Alan Parker who has such a diversified resume as far as the different types of films he has directed. But two elements in this story are reminiscent of previous efforts by him. The first is the time period (In this case the 50's) and Parker has dealt with period pieces before. And secondly he has made films that showcased the Southern culture and this film does a commendable job of being shot in the humidity of Louisiana. I personally am not as high on this film as others and it's primarily because the script does wander and then lag in the middle as Rourke's investigation goes on without even a hint that he's getting closer to the target. This is a muddled and murky mystery that seems to go on and on but there are some things that raise this film high enough for me to recommend. The set design gives this film such a rich feel for it's time period and the cinematography by Michael Seresin is excellent as he captures the heat and sweat of the Louisiana Bayou. Seresin has shot many of Parker's films and together they certainly have a special relationship that's reflected in their work. But the special thing about this film are the good performances by Rourke and Bonet and they together give one of the steamiest sex scenes in movie history. Parker had to trim it by a few seconds to get the ""R"" rating but you can view the original scene now on DVD. Rourke plays one of the sloppiest characters in recent memory and he's always unshaven and dripping from sweat. But with that he still keeps the audience interested in what he is doing during the investigation and Rourke always had good screen charisma. This was Bonet's first big role in a film and she's very good as a sexy young Cajun girl that's involved in black magic. This should have led her to some sort of a film career but it never did which is to bad because she shows so much promise here. This story has many twists and turns and even though it bogs down after a while it's still a well made film that leaves an indelible mark of sorts.",Angel Heart
63,Galina_movie_fan,"So, who are you? And I?",9,11 May 2021,"The hauntingly sad melody of a tenor saxophone sounds over a littered alley in America's loneliest city in sync to the steps of an unkempt man in a long baggy coat. His name is Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke). He is a private detective from Brooklyn but not very successful. Most likely, Harry never heard of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel ""The Master and Margarita"", otherwise he would have grinned skeptically at the title of the very first chapter, ""Never Talk to Strangers."" How would he find a client and get the job done if he doesn't talk to strangers? Such as a wealthy, sophisticated, and mysterious businessman named Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro). One fine day, Cypher made him an offer, which Harry did not refuse. The businessman tasked the detective to track down a once-popular singer named Johnny Liebling, aka Johnny Favorite, who disappeared without a trace many years ago. The businessman signed a contract with Johnny which the latter did not fulfill. The contract must be closed, and for this Cypher needs to find out what happened to the former pop star.Several features distinguish ""Angel Heart"" from many similar films with a sensible private investigator who undertakes an undefined mission and immediately encounters corpses lining his path. The director Alan Parker successfully combines elements of classic noir films, such as dark lighting, cynical characters, hopeless intonation, and a fatalistic plot with a modern vision, which gives the picture its uniqueness. The atmosphere pulls in from the beginning to the last shot, which is helped by the soundtrack. It includes not only blues and jazz compositions but also a human heartbeat in the background that raises the level of tension in many scenes. Parker realistically portrayed the era of the 50s, not exaggerating the importance of details, but not in any way ignoring them. The careful composition reveals in each frame only what is necessary at the given moment to return later in a shocking flashback and reveal the full picture of what happened and how. The contrasts between windy winter streets, alleys, and avenues of New York Boroughs and hot New Orleans fit the story because climate change and setting reflect the beginning of Angel's true understanding of the case he is investigating, of himself and his own role in what is happening now and what happened many years ago.Landscape filming, built on the screen opposition of two cities, penetrates at the visceral level. Gray and slushy New York in early January is freezing to the bone. When the investigation brings Harry to wet, stuffy, witchcraft New Orleans and its suburb of Algeria, the center of the ancient pagan cult of Voodoo, it is difficult to breathe and you wish for the rain that will clear the air, wash away the dirt from the broken asphalt of the streets, drown out the agonizing questions that persistently sound in the brain like the echoing beats of someone's heart, and will bring peace to the suffering soul. And the rain will come. A real tropical downpour, like the biblical flood. It will break through the leaking ceiling in a cheap hotel room and turn into streams of blood that will flood a squalid little room that has become a haven for two strangers, Harry Angel and Epiphany (Lisa Bonnet), a young Louisiana woman who might be a key to the secrets of the past. Tangled in a passionate embrace, they found each other for a moment in the tangled labyrinth of other people's memories, blood, lust, betrayal, and death. But the rain will not bring purification nor hope. It will only plunge even deeper into the atmosphere of a nightmare with its unpredictable logic and the inability to wake up.Following a cyclical rhythm, ""Angel Heart"" again and again returns to the same point. Shutters slam, fans growl, an elevator rumbles, heartbeats become more frequent, flights of stairs diverge into endless heights and transcendent depths, and there is always a figure in black on the bench that will never reveal the face. All of this evokes a sense of uncertainty of what is happening and the subtly enveloping ominousness that the viewer experiences along with the detective, who is desperately trying to close the case. Mickey Rourke is superb as Harry. Deprived of ambition, not caring about how he looks, unshaven, shaggy, with puffy eyes, awkward, but inconceivably charming with an amazing, slightly shy smile, Harry Angel is sympathetic from the first appearance. Rourke brings true emotions to the character of his hero: frightening, scared, distraught, or resigned, he is always realistic, and you sympathize with him to the end, even when Harry Angel discovers the true nature of his investigation.The sinister tone of the movie is set by Robert De Niro with sharp long polished nails, a pentagram ring, fine manners, a slight grin, and elegant black suits. De Niro must have had a lot of fun preparing for the role of Messier Cypher: a neatly trimmed black beard, long hair slicked back and pulled back into a bun at the back of his head, lighting and makeup tricks make him an uncanny Martin Scorsese's doppelganger. Considering what we eventually learn about Mr. Louis Cypher, this is a very peculiar and controversial dedication to the beloved director and close friend of the actor. At the same time, this is one of the manifestations of humor that is constantly present in a film which is anything but comedy.A mystical thriller, allegorical parable, and horror film, Angel Heart is a bright, talented, and timeless exercise in the style and synthesis of cinema genres, in which Parker and his actors give their best, and the bold imagery keeps captivating even if you guessed pretty quickly where the investigation would lead Harry. Long after the old rumbling elevator leaves the lonely passenger at the final stop after an endless descent, the fan, the embodiment of inevitability, sighs heavily in the final revolution, and the beating of the human heart that accompanied the entire film subsides, the viewers will not be able to shake off dark magic of the film. They will reflect on the duality of human nature, on the endless struggle of the forces of light and darkness for the possession of the soul, on the roads that we choose, but which, in fact, choose us. They will think about the price that one must pay for the chosen path. About contracts that no one has the right to violate, the offers that are so hard to refuse, and about strangers from whom you need to run without looking back. But where to?",Angel Heart
64,Easygoer10,Outstanding Film,9,27 May 2020,"I love this film. As a Louisiana native, I am naturally attracted to films shot in New Orleans; a city I know so very well. I saw it when it was released (an X rating, too). I think it is (director) Alan Parker's best work. Throughout the film, I had nagging the nagging feeling something powerful is being held back; building up (I was right, too!). This is a similar feeling to the one I had while watching (genius) director Stanley Kubrick's horror film ""The Shining"" (1980). This is carefully cast with Robert De Niro as the Devil incarnate. Mickey Rourke is outstanding as the downbeat private Investigator. This was Lisa Bonet's first big screen film role, and she is superb. Charlotte Rampling, who I had only recently noticed in ""The Verdict"" (1982) is terrific (as always) in her supporting role. Lastly, this is the very first role for Pruitt Taylor Vince (a Baton Rouge , LA native). There is one (very controversial) sex scene which is filmed exquisitely. However, the ending will leave with your mouth wide open; I promise.",Angel Heart
65,PredragReviews,"""Watch out for those chickens Harry.""",9,6 April 2017,"This is an intriguing, unusual, beautifully directed, highly atmospheric film that successfully crosses any number of genre: film noir, thriller, mystery, and horror. The plot is simple. In the mid nineteen fifties, a mysterious and slightly sinister business man, Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro), hires Brooklyn gumshoe, Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), for a missing person case. Angel's investigation, for which he is being paid a princely sum for the time, takes him from Harlem to New Orleans, as he looks for a former crooner named Johnny Favorite, who sometime during the early nineteen forties apparently welched on a business deal with Louis Cypher and hasn't been heard from since.In my opinion this is very much a film which you will be able to enjoy on repeated viewings, to savour the art of the cinematographer as well as to get a better understanding of the complexity of the plot. Yes, there are several murders and quite a lot of blood but I think you will be doing yourself a disservice if you choose not to buy for that reason. To a great extent the violence is retrospective and not in the same stomach wrenching category of 'Saving Private Ryan'.Robert De Niro is sensational in the highly stylized, role of Louis Cypher. He imbues the role with just the right amount of sardonic humor and restrained menace so as to make the character memorable. De Niro leaves an indelible imprint on every scene in which he is in. Mickey Rourke, who is in nearly every scene in this film, shows that he has the ability to carry a movie, as he is simply terrific as the private detective who is slowly unraveling. As the film progresses, the toll that the investigation is taking on the tormented Angel is evident on his face. Angst ridden, bleary eyed, and disheveled, Angel is definitely involved in the biggest case of his life. As he gets closer to the truth of what happened to Johnny Favorite, the more his life seems to be spinning out of control. Rourke manages to convey all this, no easy task. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and adds to the flavor of this delicious gumbo of a film, which is reminiscent of Goethe's Faust. Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Angel Heart
66,tomsview,The devil you know,7,4 September 2013,"""Angel Heart"" hoodwinks its audience even more than the plot hoodwinks its characters in a movie that cleverly combines the supernatural with a film noir style mystery.The story involves Harold Angel, played by Mickey Rourke, who is hired by the saturnine Louis Cyphre, played by Robert De Niro, to track down Johnny Favourite, a moderately well known crooner who disappeared years before. Favourite owes Cyphre a debt, the nature of which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Cyphre makes it clear that Angel was not chosen by chance and is offered $5000 to take the case.After a number of strange encounters in New York, Angel follows a lead to New Orleans, where he eventually finds people who knew Favourite. Among these are two women: Margaret Krusemark, played by Charlotte Rampling, a former lover of Favourite; and Epiphany Proudfoot, played by Lisa Bonet who Angel spies in a steamy voodoo ritual.Nearly all the people Angel tracks down that have a connection to Favourite are killed shortly after. Angel becomes more and more troubled by the case, and is suspected by the police. Cyphre eventually resolves the mystery with a startling revelation. The credibility of this revelation depends very much on Hollywood's firm faith in plastic surgery to change people to the point where their own mother's wouldn't recognise them.The plot of ""Angel Heart"" cheats shamelessly, providing an embarrassment of riches for plot hole explorers. The film is based on William Hjortsberg's novel, ""Falling Angel"", which was set wholly in New York. The book gets you in, and is certainly an original concept, however it does suffer from its fundamental gimmickry, which is also the weakness of the film.The film is opened considerably by moving much of the action to New Orleans; a setting that suits the story's central themes. Mickey Rourke's character, Harry Angel, is perennially sweaty and sleazy. He looks like he could benefit from a packet of those lemon-scented towelettes that are so handy after a meal of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He effects designer stubble on his chin, which owes more to Don Johnson's 1980's ""Miami Vice"" than to the squared-away look of the 1950's, the period when the film is supposedly set.Some reviewers have accused Robert De Niro of overacting in this film. De Niro, in fact, delivers just about the right level of ham balanced with understatement for what is a totally over-the-top character. Indeed, the prize for the most excessive overacting must go to Epiphany Proudfoot's baby at the end of the film when its eyes light up with a demonic glow; a heavy-handed touch in a movie that uses its other devilish effects judiciously.Trevor Jones' atmospheric, sax-accented score adds considerably to the mood of the film. The cinematography and art direction of ""Angel Heart"" are impressive, even if there is a fixation on swirling fans and interiors that are reminiscent of the musty clutter of a Peter Greenaway film.""Angel Heart"" pulls off an outrageous story with flair. For a film that is a hybrid of many genres, ""Angel Heart"", like the book upon which it is based, is definitely one of a kind.",Angel Heart

68,oneguyrambling,Remember when De Niro was good and Rourke was sane?,8,8 June 2011,"Angel Heart is more than the flick in which a Cosby kid got her kit off – but it is indeed that – it is a period drama which on paper has every chance of moving into hokey territory, but with some skillful handling and a gradual build in momentum manages to emerge as a very strong thriller with supernatural elements and a pretty solid twist.It is 1955, a decade along from WW2 and Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a small time Private Investigator. Early in the film he is solicited by a mysterious man through his lawyer to perform something of a missing person search. The mysterious man is Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro in a solid cameo) and the man he is to find was a popular African American singer named Johnny Favorite who had a minor pre-war hit before himself heading off to war.Cypher alleges that Johnny and he had a contract that was broken, and that Favorite still owes him. It is not for Angel to collect the debt, merely to see if Favorite is actually even alive so that Cypher can make his request formally And off Angel goes on the manhunt.After some early setbacks which see Angel put in minor peril he decides that this gig might be out of his league and heads to Cypher to make this clear. While Cypher explains to Angel just how badly he wants Favorite located – by increasing Angel's fee dramatically – he somehow manages to make the simple and banal task of eating a hard boiled egg infinitely more menacing than I remembered it being as a kid.Angel – now back on the case – follows the trail of clues to N'Awlins. Without going into the developments and twists in the case it is fair to say that the situation unwinds slowly in languid fashion, and we learn at the same gradual pace that Angel learns exactly who is involved and what is actually going on.Eventually Angel tracks down Favorite's former squeeze, who is already deceased but has left a young daughter named Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) who is maybe 18ish. Epiphany is smart and seems to know more than she lets on – she is also effortlessly hot – and Angel gets the itchin' for another ""chat"". Before he gets the chance to do that though he tails a blues singer who also seems to know more than he is telling, and watches as bluesman, Epiphany and a gaggle of scantily clad ""others"" perform an elaborate and frenetic voodoo ceremony complete with the sacrifice of a chicken.It's always the crazy hot ones who are into the voodoo.Now Angel realizes that there might be very good reasons as to why no-one seems to want him to know the truth.()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() People who meet with Angel as he goes about his investigation have a habit of winding up dead, though there isn't much on screen violence or gore, it seems that almost everyone involved at any level doesn't want the truth to come out. Angel himself gets warned off verbally and physically, he makes discoveries of his own and even manages to have himself an Epiphany at one point – the capital letter is not a mistake.On we go to the ultimate unveiling of the ""big picture"", with information and new facts coming thick and fast as the story moves faster and faster, involving more bizarre developments and situations. This all culminates in a quite satisfying payoff to end proceedings with Cypher arriving again and hoping to collect.This was the 80s before Mickey Rourke rode motorbikes too fast and before he got hit by both boxers, the bottle and the scalpel so hard that he started fondling panicky starlets in public. He is just the right mix of cocky, confident and resourceful here to believe what is going on and to see exactly why it was Angel that was set on the case in the first place.De Niro plays Cypher straight and understated, and obviously relishes the menacing dialogue and creepiness that his character exudes in his brief dealings, and Bonet is young and definitely hot enough, but she also manages to be very credible in her role.All in all Angel Heart is a very effective period thriller, it moves along at a slow pace and might prove a little slow and dated for some, but it maintains interest as Angel (and the audience) moves closer to the truth and boasts some solid performances from actors who could have let this all go extremely cheesy.Final Rating – 8 / 10. It could me 20 years to find this under-appreciated gem, you'd be doing yourself a favour if you looked it up sooner rather than later. (And you get to see some Cosby-cans!)",Angel Heart
69,seymourblack-1,A Creepy Thriller With Some Good Twists,9,17 February 2014,"""Angel Heart"" is a dark thriller that begins very conventionally when a private detective is employed to undertake, what seems to be, a routine missing persons case. This is misleading, however, as the investigation is soon characterised by a series of dead-ends, bizarre murders and strange encounters with the supernatural that give rise to the types of tension, violence and shocks which continue to be present at various points throughout the entire movie. The plot is thoroughly absorbing, offbeat and full of surprises and the quantity of blood on view is absolutely extraordinary.Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is an unkempt, small-time, private detective who's hired by the immaculate but rather mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to trace the whereabouts of a crooner called Johnny Favorite who'd achieved some success in the period just before World War 11. Favorite had suffered serious injuries during his time in North Africa where he'd been entertaining the troops and had spent time in a mental hospital near Poughkeepsie where it's believed that, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, he'd been treated for shell shock. Cyphre had helped Favorite to launch his career and wanted to know if he was still alive because there were some clauses in his contract that remained unfulfilled.Angel soon discovers that something irregular had happened 12 years earlier (in December 1943) when he traces a clearly falsified document relating to Favorite's apparent transfer to another hospital and then discovers the body of the doctor responsible who'd just been brutally murdered. Spooked by this experience, Angel decides that it's unsafe to continue with the case but after Cyphre increases his fee, he agrees to carry on.His further investigations bring him into contact with a sophisticated fortune teller called Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling), the daughter of one of Favorite's secret lovers, Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and a blues guitarist called Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee) who'd previously worked in a band with Favorite. All three are distinctly unhelpful and the gruesome events that take place following his contact with them have a powerful effect on Angel who's sharply aware that he's steadily unravelling but can't do anything to improve his predicament. Alarmingly, things get even worse for him when the reasons for his involvement in this dangerous and seemingly intractable case are finally revealed.Some of the content in ""Angel Heart"" is shocking and controversial but its greatest quality is the unsettling atmosphere that's present from start to finish. The dark street scene that opens the film sets a sinister tone and everything that follows from the eccentricities of Cyphre to the sounds of the descending steel elevators continues to suggest a lurking threat. This creepiness is further emphasised by the use of drained colours, high camera angles and views of a spiral staircase that work together brilliantly to create a sense of continuing unease.In a tremendous performance, Mickey Rourke inhabits his role so fully that he's utterly convincing as he portrays the difficult changes that Angel goes through and Robert De Niro also makes the most of the scope that Cyphre's character provides. ""Angel Heart"" has a haunting quality that makes repeat viewings irresistible and enough twists to ensure that such experiences are both rewarding and enjoyable.",Angel Heart

71,baumer,I know who I am!,10,5 September 2001,"I have often said that horror is the most difficult to master.  I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees, then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere, true fear is difficult to capture on film.  I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail.  I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes.  But if you remember some of the greats, some of the icons of the trade, you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows, the vicissitudes of lights, the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story.  I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre.  Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a half-assed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements.  But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers.  Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys, that being camping.  Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams.  In short, we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend.Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film, do not read from here on out.The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart.  This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets, seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters.  We meet Harry Angel ( Roarke) as he is taking a phone call from a stranger.  This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh ( any similarities here?  think about it).  They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher.""Is your client foreign?  Is he a foreign gentleman?""Harry then travels to a church ( strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective) where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap (who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski), and then he sees his client.  But what we see first is long, perfectly manicured finger nails, a strange cane, a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol, you decide.  Also, the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably.  The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand.  But he smiles with a diabolical, factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit.Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence, all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead.  Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts.""You must want this guy pretty bad,"" Harry says with a chuckle.""I don't like messy accounts,"" Cypher replies dead-seriously.And then just before the meeting concludes, Louis says to Harry,
""I've got a funny feeling we've met before.""  Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man, and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner.  It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans.  And along the way, dead bodies begin to show up.  First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case.  He shows up dead in the next scene.  Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead, ""strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with.""  Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.
Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress.  And every time he does, more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical, devout, religious iconoclast.  He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts, it seems more like a reckoning.  And the further Harry gets into the mystery, the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with.  To make matters worse, Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice, ""You know, an eye for an eye, that sort of thing.""  Finally Harry, in desperation, asks him in one of their sittings, ""Who the @^&* are you Cypher?""  Cypher's reply, ""Watch your language, this is a church.""By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters, and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding.  This apparent confusion is by design, because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue.  We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films, especially the horror genre.  That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror, but it is true.  Horror, true horror has gone the way of the do-do bird.  It is all but extinct.  Angel Heart however, is more of a heterodoxy than one might think.  It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better.  Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle.  Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion.  Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film, here are a few scenes to digest and think about.Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film.  Every time Louis Cypher is in the room, fans are first shown.  This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat, but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx?Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth.  Lines like, ""They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another, but not enough to make them love."" Or: ""Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?""  After Harry says no, Cypher replies, ""you know, they say the egg represents the soul.""  He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity.  You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied.  All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface.There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself, the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way.  And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it.We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions.  Bullets are stored in a Bible, a nun is cleaning blood off the wall, a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce, a heart is cut out, almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time.  Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress.The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked.  I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 year-old and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times, I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate.""Alas.  How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny.""""My name's not Johnny.""""I know who I am.  Cypher I know who I am!""When all is about to be revealed, Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, you reflection always looks you straight in the eye.  And when he does, all that we didn't know but may have suspected, is now revealed to us.Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling.  But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place.  Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there, Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there.  Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place.This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and along with Halloween and Jaws, not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts, it cross polinates into the top films ever made.  I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric, spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar.  Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better.  All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about.  And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something.  After all, the Bible is filled with stories of fire, brimstone, people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it?10 out of 10-- This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend.  Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind, this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T-2, First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this.  Add Alan Parker to this brilliant behind the scenes team and you have all the ingredients for one hell of a ride.",Angel Heart
72,mattymatt4ever,Definitely an eye-opener,7,18 March 2002,"""Angel Heart"" is a flawed, imperfect film that is far from brilliant, yet amazingly intriguing.  Choosing Mickey Rourke as a lead was a mistake in itself.  He is amusing at times, but let's face it--he can't act!!!  He swaggers through each scene, doing a bad Bruce Willis impression.  Mickey, you're no Bruce Willis!  And the film is set in the 1950's, whereas Rourke seems a few decades ahead of his time.  I was quite disappointed that Robert DeNiro has such a small role.  He's practically plastered across the video cover, yet only has about ten minutes of screen time.  Another attempt to capitalize on the success of a big-name actor.  I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be as eager to rent the flick if Mickey Rourke was plastered across.  But DeNiro was great in his role (a different, more low-key role than usual), and the little screen time he had I appreciated.  Lisa Bonet has proven her talent in recent flicks like ""High Fidelity"" and ""Enemy of the State,"" but she shows practically no expression throughout this film and the only reason to check out this early performance is to see how great she looks naked.  And she does have a banging body!!!  OK, enough bashing.  This is a unique, visually striking--though truly grim and unpleasant--mystery/thriller with a twist ending that comes from left field.  The film doesn't always make sense, but it keeps your interest, sometimes making your pulse pound.  Those who've seen ""Midnight Express"" and ""Pink Floyd:  The Wall"" should be able to anticipate the gruesomeness of the material.  Before viewing the movie, I heard a lot of hooplah about the explicit sex scene.  Now I'm an avid moviegoer, so I'm very jaded when it comes to sex scenes.  It takes a lot to shock me.  But when watching the sex scene in this movie...I felt like I was watching underground porn or some sort of snuff film.  It is THAT graphic!  Walls start bleeding, naked bodies get covered in blood, we see flashbacks of orgies.  Alan Parker went over-the-top, to say the least!There are other gruesome images, including a chicken sacrifice that would turn the biggest carnivores into vegetarians, but mainly this is a mystery--and what an intriguing one it is!  And it was the plot--filled with twists and turns--that fascinated me most.  I am not exaggerating when I say this movie is like nothing you've seen before.  As I said, it's not the greatest, but it's definitely worth checking out.  And after watching the film, you'll definitely want to chat about it with your friends.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Angel Heart
73,KnightsofNi11,"The feel bad movie of 1987, and I love it!",8,6 June 2011,"Terrifying would be a good word to start out a review of Angel Heart with, wouldn't it? Yes. It would. This movie will chill you to the bone. It's the story of Harry Angel, a detective looking for work who takes a job offer from a mysterious man named Louis Cyphre. Cyphre is looking for a man named Johnny Favourite and offers Angel $5000 dollars to find the fellow who has mysteriously gone missing. But as Angel's search goes on, key people in his investigation begin to die off under gruesome circumstances. All the while the investigation leads him to dark underground cults filled with disturbing amounts of voodoo and chicken blood. Angel Heart is a movie that disturbs on all kinds of levels, never once letting up and only growing creepier and creepier as time goes on.Good, sincere horror is hard to pull off, but Angel Heart manages just fine in being a truly scary, truly enticing film. The storyline takes us to the darkest and creepiest of places, taking all sorts of gruesome turns that lead us to a dramatically excellent ending. It is a film that looks to scare, yet also engage and entertain in a sophisticated yet grotesque way, and it does just that. Some would say that it goes overboard on the sex and violence, but for such a satanic and evil film, I would say it has just the right amount. This movie is like a mysterious and foreboding dark hole that, through sheer terror, draws you in closer and closer then grabs you by the neck and scares the living hell out of you when you least expect it. My only complaint would be that on the way to this final big scare, the film drags a bit and gets pretty slow right before the epic conclusion that will leave you disturbed yet mystified.I give the film a lot of credit for telling such an excellent story, but I cannot forget the hauntingly beautiful cinematography that drives this film so well. The film is shot incredibly well with each frame as poignant and tightly constructed in the most artistically creepy way possible. The film doesn't completely rely on the blood and guts to scare you, it uses immaculate cinematography to entice you and sicken you at the same time. Alan Parker directs the film with a keen eye for the grotesque yet glorious, framing beautiful shots that capture the films disturbing darkness, as well as mixing in some fast paced scenes with an abundance of quick cuts that scream right into your face and keep you so heavily engaged in the film that you just can't look away. The film boasts some truly masterful visuals.Angel Heart is an excellent horror film that plays itself so much smarter than the average horror film, while still maintaining a healthy handful of blood, guts, and thrills to be scarier than the average horror film as well. Don't expect to leave this film happy or jolly. This film is dark, grotesque, and downright evil. But it isn't trying to sugarcoat any of the disturbed terror it is trying to instill, so from that perspective it succeeds so immensely. It drags in the middle, but it pays off enough with its exhilarating and shocking ending. Angel Heart is a fantastic film.",Angel Heart

There also is lots of gruesome violence and lurid sex but somehow it fits. What is outstanding is the stunningly brilliant camera work and the highly original and effective use of music and sound. They've also done a remarkably accurate and powerful simulation of the fifties and captured the essence of New Orleans in the rain. Parts of it are pretty strong. But in many ways it is a film masterpiece.",Angel Heart
75,gab-14712,Twisty Thriller from Alan Parker!,8,18 October 2020,"Alan Parker's Angel Heart is a weird, creepy psychological thriller. This is my second time viewing this picture. The first time, I did not really think much of it and found it rather dull. I was young at the time and didn't know what to expect. Years later, I do appreciate the movie just a little more. I found the pacing to be trying at certain points, but an interesting story and exemplary performances from Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro kept me captivated enough. The film did not get much love upon initial release, but it did gain a cult following as the years went on. This film reminded me of an old noir but with a supernatural twist added. It certainly had the grimy atmosphere, the slimy characters, and the mysterious settings we associate with this genre. The film's ending is often talked about. It received mixed reactions, but I was satisfied with the ending as the movie went deep into supernatural territory.
The film was directed by Alan Parker who always go all out in his movies. The man made it a mission to dip his toes in different genres. He tackles two genres here: the supernatural thriller and the private eye detective story ala Chinatown. While not as striking nor memorable as his powerful Midnight Express, Parker was able to put his directorial and screenwriting skills to work. The screenplay is based on the popular novel from William Hjortsberg. Hjortsberg wanted to sell the movie rights to the big studios but was denied because they did not like the bleak, dark ending. That was unfortunate at first because John Frankenheimer was ready to direct and Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford were in talks to star. Not even star power could convince the studio bigwigs to finance the project. Eventually, Parker got involved and was able to finance the film under an independent studio.
One of my favorite things about the movie is its location shoots. More than 80 different locations. Many of the filming locations, including the place of the devil-worship cult, took place in Harlem. Parker wanted to film in locations that had hardly been seen in cinema. With blessing from Hjortsberg, he also decided to film in New Orleans (despite not being in the book) because of association with a voodoo cult. That is also where the sex scene with Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet was filmed and that scene made the headlines because that scene made the MPAA slap the entire movie with a X-rating, which is not a viable rating for moneymaking. Parker had to do some careful editing to earn its R. Compared to what we see in today's film, that scene is nearly disappointing. Cool bloody raindrops though.
It's New York City in the year 1955. Private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by a very mysterious, well-groomed man named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro). Angel is unaware who Cyphre is but Cyphre makes clear he chose Angel for a reason. His mission is to locate the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, who has not been seen since after World War 2 ended. As the case progresses, Angel feels like he is losing his mind. His leads take him to seedy folks and most of all, he does not trust Cyphre. Will Angel be able to complete the case with his sanity intact?
The film thrives thanks to Parker's skillful directing and excellent performances. Rourke is at his best here with his unkempt looks. Parker had to woo De Niro but it worked. De Niro dresses sharply and makes a neat antagonist to Rourke. Of course, he is heavily involved in the film's famous ending. Also, Lisa Bonet! It was a wise decision to prove her acting skills before she became heavily involved with The Cosby Show. That casting choice proved to be a little controversial considering the subject matter.
On the whole, Angel Heart takes a page out of the noir thrillers from old and adds some supernatural elements to spice things up. I was one of those who enjoyed the ending but leading up to the ending was a little bit of a chore. Parker took his time which allowed the pacing to be slow. The film is tightly edited, and I enjoyed the jazzy score from Trevor Jones. The film may not be a heavy punch, but its worth watching Alan Parker step his toe in this genre.

77,RonellSowes,Not So Clever,5,23 May 2021,"Angel Heart is definitely in the vein of classic private eye film-noirs from the 40's and 50's and starts off like looking like just about any of them. It's even set in the same era. Although, besides how its said to take place in the 50s and a few old clunkers, it feels more like 1987 than 1955.While it may start off like a standard noir, the further it progresses the more it seems to transform into a supernatural/horror thriller. As the true motivations to Angel's case are revealed-though I'm not sure if revealed is the proper word. This picture is a like the film Shutter Island in the sense that its clever twist isn't so clever in the end. As a matter of fact, what's actually going on is glaringly apparent from the moment its stated. But it's not as well made as Shutter Island and the movie's transparency only seems to hurt an already fragile film.I'm not sure if this just because it's such a mediocre film or because he's such a good actor, but the best part of this movie is Robert Deniro's chilling performance. The real life tension between him and Rourke appears to work its way into their scenes, enhancing the frigid wariness betwixt them. He's only around for three brief scenes(which isn't enough)but still stands out as the most memorable aspect to a mundane movie that falls short.",Angel Heart

80,moviesleuth2,Bizarre,5,4 June 2009,"At the end of the movie, I was thinking: What the hell did I just see? ""Angel Heart"" is that kind of a movie. It doesn't make much sense until you look back on it. While at this time, the pieces fit together, it hampers the enjoyment of actually watching the film. One might argue that it would work better on a second viewing, but at least in my opinion, it's not worth it.Harry Angel (a very young Mickey Rourke) is called by Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a man named Johnny Favorite. While on the case, Harry discovers that he really had no idea what he was getting himself into.The acting varies. Mickey Rourke is terrific as Angel, although the script has him act irrationally in some cases. He's a guy we can immediately root for. I don't know why Robert DeNiro's part was labeled as a ""Special Appearance."" His part is more than an cameo; in fact, he has the most screen time next to Rourke (although Rourke is in every scene). Lisa Bonet is rather flat here, although she can attract sympathy like no one else.My complaints about ""Angel Heart"" would be minor if the film was suspenseful, scary, or for that matter, interesting. Unfortunately, it is none of those things. I spent the whole time wondering what the hell was going on. Not exactly the kind of response you want from a viewer.The approach (the film will only work when it is pieced together after the credits have begun to roll)that director Alan Parker took with the project is not a bad idea from the get-go. Unfortunately, Parker is unable to keep the audience very involved, and that's a big problem.""Angel Heart"" has been described as a cult film. After viewing the film, I can say that I am not a part of that group.",Angel Heart
81,Peach-2,A dark and beautiful trip on the bayou,7,16 November 1998,"Alan Parker's Angel Heart is an amazing film accomplishment in style, but has not near as much substance to help it to its climax. The film takes some interesting twists and turns but never really becomes more than a study in modern film-noir. Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast, as is De Niro. Lisa Bonet does a wonderful job and the love scene between her and Rourke is true to their characters and not exploitation. The film is full of interesting moments and has a good twist at the end. Entertaining but incomplete.",Angel Heart
82,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,13 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Well, this one is an attention grabber. ""Angel Heart"" starts out dark and brooding and just keeps getting darker and darker. It will almost even test your limits, which is exactly what it sets out to do. Even though Robert De Niro's on screen time is small and limited, he steals every scene he is in. A strong performance in a limited role.Set in the mid-50's, the story follows the investigative trail of private detective, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke), as he goes south into voodoo country to discover whatever happened to a man named Johnny Favorite - a crooner famous in his day. He is employed by Louis Cyphre (De Niro), who claims that Favorite still owes him from a contract agreed upon some years ago. When Favorite disappeared, Cyphre hires Angel to find out what happened to him. The deeper Angel digs, the more he finds out. The more he finds out, the less he wants to know. The dead bodies start to build and soon the local authorities are naming him the primary suspect - leading to the film's startling and unnerving conclusion.This film is unabashed in it's visceral detail and raw portrayal of the unlucky victims who fall prey to a murderer's schemes. I would have to say that this was also the most intense sex scene I've ever seen, and that isn't necessarily a good thing. I had my suspicions going in about what was really happening behind the scenes, and I got it right. The how and the why was a big mystery to me, so I paid attention. And you do have to pay attention, because it is easy to get lost. Once the final realization hits you, it will make you stop and think. It's that kind of film.This movie is well produced and filmed. The editing was top notch for it's day, and the special effects were perfect and not overdone. You will get some chills and there are a few scenes where you will want to look away, but you won't be able to. However, it is low on the re-watchable scale. It isn't the type of movie that someone would say that they watch it over and over again. If they did, I would begin to wonder about them. It will tug at your dark side and make you uncomfortable. A solid film, but to me, just okay at only 6 stars out of 10.",Angel Heart
83,suspiria10,Dark and Moody.,8,25 July 2004,"Title: Angel Heart (1987)Rating: * * * * 1/2Version Reviewed:  Lions Gate (NTSC  Region 1) Video: Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) Audio: English dd 5.1 Running Time: 1:52:50 Rating: RDirector: Alan Parker (Pink Floyd: The Wall / Fame) Writer: Alan Parker (Mississippi Burning / Evita / The Commitments) Music: Trevor Jones (From Hell / Dark City / Labyrinth) Photography: Michael Seresin (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban / Birdy) Editor: Gerry Hambling (Pink Floyd: The Wall / Fame)Starring: Mickey Rourke (Fade to Black / 9 ½ Weeks) Robert De Niro (Godsend / Jackie Brown / Mary Shelley's Frankenstein) Lisa Bonet (High Fidelity / Bank Robber / Enemy of the State) Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool / Orca) Stocker Fontelieu (Mandingo) Brownie McGhee (The Jerk)Synopsis: 	 Harry Angel (Rourke) is a rather ragtag and rough and tumble private detective. Always one step away from trouble Harry takes a new case from a rather sinister fellow named Louis Cyphre (DeNiro). It seems that a singer named Johnny Favorite owes Mr. Cyphre a debt that he is to collect upon Favorite's death and it becomes Angels' job to find him and determine his status. When all roads lead to mysteries involving the occult and voodoo, Harry will have to uncover a terrible truth and the cost could be his immortal soul.Acting: 	The acting is superb as each actor brings some really great nuances to their characters. Little scenes in this film seem to be made huge with these little additions. Like the scene where Angel meets Cyphre and DeNiro is rolling the hard-boiled eggs and Rourke counters the menace by tossing a pinch of salt over his lest shoulder. These are the little things that make performances priceless and enduring.Direction / Writing: 	 Expertly written and directed by Parker, every frame of Angel Heart seems to have an inherent grunginess that becomes more menacing as the film progresses. Beautifully set-up scenes do at times seem to have such a textured darkness that the darkness itself seems like a character that threatens to envelope all the characters. Technical: 	The technical aspects of Angel Heart don't disappoint either. Trevor Jones musical score runs a gamut of emotion and feeling. Menace, longing, jubilant, jazzy and erotic overtones make for one of his best scores and he has made several. The editing is top notch too; every scene seems to wield yet another piece of the puzzle and is presented very well. The look of the 50's seems to be presented very well I am no expert on the period but they seem to have done a remarkable job of replicating it.DVD comments: DVD special features consist pf: 	Newly Remastered anamorphic print 	Newly Remastered  dd 5.1 	Alan Parker dvd intro 	New interviews 	Voodoo truths 	An audio commentary by director Alan Parker. 	A scene specific video commentary by Mickey Rourke 	Behind-the-scenes 	Trailer galleryAfterthoughts: 	The dvd is a must for any fan of the film and I particularly enjoyed the voodoo documentary. Angel Heart is a very deep and textured film. I have seen it three times now and it always holds my attention with the details and nuances of the acting and overall production value that is quite remarkable. A must see for all fans.",Angel Heart
84,saadanathan,Lucifer has come for your soul 6/10,6,3 May 2021,"""Angel Heart"" is a thrilling and terrifying movie by Alan Parker, It is the kind of movies you'll take as a perfect example of how to create suspense and tension. Private investigator Harry Angel has been sent by a man named Louis Cypher to find a missing person who ows a huge debt to Cypher, the investigation takes a sudden turn and Angel discovers a horrible truth. The plot itself is interesting and captivating although the movie is really slow and dull. Mickey Rourke gives an incredible and understated performance while Robert DeNiro is amazing as always, he appears in only four scenes but catches the viewer's eye every moment. The main theme of the movie is of course everything that has to do with Satan, souls, voodoo and dark magic. Even DeNiro's character has a game of words in his name, Louis Cypher - Lucifer. Overall it is a nice story with a high level of suspense although at some point it becomes less affecting.",Angel Heart

But the person who has hired him is not quite what he seems.The characters in this film are good. I liked Harry Angel, the investigator. He was likable. The guy he is working for, Louis Cyphre, is awesome... if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. Finally Epiphany Proudfoot was great. The actors playing these characters was also very good. The film stars Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro & Lisa Bonet.I was a little disappointed that Robert DeNiro wasn't in it anywhere near as much as I would have liked. Especially as his character was my favourite.The violence was great in this. It was all psychological. You didn't really see anything throughout the film, but you didn't need to. What you saw was enough to let your imagination work to figure out what happened. There is plenty of blood in this.The movie was slow in places and the story trailed away every now and then.I will give this film 6 out of 10.I did enjoy it, but it should have been better.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Angel Heart
88,acedj,My first mind bender,9,7 November 2019,"I saw this way back in the 90s, when I was a wee lad of 17. This was the first movie that i had seen where the ending threw me for a loop. I honestly did not see some of the twists coming. This is a movie that is expertly paced and acted.
It is the story of a private detective named Harry Angel that is hired to track down a missing person by Louis Cyphre, both played to perfection by Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro. His search leads him into the world of voodoo and to a trail of dead persons. It also leads him into the arms of a woman many years his junior named Epiphany Proudfoot played by Lisa Bonet. What Harry finds at the end of his search is quite shocking.",Angel Heart
89,domino1003,Creepy on so many levels!,7,27 April 2005,"""Angel Heart"" is creepy on so many levels that I thought I would have a hard time explaining myself, but I got a handle on it now, so I can finally write this review! Harry Angel (A cocky Mickey Rourke)is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (A dark Robert DeNiro) to find a musician named Johnny Favourite. Angel is a crude, rather uncouth individual who, at first doesn't want the case, but the chance at earning a nice sum of money, jumps at the chance. Pretty soon, he wishes he hasn't as he is drawn into a very dark landscape involving voodoo,weird visions (Blood everywhere, a person in black sitting in front of an electric chair, and an elevator), and murder in Louisianna. Whenever Angel talks to his acquaintances, they end up dead in gruesome ways (One poor soul ends up in gumbo!).O.K. Kids, this is where the spoilers come into play, so if you haven't seen this film WALK AWAY NOW!!! There are 3 reasons why this film is incredibly creepy: 1) The ending: When Harry Angel finds out the disturbing truth that HE is Favourite and that Cyphre is Lucifer (Which people should have figured out in the beginning), you are in just as much disbelief as he is! How on earth did this happen? When Cyphre breaks it down, and the viewer can see the evidence, then it makes sense. Angel screams in denial, saying that he knows who he is, but then he (And us)starts to realize that he's wrong. He admits to himself (And to the viewers)that HE had committed the horrible murders in the film.2)Lisa Bonnet: I was (and still am) a die-hard fan of ""The Cosby Show,"" and will always see her as Denise Huxtable. Her role as Epiphany was a total change, and to see her in an INCREDIBLY STEAMY love scene with Rourke totally shattered that image. Then for us to find out that she was Rourke's daughter? Another sin that will surely send him to hell (Incest, as well as murder).3)The images and sounds:The constant use of blood,spiral staircases,and elevators are used in a nightmarish way. The viewer gets caught up in the nightmare, swirling out of control like Harry. The final image, of Harry in an elevator, going down, is the scariest of all. You KNOW who he is and what he's done, and he is going to burn. Simply put, he's on an express elevator to hell.One of Alan Parker's best, and he gets great performances from everyone, especially Rourke. And a guarantee good film to give you the shivers!",Angel Heart
90,asc85,The Best Film of 1987,10,2 June 2011,"Maybe because I didn't see the ""twist"" coming until it finally happened, but not only do I think ""Angel Heart"" was the best film of 1987, I think it is one of the most underrated films of the last 25 years. I liked Alan Parker as a director, primarily because I know of few directors who could be so versatile as to make films as diverse as ""Angel Heart,"" ""Shoot the Moon,"" ""Midnight Express,"" and ""The Commitments."" And this is Mickey Rourke's finest performance, and at that time, was why so many of us thought he'd be the next great American actor. I didn't go as crazy over DeNiro as so many others, but he certainly scared me at the end of the movie. All in all, just a great, great film. If anyone reading this review hasn't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to finally do so.",Angel Heart
91,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Feels like a serious predecessor to Jacob's Ladder!,8,29 May 2021,"What a wild movie. This one has been on my to-watch list for quite some time, and just this week I saw it was up on Amazon Prime. I had no idea what type of movie I'd be diving into, but it delivered and surprised me in a multitude of ways. I do feel the need to mention that Jacob's Ladder is one of my favorite movies of all time, and now that I've seen this, I get the feeling that it was HEAVILY inspired by this film. One of the only other movies that comes to mind which is pretty similar in tone is SEVEN / SE7EN - if you're a huge fan of that movie, you should see this.First of all, cast wise - Mickey Rourke is the perfect wisecracker. Totally lovable though you always feel like he's gonna get himself in trouble. He acts his heart out in this - it's fantastic. I'm pretty sure most people consider it his best acting performance - and I would not argue with that (though I think The Wrestler is a better movie overall). I've never seen DeNiro in a role like this. He's pretty campy but totally sells it, and is fully amusing to watch (and look at). Then, Lisa Bonet...wow, what a goddess! Her presence...so elegant and beautiful, with opportunity to show her primal fierceness as well - I've never seen her like this. It was iconic. On that note, this movie withholds one of the most insane sex scenes I have ever seen...The only things that really stop this from being a perfect film are the floppy tone of it all, the fact that it's so out there it's beyond just requiring a bit of suspension of disbelief, and some specific sequences that visually just don't work. However, fans of pulpy, almost exploitation-style tonality will be very pleased - this movie consistently weaves in and out of campy noir-inspired amusement and bleakly disturbing sequences and imagery.The score throbs and pulses like a living, breathing creature. It's very effective and adds to the surreal atmosphere of this bizarre experience. There is a large amount of disorienting or, at the very least, intriguing shots focused on the eerie environment and surrounding and this manages to do a lot to give the film it's own character.Apparently this movie was rated X upon it's release. I'm thinking it's more so because of certain...themes, rather than purely being visually graphic content. You'll see what I mean if you watch it, and I recommend you do. They really don't make movies like this anymore :)",Angel Heart
92,cat_ranchero,"Flawed, but still great!...",8,21 April 2013,"This is a beautifully put together film with some great imagery and a slight fixation for fans (don't worry, this is explained in the narrative). The performances were all excellent with Mickey Rourke easily standing out; he always makes his characters believable and that was most important in this case. Of the others, De Niro was good in the places we saw him although he doesn't have a major part to play; I thought Lisa Bonet did a very reasonable job also. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly has something; and enough something to gain my recommendation.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Angel Heart
93,Didier-Becu,ANGEL HEART (DIDIER BECU),7,18 October 2003,"For me, Alan Parker always used to be one of the most genius directors ever as Parker can create atmospheres like no one else can... ""Angel heart"" featuring Mickey O'Rourke and the as always godlike Robert De Niro is one of the more difficult movies from Parker. Rourke plays the jobless detective Angel who is hired by a man called Louis Cyphre (=Lucifer) who wants to know if a crooner is still alive or not. Little by little Angel is involved in a web in where black magic rules and the VCR might be the perfect tool to investigate some difficult parts (as all by all this movie ain't easy) but the end clears a lot... Not Parker's best one therefore the cinematographic arts are just a bit too aged but still an enjoyable movie and I am sure that from now on you will look at De Niro's fingernails in every movies you'll see by him....",Angel Heart
94,Med-Jasta,Enjoyable enough...,5,12 August 2021,But the twist is so obvious. Like 15 minutes in I figured it out. Of course not all the way but I knew that Mickey Rourke was Johnny in someway. And by the second murder I knew he was the one doing it. And that Bonnet was his daughter. Obvious. I don't know how anybody could have been surprised at the end. Unless they had never seen a movie before.The plot is very good and fast and engaging. Rourke is very good. As always. But when it got to the last third and they didn't reveal what I already knew I got bored. Then I thought the twist might not be what I thought. Hitchcock was very good at making you think one thing but then pulling the rug out from under you. I was hoping this would be the case but unfortunately it wasn't. Parker is really good and his skill is front and present here but he should have known that the audience was smarter.,Angel Heart
95,Bloodwank,Classy and fun though ultimately shallow horror noir,7,6 November 2011,"In Angel Heart we see noir and horror come together. A twisted tale of private investigation, dark secrets revealed, preoccupation with fate and its dark inescapability, the great hallmarks of noir. And with a number of grisly sights and voodoo infused plotting its a basically effective blending of the two genres. Put simply its a thoroughly watchable affair that grips from the start and breezes by with nary a dull spell. Sadly for all its slick watch-ability its too flawed a work to be all that powerful or memorable but its entertaining at least. If entertainment you seek here you shall find it, but I can certainly see why this is lauded more by genre fans than critics. But the pluses first. Mickey Rourke is the biggest in his role as Harold Angel, private eye on the case. Somewhat cynical and sleazy whilst retaining a sense of righteousness its a spot on performance that impresses more and more as the film goes on and things get darker. A terrific focal point, and the rest of the cast is pretty spiffing too, Robert de Niro is on cool and quiet form as Rourkes wryly sinister employer, the ever classy Charlotte Rampling puts in an elegantly witchy turn and the comely Lisa Bonet makes a splash as a young priestess (who appears in the films most eyebrow raising scene. The film looks super too, from the dark alleyway opening with smoke curling up from beneath onwards there's a great sense of the life of place, of human bustle and animal scuffle, heat and wet, richness and poverty. And within it all is the suggestion of dark, but here lies the films main problem. As horror, as dark piece Angel Heart is never more than efficient. Sure there are grisly sights, ones that escalate during the course of the film to one or two nice shocks. But its all too clean and controlled, where delirious revelry is needed the film offers tight editing, smart framing and restraint, clinical cuts to the meat beneath the surface rather than a better double fisted clawing plunge. And much as the horror has little more than surface charm so does the rest of the film. Plentiful symbolic shots of air conditioners hammer home the plight of mechanisms against inevitability, but there's far more atmosphere than suspense and the films revelations are standard genre theatrics. Fate has a face but offers little more than standard villainy, a white man delves deep into colored circles but racial tensions are minimal, no doubt I'll find even more to pick up on with a second viewing. All this is not meant as seriously heavy criticism by the way, its still one of the easiest watched I've had in the past few months, an hour and three quarters or so whipping along like it was less than half that length well mounted with some aforementioned great aspects and quality moments. Its just rather frustrating to see a quality genre piece with a truly great work suffocating within, and at the close of play I couldn't help but sit back and ponder being let down. Still well worth a watch if you haven't yet though, may be lightweight but its still kind of a treat. 7/10.",Angel Heart
96,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,5,3 September 2016,"Last night I watched the film Frailty and I really liked it. I gave the film rating 10! So I wanted to watch something similar and Angel Heart was suggested in many sites. And so I just finished the film and ... It is far far from Frailty. OK, it is some kind of a mystery and horror and psichological thriller but this one was really slow paced, boring at times and overall I am not really thrilled about it.The highlight of the film for me is Mickey Rourke acting as well as Lisa Bonet's ( though I must say I did not recognized her in that satanistic/ritual dancing scene. I thought it was a completely different girl so was rally surprised when they mention in the film it was her!). I liked some of the scenes for their moody and surrealistic setting ( like that Cony Island beach scene and sex scene with blood/rain). From the first moment he was introduced, I knew he was a devil ( De Niro). It was kinda obvious but his role/acting was not particularly memorable to me.The first scene and that dead body... Is that the man /young soldier? Or just a random murdered person?All in all, this film is somewhere in the middle. My rating is five which means it is just interesting as to not make me stop watching it ( though I was giving a thought to).",Angel Heart
97,disinterested_spectator,A Faustian Tale That Makes Sense,10,29 November 2014,"One of the problems with the story of Faust, the man in the German legend who sold his soul to the Devil, is that we never understood why anyone would make such a foolish bargain in the first place. A few decades of wealth, power, fame, and sex in exchange for an eternity of suffering the fires of Hell? Evil may be fascinating, but stupidity never is, and we quickly lose interest in the fate of anyone dumb enough to do that. The story fares much better when understood in the allegorical sense, of course, but it is always better if a story makes sense literally if it is to have much value figuratively.This movie solves that problem. Johnny Liebling is a crooner who thinks he knows a way to trick Satan. He makes a pact with him, in which Satan gets Johnny's soul in exchange for fame as a singer, under the name Johnny Favourite. Having made the deal and benefited from it, he then performs a ritual that involves cutting the heart out of a soldier and eating it. By so doing, Johnny is able to substitute the soldier's soul for his own, the result being that the soldier's soul will have to suffer the fires of Hell, while Johnny's soul does not. The soldier's name is Harold Angel, suggesting his innocence, of course. As part of the ritual, the soldier's dog tags are sealed up in vase. Only if Johnny himself opens the vase will the ritual be undone. Because Satan wants Johnny's soul and not Angel's, he must trick Johnny into breaking open the vase.When World War II breaks out, Johnny is drafted and subsequently suffers an injury, which causes him to have amnesia. He spends some time in a hospital, but his friends get him out. Not knowing what to do with him, they simply drop him off in a crowd of people on New Year's Eve. As a result of Johnny's confused memory about swapping souls with Harold Angel, he comes to believe that he is Harold Angel, and eventually starts working as a private detective under that name.Ten years after the war, which is when the movie starts, this Harold Angel is hired by Louis Cyphre (Lucifer) to find Johnny Favourite. Angel does not realize it, but he has been hired by the Devil to find himself. We do not realize it either, at this point, and we are encouraged by the movie to like Angel and to identify with him. He seems to be basically a nice guy. As he starts investigating, he begins experiencing disturbing images from the past. Little by little, he begins to suspect the truth. He is horrified at the idea that he might be Johnny Favourite, and having come to like him and identify with him, we are horrified too.In his desperation to assure himself that he is who he thinks he is, he breaks open the vase, and the dog tags of the real Harold Angel fall out. The spell is broken. At this point, Louis Cyphre appears, announcing that Johnny's soul now belongs to him. Finally, recent memories that Johnny had distorted are replaced by accurate ones, and he is forced into the realization that he has murdered several people.Because Johnny thought he had a way to trick the Devil, this story works on a literal plane. And by making us like him as Harold Angel and identify with him, the movie forces us to realize that we too may not be as good as we like to think we are, that we too have something inside us that is evil.But a remark made by Louis Cyphre gives this Faustian story a new twist. Cyphre says that Johnny was doomed the minute he cut that boy's heart out. In other words, all that dabbling in black magic and making a pact with the Devil was just so much hocus-pocus. In itself, it was harmless nonsense, and Johnny would never have gone to Hell for that. It was only when he did something truly evil, when he murdered that soldier, that Johnny was damned. By this remark, Cyphre links the literal understanding of this story with its allegorical one.",Angel Heart

As for acting, this is a film in which Mickey Rourke has shown that he can act, and his performance at the end of the film is particularly impressive.The direction is great, with a lot of subtle details that contribute to the atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, the details fit perfectly into the story, and together with the soundtrack they create a truly exceptional cinematographic experience.An interesting and sinister story that seems like another crime story, but the film is much deeper and deals with those things that make us human.

101,The_Core,How terrible is wisdom...,9,5 February 2005,"... when it brings no profit to the wise? On the surface, that seems to be the moral of ""Angel Heart."" But look a little deeper -- the fact is, Harry Angel knew the truth all along, and here's the true moral:""However cleverly you sneak up on a mirror... your reflection always looks you straight in the eye.""Much of the meaning in this dark tale lies in the above line uttered by DeNiro's character, Louis Cyphre. We can pretend to lie to ourselves and bury our heads in the sand, but in the end we know. And it isn't the knowing that hurts us, but all the hiding and lying that went on before.This film has been summed up many times before, so I won't do it again. It's also been said that the film was ahead of its time in 1987, and IMO this can't be emphasized enough. There's no doubt in my mind that it's been an influence on many a filmmaker and screenwriter. Among films of this type it's easier to follow than, say, ""Memento,"" but more befuddled and confusing than ""The Sixth Sense."" You may or may not guess the ending, but if you're the type who's bothered by confusing movies -- simply read all the spoilers or the whole screenplay, THEN see the film! I guarantee you won't enjoy it any less for knowing.Cinematography 10/10, screenplay 7/10, acting 9.5/10, overall I'd give it about a 9/10. If anything makes this movie great (and qualifies it as a classic) it's the cinematography and atmosphere. It really is richly and gorgeously shot, and atmospheric to the nth degree.

102,dschmeding,Classic movie in its effective eerieness,9,24 September 2007,"I remember having seen this movie in the beginning of the 90ies on TV, the strange atmosphere stayed with me but I didn't quite get the movie back then I guess. Watching it now I am really stunned with its plain bleakness, classic plot twists and effectiveness in creeping you out without the nowadays so popular and cheap SAW-Snuff-Stuff. ""Angel heart"" takes place in the 50ies revolving around a private eye from Brooklyn played too damn perfect by Mickey Rourke who gets a job by a man named Louis Cypher (played great like expected by Robert De Niro) to check out where one of his debtors hid. Investigating the case he gets more than knee deep involved in a story full of occult and voodoo themes that throws him into the mad heat of Louisiana.The whole movie is raw and gritty, the soundtrack is minimalistic yet effective and the violence is rather on the sidelines, still sticking in mind. For the atmosphere of eerieness and strangeness (loved the nose shield!) this movie already deserves to be ranked among later classics like ""Seven"" and the final twist of the movie with its subtle ending round it up to be a must-see. Not just the ending, the whole way of telling the story is pretty unique from the saxophone-driven beginning in a dimly lit back alley. Check this movie out by any means if you are bored by all those movies which try creeping you out with extensive gore and close-ups.

103,bbhlthph,A very misguided attempt to create horror.,1,5 September 2010,"Verbal stories, books and dramas, based on the theme of someone prepared to bargain with the devil, and ultimately selling their immortal soul in return for worldly treasure of one type or another, have been a part of the literature of almost every culture and religion since the dawn of writing - so it is inevitable that the cinema has its share. I will nail my colours to the mast right away - in my opinion none of these works surpass the classic play ""Dr Faustus"" by the early English dramatist Thomas Marlowe, either in well rounded dramatic appeal or theological relevance . For me, this play although not totally original towers above later and often better known versions of the Faust legends such as Goethe's dramatic poem or Gounod's opera. All of these however transcend Angel Heart. This popular film still carries a (for me) incredible IMDb users rating of 7.3; if compared with them it can be seen as the absolute trash that it was. Assuming the supernatural was what its makers wanted to feature they would have done far better to base their film on Marlowe's great out-of-copyright drama rather than to purchase rights to a twentieth century imitation set in New York, and then stiffen the content by stirring in a gratuitous mix of voodoo rites that had nothing to do with the book they were filming. But they appear not to have known or even cared, whether their aim was simply to create a horror film designed to appeal to impressionable young people or whether it was to provide some sort of morality linked message - ultimately they achieved neither. True the film has a certain superficial gloss which is initially attractive, but ultimately most of it is simply ludicrous and where its search for horror runs unchecked it becomes crude and disgusting.If its makers aimed simply to create a horror film they needed to recognise that horror comes from showing ordinary normal people going about their normal days activities, and then to gradually make the viewer aware that these people are unknowingly only a hairbreadth away from some contingency that will change their lives for ever. Think not of imaginary monsters or supernatural events, but of such ordinary situations as 2,000 people following everyday activities on the Titanic when they were told that most of them were five hours away from spending their last five minutes battling the cold waters of the North Atlantic. Or think of the office workers in the twin towers carrying out their normal daily activities five minutes before the terrorist's 'plane struck and doomed almost all of them. Among films, few create such a sense of horror better than 'Naked Fear' where a young girl quietly trying to earn her living in a strange town suddenly discovers she is on the hit list of a maniacal serial killer. But Parker's films are always flamboyant and he is not the right director to produce such a film. Instead we have a film steeped in necromancy which can raise little more than a chuckle with its juvenile efforts to make our skin creep. Murnau did far better with his silent classic 'Faust', filmed in 1926 but still supporting an IMDb rating of 8. Did the makers of 'Angel Heart' ever watch this? I have not read their original novel but I understand its scenario was entirely set in New York. Parker has attempted to rake up the horror by shifting the scene to New Orleans and bringing in some lurid voodoo rites. Voodoo beliefs provide much of interest but I felt they were better featured in such simple low cost B movies as 'French Quarter' or 'Barravento' and I do not know what place they were supposed to have here unless it was to provide justification for some of the extremely crude and gross, but totally pointless images - often verging on the obscene - gracing this film. Ultimately for me the only real emotion these raised was extreme distaste. I can only hope that those responsible for the planned re-make are determined to avoid repeating Parker's fiasco.",Angel Heart
104,skallisjr,Worth The Look,9,24 April 2005,"This is a nice mix of noir and spookiness. As has been mentioned before, a detective is hired to find a missing singer, and the path he follows gets darker at every turn. Everyone in the film plays their parts well, and the descent into despair works well.Spoilers: As noted, the detective is actually on a hunt for his real identity, which is sufficiently diabolic for Mr. Cyphere. It's the kind of vengeance fitting the ""crime."" Why such a protracted search? A devilish punishment.The occult aspect of the film is almost superfluous to the action; the murders would work just as well without it; however, it does add to the mood.Nice effort, well worth seeing.

105,lagriff05,I'm speechless---this rules,9,17 June 2007,"(written November 2006)This is an old 80s suspense/thriller film about detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), who has been hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find one Johnny Favorite, once a singer, who owes Cyphre something big from before the war. Harry goes on a long, twisted journey of murder and violence through Louisiana's rougher parts that eventually leads to a startling conclusion.For the life of me, I could not think of much to say about this movie. It's amazing, that's for sure. Great acting, great setting, mind-blowing plot, attractive young women, big names, it's got all of it. There isn't much to say here except that the movie rules. The plot twist is truly genius once you let it sink in.The detractor of this movie is the fact that the ending sucked. It wasn't a good place to stop the movie really. It's a bit hard to swallow at first, you don't know what hit you. And sadly, it doesn't completely make sense, even after you understand it. There are...plot holes, which I won't state here due to not wanting to ruin this movie. And that is really all I can think of to take points off of this masterpiece. Go rent it. Or buy it. Steal it, even. Whatever. Highly recommended to fans of dark and intelligent films.",Angel Heart
106,Jakealope,"Loved This Movie, Stylewise and Acting Wise",9,15 August 2005,"It was the best devilish horror movie next to Rosemary's Baby. The sets, acting and action were utterly consistent and convincing. Mickey Rourke lived the role, making rumpled, street wise Harry Angel by far his best role. DeNiro and Rampling were their usual good. The only ""stunt"" was the hoopla surrounding the sex scene with Lisa Bonet, but that was consistent with the plot too. The atmosphere of the whole movie was unrelenting doom and the imagery, from the fans, elevators and old buildings sets supported that consistently. Not for the weak at heart, it has a few sick scenes and a general air of brutality, it's a film about evil and the Devil.",Angel Heart
107,spacemonkey_fg,Mickey Rourkes finest Performance!,10,3 March 2005,"Title: Angel Heart (1987)Director: Alan ParkerCast: Mickey Rourke,Robert Deniro, Lisa Bonet Review: I cant believe that I had let this movie pass me by! And I call myself a horror fan...anyhows, lets get to the point. This film is awesome! Its great! And I'm really, really glad that I saw it. Robert Deniro and Mickey Rourke, it cant be all that bad right? Right! The story is about a private detective called Harry who is called upon by a man called Louis Cypher to look for another man called Favorite that disappeared many years ago and owes him something. Harry needing the money takes the job and starts to investigate who this guy 'favorite' is and what he did. The journey takes him deep into the heart of voodoo, new Orleans and devil worship! Alan Parker has delivered a truly dark film. I was impressed by the look and feel of the movie which is one of its strongest assets. The film starts out in Los Angeles, kind of like a film noirish dark alley smoke coming out of the streets, fans blowing in the summer heat type of place. Thing is, the movie only gets darker and darker... the deeper Harry is to uncovering the mystery, the darker the film gets. Everything is dirty and steamy. Hot, wet and bloody. As you can see I absolutely loved the visual aspect of this film. But what about its performances? Well Mickey Rourke is the main star here and he delivers the goods. In fact, I think Ill say that this is definitely one of his best -if not the best performance- of his life. The last frames of this film display that this is truly one of the best actors who's sort of disappeared into nowhere. I certainly I'm looking forward to his next film. Lisa Bonet delivers another great performance, too bad she is also hardly ever seen. And speaking of seeing Lisa Bonet...for those of you guys out there with a hard on for her, check this movie out! I think she was only like 18 or something when she did it! But damn it there's a steamy sex scene in which she goes all the way with Rourke and its sexy as hell. Now we understand why Lenny Kravitz wrote all those love songs for her. But get this the scene is not only steamy...its artistic as hell! Once you see the dance of blood that goes on in these sequences well you will be impressed as well, Parker here shows complete domain over using visuals as art.And then there's Deniro. He is good as always...but on this film, the role he plays gives you a real nice chill down your spine. First off he looks menacing as hell with his goatee and his long hair and those long fingernails. He has got this deadly serious tone to him, you don't want to mess with this guy, every word that he spits out sounds threatening. The delivery of his dialog is excellent. Also my hats of to Alan Parker for writing an excellent screenplay.The atmosphere on this film never lets off. Even if the movie starts out in a big city landscape...its a dark and shadowy big city! Then it moves to the bayou in New Orleans and things really start to cook up. Right down to the moment where we witness a real life Voodo Dance ceremony. Alan Parker is a great director, heck who wasn't moved and shocked by Midnight Express? With Angel Heart I really think he delivered yet another great film which should certainly rank way up there among his best films ever.Basically, this movie took me by surprise and I enjoyed every second of it. Its a mystery that you will want to devour slowly. Like a delicious meal that you just want to really savor. A slow boiler for sure, but a good one! Review: 5 out of 5",Angel Heart

The movie does a good job of clearing up the mystery of why we and the devil know that Johnny is doomed, but he and his friends do not.",Angel Heart
109,SeriousJest,Probably De Niro's,9,14 May 2014,"These are some of the best acting performances I've seen from De Niro, Rourke, and Bonet. It is probably De Niro's creepiest role. It's also amazing to see the huge difference 25+ years has made in Rourke's appearance, while how little Bonet has aged.This flick has the ingredients to keep you on the edge of your seat. Aside from the great acting, it is a film noir featuring murder, sex, the occult, two major cities with very different cultures, and a very solid mystery with a twist that I didn't see coming. If you predicted the latter, please let me know in the comments, but precede your post with ""SPOILER.""While the quality of the video, effects, sound, etc, is not on par with today's technology, which could easily render most movies with such a dark tone sleepy, its aforementioned strengths make this movie a classic and one that you will want to watch more than onceprobably not right away, but somewhere down the line, someone will say that they never saw this film, and you will suggest that you both sit down and watch it together. You will probably enjoy watching it the second time around, knowing what to look for.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",Angel Heart
110,K-Slicer,"This movie has ""heart""",8,17 November 2001,"If you thought ""The Wall"" was trippy, Angel Heart is the ""The Wall"" on acid. It is an acid trip inside of an acid trip.  I was horrified and in awe at the same time.  Some of the scenes that contain the most gore and grossness truly capture the aim of the film.  The aim of the film is to show that if you screw with evil, you will get screwed in the end.  While I was supremely sickened by the ""climax"" of the film, I loved the ""twisted"" story and the terrific acting.  Robert De Niro always had a way with playing the bad guy. I can see why he was picked for his role in ""Meet The Parents.""  Overall, Alan Parker succeeded in making a noteworthy film despite depending upon one's opinion of it.  For me, Angel Heart fits into the catergory of good movies that will make your skin crawl.  This is a movie worth some praise despite how sacreligious it is.  I give it an 8 out of 10.  A decent piece of actual horror that uses gore to make a statement which is to make you feel uncomfortable.",Angel Heart
111,KingM21,A Fallen Angel.,7,5 January 2006,"Harry Angel, a low-rent private detective, has been hired by Louis Cyphre to track down a man with whom he has some sort of contract. The investigation leads Harry from person to person, from New York to New Orleans, through many dark twists and turns. As he goes deeper into the case, he gets pulled into a world of Voodoo, the occult, and murder and finds that he himself is involved somehow. He struggles to find out the truth behind everything going on and when he does, it's quite the revelation for him.It took me several viewings to finally grip Angel Heart. The film is a bit difficult, not in that it's hard to understand the plot but that there are so many details to sort through. You must pay attention to make sense of all the names mentioned, the flashbacks, the twists, and a tricky back-story that is given to us piece by piece. That said, when all the things come together, it does work well for the most part. Alan Parker's direction is both subtle and sharp, and he really does a fine job capturing the noir-type mood. He's also able to bring the 50's era to life without going overboard or relishing in it, he just simply shows it. The slushy New York locations contrasted with rainy, humid New Orleans suit the story very well (the change in climate being a reflection upon Harry's own comprehension and, indeed, fate), as does the bluesy/jazzy soundtrack. And that pounding heartbeat really helped to turn the tension levels up. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Harry. He's got just the right amount of New York accent and brings true emotions to his character; formidable, frightened, or distraught, he performs realistically. Now Robert De Niro, it's just a pleasure watching him as a sly Satan! His mannerisms, from a slight grin to a menacing glance to eating an egg, are wonderful. I've read some negative remarks about Lisa Bonet's acting in the film but I thought she did just fine with her role, as did the rest of the cast.So, aside from the sometimes confusing plot points, I thought Angel Heart was a very good horror mystery and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old. I really do enjoy story-driven films dealing with such subject matter and was not disappointed with the one in Angel Heart.",Angel Heart

It had a holographic cover which caught my attention and I saw De Niro was in it so I read the back cover and was immediately enticed. I couldn't find it in any rental stores so I put it in my online queue and I just finished watching it. I have to say it was an extremely good movie and I was just so glad that I found it by a lucky chance. I've always liked Mickey Rourke and have seen a lot of his movies but it's an easy decision to say that he was in top-form for this one. Robert was great in a brand new role for him and I loved it. I must admit that I had no idea what the ending would be and it really threw me through the ringer. The twists and turns were mostly unpredictable, unlike many generic ones we now witness in today's movies. I also found the suspense to be absolutely riveting. While there was some gore I didn't think it was excessively done especially with the whole Voodoo theme going on in the backdrop. The plot does get confusing at times but if you pay attention at the end it'll all come together so just hang in there and you should find your patience to be well worth the wait. Such a good movie!Final Gall:Movies: If it ever gets re-released you can count me in.DVD Purchase: It's still expensive despite the sale but I can see myself buying it in the near future.Rental: Do so!",Angel Heart
115,BlueSkies765,Great movie,10,13 June 2020,"In the beginning of the movie I forgot that Mickey Rourke is actually an established actor. For some reason I kept associating him with boxing and was wondering why he's in the lead. It's funny how the mind can work. However he stole the show with an amazing performance. Quickly reminding me he was cast as the lead for a reason.The movie has a little rough patch. Some scenes felt a bit repetitive and could've been left out or shortened but whatever it's only a small thing.
I liked the style of the movie. Set in the 50s it showed the rougher side of living. A lot of times movies are very polished with clean streets etc. which gives it a majestic viewing experience but in this case the gritty settings was better suited for the main characters journey.The movie moves as a mystery but always has a feel that something really strange is going on because occasionally there are some shocking scenes. A concept that was creatively executed with a strong ending that will definitely make you think for a little bit. Overall just a great movie.",Angel Heart

The direction is truly amazing, as Parker drives us deeply through a meticulously prepared dark atmosphere, full of allegories and secret hints.In ""Angel Heart"", we watch Mickey Rourke in his finest acting hour, who plays Harry Angel, a private investigator hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre, depicted by the great Robert De Niro. Cyphre assigns Angel the task to find a guy named Johnny Favorite who has disappeared, with whom he has unsettled debts. The task is much harder than it first looks however, as Angel bumps into several murders in the process; and as if that were not enough, the quest makes him realize some very unpleasant truths about himself and Mr. Cyphre.As noted before, both Rourke and De Niro are excellent in their roles; a high mark goes for the rest of the cast as well, with Lisa Bonnet standing out as charming and apocryphal Epiphany Proudfoot. Yet, the 10/10 mark for this film is definitely credited to Alan Parker's direction: It is his masterpiece.",Angel Heart

Trevor Jones' music was brilliant and a few days after seeing the movie I bought the soundtrack. While the record spun often on the record player, I didn't see the movie again until a few days ago - and the magic hadn't left.

121,Putzberger,From the heyday of Extended MTV,5,27 February 2009,"This movie works as a montage of images that range from the mildly disturbing (the old lady standing in the surf, singing as a storm gathers) to the intensely disturbing (blood dripping on Mickey Rourke's bare butt while he chokes Lisa Bonet). So it belongs in a little-acknowledged genre of expressionistic 80s films that combine intense visuals with a silly or incomprehensible plot (think ""The Hunger,"" ""Altered States"" and ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" which also starred Mr. Rourke). Let's call these flicks ""Extended MTV."" The storyline of ""Angel Heart"" veers closer to the ""silly"" end of the Extended MTV spectrum -- Rourke plays a hard-bitten private detective hired by a mysterious, slightly sinister wealthy man (Robert De Niro, showing off) to find a vanished singer named Johnny Favorite. Yeah, the set-up is kind of ""Big Sleep""-y, but the actual film is more ""Rosemary's Baby"" meets ""Total Request Live."" Rourke's (Hark the) Harry Angel character wanders around some creepy New Orleans sets, loses an underacting contest to Charlotte Rampling, watches Lisa Bonet choke a chicken (literally) and eventually finds out that he's . . . whoops, I don't want to ruin the ""surprise"" if you bother following the plot.If you're not familiar with Mickey Rourke and wonder why he had to make a comeback in ""The Wrestler,"" well, ""Angel Heart"" explains it all for you. He's charismatic enough to command your attention but self-conscious enough to annoy you every second that he's on screen. Charlotte Rampling, one of the most underrated villainesses in film, is arresting in a small, thankless role and you wish she'd stick around long enough to rip Rourke's heart out instead of . . . uh-oh, almost spilled the beans again. Lisa Bonet was paid to look pretty and get naked, and she earns her salary. And every now and then De Niro likes to demonstrate that he's also a great theatrical actor, capable of vanishing behind costumes, accents and mannerisms (think ""Brazil""). He seems to be enjoying himself as the menacing Louis Cyphre (cute, huh?)so ""Angel Heart"" is worth renting if you're a De Niro completist. Or if you're a fan of goofy, overproduced, underwritten 80s movies that fooled a few inebriated undergrads into thinking they were bleeding-edge art (or was it just me?).",Angel Heart
122,sc8031,Naked breasts -- the most wholesome stuff in this flick :),6,26 May 2008,"Horror, suspense, action, gore, softcore porn? Here's a movie that probably inspired the more recent flicks, The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate. It has really good acting and very solid dialog, but the pacing is a little off and the plot revelations come very late in the film and rather clumsily at that.Mickey Rourke is really good. His character is pretty entertaining to watch, likable and revolting at the same time. The exchanges between him and most other characters are pretty good and Rourke's guy Angel gets in a lot of good lines. The homage to '40s noir is really excellent, the sets are legit and the music is moody and eerie and never lets up. This stuff carries the movie pretty far. Really excellent is the elevator motif and its recurring symbolism. I liked that a lot. Those elevator shots ruled and were way ominous.In the DVD extra interview, the director mentions the book this movie is based on stays central to NYC. But the director took creative liberties with the film and moved part of the story to the Louisiana bayou. This is where the film slows down and becomes somewhat choppy. A lot of stuff happens with loose ends or nothing is revealed to the viewer until the final scenarios play out, those of which I personally did not find to be anything particularly mind-blowing. The first half of the flick breezes by, but the second half seems to take a really long time.Oh, also the ""occult"" elements are totally amateurish (not to mention the horrible, horrible special effects!). I mean, come on people! Consult someone who knows their satanic jazz before you start talking about black magick and whosits. Intriguingly, I felt the same way about The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate, though I thought those films had much better pacing, even though the acting might not have been up to par.It's worth watching if you're a sucker for Rourke's acting chops, occult or alternative suspense/horror flicks, or you just wanna see Rourke's hairless bum (I'm serious). The feeling of this movie reminded me of some of those decent H.P. Lovecraft movies (""From Beyond"") and the presence of a NYC-Bayou connection with the devil involved reminded me of that guitar/blues-related Ralph Macchio vehicle, ""Crossroads"", from around the same time as ""Angel Heart"".",Angel Heart

124,RileyOnFilm,DeNiro as the One We Do Not Speak of ...,8,28 April 2019,"Robert DeNiro comes on screen very quickly. His fingernails are sharpened like demonic claws. There is another religious theme that shows itself right away, the ""name it and claim it"" prosperity gospel. This draws us in to this mysterious horror film. As of 4/26/2019 Angel Heart was streaming on Amazon Prime Video. The rest of this review contains spoilers.Mickey Rourke's character is a private investigator. He's been retained by DeNiro's character, ""Mr. Cypher"" to find Johnny Favorite. He has to determine whether he is alive or dead. Sounds easy enough? I think it's clear at the get go Cypher is not of this world. I originally suspected he was the devil. It was pretty neat to see Kathleen Wilholte as the records clerk. I recalled seeing her as Luke's sister on Gilmore Girls.Rourke's character ""Harry Angel"" interrogates a poor of addicted doctor in his own home. You can see right away Rourke is used to dealing in unorthodox methods. After getting some info on Johnny Liebling (Favorite) , he locks the old man in his room. He is a quite brutal interrogator. Upon returning, he sees the old man has committed suicide. He was an addict but it seems somehow implausible that he would do it. Angel tries to get out of the job and Cypher lures him in with $5000. He was previously making $120 a day. Although he is spooked and possibly a murder suspect, Angel reaffirms himself to the case.He discovers Johnny Favorite is some kind of deceiver. He's had facial reconstructive surgery and paid off a doctor to claim he is still in the hospital when he is out and doing things. Just what he is doing we don't know at this point. Continuing the journey, Angel meets up with his informant girlfriend. She strips naked while talking to him and they make love. This is all despite his almost hallucinatory visions he starts having about wheels and fans and shady places. Rourke looks so cool in this film. It's a gumshoe film noir.He proceeds down to Coney Island and has a conversation with a woman who once knew Johnny Favorite. He finds out there was some witchcraft associated with the guy. A lady from the carnival was introducing him to it. His character just gets more and more mysterious from that point.Angel tracks down a fortune telling woman played by Charlotte Rampling and rings her doorbell. The New York buildings and antique interiors are beautiful. They serve to entrance you. There is a supernatural vibe throughout. All the familiar faces here are very young. After all, it is from 1987. She tells Angel Johnny is dead and seems offended. She kicks him out. He wants his palm read but she says, ""I don't think you'd like what I see.""He goes into a Cajun Voodoo shop and asks about a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. He rents a car to venture out to see her. She is dead but her daughter is played by Lisa Bonet, most will remember her as one of the daughters on the Cosby Show. She looks great soaking wet, t-shirt and all. Soon she's in a scene writing to a drumbeat naked pouring chicken blood on her chest. Times have changed I guess, especially if you think about how Cosby is in jail for feeding ruffees to women and raping them.To make a long plot shorter, we end up finding out that Angel was being paid by the devil himself (DeNiro) to investigate and reveal his own misdeeds. The end of the film is a revelation to Angel that he is indeed Johnny and he's been living in someone else's memories. I don't really get the very end of the film. It's spooky and creepy but doesn't make a lot of sense. That babies yellow eyes? WTF. This is an incredible film from 1987. It gets 10/10 stars from me. Over and out.",Angel Heart
125,pcsarkar,Mickey Rourke Inc.,2,8 April 2012,"After reading all the stupendous reviews of this film , and then seeing this dreary movie myself, I have to come to realize that either I am totally out of sync or the movie was itself out of sync, with both period-film production as well as modern cinematography.Leaving comparisons with the novel aside (and that is true for 99% of Hollywood films based on popular novels), this film is about the mannerisms of the lead actor, Mickey Rourke. The movie must be having about a million camera angles of Rourke's face, the way he speaks, mumbles, stumbles, lurches, runs, drinks, fights, romances, jokes, grimaces, smokes umpteen cigarettes, etc etc etc. The pacing of the film is so slow that it is a perfect panacea for insomniacs. Robert de Niro, as usual, is a treat to watch, and his perfectly manicured nails made my perfectly manicured and coiffured wife, suffer from an inferiority complex. The allusion to voodoo is pure crap and the film suffers badly till the end, as it is neither a horror nor a murder mystery. It has absolutely no re-watch value, and I doubt that anyone will suffer the first 90 minutes of pure, unadulterated boredom, just to enjoy the 5-minute twisty end.To repeat: A good substitute for Alprax, for those on medication for insomnia.",Angel Heart

The premise sounds like a regular mystery of a missing person, with the investigator, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke) following every lead he gets. But things are not as straightforward as they may seem, as Harold slowly uncovers the disturbing truth behind the disappearance.I am surprised Angel Heart doesn't even have a 8/10 rating on IMDb. It definitely deserves much more than a 7.2. At least from horror/thriller film loyalists, 'cause this one is definitely a cut above some other cheap, B-horror flicks. This movie is a close second to the brilliant 'Jacob's Ladder' from the same producers (Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna).Alan Parker's direction is excellent. The background score by Trevor Jones is well in place and perfectly complements the dark mood of the movie.What can I say about the performances that hasn't already been said! This is quite possibly Mickey Rourke's career best performance! He shows a wide range of emotions, with so much ease. He sinks his teeth firmly into the character and fits the role of Harold Angel to the T. Not to mention he has great screen presence and charisma.As for the great Mr. De Niro...this is one actor who never fails to amaze me. Just when I thought he couldn't possibly be as brilliant as (or better than) he was in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver or The Godfather Part II or even Casino, I come across this GOD of a performance..De Niro's Louis Cyphre! This is what a true performance is all about!!! And what's more, De Niro is hardly there on screen (maybe a total of about 15 minutes?), but you've got to hand it to him....he makes it a point to be extraordinary in every frame he appears in! This is one less known but magnificent performance from the legendary actor.And then there's a special mention of Lisa Bonet. She delivers in her small role as Epiphany.All said, 'Angel Heart', is not to be missed. Strongly recommended for the fans of creepy and twisted movies.",Angel Heart
127,inioi,Remains in our subconscious,10,4 December 2015,"I watched the movie back in 1987 in Madrid with a group of friends.The theater was crowded. When the movie finished and the lights turned on, nobody moved from their seats. the film was so shocking, deep, intelligent, terrifying, that simply we were not able to assimilate what we saw.This is not a usual horror movie. Is extremely psychological. Some days after watching the movie i was under the influence of this feeling: a kind of unusual fear, which lies deeply at the bottom of our subconscious . Ancestral, ancient fear. In order to cause this feeling, the director conceived a claustrophobic atmosphere, highly mysterious and disturbing: spiral staircases, shadows, opening and closing doors, intense and visceral soundtrack full of subliminal sounds, and most important: an intelligent and totally different plot from what we've seen so far.It is also a story about karma and it's remuneration. The discovery of who we really are. Fate.10/10",Angel Heart

The actors were bad and seemed to reveal too much to keep you in suspense. I was very disappointed in this movie. Someone who knows me well recommended it, thinking the ending would surprise me.

And to a point, they're right - ""Angel Heart"" is totally an eighties film, a film of the decade in which the movie world was discovering a new visual language in video and playfully indulged in experimenting with its new toy. It was literally speaking to a generation straight out of MTV classrooms and workshops and is in that sense very similar to stuff like ""Betty Blue"". And true enough, there is a lot to remark on what can today be seen as a slightly poseur-ish ""one too many revolving fans, angularly lit staircases and heartbeat sounds in the soundtrack"" kind of thing. However, ""Angel Heart"" does carry a tremendous amount of energy thanks to its imagery, which will stick to the viewer's mind in exactly the same way a sweaty shirt sticks to the body in sticky weather. Besides, the impeccably drawn cast led by Rourke does a truly remarkable job - that's beyond question - the sets are great, production design and cinematography are very evocative, the soundtrack is memorable and the story is one of the crucial ones.

134,drunken_critic,Rourke sold his soul in 1987,9,10 April 2005,"This movie was amazing. I always judge a great movie by the criteria: Is it good enough to watch again and again. The answer to this movie is yes. This movie is an unfolding mystery starring Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro. First off the scenery was spectacular. The movie is supposed to take place in the 50's, and it captures the film noir scenery perfect. I have to give credit to the director Alan Parker, who has an impressive list of films directed. Also amazing is Mickey Rourke's performance. Barfly is probably on my top ten list, and it starred Mickey Rourke. I loved his performance in that movie. It is amazing that he starred in two great movies in the same year. Both this movie and Barfly was released in 1987, and both movies in my opinion are required viewing. 1987 was an amazing year for Rourke. It makes me think maybe he sold his soul to the devil, just like the character he played. Prior to seeing Barfly and Angel Heart, ironically, I thought Rourke was a worthless actor. I saw him in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro man, and I could not understand all the hype he was receiving for being an actor. Now I understand! The story itself is complex, and it leaves the viewer to come to conclusions and answer their own questions. A look at the IMDb.com message board will verify this. There are many posts with questions trying to figure out answers to the movie. Repeat viewing will help you answer these questions.92/100",Angel Heart
135,p-seed-889-188469,Fascinating journey to mumbo-jumboland,7,7 May 2014,"Angel Heart is one of those movies where the journey is so interesting you can be very forgiving when you find the destination is disappointing. Quite frankly the destination is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that has plot holes big enough to drive an 18 wheeler through, but by that time we have been well satisfied and entertained by the ride to get there, so I for one am not complaining.I've watched this movie a few times now, first because it is so stylishly noir and evocative of a time and place and genre, and secondly because I really would like to get my brain around the actual premise of the diabolical transaction that took place. I really don't understand who or what Harry Angel is. His body is obviously not Johnny Fortune's, nor is it that of the original ""Harry Angel"", the army guy who was butchered as part of the ceremony to transfer Johnny's soul. And why did Margaret Crusemark and her father actually assist in this process, since we find out later that she hated Johnny Fortune? And why does she not recognise Harry Angel as being that soldier when they meet years later? So many questions, so many flaws, so fundamental that it forces you to watch the movie again and again to get to the truth, if there is one.If there is one thing I would criticise it is the unnecessarily gruesome way in which people die. Maybe it is true to the book, I don't know, but it adds nothing to the movie, and in fact quite the contrary, it jars badly with the standards you would expect in what is essentially a 1950s period piece. For me the fact that people simply die is enough to tell the story, I don't need to know they had their genitals cut off, or whatever.I love the little ""extraneous"" details that are thrown in. Like when Harry greets an unknown girl on the sidewalk and asks if her new boyfriend really owns a car. We never see her again, and it adds nothing to the progress of the movie, yet it says so much about Harry as a person, as part of a community, and makes you care about him so much more.Much has been said about Robert de Niro's work, I agree it's fine, but really no more than you would expect. I loved his line ""the future isn't what it used to be"". Who'd have thought the Devil could be a stand-up comedian.Mickey Rourke of course holds the whole thing together and he does a brilliant job of portraying a believable gumshoe doing the best he can, but for my money the best piece of acting comes from whoever plays the morphine addicted doctor.So a mixed bag here, a rough diamond, but with enough allure to make me watch it again and again, which I guess makes it a great movie.",Angel Heart
136,luke-346,Matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike!,8,7 December 2007,"I'm glad I caught this because what was seen by many as a poor film in 1987 can only be seen as great film in 2007. Angel Heart is one of those films that matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike. A psychological horror/thriller is one of the hardest genres for a director to prosper in but if you were to mix in spiritual and religious elements along with a heap of film noir, a touch of romance and a smidgen of jazz then you would set yourself a near impossible task, nevertheless it would be a task in which Alan Parker would succeed.The direction of this film is masterful as Parker engages us through a meticulous atmosphere littered with mysterious allegories, gut rendering paranoia and an unmatched sense of place. This unmatched sense of place is a symptom of his stark imagery and sombre lighting which is played out through an amalgamation of film noir and the focal iconography of 50s and 60s French New Wave (the use of elevators, ceiling fans, staircases etc).For many of these reasons and more Angel Heart is a very influential film and its inspirations can be seen in many of the psychological thrillers/horrors released in the past 20 years, it is thought provoking and at times a lot more disturbing than any of its genre equivalents. The multi-faceted love scene in the film is one such example, it plays very well as it is cleverly interspersed with a host demonic echelons which (given its style and narrative position) I believe to be unparallelled, even in contemporary cinema.Overall Angel Heart is a very well paced and well acted film  although initially I felt that having Mickey Rourke in the lead role was a poor choice (based on his more recent work) but clearly he was at his acting best in his younger days almost Oscar-worthy, Robert De Niro is also on form as is the young Lisa Bonet  but these performances combined with everything else make Angel Heart a film that will stick with you, not as much as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning (dir. Alan Parker), but enough to make you ponder why this film wasn't so successful upon its initial release and enough to curse why he didn't spend more time dabbling in the psychological/horror genre.",Angel Heart

138,Global_Marketing_Pros,"A play of spirituality and Satan, finding the truth of human nature and the sovereignty of leadership",8,26 September 2006,"This is a very unique movie which plays with the concept of death and spirituality. In unexplainable situations the body dies but the soul is unprepared. For some reason the soul needs a guide to help it find its way home to reach the logical conclusion.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0bYEey2ztQ This is a video about reaching truth of society for political power.Robert Deniro plays the character of the angel of the lord our God sent down from heaven. His mission is to reveal the truth to a human soul which is misguided. By his guidance the truth is revealed. Although painful human nature is shown its reward by its actions.Since Robert DeNiro is supposedly Jewish I often wonder if he also studies the Jewish Kabbalh. This is also a concept to reach enlightenment and truth of human society. This is free and only requirement is to have an open mind and open heart. According to my research Hasidism, based in the Kabbalh, became popular around the turn of the 18th Century which also stressed dance and music. As symbols have been often used music may have been interpreted as a truly logical and creative eloquence that is universal among people.Some people have different senses of logic to determine which music is the best. The screams of pain and suffering, rejoice song, religious belief song, drums and trumpets of ancient warfare, laughter and other emotions. Natural verse electronic. Obviously in this film prefers natural saxophone music similar to a natural trumpet mouth.Again the main theme is for the soul to reach truth, enlightenment, and or peace. Its not very peaceful to find out that the screams of pain and suffering is a desirable aspect of the investigation, even though they are naturally made by the mouth of a human soul.I think the human soul has a universal sound in elation such as laughter, crying, pain, happiness. Why Lucifer prefers the natural course seems to entice a hatred of the concept of Satan, but similar to the concept presented in Dantes'Inferno. Although Dantes' Infernio could be more related into an investigation of feudalism, monarchy, administrative corruption by human vices. Which were more of the era of Orthodox Christian thought.Since this film deals with eggs, being a symbol of the soul, and as Satan devours one explaining his orders for the investigation. Perhaps it is something Satan desires as well found in the musical essence as a survival tactic. Partly because Satan desires payment of this soul, and partly because Satan is being responsible, but would like to keep something which seems to be the ethical vice in natural music to further distinguishes his evil presence in the eye of the public. Or in this case the viewer of public censorship concerning the evil of man embodied in Satan as generally perceived by the public.I discovered the secret of royalty despite this film about the Pagan Occult with the innocence of a child. Its not the hand that guides the sword for a true leader, but the mind that guides the motives of society. Hence the orb in the left hand and sword in the right of a seated ruler. The orb could be seeds, medicine, or other knowledge condensed for the transfer into society by the ruler. As in the movie James Bond in Octopussy the Russian usage of eggs may symbolize seeds of the population or fertility ornately by jewels. But again it is the loyalty of a subject which brings the truth to protect society into the hands of their sovereign leadership that defies the forces of evil that should seek destruction of the soul of a nation.",Angel Heart

I think the only reason it is taking so long for this film to get recognized is because of it's ultra-dark theme.  Let's face it, most people these days just aren't comfortable with this sort of truly evil story and unlikable, diabolical characters.

It is easy to forget what a good actor Mickey Rourke really is based on some of his film choices over the years, but he is a good actor and this film showcases his broad talent. He can play an entire range of emotions and he is very talented.

Far from being confused, it is actually quite simple and straightforward. Far from being plot less, ""Angel Heart"" has one of the most intricate and well-constructed plots of any film I have seen. Every shot in this film carries a hidden meaning, from the opening with the young man's corpse, to the whispers in Harry Angel's ear, to Harry shattering a mirror, to the direction turned by the blades of fans.

Finding Fortune is proving problematic for Harry and this is not helped by people connected to the investigation turning up dead after being murdered in varied gruesome ways. His investigation eventually takes him to New Orleans where the trail takes a very unexpected and sinister turn.Rourke is fantastic as Harry Angel and really exercises his acting chops here. De Niro absolutely relishes the role of Mr Cyphre. I was an enormous fan of Rourke's in the 1980's, he really was drop dead gorgeous in those days.Parker creates an authentic 1950's New York and the steamy heat of New Orleans just about rolls off the screen.

He knows it from the beginning, but the problem he has is that Harry doesn't know it. He sets Harry the tasks of finding the missing singer already knowing what Harry may find and counting on it.In esoteric lore, you cannot actually sell your soul to the devil because you don't own your soul, it is a part of the highest god level. You can only think you sell your soul to the devil and go through with whatever deal you think you have. If you don't know you have a deal, you cannot be asked to pay.That is why the deception to get out of the deal with the devil worked.

Very confusing film, I couldn't work out what was real and what wasn't, and the ending doesn't make sense to me - if Angel is really Johnny what is the relevance of him killing all those people? Or is it so they don't identify him? I have no idea. If he had changed into looking like the soldier then wouldn't Margaret have recognised him anyway?

I was already somewhat of a Rourke fan, having enjoyed his work in ""Rumble Fish"" and ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"". ""Angel Heart"" made me a believer for good. His performance was so charismatic and raunchy, but also subtle and nuanced. He's the anti-hero. He plays a Private Dick who goes on a wild goose chase through New York and New Orleans, seeking a missing person. That's the basic thrust of the story, but it is filled with twists and turns and menace and mayhem, and the lush photography and spot-on set designs are a pleasure to the eye. It has elements of ""Gothic"" horror, but it is really more of a mystery/thriller. Despite Robert DeNiro's presence throughout the film, Lisa Bonet's massive sex appeal, and Alan Parker's excellent direction, it is Rourke who carries the film. His acting is so human and true and vulnerable, especially at the film's crescendo, that it leaves a lasting imprint on the memory. Angel Heart is an underrated gem of a film, that although has a cult following, should be more universally honored for it's originality and overall excellence.",Angel Heart
155,area01,If I was going to make a film,10,5 January 2006,"If I was going to make a film, I think that Angel Heart is the type of film I would love to make. It had a superb moody atmosphere with great locations like Cooney Island, New Orleans and The Bronx. Actors like Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and Charlotte Rampling at the top of their form, and a slow dream-like quality not seen too much in today's Cinema. It also mixed ""genres"" very successfully - merging the traditional gritty private eye format with an occult supernatural story-line - a unusual amalgam at the time, and not really revisited since this fine outing. There's also a fair amount of black humour, and a wealth of sparkling cameo performances (Izzy and Wife) that add depth and quirkiness to the film - making the overall experience even more enjoyable.I get the impression that director Alan Parker was at a point in his career where he could choose the style of movie he wanted to make, and was willing to direct against ""type"" with this private eye/occult thriller. This must have been magnificent freedom for a director - along the lines of David Lynch and Spike Lee making the movies they wanted to, with seemingly little studio interference. Alan Parker had had great success up to this point with films like Fame and Midnight Express, so he had some clout with the studios, and they knew that he was likely to produce a quality movie.I think that Angel Heart is one of those buried treasures that has not even achieved ""cult status"" - it seems to be below the radar for most movie watchers - even the UK DVD release seemed low-key and budget-priced, but very well done with a superb transfer, director commentary and informative extras. IMDb review comments mostly praise the film - but I feel that it's an 80's gem that ranks along side Good Fellas, Blue Velvet and deserves a much wider audience.So now that Angel Heart has been made - I will have to set my sights on making another classic unknown film, I suppose the world is my celluloid oyster..",Angel Heart
156,ztruk2001,Angel Heart will have you gasping for air.,10,20 April 2005,"There's enough broken down fans, chickens, dark allys, twists, and seedy characters in this thing to keep you glued to your seat, contemplating the film, for hours after its concluded. Quite frankly, you'll be too terrified to even move. If anyone has played the excellent Sierra adventure game, ""Gabriel knight: Sins of the Fathers"", you'll see a clear inspiration with this movie. Angel Heart is a nightmare of a film-noir flick with a little of the horror genre mixed in. Truly one of the most involving films I've ever seen and by the end of it, the audience will feel as though they've been taken through Hell. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a small time private investigator in New York City. Most of his clients are jealous lovers and that sort. Angel gets a call one day by Louis Cyphre, a clergyman of a strange religion, asking him to track down a man who is in dept to him. Angel Heart moves like a detective drama with the pacing. But the film is so much more than just a gather clues and evidence type of thing. There's a real psychological horror that builds up as Angel nears closer and closer to his man and as he begins to question the validity of his employer, Mr. Cyphre. Mickery Rourke is brilliant in the movie. He plays a detestable and dirty chainsmoking hustler who will do almost whatever it takes to find the person he's after. Yet the character is also likable because of Rourke's charm, which allows for us to care about him. Robert DeNiro is creepy and downright disturbing as Louis Cyphre in all his subdued glory. The production is amazing. Angel Heart feels like a dark moody blues and jazz number. The story starts in New York and ends up in New Orleans. Lisa Bonet and Rourke have one of film's most notorious moments, a sex-scene that got her kicked off ""The Cosby Show"" and almost landed the film with an X-rating. Parker's movie ain't for the squimish or faint of heart, that's for sure. Many of the voodoo scenes with chickens are freaky enough, let alone several of the films' gruesome murders. Alan Parker directed the film perfectly. He's vowed to work in every genre and made one hell of a flick with Angel Heart. Michael Seresin did the cinematography for the movie. He also shot Parker's earlier film, Midnight Express. Trevor Jones composed the film's score. Overall just a damn fine piece of movie making. You'll be hard pressed to find a more surreal and nightmarish movie than this with such great acting and storytelling. The ending will leave you gasping for air, yet somehow you will have seen it coming all along. Grade: A+",Angel Heart

Well, there can be many reasons for that, but although I was the movie second time recently. I remembered lot of it, but it didn't spoil any of the atmosphere of the movie. It still rocks.

158,Holden_Pike,images indelibly fixed to the soul,9,15 October 1998,"This is a beautifully told but very ugly story that will stay with you for days (and nights) afterwards.  The cinematography in this movie is striking. It is a tribute to and a step beyond the greatest B&W film noir of the past. It ranks up there with ""BladeRunner"" and ""SE7EN"" as modern standards of light and shadow as character.  New Orleans has never looked more elegantly seedy.  This marvellous photography is used by Alan Parker to create a very ominous and nasty atmosphere, which is perfect for this clever detective tale gone gothic horror.  The tone of this film is palpabele.  Mickey Rourke is excellent here, easily the most complete and interesting performance of his career, and DeNiro looks like he's having fun as Mr. Cyphre.  Unlike recent films such as ""Fallen"" and especially ""The Devil's Advocate"" there are no cop-out endings that ring unfair or false, just the inevitable conclusion to the story of a doomed soul.",Angel Heart

It's one of those films, like Sixth Sense, that plays differently (and just as strongly) the second time around. I saw it about ten years ago and loved it. Just watched the DVD and still loved it, but DeNiro's performance really stands out on second viewing! First time I didn't get his attitude. This time I saw the humor in his performance. Also really appreciated the PLOT on second viewing. Not confusing or intricate at all, but truly ingenious and evil - and something true to DeNiro's character. And Mickey Rourke is phenomenal. A truly great performance. You really feel for him at the end. Ditto the music and beautiful cinematography. Watch the DVD if you can.

162,rainfall,"Parker's ""Faust""",10,16 November 2006,"If to choose things that influenced Parker's masterpiece, there must be ""Faust"" and noirs of the 40ies-50ies. It's just simple like that but at the same time it isn't. It doesn't mean Parker's picture is a licentious screening of Goethe's tragedy or stylized retro-noir. It is a unique piece of cinema that had never been done before or after. Having received rather controversial reviews buy American critiques, it's been underrated from the very release. It got it's cult meaning only years later, when it has been recomprehended around the world. But even today many people see only movie's external cover not willing to think on it's deep philosophical issues. In my opinion, this this certainly Mickey Rourke's best role and it's a big pity seeing what he did with his career. De Niro makes a very memorable cameo as Mephisto. In fact, the whole casting seems to be just perfect, from cold-eyed Charlotte Rampling to magnifying Lisa Bonet. For those who think that Hollywood of the 80ies was becoming commercialized and too viewer-friendly, Angel Heart is a living evidence that it also gave birth to such transcended pieces of cinema. 10 out of 10.",Angel Heart

Seriously!I had to go outside and walk around to get rid of the feeling it was so freaky.I have probably seen Angel Heart ten times since then. It is brilliantly acted, directed, written, and photographed. It has so many little details that you miss the first time around. I rate it easily as one of the best films of the 80s. I'm so glad (and not at all surprised) that people are rediscovering it now.

I had to watch it several times to understand all the movie's complexities  If you watch Angel Heart after The Sixth Sense and Devil's Advocate, you'll see many similarities between the 3 movies.

165,simonesecci,A majestically eerie movie by Alan Parker,8,4 May 2020,"Angel Heart it's a movie that gives you something different every time you re-discover it. Every cinematographic element in this movie is pretty extraordinary. From the incredible performance of both Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke to the masterwork of Alan Parker.
There is a perceivable balance in the visuals between a melancholic celebration of the 1950s, (the shots embrace that imagery fully, almost like an Edward Hopper's painting) and the expressionist use of Chiaroscuro where the sinister undertone of the movie takes over, but the two coexist perfectly to create a truly unique feeling throughout the movie.
The screenplay embraces the dualism of the descent into madness/descent into hell and it does so gradually, with increasingly disturbing and gruesome elements that eventually reach an inevitable peak by the end.
However at its best Angel Heart is not just style over substance, is a very captivating supernatural thriller that keeps you glued to your chair all the way to the end, wanting for more.",Angel Heart
166,jimmykebab,A harrowing tale of noir atmosphere blended with black magic,10,19 November 2005,"The film starts with a lone figure walking down a dark alleyway passing a mutilated corpse, who is this figure? See if you can work it out. This kick starts the amazing piece of cinema that is Alan Parker's Angel Heart.Mickey Rourke slides into his role as the sleazy P.I. Harry Angel, relishing the character and chewing the scenery as he goes. He is hired by, the absolutely terrifying, De Niro (as Louis Cyphre) to track down the popular singer Johnny Favourite. What starts as a seemingly simple missing person case, turns into a tale of all out horror as Angel careers closer and closer to the mind of Johnny Favourite. Paranoia sets in and elaborate dream sequences help to show his fractured mind, with Alan Parker packing in some of the greatest and indeed chilling Manichean, among other,imagery> helping to create an indescribably tense atmosphere. Lisa Bonet also provides some excellent support, and misleads the audience as well as Angel.The ending itself is a kick to the senses, and makes for the most visceral and indeed scary ends to a film.

167,nycweboy1,Gothic Noir,8,25 May 2021,"Billed at the time as a dark retro noir thriller, Angel Heart lays on its elements pretty thick - and mostly so skillfully, you may genuinely try to argue against the obvious solution even as it stares you in the face. In retrospect, it feels a little foolish to have fallen for it - blame it on the mix of hoodoo hooey and overheated sexuality steaming off the leads - but many works have wandered this ground since, and they still make it work. Whether it's Rourke's best performance or just an over the top production that makes him seem subtle, is up to you. It's Bonet who completely up ends all expectations, giving a smart, sexy unapologetic take on a badly stereotyped role. The supporting players are ""A"" stars on B material, making the proceedings look more classy than seamy, a Chinatown with even looser morals, as if that were possible. It's DeNiro who all but gives the game away, and even he refuses to wallow in the dirt. Classy and sleazy all at once, Angel Heart still works. But with time and distance, it's less art and more clever muck than I once thought.",Angel Heart

Few horror movies get to be this good; and many try to emulate it's mood to no avail.Angel Heart is considered Alan Parker's Master Piece for a good reason. The acting is quite excellent (except maybe for Eliott Keener, playing as Det. Sterne); Rourke, Bonet and De Niro make a fabulous tríade. The general photography delivers a sense of dark eeriness and estrangement and the Sound Track (mostly Blues) works like ""a charm"".As a side note I would also like to mention the actor Pruitt Taylor Vince, who in this film acts as a sidekick for Det. Sterne; but the curious tidbit is that you also get to see him on ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990), another Thriller/Noir Master Piece of eeriness (though a very different movie), and as memorable as Angel Heart.",Angel Heart

171,Lorenzo H.,"Supernatural Film-Noir - disturbing, unsettling and flawed.",6,4 March 2000,"This motion picture will stay with you long after you've seen it.  It has a tendency to leave you feeling quite disturbed and unsettled. This can be attributed mainly to the films last 15 minutes, wherein the lead character Harry Angel, a private investigator (played by Mickey Rourke), learns the emotionally devastating truth behind the case he has been working on. Rourke is quite good throughout the entire movie, lending his character a certain sleazy-cool charm, but it is in the films last few moments that he shines best.  His harrowing display of pain in these scenes is so intense and believable that you truly feel his despair.  Robert De Niro who appears in only a few scenes (in a key role), also does good work. 
Now for the down side.  Director Alan Parker from the very beginning imbues his film with such a heavy atmosphere of impending doom that we hardly have a chance to breathe.  If he had perhaps lightened up a bit in those earlier scenes, the ending would have slowly crept up on us and been even more shocking and disturbing than it was.  Also he attempts to combine the horror and detective genres with only moderate success (especially in the later case).  What usually thrills us about classic film-noir detectives is their sarcastic wit and hip dialogue.  This verbal element is sorely lacking in ANGEL HEART, so the audience tends to latch onto the visual aspects of the investigation which are not enough to keep us totally riveted for the first two thirds of the film.  On occasion the director also loses his sense of subtlety and allows sex, blood and gore to steal the show (as in the bedroom scene with Rourke and Lisa Bonet).  The above complaints aside, ANGEL HEART is an unforgettable and haunting film which though not a totally pleasant experience, is still worth a look, especially if you like films dealing in psychological horror.Final Verdict:   6 out of 10.",Angel Heart

I saw it when I was 12 and maybe it was too much to ask of me then to understand all the messages and nuances but I just rewatched it and was very thrilled. Felt like I was watching a true noir with actual story, meet on its bones, atmosphere and music oozing out of the screen and an unbelievable performance but the entire cast.

173,muertos,Don't bother with this turkey. Read the book instead.,2,25 January 2005,"Angel Heart is a dreary mishmash of overblown egos, lofty expectations, misplaced symbolism, and garish excess. Its ""thrills"" aren't thrilling, its ""mystery"" isn't engaging, its characters are uniformly repulsive and it tries to score so high on the shock meter that it comes off as nothing but a common exploitation film. This is a highly disappointing result given the excellent novel from which it was adapted, and a major career fumble for talented moviemen Alan Parker and Robert DeNiro.This movie was infamous when it came out in 1987 for the long battle with the MPAA to avoid the dreaded ""X"" (now NC-17) rating, specifically for some steamy antics involving Lisa Bonet, then under the (thankfully) mistaken impression that her stint on the Cosby Show would springboard her to stardom. A movie this bad doesn't even deserve to be remembered for that controversy, because the scene involved (I won't spoil it for you) is a yawner. The plot is unusually choppy, and Mickey Rourke's limp portrayal of Harry Angel leaves the viewer totally unsympathetic and thus indifferent as to whether he solves the ""mystery"" or not. Killings and other bloody business masquerade as ""atmosphere,"" and except for looking grody or artificially spooky there's no real attempt to give this film a strong flavor. It's really hard not to burst out laughing at the final shot of the film, something you don't want to do after sitting through a ""scary"" movie.Missed opportunity for all concerned. Hopefully for you too, because if you're smart you won't waste your time on this rubbish, and read the book instead.",Angel Heart
174,t-paulsm,Almost 20 years later...,7,4 December 2005,"After almost 20 years since I caught this move in the theaters, I decided to rent the DVD, and remembered why I enjoyed the visual and atmospheric aspects of it.This was Rourke's next appearance after the blockbuster ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and before ""A Prayer for the Dying"" and ""Barfly"", which means it was made while he was just leveling off from the peak of his game as an actor. Rourke said so himself regarding ""Angel Heart"" that it was a movie he did in order to get the money to pay for the house he was about to lose, and was also around the time that he had realized that acting wasn't giving him what he needed anymore. I have to say, I'm glad he did this one rather than passing it up, as it contains some of the best of his more subtle acting.I must admit that when I saw this in the theater, I turned to my date and said ""Gee...Louis Cyphre, huh? A private dick, huh? Lookin' for someone who has gone missing with amnesia, huh? It's going to be him searching for himself - just watch."" Well, this truly did annoy my date, who brushed off my observation (which I thought was pretty evident to anyone with a brain) and I simply watched the film, treating what I'd already figured to be true as merely incidental to the film and enjoyed how the story was told.And told beautifully it was! Alan Parker and his production team of cinematographer Michael Seresin, production designer Brian Morris, & editor Gerry Hambling, create an incredibly atmospheric, rich and lush film worth seeing. For Parker's first venture into making a thriller movie, it was, for it's time, a completely original and welcomed approach to a much-abused genre.Watching the DVD today truly did please me for a few reasons. The main factor I appreciated about the DVD's special features were the segments devoted to the truths about voudon. The parts, titled ""Voodoo...The Truth - Voodoo in the Madia"" and ""New Orleans Voodoo Connection: History of Voodoo in New Orleans"" plus ""Dances of Worship: The Meaning of Dance and Music in Voodoo Worship"" and so on, showed a great responsibility on the part of the DVD's creators to dispel the much-negatively-portrayed religious belief/way of life of many people around the world, as well as telling the truth about how many lies this movie/the novel contained. Containing interviews and conversations with various practitioners, from Ava Kay Jones a Yoruba priestess, Brandi Kelly, the proprietor of ""Voodoo Authentica"", John T. Martin, manager of the Voodoo Museum in New Orleans, Ifa Priest Dr. Afolabi Epega, dancer and teacher Ausettua Amor Amenkum, and others, the ""special features"" is well worth watching, whether it be by an every day joe or joeanne, an initiate, or a practitioner of the faith.""Angel Heart"" was yet another film that was frowned upon by the practitioners of Ifa, Santaria, Candoble, Lukumi, and other Yoruba belief systems, as it was yet another film that hyped the false negativity of this benevolent belief system. When the film was made the term ""voodoo"" was always associated with darkness, whether referring to ""voodoo economics"" or via its portrayal in the media at large. The fact that Satan is even personified in this movie is ridiculous when you look at the fact that voudon in any of its forms has no actual heaven & hell system. To tie the Judeo-Christian laws and beliefs in with something that has had to work in, around, alongside, and with the very man-made ideals that have sought to oppress or destroy it is hilarious at its best - destructive at its worst! When I see this happen time and again, I often wonder how many would be outraged if, say, Judaism or Baptist beliefs were portrayed in the same dark and destructive manner?So, I must say, it pleased me, a practitioner of Ifa tradition, to see that finally someone took the time to fill the general population in on the realities behind the practices that have been all but crapped on by the media!~T.Paul www.t-paul.com",Angel Heart
175,padawandoug,"Great Cinematography, Great Story, Great Acting -- These make a Great Movie",10,27 February 2003,"I just thought I'd add a few words about this great movie.  First of all, it is great, and I hope you reading this will side with the large number of positive reviews and see this movie.  The few people who didn't like it must be pinheads (or short attention span types)!*** Spoiler Alert *** This movie is not new, so I don't feel shy about discussing some spoiler type info.  Louis Cyphre = Lucifer; this should be easy, and tipped me right at the beginning the first time I saw the movie.  But I still wasn't sure until the scene a little later where Mr. Cyphre says that in some cultures, the egg is the symbol of the soul.  He then proceeds to eat the egg (hard boiled), in a creepy shot.  He eats souls!  At this point I said to one of the guys I was seeing the movie with ""he's the devil!""To those who may be confused by the details of the soul-switching scenario, and why the devil took so long to come after Harry Angel/Johnny Favorite: the ceremony they performed back at the beginning of WWII was to give up Harry Angel's soul in substitution for Johnny Favorite's, thus cheating the devil.  Then Johnny was going to take on Harry Angel's life and escape the devil indefinitely.  But then Johnny was shipped off to war, got a head wound and amnesia, and ended up really thinking he was Harry Angel (okay, I'm a little unclear on this bit, but I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years).  So what it comes down to is, Harry Angel is really Johnny Favorite, even though he doesn't know it.  And since he is, and his soul belongs to the devil, Lucifer can command him to commit murders, even without his conscious knowledge!  This is how Johnny/Harry killed the blues musician, and the astrologer/former girlfriend, and the old addict doctor without even knowing it!  And you realize then that the Lisa Bonet character is really his own daughter!  One of the only movies I've seen where incest is part of a movie yet not the main point of it.This movie is just beautifully shot as well.  See it in widescreen if you can, Alan Parker always has great shots that deserve it.  I remember a shot of a spiral staircase at one point that was just beautiful.  And I will never again see a fan in a movie (an electric fan) without thinking of this movie.  That's another clue:  every time you see a shot of a fan, and the blades start moving, the devil is in the room!  It starts right at the beginning, when Angel first meets with Mr Cyphre.  It's winter time, but fans are going!  (On a side note: isn't it appropriate that the devil has a French name?  Given current political feelings, I mean; of course, I'm biased -- an Anglophile -- so I don't like those weasely Frogs to begin with.)There is so much to recommend this movie that it's hard to pick things: from the humorous touches (""Do you know what today is? It's Wednesday -- it's anything can happen day!""  I never was a Mouseketeer, but it's a great reference to the period.)  (Also funny:  ""I got a thing about chickens.""); to the great music -- that haunting song, which seems so real, like it was a real song from a crooner of the '40's, as well as the real blues featured in the movie; even the end credit sequence is great, with the elevator cutting back and forth with the credits -- an elevator going straight to hell!  The movie also shows a creepy movie version of New Orleans which could seem cliche to some, but is so well done, and fits so well with the period of the movie -- reminds me of another great one, ""Southern Comfort,"" where there's this whole community of Cajuns living in the bayou, just oblivious to the outside world.I also love movies that blow up the illusion that the past was better than the present.  Every culture tries to promulgate that, but it is just resistance to change.  The '50's was no happy time, people were just a lot more deluded than they are now.This is a great movie to watch, a great movie to listen to (I eventually bought the soundtrack), and one with a great story.  Alan Parker is one of the sort of underground geniuses of filmmaking.  He directed Pink Floyd's The Wall, too.  Another great movie of his is ""The Road to Wellville,"" not a mystery, but another period piece, this time about the 19th century (and how squalid it could be), and the exploits of Kellogg, the guy who founded the cereal company.  See that one too (it's a lot funnier than ""Angel Heart,"" and stars Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda, Anthony Hopkins and Dana Carvey in another overlooked movie.

None of us knew what to expect as we had been overseas on a school trip so knew nothing about it. What a pleasant surprise. Great period piece with attention to the details, wonderful cinematography and a fun little story with enough little twists to keep it interesting. The biggest twist is a bit obvious, but it is really a lot of fun getting there, with Mickey Rourke perfectly cast as the slightly shady and completely disheveled Harry Angel. Trevor Jones and jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine combine to form a wonderfully spooky soundtrack that I have listened to a hundred times.

Director Alan Parker brilliantly weaves an intense thriller using the horror and noir genres. Angel Heart, set in Brooklyn and New Orleans, is one of the most beautiful cinematic films I've ever seen. Parker really took advantage of the surrounding scenery.But what stands out the most in this film is the acting. Mickey Rourke, who plays Harry Angel, is phenomenal as usual and proves that he really is one of the greatest actors of his generation. DeNiro, who plays Louis Cyphre, though only in about 15 minutes of the film, delivers one of the creepiest performances I've ever seen. You can't not enjoy this film.",Angel Heart

The soul is the essence of this story. Notions of Biblical evil were out of fashion in the cinema for many years. This film bravely attempted to bring such old fashioned evil back to our attention via a stylish film noir. It succeeded artistically but failed commercially and critically. It can now be seen to have influenced so many more recent hits such as The Devil's Advocate, The Firm etc. Alan Parker paints his scenes with beautifully bled (no pun intended) colour. O'Rourke and De Niro are mesmerising as their characters take part in this game of deceit and treachery. It is particularly sad that O'Rourke's career faltered so badly in the 90s. De Niro could have been forgiven for being concerned that a new rival was about to challenge his supreme acting status. O'Rourke must look back on this film and think those immortal cinematic lines: I coulda been a contender. Especially appropriate given his other career in the ring. This film will never leave you. Perhaps only challenged by Bladerunner as film of the eighties.",Angel Heart

187,livinitup2589,Angel Heart: A brilliant example of atmospheric horror,8,14 October 2006,"The first time I saw Angel Heart, I didn't know for sure what it was. About two years ago I had been flipping through stations on TV and stopped on a movie with Mickey Rourke and a bearded Robert De Niro. Already I was hooked, but it wasn't just the presence of these two actors that had me watching, it was the look and feel of the film. Considering I had only caught the last ten minutes of the movie, I was completely engrossed. But it wasn't until earlier this year that I was finally able to sit through the entire movie.The story of Angel Heart is one of noir essence accompanied by overwhelming dread. It begins in 1950's New York, with Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), a low class gumshoe with quite a low prolific career. In his office, he gets a call from a potential client's lawyer, asking him to meet him in of all places, a Harlem church. The client in question is Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro), a mysterious figure who offers Harry a case: Find Johnny Favourite, a war veteran and jazz singer who went missing after returning from the war.. This seemingly simplistic case takes Angel from the roughness of New York to the steamy bayous of New Orleans. As he investigates Favourite's disappearance, he finds himself in the middle of something far more sinister than he ever suspected.As a through-back to the detective thrillers of the 40's and 50's, Angel Heart takes us to places that weren't often traveled in thrillers of the 80's. We're taken to the backwoods of Louisiana where locals practice Voodoo, jazz clubs where classic sounds are still new, and seedy motels that make alleys look like suites at the Ritz-Carlton. There aren't many clean places in the film and it rains in nearly every scene. Writer-director Alan Parker creates a world where only the noir exists and darkness is constant.But this is not a genre film in the conventional sense. Parker keeps most of the story within the nostalgic South and even adds Satanism to the mix. Eventually, the movie begins to completely turn away from its noir roots and becomes surrealistic horror.In what can be called a virtuoso performance, Mickey Rourke gives Angel a perfect glibness that makes his journey all the more surprising. Balancing pompousness with certain professional drive, Rourke perfectly captures a down and out gumshoe. Sharing his every scene with Rourke, De Niro shines in a purposely understated role. As Cyphre, De Niro is at his most stoic and creepy in only a few scenes.At the time of its release, the real interest of the movie came in the appearance of then Cosby Kid Lisa Bonet. As the gorgeous but mysterious Epiphany Proudfoot, she gives an against type performance that showed its power by getting her fired on the role that made her famous. The sex scene that most scarred her innocent persona is anything but sexy and is something you have to see for yourself.For me though, the ultimate standout of the film's legacy lies in the brilliant cinematography by Michael Seresin. In terms of capturing a film's visuals with its atmosphere, Seresin's photography is some of the best I've seen in the horror genre or any other. Along with Seresin, Parker uses another one of his regulars, Trevor Jones, to create the perfectly toned music for the film.Angel Heart is a prime example of a filmmaker creating a perfectly envisioned piece of work. Everything about the movie fits the genre to a perfect pitch and follows its dark visage to the very end. Criminally underrated at the time of its release, its finally found an audience ever since its release on DVD, and rightfully so. A horror film this brilliant shouldn't be missed by anyone remotely interested in horror or mystery films.",Angel Heart
188,pjb2354,Angel Heart .......................................................Huh!,1,26 July 2013,"Angel Heart is an awful movie and for one to compare this to Psycho is an insult to a master director in Alfred Hitchcock. Psycho was shot in black and white film noir with a story line that people could follow and understand, even before the doctor analyzed Norman Bates, since the movie title was called Psycho. I am a fan of Mickey Rourke in the days of Rumble Fish and Rumble Fish was dark but you could follow it through to the end. But in Angel Heart, its a movie literally drenched in characters, story lines, blood, chickens, gratuitous sex and killings to such a degree where the viewer can't follow and understand. One moment Angel is having sex with a Voodoo Priestess and the next moment she's his daughter? Huh! Angel is hired to investigate a man who later in the movie turns out to be himself? Huh! Amnesia is not a criteria for a P.I. When the movie ended, I said to myself, Huh! I walked out of the theater totally confused not knowing what the conclusion was. Norman Bates was the Psycho with a split personality dominated by his mother. Johnny Angel or whatever his name was since he had so many aliases, was an investigator, investigating a missing person who happens to be himself who murdered people but had no memory of it, had sex with a woman who was his daughter .............................?

Mickey Rourke plays old school detective Harry Angel like a character straight out of a Tom Waits song. De Niro is masterfully understated and steals every scene as the shadowy client that hires Angel. The soundtrack is creepily fitting and the action finds the perfect mix between straight out detective story and all out horror building to an unforgettable climax.

Harry is the ultimate tragic character or is he? After reading the boards here and the references to the book, probably not. But, but...I have my own theory. Harry is so identifiable. Not perfect, but pretty decent. Should he be punished for Favorite's sins? Is he Favorite? What happened to Harry? Mickey Rourke in his prime-women wanted to be with him and men wanted to be him.

Technically, it's well done; good acting (Rourke, De Niro, Bonet), dark atmosphere, a convincing set.Its only fault is: It's boring and way more ambitious than what it delivers in the end.(Spoilers ahead)The age-old subject of a man selling his soul to the devil and then trying to cheat his way out of the deal may still be appealing but it only works if the cheater is at least a bit likable. Harry Angel (the obvious pun is annoying either) isn't. He's a brute, a bully, a loser. Someone you don't care about at all. Who cares if he looses his soul?To make this waste of celluloid a bit more interesting, they thrust in some voodoo, some half-incestuous sex and lots of blood.

Mickey Rourke's nude body blasting into Lenny Kravits' X-sperm bank is horrific.

Likewise the whole ensemble filled and became their roles making a truly palm sweating, spine tingling, 113 minutes. Quite possibly the best 113 minutes of a lazy weekend spent on the sofa with cheese crackers and a bottle of crisp chardonnay as one sits mesmerised like a well fed and slightly tipsy bunny caught in the headlights of approaching traffic, doomed to oblivion but caring not.Like good cooking one can't fail if one has good ingredients.

It do scares you, with its plot, atmosphere, some cut out body parts and blood.The story is all about how a guy, a private detective, gets this case of finding out about a guy Johny Favorite, that whether he is alive or dead. In course, he finds out a lot, and the people to whom he investigates get killed, brutally, by cutting their organs. In the end, he finds out about Johnny, and the secret.Film has a lot of blood and violence; and a sex scene, which is not porn, but is far far away from normal sex scenes, and has nudity (not front) and blood.Watch this movie in relaxed mood and with a strong heart.",Angel Heart

I won't ruin it for those who have not seen it yet, suffice to say you just KNEW De Niro was a nasty piece of work, but you can't put your finger on it. Or rather I couldn't.

I very seriously doubt we will ever get a chance to see Mickey in a starring role again, so if you haven't seen his role as Harry Angel, you are missing out one of the best actors of the 20th century right when he chose all the right roles.There was no generic in any role Rourke played in the 80's, and this movie is certainly not generic also. You approach the search for Favourite with Harry. You are torn by the search with Harry.

I love this movie because Mick was so beautiful. But on top of that, the movie was excellent. Rourke made alot of actors look sorry by comparison. He showed unbelievable depth in his acting. You get the impression he is actually experiencing it. You may have to see the movie at least three times in order to get the twisting plot. But it will probably be so interesting to you, you probably won't mind! Mick really was the prince of fine actors. Bonet was most lovely and showed herself an incredible talent.

200,heaven_beside_you,Relatively unknown masterpiece,10,28 November 2006,"I unsuspectingly decided to watch AngelHeart one day, propelled by the grim apocalyptic landscapes in The Wall and the intense Midnight Express. I must say, i was unprepared for the complete kick in the ass this movie was. First of all, the script is very sound, combining tight noir mystery and bizarre paranormal carnage in one seamless, endlessly bleak atmosphere that unfolds beautifully and economically. It's one of those movies were clever hints at the final plot twist exist throughout the duration of the film, but it's only at the end that all the pieces fall into place. Some people have told me they saw the end coming, which i will not reveal here, but i think most people will be too engrossed in the gorgeously filthy, decaying set pieces and grizzly violence to pick up on all the hints, and even then the movie still delivers on the grounds of execution alone. Rourke gives his all-time best performance (with his role as Marv in Sin City following at a close second), and imo perfectly depicts a man falling completely apart emotionally as he progresses further into madness. Parker is masterful here, maintaining a constant aura of doom and mystery, juxtaposing the quiet main piano theme brilliantly against Rourke's failing sanity. Every scene is charged with despair and melancholy, and i consider this one of the most depressing films i have ever seen. Though many people may see this as a good reason not to view the film, i still consider it a remarkable artistic achievement. De Niro also turns in a small but creepy performance... Overall, i would highly suggest this film to anyone interested in nightmares",Angel Heart

202,bostonmania2002,exquisite... watch it more than once...,8,25 May 2007,"No quesch, Angel Heart is a kind of movie not for everyone. Ideally suited for mature and attentive viewers with a particular zest in movies seeped in a bizarre Dali-type surrealism full of mystery, supernaturality, violence, bloodshed and sex. I drags us into an hypnotic world of voodoo, mambo-jambo, black magic, and the Lucifer.But, this is not a classic-type horror flick per se. Instead, unique and stylish OCCULT-THRILLER like Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Ninth Gate"" based on intrigue, confusion and contradiction. In terms of its twisty plot and surprise ending, it is the predecessor to ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Others"", ""The Skeleton Key"", ""Secret Window"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"". If you enjoyed these movies, ""Angel Heart"" would be a favorite piece in your DVD collection.Set in 1955, it is an excellent period work, as are the settings and cinematography, especially shots of dark, seedy, and steamy backdrops in Louisiana. The scenery is murky, the ambiance is eerie, flashbacks and images are distorted, all playing tricks on your mind. Surrealistic scenes are all shot beautifully and subtly: grotesque elevators, lurid ventilators, decaying buildings, sleazy rooms, echoes of closing doors, pieces of shattered memories, suffocating Louisiana swamps, blood dripping and running all over the room. Sometimes it's difficult to follow the plot precisely, and every detail needs to pay attention to get the clues and put the pieces together. It is likely that you would miss some details and second viewing would be helpful.From beginning to end, a scuzzy and confused private-eye Mickey Rourke's performance is top notch, you can't help but feel pity and sadness for him. Harry Angel is his magnum opus. Robert De Niro portrays more gruesome & deadly Satan in human form than Al Pacino's comedic & commercial Lucifer in ""Devil's Advocate"".Exquisite work from Alan Parker.

I hadn't seen it in years, and stumbled across it one afternoon.I was stunned as I was completely drawn into the world of Detective Harry Angel, and sat mesmerized for the next two hours, until the film's stunning conclusion left me breathless, even though I knew what was coming.This is not a simple movie, but the simple plot line is that a hard nosed private eye gets in too deep when hired by a mysterious client to find a missing person. What follows is a complex, twisted tale of morality, secrets, and the fact that you can never outrun your past, no matter how hard you try. For those of you who only know Mickey Rourke as the hulking ruin you saw in Sin City, you really need to see this film. Rourke was at his prime here, and gives a performance that is both believable and shattering. It is a portrait of a man who knows he is losing his hold on everything that he knows to be true, but is unable to stop going down the road that he senses will lead him to oblivion.The first time I saw this movie, I was a teenager, and thought the movie was too slowly paced. Now, with a more mature set of eyes, I think the pacing is perfect. Languidly allowing the viewer to be steeped in the humid, foreign atmosphere of a sultry Louisiana.The cinematography is fantastic, with every detail authentic, down to the fact that people didn't wear antiperspirant back then :-)I absolutely believed in the world that Harry found himself being trapped by, and the horror kept growing as every new detail was slowly brought to light.This is a film that demands to be seen at least twice.

I think the drabness (characters, wardrobe, rooms, settings) that give you an almost depression-era feel (actually set in 1955) is one of the brilliant aspects of this film; and I think it's why some folks despise the film.Personally, I love slow moving films like this with artsy cinematography and attention to detail.

The premise is so fascinating. Think about it: Do you know who you really are? What if you made a pact with the devil for stardom but can't remember any of it? In our celebrity crazed America, can you think about anyone who would do that? The symbols alone are worth watching. The fan, the broken mirror, all the voodoo stuff. I was a child during the time period of the 50s when this movie takes place. It is very nostalgic for me to remember seeing some of those props such as the converted street car turned Diner that I remember as a kid. Where they found all these props is beyond me. Now I have to tell you that the novel, ""Falling Angel,"" has some pretty explicit scenes of group sex in front of the devil who witnesses his followers offering a baby sacrifice to him that's left out of the movie. It's interesting if you watch Rourke's comments in the new expanded DVD version, he says he was in a very negative period in his life and doesn't recall much about working in the movie. He simply needed the money and took what roles he could get. If you buy this copy, by all means do yourself a favor and listen to Mr. Rourke's commentary.",Angel Heart
209,Barbaric_Martyr,"Quite Possibly The Most Brilliant Thriller You're Ever Likely To See,,",10,8 July 2005,"I think the summary... sums it up! This is a rich classy thriller/horror and even funny in some parts (once you've watched it, you'll understand what i mean!).With terrific performances from the always-excellent Mickey Rourke (whom i happen to love... *Winks*) and from Robert De Niro (not to mention the rest of the cast) it's hard not to love this brilliant movie, i guess it's one of those blockbusters, you either love this, or hate it.I wont go too much into the story, but i must say there are plenty of satisfying deaths (though, don't expect anything too gory.. this was made in 1987 after all...), although i'm 14 (and own it on directors edition), i wouldn't suggest young children watch it, because of the overall contents of nudity and a very strong sex scene.I highly suggest anyone with taste for a great movie, which not only twists and turns but will keep you thinking about it, not to mention talking about it, i recommend this movie. And i completely recommend the Directors Cut edition, which i got for a mere £6 in HMV (it's worth so much more), so look around and i'm sure you'll find it at a cheap price, even try AMAZON.COM/CO.UK.

Sublime portrayals of sinister brooding evil, edgy sleazy guilt, and powerful yet vulnerable beauty, respectively.The plot, and the tension, build relentlessly to the cataclysmic ending with (for my money) the greatest piece of cinematic imagery I have ever seen. In keeping with the film it is understated, and IMO devastatingly chilling.If other reviewers haven't mentioned it then I would like to encourage fans of this film to read William Hjortsberg's Fallen Angel on which the film was based.Its a great book and despite the fact that, having watched the film, you know the ending it still slams into you like a steam train.Great book, great film.",Angel Heart

No, just nothing, no depth, no character, just a bum walking around. And that is the last thing such a story should do.The directing - every time there is action I asked myself ""why are they running around ?"" You just don't buy it, like the whole story in total.

This is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book, Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg. The plot has all the elements of a Chandler story mixed in with devil worship, voodoo and the stifling atmosphere of the Deep South. Mickey Rourke's performance as gumshoe Harry Angel is the best of his career, without doubt worthy of some kind of industry recognition. Robert De Niro's Louis Cyphre is played with the kind of calm, self congratulating detachment that comes of knowing the inevitability of Angel's demise. Angel's brief is to find out the location of crooner Johnny Favorite, whose wartime injuries left him a virtual vegetable in need of constant supervision. Cyphre, having a 'contract' with the vanished singer, employs Angel to ascertain his whereabouts. As Angel brings his dishevelled form of inquiry to the case, things start to happen, bad things. All the key people who Angel talks to end up getting bumped off in particularly nasty fashion. Its as if the singer is stalking his links to the past and getting rid of them one by one. Circumstantially, Harry is becoming the prime suspect and can feel the noose tightening around his neck. The ending is a finale of epic proportions, a terrifying realisation that rocks the viewer and ties up the twisting plot. The acting, direction, camerawork, story , settings and dark soundtrack make this film an absolute classic.

""Angel Heart"" is definitely one of the most hypnotically  movies I ´ve ever seen. First there is the brilliant acting of Mickey Rourke, Robert ""Louis Cyphre"" De Niro and Lisa Bonet. The acting of the two male actors reminds me of a boxing fight. De Niro the master of method acting, always in deep concentration and the young Mickey Rourke who, apart from ""Barfly"" plays the role of his life, went at it hammer and tongs. Secondly Alan Parker the British director of masterpieces like ""Birdy"", ""The Commitments"" and ""The Wall"" together with Michael Seresin the director of photography,  created an unforgettable atmosphere of William Hjoertsbergs novel ""Falling Angel"".  A dazzling mixture of a film noir of the 50´s and Goethe´s Faust. First Alan Parker wanted to shot the movie in b/w, but we all know that it is much harder to find proper financiers for a b/w film in USA than in Europe. Thirdly Trevor Jones one of the best score composers produced a real masterpiece of a soundtrack. (Courtney Pine ´s sax is great) I know that there is no best movie in the world but there are a few who can claim that they are nearly perfect. Angel Heart definitely is one of them.",Angel Heart

This was a pretty seamless effort on the face of it for me. The storyline does not require the mentation of a chess-master to follow. I find that distracting.

There are certain conflicts in th movie, deliberate I'm sure, first one to clear up is how Johnny managed to kill the young boy,and eat his heart on New Years Eve.Doctor Fowler admitted to Harry that he was a virtual zombie when he arrived but soon recovered.A man called Edward Kelley and an unknown young woman took him away.They went to Times Square and stole Harry's heart,and all moved south, so why was Harry still in Brooklyn?

Mr. Cypher is trying to track down a lost contract, and hires private detective Harold Angel (Rourke).The film is brilliantly shot, darkness and light contrasted to excellent effect.  Fans, stairs and lifts keep appearing for no apparent reason, 'pinging' our senses for attention - symbols of a yet  darker and nastier turn ahead in the plot. Stifling heat add to the overall discomfort of the backdrop as Angel is thrown into a web of brutal murders and sinister connections. The casting is excellent, everyone is in the right place.  The cinematography is wonderful and the overall attention to detail is superb. Both Mickey Rourke and DeNiro are on top form, trying to 'out-do' each other.Lisa Bonet is every bit as effective in her lesser role.  Having grown up with her as the sweet, innocent, young actress from the Cosby Show I was more than a little surprised.Rourke carries the film along cleverly and sincerely against a backdrop of dysfunctional characters and locations. As we watch Angel's life go to pieces he is thrown from one situation to another in the quest for the lost contract.This is a superb combination of detective/horror story.

Rourke truly was Harry Angel in this movie, and because of this has never been the same since. My view is that Johnny Favorite only committed the first murder when he became the soul of Harry Angel. The murders of Fowler, Sweet, Krusemark, Kelly, and Epiphany were committed by Cyphere (Satan) to play with Angel's mind and get him to in effect to admit to all of the murders after Epiphany's killing. Cyphere, in the end, won by having Angel admit to all of the aforementioned murders and relinquishing his earthly life to the ""chair"" for having broken the contract with Cyphere. Note in one of the last scenes how Cyphere picks up Angel's gun and dog tags in Krusemark's apartment before killing Epiphany and framing Angel.

Rourke is a great actor. The rest of the cast including De Niro were excellent but, unlike Parker and Rourke, they were replaceable.The horror of this movie is not revealed until the climax, which makes it different to the standard fare and puts it well into the A category.The plot of a sleazy private detective being hired by a creepy and somewhat malevolent client to track down a debtor who has disappeared is soon revealed to be a mere vehicle designed to unveil the real story.

Also, can I ask did anyone else who had never seen or heard about the film before work out that De Niro was the Devil from his name Louis Cyphre?

Since i saw it about 10 times, and then i haven't watch it for about 5 years up to today. It's just incredible : the movie looks absolutely not almost 20 years old !!! And this darkness ! I can't remember i saw a so dark movie. The painting of hell with the death in black dress, the lift and these ventilators just get me sick. I had also forgotten a main point in the end of the story : the love story with Lisa Bonet reminded me the recent Old Boy. I thought any American movie could suggest this taboo subject, no i just have to revise my judgement. PS : Rourke is a very great actor : look at him : during all the movie, when you know the plot, you can notice that he ""knows"" something that he cannot remember. He as just the perfect attitude in this very difficult role. Well, i would like to add that it is more a symbolic film that Devil's advocate, and really worth to be recommended for Alan Parker's work. Also for Trevor Jones'.",Angel Heart
