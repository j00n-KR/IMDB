0,MartinHafer,It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...,7,22 August 2014,"""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a remake of a Japanese film, ""Hachi-Ko"" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since ""Hachi-Ko"" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America. Back in the 1920s and 30s, the real Hachi was a dog owned by a Japanese professor. One thing that set him apart from most dogs was that Hachi would meet the professor at the train station after work each day! But, even more unusual is that after the professor's death, Hachi CONTINUED this routine--waiting patiently for his master every day! In many ways, the story is like that of the very famous Scottish dog, Greyfriars Bobby--who is memorialized in Edinburgh outside the pub and church where the do would do its daily ritual (lying at his master's grave and then visiting the pub). In fact, I did some reading and found several other similar accounts throughout the world. This leads me to wonder WHY the film did a semi-remake. Why not just make a fictionalized story? Why keep a few details and change others--especially when this Japanese dog inexplicably shows up in Rhode Island!So does this lack of attention to detail mean I hate the film? Even as a retired history teacher, I cannot, as I must confess that I've owned dogs for years and currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me (in addition to my two cats who alternate between adoration and ambivalence). I am a sucker for a film about a cute dog--and the Hachi in the movie is one of the cutest Akita's ever (much cuter, by the way, than the original Hachi). You cannot help but like the dog and enjoy seeing him interact with his owner (Richard Gere). But, there needs to be more than a cute dog to make a really good film--and currently this fame has an astonishingly high score of 8.2! Is this number, at least in part, less about the quality of the production and more a vote to signify that most everyone loves cute dogs? Well, yes. Objectively speaking, the film is a remake--and that's one strike against it at the onset. And, I just cannot imagine a pleasant doggy film making it to the IMDb's Top 250 List--but it did and it's currently #190--giving it a slightly higher rating than films like ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (one of the greatest films of the 1940s), ""Rocky"" (the first one was very nice), ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""The Celebration""--as well as the original Japanese film!! Overall, it's a nice doggy film that is VERY family-friendly at that and with a lovely and evocative piano soundtrack. By all means watch it-- but don't be surprised if you like it but don't love it.A few final notes: First, I noticed that AFTER the master died in this American adaptation, it ALWAYS seemed to be snowing in this town--for years and years after the death! Second, what's with the professor's wife?! Her husband dies and she finds Hachi at the end years later at the train station and is surprised to see him?! Where was she at the time...off-world or taking a very long nap?! Didn't someone bother to tell her about HER dog or didn't she ask about how old Hachi was doing?! This seems to be a missing plot thread. Third, if you are curious, Hachi's actual remains were stuffed after his death and he is on display at National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. And, there is a statue to him as well as annual celebrations in this country. How these people view an American film company 'appropriating' their story is something I would love to know.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
1,SnoopyStyle,A real tear jerker from a simple premise,7,24 February 2014,"Based on a real dog, Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) is a music professor. One night, he finds a stray puppy at the train station. Despite his wife (Joan Allen)'s objections, they take him in and name him Hachi. The dog loyally waits for Parker every day at the train station even when Parker passes away and the family has to move away. He becomes a staple at the station.It's the thinnest of premise. Based on a Japanese film based on a real dog in Japan, it takes that premise to its simple tear jerker conclusion. Dog lovers will love this movie. The story is very simple done with a very light touch. Nevertheless the movie is very effective.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
2,boblipton,Loyalty,10,11 March 2020,"I would love to hate Richard Gere. He's too good-looking, and knows it. The problem is that I always enjoy his performances. His star-making turn was in AMERICAN GIGOLO, where the montage in which he makes himself beautiful using name brands began the 1980s.Yet, he takes his craft seriously, flew to Japan to work with Kurosawa, and has excelled in a wide variety of roles. So when I realized that he was working with Lasse Hallstrom in this one, I steeled myself to watch it. I love most of Hallstrom's films, but every once in a while, his weird losers just repel me. He's the Babe Ruth of the movies: the Home Run King, who is struck out more often than anyone else.Well, they don't strike out in this one. I smiled and leaked tears when the film maker thought I should. The three dogs who play Hachi at various ages are handsome creatures With Joan Allen and Jason Alexander.This movie is based on the story of Hachiko, a dog owned by a Japanese professor, who waited for him every day when his train brought him home from the university. Even after the professor had collapsed and died, the dog waited every day until his own death nine years later. Hachiko became a symbol of loyalty and inspired the revival of his breed, the Akita -- there were only thirty of them left. I don't know how many there are now, but more.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
3,mark.waltz,Richard Gere with a dog...Richard Gere with a grandson...Richard Gere in a G-Rated Movie!,10,18 March 2013,"The last part of that intro is perhaps the most surprising thing about this lovely family drama that will have you going through a box of Kleenex and reaching for toilet paper 'cause you ran out of Kleenex! An adorable young boy gets up in front of his classroom and starts to talk about his hero. The kids all laugh when he mentions that it is his grandfather's dog. But from the moment you see this cute little puppy being boxed up and sent overseas to the United States and found by Richard Gere when he breaks his way out of the box, you are hooked. This is no ordinary little puppy. He ain't ""Marley"", ""Lassie"", ""Hooch"", or ""Beethoven"". He doesn't easily learn how to fetch and he destroys one of Gere's wife's (Joan Allen) art pieces as well. But he doesn't slobber, pee, poop or chase the cat. He's a well behaved gentleman, the most adorable movie dog since the pug in ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"".Gere, who plays a choreographer for a ballet company (and straight to boot!), has to travel into New York every day for work, and Hachi can't bear to be without his master. So he heads to the train station to bid him goodbye and comes back every evening like clock work. Yes, that is really the plot of this movie. No kidnapping, no nasty neighbor reporting him to the pound or any cruelty whatsoever. Just the story of a beautiful friendship that even destiny can't take away.Some people may say this a total manipulation of the emotions and they may be right. But for a movie to come out in the extremely cynical 21st century and be so sweet and express values that never disappear (especially the importance of loyalty) is a rarity today that can't be dismissed.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
4,kosmasp,Buttons,9,11 June 2010,"A movie about a dog and his relationship with his owner(s). Didn't we have something similar with Marley? Not quite! Where Marley struggled to keep up and keep you invested to the characters and/or the dog(s), this one hits all the right buttons. From beginning to end it grabs you and takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. You must be of stone, if this story leaves you completely cold (or you just don't care about animals or didn't like the movie) ...And although quite a few people seem to get the story wrong (saying something about the dog, that's not true that is), even if you knew where this was going, it still is very emotional. It's about friendship and loyalty. It's about respect and decency. And all this portrayed mostly without words.It is very nicely shot and the music score is good too. Based on something that really happened, this is a story that you should watch. And you don't have to be ashamed if a tear or two roll down your cheek ...",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
5,classicsoncall,"""You want to wait for him, don't you?""",8,29 November 2017,"Oh my, hold everything. You want to be prepared to watch this movie with plenty of Kleenex on hand. It really does resonate for viewers who have a special bond with their pets, but I think it probably moves a few hearts of those who don't share hearth and home with a favorite canine. It's a bit ironic actually, to think about the picture's impact on a person, when a dog's reaction to it's missing owner invites more sympathy than one feels for the owner himself, who died of a heart attack.Well, not to get too morbid, this was a sensitively told tale that one finds astonishingly hard to believe when it's revealed that Hachi celebrated his master for ten years after the man's death by showing up daily at a train station at the end of the work day to greet him. Based on an actual event that occurred in Japan in the 1920's, the film has been Westernized for an American audience with Richard Gere in the lead role as a university professor who adopts a wayward Akita puppy found wandering around a train station. But the real star is the pup who matures into the adult Hachi and takes full possession of the viewer's emotions on the way to a heart tugging finish. It's a family friendly film that you're not likely to forget for a long time once you've seen it.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
6,gavin6942,A Highly-Rated Richard Gere Movie,7,17 November 2014,"A drama based on the true story of a college professor (Richard Gere)'s bond with the abandoned dog he takes into his home.Exactly how this film got into the IMDb Top 250 is something of a mystery. My guess is that there are a lot of dog lovers out there. Not that it is a bad film, but it starts off very much like an ABC Family film, and the production value never really increases.Luckily, the plot tends to improve as it goes along, and it is clearly an emotional film. Those who are more prone to crying during movies may do a bit of crying here, because it is a great encapsulation of how loyal a dog can be to his master. As summed up by Kim Newman, ""Not a dry eye in the house - but not irritating schmaltz either.""",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
7,jboothmillard,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,6,18 May 2017,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, I remember the leading actor and the dog, I didn't remember it was a fact-based film, so I was looking forward to trying it, directed by Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Cider House Rules, Dear John). Basically schoolboy Ronnie (Kevin DeCoste) has to give an oral presentation about a personal hero, his subject is his grandfather's dog, Hachikō, his classmates laugh at first when he begins, but he continues and tells the story. The story flashbacks to several years earlier, in Bedridge, in suburban New York City, Ronnie's grandfather was college music/performing arts Professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), he catches the train to and from work every day. One day, an Akita puppy sent from Japan has escaped its cage and is lost at the train station, on a routine day Parker finds the puppy, he takes him home intending to return it to the station and find its owner the following day. Parker learns the next day that the puppy was being shipped to an unknown location, the shipping tag was lost, but he is wearing a collar with a symbol, his Japanese professor friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) translates the symbol as saying Hachikō, which means good fortune. They do not find the owner, and Parker's wife Cate (Joan Allen) does not think they should keep the puppy, now given the name Hachi, but they do keep him, and a year later the dog and Parker have become very close. Hachi refuses to do dog-like activities, like catch and fetch, one day Hachi follows Parker to the train station for work, he refuses to leave until Parker walks him home, so the dog waits patiently for Parker to return, Parker is surprised to see him there, but this becomes a daily routine. One day, Hachi waits patiently for Parker as the train arrives, he is unaware that Parker has died of a cerebral haemorrhage during a lecture in class, Hachi continues to wait in the snow for hours, until Parker's son-in-law Michael (Robbie Collier Sublett) comes to get him. Although everyone tries to tell Hachi that Parker has died, Hachi doesn't understand, so he returns to the train station, there he waits every day, hoping for the return of Parker. As time passes, Cate sells the house and Hachi is taken to live with her daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer), Michael and their baby Ronnie, however Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station, to sit in his usual spot. Andy takes Hachi back home, but sees how depressed the dog is, she lets him out to return to the station, there he waits every day, and sleeps in the rail yard every night, he is fed daily by the train station workers that knew Parker. Hachi becomes notable for waiting outside the station everyday, a journalist makes a newspaper article, Ken visits Hachi after reading the newspaper. Cate returns to town to visit Parker's grave on the tenth anniversary of his death, she meets Ken, she is stunned to find a now elderly Hachi still waiting outside the train station, overcome with grief she sits by Hachi's side, she returns home and tells now ten-year-old Ronnie all about Hachi. Meanwhile Hachi the dog continues to wait at the station, through all seasons, until his body can wait no longer, he is last seen lying in the snow, alone and still, his last vision is of Parker finally appearing and picking him up, leading him into the afterlife. Ronnie concludes on why Hachi is his hero, his class is moved by the story, with many who laughed at first holding back tears, after school he is met by his father and his own puppy, also named Hachi, Ronnie and Hachi walk down the same route where Parker and Hachi spent much of their time together. Also starring Seinfeld's Jason Alexander as Carl, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Jasjeet, Davenia McFadden as Mary Anne and Tora Hallström (Lasse's daughter) as Heather. Gere is perhaps unusual casting, but is actually perfect with his time on screen as the dog's owner, Allen does well also, the other supporting stars are fine being nice people as well, but you cannot deny it is the adorable Akita dog that is the star of the show, the real dog had a statue that stands outside a train station. When you know that the story is true, about a loving relationship between a man and his dog, and then the dog showing great dedication for his owner, even after death, it makes this story so sweet, it is not too sentimental or slushy, it is tragic, but it is a wonderfully touching and heartwarming family drama based on a true story. Good!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
8,ccthemovieman-1,Loyalty: A Trait To Be Admired,10,18 March 2010,"I don't think you find a better example of a dog's devotion to his master than this one, a based-on-a-true-life tale of a dog who was into a routine of meeting his beloved male owner every day at 5 p.m. at the train station.I saw this movie a week ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. If the words ""love"" and ""loyalty"" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, ""I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no."" The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you: go rent the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

10,moonspinner55,Family film is a bit underfed...still a worthy heart-tugger for animal lovers,6,27 December 2012,"An Akita Inu puppy, transplanted from a Japanese monastery to a picturesque town in Rhode Island, becomes lost at the train station but is soon adopted into the home of a music professor and his wife. Low-keyed American remake of a 1987 Japanese film, ""The Tale of Hachiko"", itself based upon a true story, has sweet and lovely passages, though overall content is lacking. Family-friendly movies about the bond between humans and animals nearly always work if the casting is right; here, the canine who portrays the older Hachi is a gorgeous, expressive creature--so how could the filmmakers miss? Co-produced by its star, Richard Gere, and directed by Lasse Hallström, the film touches on universal emotions when it comes to our beloved pets, but the human interaction (disconcertingly subdued throughout) is under-nourished. Playing Gere's wife, Joan Allen is unable to find a character in the writing; and when the dog is moved around in the film's latter stages, Allen's actions (and her subsequent disappearance) are puzzling. Gere doesn't really have a character to portray either, but he's appealing and unhurried in his scenes with the dog, projecting a warmly lackadaisical presence. Hallström, minus his barbed sense of human dynamics, must have helmed this project as a lark. He indeed guides the narrative with an assured, steady hand, but ""Hachi"" is far too subdued overall to make a big impact. **1/2 from ****",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
11,Quinoa1984,"kind of an impossible film to truly hate, though I don't quite love it",8,3 March 2016,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale may be 'syrupy' to some, that word that is a euphemism for 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'feel-good'. It's all that, but I think that what sets apart this film from what this could have been (maybe Marley & Me comes to mind) is that it sticks to being as simple as possible - it's a no-frills kind of light-hearted drama, if that makes sense. As soon as Richard Gere sees this dog at the station - basically as cute a puppy as one will see in a movie that's meant to be taken seriously - that's how the movie will go. It doesn't pump up much artificial drama at all, and the only real conflict is a major one that comes about halfway or maybe 2/3rd a way into the movie, and it's one that is meant to bring on the water-works for the rest of the audience in the remaining run-time.Who is Hachi (or Hachiko as his full name was in the original film and in real life, which this is based on an actual story in Japan)? A dog that is what is sort of written in the unofficial guide-book for good dogs: faithful, loyal and true. It also helps that Hachi is a happy dog, for the most part (maybe a few times he barks, but never really much at all except to be like 'hey!' to a human). It also plays on the universal truth for dogs that when their master goes away it's like the human is going away forever, and when he or she comes back it's like its the first time all over again that they're connecting. Dogs are great in that way, that their love and compassion is basically undying; in other words, the point of the movie is to show a kind of lesson for human beings as well - be more like Hachi, if you can.I think it also helps that Richard Gere and Joan Allen and (yes) Jason Alexander are very good in their parts, and keep things at the (in a good, clear way) simple level that director Lasse Hallstrom is keeping it at. While the score is the one part that could arguably be the sentimental part of the picture, with its soft and fluffy and sad piano and strings, it's perhaps necessary at times too for the story to work. If this were too quiet it might not have the proper resonance; it's one of those times with a heart-felt drama that I'm glad there's a score like this, even if it goes too far in certain moments. What works though is that the actors above, and even actors in smaller roles (the hot-dog vendor, the bookstore worker) have presence and have a good rapore with the dog.Is it a kid's movie? Sure. But it doesn't come with the Hollywood BS that so many movies get; the most wacky 'comedy' part is that Gere and his lovable dog get skunked at one point. Because it keeps it so... basic (is there another word for simple I can use), it can resonate with people since its not trying to pull a fast one or pull SO hard on the manipulation that its Hallmark channel. It's not quite great since there isn't necessary too much in the way of human character past Gere and Allen (there's also their kid and her family, but that's kind of weak), but it is all about the dog, as the title says. And hey, it's not Old Yeller.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

We are taught that prolonged grieving is not good. That doesn't mean that we stop thinking, loving or caring about the departed person; it just can't be forever. Remember, we are told that life must go on.I've never seen Joan Allen go from being an anti-dog person to one who came to realize what Hachi meant to Richard Gere.Gere's sudden death in the film at such a young age is shocking to say the least.

A college professor takes home an abandoned dog. Over time the bond between them grows incredibly strong and the dog becomes extremely loyal to his owner. Then one day, tragedy strikes...Well directed, and often shot from Hachi's perspective.

Its a beautiful movie from beginning to end, and Halstrom has made such a sad story, into one of unconditional love, a dog giving up a family home in order to wait for his master.It's based on a true story of 1923, and its a remake, but its classy and the additions of Gere and Allen make this movie all the more worthwhile.In anybody else's hand, it could have easily been a TV movie cropping up on some mundane station that nobody would see, so its lovely to see that this story shall be seen by more.A great film to watch with the whole family, and when you are feeling down.Beautiful.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
16,gradyharp,"Love, Loyalty, Commitment, Devotion",10,14 March 2010,"There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental rather than intentional, etc), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers. Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both Kaneto Shindô and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallström. The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale). The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen). But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs. And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal. It is a little film to treasure. Grady Harp",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hachiko: A Dog's Story,6,24 January 2010,"I came to know of the Hachiko story from one of the film screenings during the Japanese Film Festival more than two years ago, and having visited Tokyo, who would not have heard and noticed that one of the exits of the busy Shibuya station had one exit named after the famous dog? Why an American version of the story would be made baffles me, if not only to tell of yet another dog story following the likes of the Lassies and the Marleys that because dog is Man's best friend there will always be a ready market for it?Directed by Swede Lasse Hallstrom, at least there's the sensibility to still ensure that Hachiko remains Japanese, only for it to be accidentally transported from a Japanese monastery, and thanks to a botch up in cargo handling, Hachiko the puppy's destination ended up to be an American town with the Bedridge train station, where his first night wandering around the station's platform brought him to encounter Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Taking pity on the puppy whom he thought was abandoned, Parker brought it home to the opposition of his wife (Joan Allen), but who can deny a homeless dog especially one that looks as cute as a button?The gist of the story you would already know from the trailer which decided to tell all. The film curiously didn't spend too much time with Hachiko as a puppy, and decided to fast forward to when it became an adult dog, starting to walk with Parker to the station, and at 5pm every work day, promptly made its way back to the station to wait for its master, and then walking back. The Japanese version did this very well with people interaction along the way, which this version decided to erroneously gloss over. It's not about just the Professor and his dog, but the community around in which the dog's loyalty, faithfulness and street- smartness touched. Sure there was some attempts at that in this version, but there was too little and probably wanted to approach the story in a different direction.Unfortunately it got a little carried away, and after the pivotal turning point, it somehow went downhill with the narrative being dragged out because here's exactly when the relationship between community and the dog would have taken over to move this to another emotional plane, and didn't because the foundations were not established, granted though there were enough moments and scenes to tug at your heartstrings.One cannot deny that the Akita breeds are cute, and many would have missed the disclaimer toward the end of the credits that the dogs are for experienced dog owners, so don't you be heading toward the pet store to get one puppy on a whim, as the worst thing that shouldn't happen, is an abandonment because fancy has worn off, and would have been very contradictory to the message preached in the film.Between the American update and the original Japanese film, no prizes for guessing that I much prefer the latter for the simple reason that it had more genuine emotions with a better focus on Hachiko, and the locale which the American ""Hallmark"" version just tries so hard to replicate. Good news is the Japanese film made in 1987 is now re-released locally on DVD and is available in the shops now, and hopefully, the homage paid to the original story and the dog at the end of the film would pique interest in more picking up that version to watch.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
18,siderite,It will probably make you cry about a dog,8,20 June 2010,"What goes on inside the head of dogs when they are waiting for their master? Why do they do it, time after time, why do they show so much joy every time their life companion shows up? Don't they get tired of us? I know we do, so why don't they?This is a film about a dog so loyal that he waits every day his master's return, even if the man died ten years ago. The story is a true story, only it happened in Japan in the 20's. The movie was really well done, with as much an emphasis on the dog as possible. People except his master were just secondary characters, a thing that further underlined the dog's single minded obsession and love.Rationally, if you think about it, any man doing what this dog did would be institutionalized as an obsessive compulsive. Would we respect the man in any way? And still, such a simple show of loyalty brought tears to my eyes that I could not stop from coming out. I knew I was inventing human traits for the dog, but it still would not make me feel any less miserable for that animal's sense of loss. I am also making an effort to not turn this review into a ""stop killing dogs, you brainless simpletons!"" so I stop here.Bottom line: Very simple story, very effective movie, the actors were a little out of it, except Richard Gere who did great.

20,sddavis63,The Animal Tearjerker To Beat All Animal Tearjerkers!,9,2 March 2012,"You choose to watch a movie such as this knowing darn well that it's going to turn out to be a tearjerker. You set yourself and steel yourself against it. There will be no tears, you insist to yourself. It's just a movie - even if it is based on a true story in Japan almost 80 years ago. But it's still just a movie. No tears. But in the end you have to succumb. This is literally an emotional roller coaster, with ups and downs from beginning to end. I've not always been really impressed with director Lasse Hallstrom's work, but he truly managed one of the finest and best told tearjerkers I've ever come across with ""Hachi.""The movie features a good performance from Richard Gere as Parker, the man who adopts (somewhat unwillingly and definitely against his wife's wishes) an Akita puppy who found him (for the point of the story is definitely that Hachi found him) and we follow the development of a bond of loyalty and even friendship between the two that transcends even death. Gere was good, but it wasn't an incredibly demanding performance, because the dog is the star. He waits anxiously day after day at the train station for Parker to come home from work, and Parker looks forward to the greeting. Then, unexpectedly, Parker dies, but Hachi never gives up, going back day after day to the station for the next ten years, waiting without hope for Parker to come off the train, all leading up, of course, to the ultimate tearjerker moment - both sad and happy - as Hachi finally dies lying outside the station one night, but in death sees Parker come out of the terminal and runs to him as they're joyfully reunited. A man and his dog reunited. If you're not shedding tears by the end of this - seriously, what's wrong with you?This is basically a much more serious version of the ""Marley & Me"" type of storyline. Where that movie focused on the clumsy lovability of the dog, this one focuses on the undying bond of loyalty the dog shares with its master. This is truly one of the most emotionally wrenching movies (both happy and sad) you will ever come across. (9/10)",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

If not for anything else, Hachi displays the genuine loyalty and bond that a dog can have with a human. Those scenes alone were enough to get me emotionally in pieces, and then came the final 15 minutes when the film comes to a close and I found out that it was based on a true story. Admittedly, the film doesn't surround itself with better than average human characters, besides the owner of course, but Hachi is enough to give the 90 minute runtime just the boost it needs.

27,howard.schumann,A sweet and touching story of loyalty,8,22 December 2013,"Hachiko, a Japanese Akita dog, is the hero of the film Hachi: A Dog's Tale directed by Lasse Hallstrom, yet he has no super powers, cannot talk and act like a human being, and doesn't even care to ""fetch."" He is just being a dog but he is a special breed, strong, independent, and wary of strangers, one that is noted for gentleness and affectionate loyalty with family members. The film, based on a true incident, was the subject of the 1987 Japanese film, Hachiko Monogatari in which Hachiko, born in 1923, was owned by Professor Hidesaburō Ueno who lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a Tokyo suburb and commuted to work every day on the train.Hachikō accompanied his master to and from the station each day and waited every evening at the station for him to return from work. Today a bronze statue of the Akita can be seen at the same station. The American version, which went straight to DVD after a showing at the Seattle Film Festival, stars Richard Gere as Parker Wilson and Joan Allen as his wife Cate, the caregivers who develop a long term loving relationship with the Akita they name Hachi after a Japanese symbol left on his collar. Parker, a music professor who commutes each day by train to the university, finds the pup (or he finds Parker) at a train station in a small town in Rhode Island after the dog breaks out of the shipping crate that was bringing him to the U.S. from a monastery in Japan.Parker is drawn to the adorable little pup but, knowing that his wife is opposed to having a pet, plans to give him away. He puts posters around the town and talks to the local pound but when the dog is not claimed, he convinces Cate to keep him. Parker's day consists of rehearsing his students in a ballet and giving lectures on different composers but he looks forward to stepping off the train each day at two minutes after five to be greeted by the friendly train conductor (Jason Alexander) and by Hachi who waits lovingly for his master.Wilson attempts to teach Hachi to retrieve a tennis ball in the yard but Hachi is not into it even though the professor sticks the ball in his own mouth and runs around the yard as he is observed by his wife and daughter, Andy (Sarah Roemer). As the years pass and Hachi becomes a fully grown Akita, he develops a friendship with the hot dog vendor Shabir (Erick Avari) at the train station and the librarian Mary Anne (Davenia McFadden), while he continues to wait day after day for his master to come off the train at the appointed hour.Hachi: A Dog's Tale can undoubtedly be classified as a tear-jerker but no classification is really needed. Though many will be in tears at the end, it is not through audience manipulation but through the ups and downs of a genuine relationship that sadly cannot go on forever. It is admittedly a rather slight story and perhaps one that is stretched to its limit to fill its hour and a half, but it is a sweet and touching story of loyalty that you may want to see many times. You might even give your dog a big hug or think about owning one if you don't already.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
28,SAMTHEBESTEST,EPIC !!! The longest sobbing i ever had for any film..,10,10 July 2020,"Hachi A Dog's Tale (2009) :
Brief ReviewEPIC !!! The longest sobbing i ever had for any film. After watching 2000+ films or may be even much more than that, after watching more than 100 tearjerkers, after watching more than 500 emotional sagas this Hachi A Dog's Tale recieved the Longest sobbing of my life. I remember so many films just because they made me cry like kid, i can name many just like that, just now but you know most of those films had that emotional roll down moments somewhere in the last scenes. It is mostly the climax where i had to use tissues but Hachi A Dog's Tale was like raining tears. I cried for approx 25 Minutes continuesly setting a new record for myself and may be for all movie buffs. I mean how emotional film it was despite the fact i tried to hold it acknowledging the fact that yes i am a movie buff and i had to look for Cinematic proportions before breaking down and fortunately there were no cinematic blunders, no mistakes in writing, no loopholes, no non-sense theories and I was all free to cry like a small kid as if i am locked in an empty room and no one's watching me, just cry out loud. And yes i did it. It is inspired from a true story of a college professor who finds an abandoned dog and he takes into his home and how the Dog sets an example to the world about loyalty. Believe me, the dog put us all humans at shame. His loyalty and emotions were far far greater and immortal than humans and this is what makes this film truly Epic. You will see many scenes proving this statement in the film. Lasse Halstrom wherever you are just take my salute and please recieve my thank you, it means a lot to me. The way you crafted this film has left me stunned and heart broken. I promise you here that sooner or later i will have a Pet and i hope it would love me just the way Hachi loved his owner.

29,Vartiainen,Overly sentimental,5,14 July 2018,"A college professor (Richard Gere) finds an abandoned puppy on his hometown train station. Despite the protests of his wife (Joan Allen) he brings the puppy back with him, to look after it until its owners are found. Turns out that the dog ends up staying with them for good.The film is an Americanized version of the 1987 Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari, which in turn is based on real-life events that took place in 1920s Tokyo. The basic premise being the same in all three. A professor, an akita dog and a story about loyalty.That being said, I think I would have rather watched the Japanese film. Because quite honestly, while I can see why some people might really love this film, it feels so patronizingly Hollywood to me. All the usual tricks are here. The attempts to mystify the Far East, the touching montages, the sappy music, the candles and tears in the corner of the eye, the idyllic small town charm. They even slap a GoPro on the dog, just to make sure we understand that it is its story. Quite honestly I expected the dog to start talking at some point.Plus there's an absolutely pointless framing story featuring the professor's grandson. Absolutely pointless, pure waste of time and film reel.Still, the film is professionally made, looks very nice and if there was ever only one man who could pull off this kind of story, it would have to be Richard Gere. Quite honestly I had more problems with the characterization of the dog than I had with him.Not really a good movie in my opinion, but it has its numerous fans, and I can see why.

31,robert-temple-1,"The ultimate dog film weepie, impossible not to cry no matter who you are",10,29 May 2010,"This one really will make you cry, even those who think they can't. Hachi, full name Hachiko, is an Akito dog from Japan. In this film he is sent to America, where his story unfolds. But there was a real Hachi, who lived in Japan, and this story is true, although it really all took place in Japan. So famous is the real dog Hachi that a life-size bronze statue of him was erected in his home town in his memory! By transferring the story of Hachi to America, it meant that Richard Gere could be 'Hachi's mother', the university professor who finds Hachi lost on a railway platform and with whom the little puppy bonds for life, with fanatical devotion. I was going to say with superhuman devotion, but I guess supercanine devotion is a better way to put it. I noticed that this film was distributed by a subsidiary of Sony, so perhaps that is how a Japanese tale ended up being transposed to Rhode Island, where Gere is presumably meant to be teaching at Brown University. (His educational and professional life is only roughly sketched.) The one false note in this film is Joan Allen, who plays Gere's wife. Although she was brilliant in OFF THE MAP (see my review), she gets the tone wrong here, which may be the fault of the otherwise brilliant Lasse Hallström, who has directed this film otherwise nearly to perfection. Allen falls into the trap in the early part of the story of acting the part of the censorious, sour and unsympathetic wife, who has become just as much a stock character in modern American movies as the embittered and vicious ex-wife or the 'angry young woman' who takes her revenge on men. Although Allen softens up as things go on, she is never convincingly warm either towards her husband or his dog, whom she initially fanatically opposes (for reasons which are entirely unclear other than the presumption that Gere's wife, not any potential girl dog whom Hachi might ever meet, is a bitch). I found that aspect of the film disappointing, disturbing, and incomprehensible. Hachi starts out as a puppy, becomes an adult, and then becomes an old dog, so there must have been at least three Hachis acting in the film. Hallström is known as a dog lover, and he aptly subtitles this film: 'A Dog's Love Story', as the attention is all on Hachi. Richard Gere is absolutely superb as the man who learns to love his dog more than anyone or anything. He and Hachi become inseparable, and every day at 5 PM, Hachi trots over to the railway station to meet his master's train and accompany him on the walk home. But Richard Gere has a heart attack and dies whilst teaching, and when Hachi goes to meet the train that day, his master does not appear as normal at the station door. Various events ensue, but Hachi cannot settle with any other member of the family, as they have all left the original house near the station, so Hachi returns to his post every day and waits for his master. He does this every day for ten years. (The real Hachi in Japan did it for nine years.) He faithfully waits and scans the station door every day at 5 PM, never giving up hope or losing his loyalty to the man he adores. He does this come rain or shine, he sits in the snow, he lives on scraps, but nothing can deter him or shake his loyalty. There are some really good performances by minor characters associated with the station, a hot-dog seller (sensitively portrayed by the Indian actor Erick Avari), some station employees, and other locals such as a friendly butcher and his wife, and even a real Japanese professor (excellently played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who had been a friend of Gere, who comes and speaks to Hachi in Japanese, which Hachi from his facial expression clearly recognises. Hachi's point-of-view shots are all shot in black and white, from ground level, presumably on the theory that dogs do not see in colour. They are very effective indeed, which is not an easy thing to pull off. I don't know why poor Hachi was left outside at night in a doghouse. Any half sensible person would have wanted Hachi in the house at night, rather than in the cold during the winter, however thick his fur might be. But then people are weird, and only dogs are sensible and loving, as this film proves. If ever a dog could teach us all something it is Hachi. He can instruct us in the true meaning of the word 'loyalty', both the dictionary meaning of which and the daily application of which have become so unfashionable in our current narcissistic society, where no even looks at another person anymore, as everyone's eyes are now out of focus, staring into space vacantly while listening to someone talk nonsense on a cellphone, oblivious of all surroundings. This film is so sad and such a desperate weepie that even the most hardened narcissist might turn his Blackberry off for a few moments of reflection, that is, if he has sufficient attention span to watch two or three continuous minutes of anything other than a combat computer game. I had great fun watching this DVD with Dutch subtitles. I now know that 'Good Boy!' in Dutch is 'Brave Hond!', 'Really?' is 'Echt waar?', and if I ever want to call anyone 'Sweetie' when I am next in the Netherlands, all I have to do is say 'lieverd' and smile. So you see how much else Hachi has taught me? I really recommend turning on the foreign subtitles when you watch movies, as you can learn a foreign language at the same time as seeing the film. Such fun!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It's about a relation between a man and a dog like no other, and gives a new meaning to the phrase ""Man's best friend."".Based on a story of a real dog Hachi that waited for his deceased master for 9 years in Tokyo's Shibuya station, Hachi is a moving story about dog's loyalty that transcends animal - human barrier. Nowhere in the world has a story of this likes has been reported, and in his native Japan, Hachi is still the symbol of how families should be faithful to one another. This is no ordinary animal's movie as the animal not only gets the top billing, but gets it above a Hollywood A list actor Richard Gere. Although the movie's setting is transplanted to a town in Rhode Island, the story is essentially the same as that of the original Hachi. Richard Gere makes his second appearance on a Japan themed movie, first being ""Shall we Dance ?"", as the University professor.For the real dog Hachi, a bronze statue of him was erected in 1948 at Shibuya station in front of an exit that now bears his name ""Shibuya eki Hachi ko guchi"" (Shibuya Station Hachi Ko Exit), and is a popular landmark for people to use as a meeting place.This certainly is one of the best movie Richard Gere starred in, and also one of the best animal movie of all times.

Firstly, it's pretty boring. Secondly, the dog is just plain stupid. So he never fetched a ball and supposedly, as it was said, he waited for a special moment to fetch. He, of course, chose the moment before his master's death, which means he clearly knew his master was going to die that day. That means that he waited for him later on even though he knew he was never coming back. If it was about loyalty, the dog would have waited for him if he did not knew his master was dead, so he would have waited for him, no matter what, hoping he would come one day, because he has no reason to doubt his master - that is loyalty. Here, he knows his master is dead, yet he keeps going there waiting for him which is just plain stupidity. It's like running into the wall and then being surprised that the wall was in your path... Anyway the movie ends with hallucination or imagination of his master finally coming, which is truly predictable, lame and forced.

It is based on a true story, and isn't just the Disney fiction story we are used to.Richard Gere portrays a music professor in New York suburbs who commutes to the city for work every day. One day he comes across a stray, a beautiful Akita puppy who has lost his way.He brings the pup home, hoping at first to keep him, but his wife, Joan Allen, is not really a dog lover. She wants the dog in the shed, or to find a new home.After back and forth of trying to get the dog adopted, Gere finally decides he cannot just give the dog to a shelter, where they put dogs to sleep after two weeks, there are too many which aren't adopted.He eventually names the dog ""Hachi"" after his Japanese colleague tells him the story behind the breed of Akita. They are very loyal and devoted, but do not expect them to play catch at the whim of a human.Over time we see Gere and his family, he becomes a grandfather, he takes the dog for trips (Hachi refuses to sit home while his master is at work, he will wait for him at the train station, even in freezing weather). The story is told in a natural progression, we also see in the dogs perspective, in black and white, with gray.While this film came out after ""Marley and Me"" it is not just another dog story. It will truly touch your heart. Indeed, I have not cried over any film in over fifteen years. Highly recommended and read the true story as well. 10/10.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Even thought, I decided it was a good idea watching this movie. And it was. First minutes are reasonably predictable, since we all know that, in the end, the family would adopt the little dog anyways. It is nice the way Gere's character became friends with the little animal, and it was beautiful to see their activities together-- specially when Mr. Wilson tries to teach him how to catch a ball or any object. In a moment I couldn't imagine how the movie could become sad if the dog didn't die, but some scenes after I found it could be worse than that-- I'm not spoiling on that. Photography direction is beautiful, and so are acting and story. I won't deny I almost cried in the last minutes, given that the ending is completely hopeless, but makes it become a strong movie involving emotions and feelings.

40,Sandcooler,"Dull characters, but the dog is darn cute",7,2 January 2014,"The true story of Hachiko might be very touching, but how can you translate it to the screen? It's a dog waiting for his dead owner to come back while sitting in the same spot for years, how do you make that visually interesting? Director Lasse Halstrom partially solves this problem by having Richard Gere die very late into this movie, a bit too late perhaps. The whole family is just so bland, what do we get to know about these people throughout the movie? They're happy. That's pretty much the character development. There are only so many scenes about Richard Gere playing with a dog you can stomach without wondering when something's going to happen. The last half hour of this movie manages to save a lot though. Seeing Hachi interact with all of his owner's old friends who can't convince him he will never be back, watching him badly age while everyone around him knows he's wasting his time, it's all very strong because the build-up does work to some extent. It's kinda boring, but we do feel like we get to know Hachi well and that makes it all the more sad when we see him suffer. Everything that concerned Hachi I loved, the rest I can sorta do without.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

43,Takethispunch,Good movie.,10,18 December 2016,"Hachi is a story of love & devotion between a dog & a man. The story is told by Ronnie, the grandson of the man. He has to give an oral presentation about a personal heroes. Ronnie's subject is his grandfather's dog, Hachikō. Despite his classmates laughing he tells how his grandfather, Professor Parker Wilson finds a lost puppy sent from Japan at the train station & ends up taking it home with the intention of returning the animal to its owner. He names the Akita puppy Hachikō, after Ken, a Japanese professor, translates a symbol on his collar as 'Hachi'— Japanese for the number 8—signifying good fortune. Even though they didn't find his owner & his wife, Cate doesn't think they should keep him, they do. Over the next year or so, Parker & Hachi become very close. Parker tries, but Hachi refuses to do dog-like activities like chase & fetch. One morning, Parker leaves for work & Hachi follows him to the train station & refuses to leave until Parker walks him home. Later that afternoon, Hachi walks to the station to wait patiently for Parker to return. Parker is surprised to find Hachi waiting for him, but it becomes a daily routine. One day, Hachi waits patiently as the train arrives, but there is no sign of Parker. He waits, lying in the snow for hours until Parker's son-in-law Michael comes to get him, he tries to tell Hachi that Parker has died, but Hachi doesn't understand. Hachi continues to return to the station & wait every day. As time passes, Cate sells the house & Hachi is sent to live with her daughter Andy, Michael & their baby Ronnie. However, Hachi escapes & finds his way back to the station, where he sits at his usual spot. Andy arrives & takes him home, but after seeing how depressed the dog is she lets him out to return to the station. Hachi waits every day at the train station, while sleeping in the rail yard at night. He is fed daily by the train station workers that knew the professor. After seeing a newspaper article about Hachi, Ken visits Hachi. Cate comes back to visit Parker's grave on the tenth anniversary of his death & meets Ken. She is stunned to see a now elderly Hachi still waiting. Overcome with grief, Cate sits & waits for the next train with him. At home, Cate tells the now ten-year-old Ronnie about Hachi. Meanwhile the dog continues waiting until his body can wait no longer, Hachi is last seen lying on the snow, alone & still. Ronnie concludes why Hachi will forever be his hero. Ronnie's story has clearly moved the class, with some students holding back tears, even those who had laughed at the beginning. After school, Ronnie is met coming off the school bus by his dad & his own puppy, also named Hachi. Ronnie & Hachi walk down the same tracks where Parker & Hachi had spent so much time together. The movie was based on the real Hachikō, who was born in Ōdate in 1923. After the death of his owner, Hidesaburō Ueno in 1925, Hachikō returned to the Shibuya train station the next day & every day after that for the next nine years until he died in March 1935.

Then followed a brief moment when I had to recover my posture having fallen off my chair and, while the remainder of the film did have me under some emotional turmoil, it wasn't until the final few stills that I could put into context the contrivance I'd absorbed.

Hachi ( means the lucky number 8 in Japanese language) was an abandoned dog who ultimately is adopted by Professor Parker Wilson in Bedridge Town Railway Station. Parker , following his wife's constant complaining to keep the dog, tries to give it to someone else but destiny plays different role and no matter how much he tries to shove Hachi away , it keeps on coming back to him with nobody willing to take the lost puppy. Eventually , a deep bond builds in between the two and Parker finally decides to take him home. Hachi becomes so close to his master that everyday he waits for him to return home at 5 PM in the nearby railway station and this becomes his regular habit. Now , a dog's story has always moved me right from Marley& Me to Red Dog and this film goes a one step ahead with such a delightful and touching story of a canine who becomes a legend in the small town after he waits for his master at the gateway of Bedridge railway station for nine years following his master's death. Lasse Hallstorm ( Chocolate , Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) has chosen a very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world. The direction is simply superb and script is tight that will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The cinematography is eye-catching , the art direction is wonderful with an awesome background score. The performances are stupendous. Richard Gere excels in the role of Professor who feel compassionate for the animal. The dog essaying the role of Hachi was gorgeous and full of expressions. Other starcast did a fine job as well.So , overall , a superb story to be told , to be heard , to be seen. "" Dogs are the most beautiful animal on earth who needs only one thing from you - Love.

47,tim-764-291856,How I Tried to Resist this film....,7,26 April 2012,"I reckon that Hachi: A Dog's Tale has been shown on one of the Sky Movies channels graveyard slot almost every day, for months now. Hmmm. Another shaggy dog story, no thanks.Radio Times online has a photo of a young boy with a puppy to go with it. Doubly no thankyou! So, I resisted even longer. Then I noticed the director was none other than Lasse Hallstrom, who not everybody knows, made as one of his earliest films in his native Sweden, 'My Life as a Dog', back in 1985.That being quite a favourite of mine, I then recorded Hachi. But, My Life is a Dog it isn't and is very different and much more 'normal' and grown up and sober. For much of it though I still found myself sceptical; instead of my worst fears of having a small boy playing with his puppy, we have a fifty-odd year old man playing with his dog. All very cute and life-assuring but hardly high drama.Of course, this is a family drama and one that is obviously loved and so I adjusted my perceptions and then, enjoyed it. It benefits from a good cast - Richard Gere and Joan Allen as his wife and being filmed in the old school tradition - simply, slowly, beautifully. The simple piano-led music is evocative, emotive and fitting - and universal.Hachi is a touching tale that certainly brought a lump to my Tarantino- hardened throat and certainly made me think and ponder. Recommended.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
48,ajs-10,A heart-warming tale...,7,5 February 2011,"I had better state first of all that I'm not particularly a dog lover, I'm more of a cat person, but I appreciate the bond that can exist between an owner and his pet. I should also say that if it wasn't for the fact the Richard Gere appears in this film I very much doubt I would have watched it. Having said that, what I saw was a very heart-warming story that will most definitely not be for everyone, but for those that can appreciate it, it's well worth a viewing. Here's a very brief summary first before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please wait outside the railway station while I write the next paragraph).Parker Wilson is a music professor at a university and he commutes by train every day. One day he finds a puppy wandering about on the platform. Unable to find anyone to claim the dog he takes it home. His wife, Cate, is not best pleased and tells him he must find the real owner soon. He puts up flyers and asks around but nobody claims the dog. He even asks Ken, a Japanese colleague about the dog. Ken tells him that he has a symbol on his collar that says 'Hachiko', which means 'eight' in Japanese. As you can guess, Hachi (for short) becomes the dog's name. As the days pass the bond grows stronger between Parker and Hachi and Cate eventually relents and allows the dog to stay. Once fully grown, every day Hachi would follow Parker to the station and then go home until the evening when he would return to wait for his master. This goes on for quite a while and Hachi becomes a bit of a celebrity amongst those that work in and around the station. But something is about to go badly wrong and this will test Hachi's devotion to his master. Of course I'm not going to tell you what that is as I really don't want to give away too much.You may be surprised to know that this film is based on a 1987 Japanese film called ""Hachiko monogatari"" by Kaneto Shindô, which is, in turn, based on a true story. There is a very nice musical score that complements the visuals perfectly and I love the occasional shots we get from the dog's point of view. Nobody does a long stare quite like Richard Gere, and he was excellent in his part as Parker Wilson here. Also worth a mention are; Joan Allen as Cate Wilson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken, Sarah Roemer as Andy (their daughter), Jason Alexander, as Carl and Erick Avari as Jasjeet.Although this has the feel of a TV movie of the week, it is a very well done TV movie of the week. If anything the ninety minutes running time is a little long for the story and you begin to feel there is a little too much padding in there. But having said that I still found it a decent watch. Over all, although it is not for everyone, it did bring out some emotions in me that I rarely show and so I deem it Recommended.My score: 7.3/10",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
49,MihaiSorinToma,"Simply put, a masterpiece!",10,23 March 2019,"An extraordinary plot, inspired by a true story, of a special dog who generates an incredible bond between him and his master after he's found in a railway station. The way their relationship builds up is full of emotion and happiness, the dog's cuteness and overall attitude playing a very important role here. The human actors also do a very good job in impersonating their characters which manage to generate plenty of emotion and love with every chance they get.The movie manages to create such an unique atmosphere that it simply transports the viewer into its world, making him feel what the characters are feeling, making him empathize with the characters. Although maintaining a slow pace all the way, it doesn't let the viewer get bored at any single moment. It has this gift of keeping one's attention, making him care about the situations and the characters. But, as we get past the first half of the movie, drama starts building up, replacing the happiness with sorrow and grief. The amount of it is simply impossible to explain using mere words. It was so tragic that I was hardly able to control my tears as they seemed more and more inevitable.It very hard to explain how this movie made me feel, how it was able to put a smile on my face but also generate so much sadness to make me cry. Everything seems so well thought, so well put into picture that it simply is an unique experience which you have to live it in order to fully understand its depth. It simply is a masterpiece which deserves any recommendation possible.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

51,MattyGibbs,Incredibly emotional drama.,10,23 June 2013,I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much from this movie when I first saw it. The start is pretty standard as it sets the scene and you are therefore caught unaware when the emotional tug of the film kicks in halfway through. I'm pretty pleased that I watched this film on my own one afternoon as I found myself crying more than in any other film I've ever seen. It was almost unbearably sad at times but in an uplifting kind of way. I challenge anyone who has a heart to watch it without feeling any tinge of sadness at all. The fact that a family orientated film has a rating of 8.1 on IMDb shows just how good it is.

Either you really get into such things or you don't, and there's not a lot of grumbling to be done if you know what you're getting into. Hachi is an appealing little pup who is found by professor Richard Gere, coming home from work one night and who finds himself helplessly captured by the beauty and unabashed attachment of the animal....Gere's curmudgeonly wife (perfectly played by reliable Joan Allen) thinks otherwise. Take it from there: this is not a stupid pet movie full of fire hydrants and stupid tricks--it's a very well-acted, sensitive film, knows just how and when to push a willing viewer's buttons, and you may want to rush right out and find a dog just like Hachi when you have finished using up all the Kleenex.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

This one is a real dog and a real story. It does not, it does not do funny things or never becomes serious, it just plays itself as a dog. Hachiko, the dog is an amazing one and the story is fascinating too.It was hard to believe that such a dog existed, till I got to read the real story. Akita, the breed of Hachiko seems to be most loyal of all the dog breeds and we are lucky to have such beings accompany us in this world. I am lucky enough to have known and seen the story by myself, although in a cinematic form.It's a story that's worth telling and is worth knowing. There are aspects from where we as humans can learn something I believe. I learned to be more humble, and will try to be more down to earth. Death is a certainty that no mortal being can escape but the way we die makes what we are. This is the take away from the film. I hope to die in a way where I am remembered not just by my family and friends but by many more persons for the rightful deeds.Thanks to the technical team of this film, for taking this story and making us a film, so that many more will get to know of this. Thanks to Richard Gere for acting in this low-key film and making his performance and also the film special. He seems to be a generous human, by playing his part in a film like this one.

Richard Gere, well, it's Richard Gere, what more can be said? Richard Gere doesn't need to do too much to light up the screen. But the real star is (are) the dog(s) that portray(s) Hichiko. You don't expect so much emotion and facial expression to come from a canine and that is why the last twenty minutes or so of this movie is so gut wrenching. We feel for the dog as if it is human, perhaps feel even stronger for it because it is not human and doesn't know that its master isn't going to someday reappear.

I lost my dog in July 2014, and was debating on renting this movie. I saw it on Redbox, and thought why not. The movie is about an Akita pup who makes it's way from Japan to the United States. It arrives at a train station,it gets loose from it's cage. Parker Wilson(Richard Gere) comes along and finds him. He figures the dog belongs to somebody and tells Carl( Jason Alexander), the train station manager. He asks Carl if he could keep him until the owner comes. When Carl says I can come in, in the morning; and drop him off at the pound. Parker has second thoughts, and decides to take him home. He finds a box to put him in, until he can find the owner. Parker has him in the den, and decides he his safe until morning. The dog wants to be with Parker, he gets loose climbs up the stairs to Parker's and Cate's room. The dog licks Cate's feet, and scares her. She tells Parker about their agreement, no more dogs. Parker get's up, and put's the dog out in the shed for the night. everyone in the house wants the dog to stay except Cate. A bond begins to form with Parker, and Hachi. Cate sees this with Parker, Andy( their daughter); and decides to give in. The Parker's have a new family member. As Hachi begins to grow the bond becomes stronger. Every work day, Hachi would go to the train station with Parke,r and meet him when he returns. Hachi is a very loyal dog, who is a one master dog literally. When Parker doesn't come home from work one day, Hachi sits there until the family picks him up. Parker had a heart attack teaching class, and died. Hachi seems lost after this, but he would do the same routine every work day like Parker was going to return. Hachi is a regular at the station, and is beloved by all there. They would feed him, look after him, and let him stay there. He was sent to live with Andy, and her husband, but he didn't want to live anywhere so lived close by under a train on the tracks . I guess he did this to be close to the station; he just wanted his master to return. As the years go by, you still see the strong devotion of this dog. He doesn't give up, the same routine every day, you feel for the dog. In a way he seems lost; but he is strong willed. This movie is very heartwarming, it has it's sad moments; but the humor it has will put a smile on your face. At the end of the film it shows a picture of the real Hachi. It also has the factual information with it, which is very interesting. In Japan there is a huge statue of Hachi at the train station, where Hachi would wait. This is a great film the whole family will enjoy. Even though it is sad the ending is touching. It is a tear jerker so have those tissues nearby. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

65,ragingbull_2005,"Prepare to be laugh,cry and be devastated by this extraordinary drama",9,15 December 2012,"Well, to begin with a confession. I have been crying for nearly the last half hour. These have not been tears of frustration on watching yet another jaded entertainer or difficult to fathom artsy flick. These are tears of gratitude towards the director of the movie for what is easily the most sensitive and touching portrayal of the bond between a man and a dog. Richard Gere is the music professor at a college who finds an abandoned dog at the train station. He takes it to his home. His wife (Joan Allen) is initially against keeping the dog with them because of a reason. But slowly she understands that her husband had become totally crazy for it and he ends up becoming a part of their family which also includes a daughter. Gere finds out that its name is Hachiko. The film tracks the relation between Gere and Hachiko over their life time. The incidents are funny and poignant and you would be laughing as well as suppressing sniffles. Gere is in the acting form of his life and you can clearly see that he loves Hachiko. Their chemistry burns up the screen and lifts this from a very good movie to a truly extraordinary one. Allen is better than average as his wife. There are a bunch of characters that fall in love with Hachiko and they are sketched very vividly. But the film belongs to the titular Hachiko. The director uses black and white to show his point of view. Watching many scenes I thought I could understand that the director was trying to show that we may be thinking that our pet is really fine and cozy in its place but what it actually wants at that time is to be with us, in our arms. Hachiko wins your heart and bowls you over and devastates you by the end of the run time. I have never owned an animal in my life time. I guess it is time to set this right. As one of my friend wrote and it has stayed with me ever since, when you go and select a dog perhaps that may be the only occasion you get to select your relative. Unbelievable achievement. 4.5 out of 5.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
66,deepfrieddodo,Incredibly Emotional but Plot Lacking,7,19 December 2020,"Evidently, Hachi is an unbelievably emotional film, full of sentiment. The dog is lovely, the relationship is everything everyone hopes to have with their dog, but there isn't any real plot to go with this.For the first half, it was dull, unfortunately, as although the development of the relationship was there, no real story was. It's a matter of a dog and its owner loving one another, lovely, but not engaging. Then there is the change in pace, and really it's not a very nice watch. The film is just horribly sad, the sentiment pulls at everyone's heartstrings. My girlfriend was in floods of tears for the majority of the film, because you feel so much for the dog, but something so enduringly sad can't be a perfect film can it?Evoking so much emotion means you cannot give it a terrible score, but without a story to truly follow it cannot be a brilliant film either.

Hachi spent nearly ten years of his life waiting for the figure of the professor he used to get along with. To others, the professor is just a dog, but to Hachi, the professor is his life.As the movie said, the distance between life and death, for a dog, it can not figure out, it only believe that his master will come back. Its life is like a note of water, little by little in the station bluestone Taiwan year after year by year. As a dog, it has its principle, never abandon, regardless of birth, sickness and death. It lies there, ten years, thoroughly into a landscape.Hachi could have chosen to live in the professor's daughter's house, but he still went to the railway station to wait for the professor. This is Hachi's loyalty to his love. Hachi died at the end of the story, but Hachi finally got to the professor. I think Hachi was happy.Every time I listen to the movie soundtrack ""Goodbye"" by Hachi, I always think of the scene when the aging Hachi walks to the station Bluestone Platform step by step.

Because that is why this film is scoring so high on IMDb. Director Lasse Hallström was probably eager take make a film where he could jerk the tears out of people. I just couldn't help feeling constantly manipulated and pushed around by the slimy piano music and the forced script and acting. I was thinking before I saw this film: how can they make people care so much for a dog it would make them cry and there really is only one way, the easy way which they took here (No spoilers but futurama episode 1 has a 1 min dog-sequence which this film ripped off which works so much better then Hachi). I have to say the dog is cute -although I'm more a cat person- and he does look sooo very sad at times in this film you can't help but feel sorry for the poor animal, but this is the manipulative effect this film has on people and Lasse knows and uses it so well. The dog trainers did a good job, kudos there but you do sometimes notice the dog is looking at something (the dog trainer) out of frame who is directing the dog to do certain things. The cinematographer also scores some bad points: this film was filmed digitally on a Genesis camera, but the picture has a very video/TV-like look which reinforces the feeling this is simply a low budget TV movie and not the cinematic masterpiece a lot of people seem to think it is. I know people who loved this movie won't understand and think me unempathetic for saying all this, but I love films and sometimes you need to dare point out the bad as well. It's like when a bad actor dies. Nobody dare say he sucked coz emotions have the upper hand but he was a bad actor all the same.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The actual story should have been told verbally by people coz the interesting part is only in the beginning and somewhat in the middle. I got bored in the end and was hoping to get something interesting in the end. A disappointing experience I must say. Well the part that I appreciate is that there were not too many characters inserted just to increase the length of the film. Than at sometimes I could not understand some of the things that the dog was doing. May be I was not able to understand.

74,lyubitelfilmov,An immortal example of loyalty or One of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema,10,8 November 2020,"Drama. American ""rethinking"" of the Japanese painting ""The Story of Hachiko"" of 1987, which in turn is based on real events. And again, the Russian distributors decided to turn on unnecessary fantasy, and called the picture ""Hachiko: The Most Loyal Friend"", although the original name is translated as ""Hati: The Story of a Dog"", but oh well. The first time I saw this picture in the thirteenth year, when I was at university, gnawed at the granite of science, so to speak, and came to work (I studied in absentia), but there was no one there, it was on Sunday, there was nothing to do, and I decided to see this film - and cried out a bucket of tears, and I could not forget it. Even then, I gave this picture the highest mark. Oh yes, I did not see the original Japanese painting, so I will judge it as an independent work. After the first viewing, I avoided reviewing this picture for a long time, because I knew that it would not do without emotions, and only recently decided to review it - and again my handkerchief was wet, and again a bucket of tears. And here's my brief opinion - one of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema. This time I tried to look at the picture carefully, trying not to miss a single detail, but to my regret, I did not find any flaws in this picture, but the dignity still creeps out, and I turn to them immediately.
So, here they are:
1.Dramatic and touching story - the picture tells the story of Hachiko (whom everyone calls Hachi in the picture), an Akita Inu dog who got lost at the train station until he was picked up by an American professor, which became the reason for an incredible and strong friendship between them. Every day, Hachiko accompanied his master to the station and met him. This was until the owner died, but Hachiko continued to go to the station for many years and meet his master. The most famous example of selfless loyalty, they even erected a monument to him in Japan, and lovers make dates near him. The script is measured, simple and straightforward. Although I am a cat lover, dogs have one thing that makes them very different from my purring favorites - loyalty. The ending of the picture turned out to be very powerful, on the one hand, the most terrible and most breaking heart was not shown to us, on the other hand, they honored the memory of the real Hachiko, who deserved his place in the pantheon of heroes. He has a lot to learn.
2. Emotions - well, where can we go without it. Not a single viewing of this picture is complete without ammonia and several dozen scarves, because you will roar in any case, even if you think the opposite. I myself thought I would hold back, but I was wrong. Live and learn, as they say. There is a lot of drama here, and there are even more touching moments.
3. Humor - even in such a serious and dramatic story, the writers added a little humor that fits perfectly here. Here he is unobtrusive, filled with everyday affairs and causes both a slight smile and a short laugh, which dilutes the colossal drama on which the script is based.
4. The tone of the picture is measured, unhurried, with a touch of light melancholy against which the story unfolds. The tone does not drive you into melancholy, because sometimes it can seem stringy.
5. Music - composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek did a good job, giving the lion's share of piano or piano music, which I love very much, because without such music, Hachiko's story would have looked less dramatic. Indeed, in the most touching and heartbreaking moments, it is music that contributes to active tears. I do not recommend listening to these musical compositions separately, because otherwise the very moments will pop up before your eyes that will make you literally cry, even if you are an adult man who has gone through the war.
A little about the main characters:
1.Parker Wilson performed by Richard Gere is a professor who has become an unwitting master of Hachiko, a kind and strong-willed person, as well as a loving husband and caring father. In short - an example to follow, the role of which was played by the famous Richard Gere. With the selection of the actor, they obviously did not lose, because Richard just perfectly got into the character. Bravo!
2. Kate Wilson performed by Joanne Allen - the wife of the professor, who was downloaded against Hachiko, but gradually, seeing her husband's affection for the dog, gives way. She manifests herself as a loving wife and caring mother who was able to love Hachiko, with his selfless devotion to her husband. Joanne quite successfully coped with the role, here without pretensions.
3. Chiko, Laila and Forrest performed by Hachiko - you are not crazy, three dogs played the famous Hachiko, and I can't even imagine how much effort it took to train them, because dogs of this breed are special, they are very attached to their owners, and my humble opinion - the dogs did it.
Of course, the habit of Americans to shoot ""rethinks"" of successful foreign films infuriates a little. They just do not like to watch foreign films, and the producers create ""rethinks"" with the obligatory transfer of the main action to America. To me this approach seems strange and even absurd, but we will regret the ""beacons of democracy"".
At the moment, I consider this masterpiece the most tear-squeezing in history, but I have not watched the original Japanese picture and have not even had time to check out White Bim Black Ear by the excellent Soviet director Stanislav Rostotsky, where the main role was played by the wonderful old school actor Vyacheslav Vasilyevich Tikhonov, therefore and put the mark ""one of the best"".
As a result, we have an excellent drama about Hachiko's selfless feat, with an excellent script, great music, a strong emotional component and great acting.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Tears will flow and you'll need your tissue box for sure. This movie is so darn good though. The journey of a sweet, Akita dog from Japan to the U.S. I don't often get this emotional during a movie, but Wow! Amazing is not a good enough word to describe this one. You've got to see it for yourself to get the full appreciation and I'm not a dog owner, nor have I ever cared to own one. What an emotional journey this dog took though. And to know this was actually based on a true story, made the movie even that more special, topping my list of favorites viewed thus far. The end does reveal who the movie was about. One cannot even compare this movie to any of Nicholas Spark's written novels turned into incredibly powerful 'tear-jerker' romance movies. Everyone, if you can handle this movie, don't miss out on it. Sometimes love runs deeper than the imagination can fathom and this wasn't imagination at all, this was real! I want that kind of love! Someone who will always be there waiting in anticipation of me and even going out of their way for me, to see me before I come home. That kind of love cannot be topped!

77,calspers,Unfathomably overrated - dog lovers must have driven this to the top,4,24 March 2019,"Yeah we follow Richard Gere and a dog named Hachi. The film basically lacks everything that features a great worthy of holding a place at the IMDb top 250 - a good script, direction, cinematography, score, editing, and so on.I felt that the film lacks basically all qualities of these traits and that the director attempts to compensate for this by the intense and very dense use of classical piano music, which seemed unnatural, as well as with the dialogue throughout the film.An example of this is seen in the scene where Richard Gere's son-in-law plays catch with Hachi and trips over a ball game. If you do decide to watch this film for whatever reason, try and notice the dialogue and his reaction to falling and how badly acted it is and how immensely unnatural it seems. It almost has a ""The Room""-esque vibe to it.The only way I can fathom that this film received such high praise is that it is watched primarily by dog lovers that schew the ratings so badly on this film.Not in any way recommended.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

81,jonnyfendi,Learned Humanity from A Dog Story,8,16 April 2010,"""Hachiko"" is based on the real story that actually happened in 1925 at Shibuya, Tokyo. There's a dog named Hachiko, devotedly waiting the return of his master every day at the train station. Unfortunately, one day his master died and never showed up again. But afterward Hachiko kept waiting on the same spot every single day. The story is widely spread and very well-known in Japan. The Director of thiz movie is Lasse Hallström. Hallström made many modest and effective dramas. His famous works are ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" (1993), ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999) and ""Chocolat"" (2000). The movie tries to capture how the event occurs, while the setting and characters are adjusted to United States background. Richard Gere played as Prof. Wilson. Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer played as his wife and daughter. Gere performs his character properly. He looks so compassionate and lovable. The storyline is also filled with simplicity. The plots try to build the sympathy from the beginning and mount up in the end of the movie. The movie simply tells you the story about what happens after his master death. I think thiz movie will easily affect on you, especially if you are a dog lover or a person who ever raise a dog. Thiz is totally just a powerful story behind the real event.

The Censor board has approved this movie for General exhibition so it can be watched with your family.

86,samhill5215,A testament to inhumanity,1,30 November 2020,"Despite it's designation as a children's film it's anything but and should be avoided at all costs. The story begins well enough but careens into utter heartlessness once the professor dies and the dog is left to fend for itself, dependent on the charity of strangers. There's nothing to celebrate here. Yes, Hachi was a loyal companion who faithfully waited for his master to return. But once he died why didn't his widow or daughter adopt him? How could they have been so insensitive? I repeat, there's nothing to celebrate here. The story does nothing but testify to his family's insensitivity. At the very least they could have provided for him with a doghouse, regular care and food instead of letting him sleep in a train yard, exposed year round to the elements for ten years. TEN YEARS! And then the widow runs into him after all those years and all she could do was hug him as if that makes up for her disgraceful behavior. How anyone could find this story inspiring is beyond me. Be forewarned! Like me you might end up crying but not out of admiration for Hachi's perseverance. Instead it might be because you can't believe people can be so cruel. Don't be fooled by the high scores or the uplifting score, or the brilliant cinematography, or the performances. Whether you share your life with animals and perhaps especially if you do you'll come to rue your investment in this story.After sleeping on it I have come to question several assertions of the story. I don't know the original Japanese version hence my comments address this, the American version and some bear on the behavior of the local authorities. Without a doubt Hachi would have been considered abandoned within days of his vigil at the station. Let's just consider the station master, or the vendor or the shopkeeper. They were all aware of the professor's death, Hachi's adoption by his daughter, the sale of his house and the relocation of his wife. It's inconceivable that in the US they would have shown no more concern than what is depicted in the film. And if not them then what of the commuters? We are even shown some greeting and caressing Hachi. He was clearly not an aggressive or defensive dog as Akitas are reputed to be. Any one of these individuals could have adopted Hachi or at the very least alerted the authorities of his condition. We know of a local animal control officer. We meet him early in the film. Once alerted, he would have been duty bound to capture Hachi and proceed with the dictates of local ordinances regarding stray animals.Now let's consider the professor's family. Their behavior is likewise inconceivable. Did they all somehow stop loving Hachi? We're supposed to believe that the daughter's response to a grieving dog, one she is responsible for and is charged with its care, is to open the gate and essentially abandon it? Really? Doesn't that strike anyone as ludicrous? Even if they thought Hachi was lost or dead were they not alerted by any of the aforementioned individuals or the authorities that he was at the station? We are expected to believe that Hachi, contrary to all evidence, couldn't or wouldn't transfer his loyalty to another human. Dogs and in fact all pets can and do just that. As such the family's portrayal is unbelievable, even slanderous.In the final analysis this film strikes too many false notes to merit its stellar score. I actually feel cheated. I was elevated by the love between a human and a dog only to be angered and disgusted by the events in the film's resolution. Crises do occur, some lead to unforeseen disaster and tragedy. None of that was present here. There wasn't even a point. I'm actually surprised, even disappointed, that actors of the stature of Joan Allen and Richard Gere were involved in this project. It was beneath them.To be fair, had I scored the film on its technical merits and performances I would have given it a higher score. It's the story that destroys it, plain and simple. If you look at some of my other reviews I love duds, turkeys, just plain bad movies. ""Hachi"" is not that. It's a fraud, a deception. It's pretentious. It masquerades as a story of loyalty when it's really about cruelty and desertion under a veneer of devotion, honor and fidelity.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I know that many are using the fact that the dog keeps going back to the train station for years as a sign of loyalty (an it is a sign of loyalty), but him going back for all those years is also the cruel part.I have had dogs, cats, a rabbit and ferrets. All of them have been extremely attached to me and several did not even like it even if I was just outside the house and they could see me from the window. For years I have had a part in my will that states that if I die, my ""babies"" are to be shown my body so that they know that I will not be coming back. I do not want them to be waiting forever for my return that will never happen.I was crying throughout the last part of the movie, not that Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) had died, but that the poor dog did not know that and was now forever waiting for him to return. I had heard of a similar situation when a guy that had a dog with him in a hospital and had to have surgery, died in surgery and he too, waited for the rest of his life for his friend to return. I even make sure that any of my ""babies"" that are still alive see any of my ""babies"" that die, so that they are not waiting for them to return.I had seen a few reviews that had stated that you needed tissues, but I did not realize why. Had I known, I may not have watched this movie.I implore any of you that have an animal (or as I call mine, ""baby""), that is very attached to you as this dog was to Parker Wilson, that you make sure that the members of your family know that the animal, or your ""baby"" is shown that you are dead so that they do not wait for the rest of their lives for your return.

I've also seen the Japanese 1987 version; both versions have their moments and similarities. Of course, the Hollywood Hachi is modernized for today. Richard Gere was the perfect choice for this film. It's so tragic. I'm getting teary just thinking about it again and I watched it over a month ago.

There is no faults where the acting is concerned and Richard Gere gives out a terrific performance as Hachiko's master. Hachiko is directed superbly and the timing for the movie is marvellous, the movie didn't feel long or short and the ending was brilliant. The music added so much emotion to the scenes filmed even though the movie was emotional enough without it. The only fault I have with the movie is the characters. While the characters are lovable, you didn't know enough about them which made them a little underused. However, that could have been intentional to show the audience the loyalty and love between Hachiko and his master.I would recommend this to everybody as this one will tug your heartstrings and make you cry. This is one movie no-one should miss, this isn't your normal dog story, this is one story you won't forget in a hurry.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

93,AbhiMathews,The Pain of Unconditional Love,10,26 January 2014,"Introduced to a little dog transported across the world, it's impossible not to fall for this puppy wandering a dark train station at night. Over time, you see the special attachment shared between Hachi and Parker and find warmth knowing he has finally found a good home. It's incredible how warm a dog can make a home that was once desolate. If you have ever had the fortune of owning a pet, you understand the strong attachment you have with one. You protect them, provide for them, and love them despite being unable to converse. You can see a dog's emotions just from its body language, and the dog comforts you when he/she realizes you're distressed. It's an amazing feeling to have such a unique bond to an animal that is so pure (like all creations), and views you as immaculate despite your imperfections. Unfortunately, you have probably had to endure difficult times of struggling health, senescence and inevitable death. It's this period of such great love followed by emptiness that is so hard to bear. Like any relationship, it is when there is a strain that you discover the true colours of those involved and discover everyone's true emotions. I once heard a story of a young boy saying that humans need more time in this world because they need to learn how to love and then reciprocate. Dogs on the other hand are born into the world already knowing how to love and that is why they don't need to live as long. Although I agree with the little child, I would also add that the pain that a pet would endure if its owner passed away would be unbearable. I wished there was a way to offer Hachi solace and tell him everything would be okay. I wish for a lot of things. Hachi was a loving dog who was saved by Parker. He's no ordinary dog...none ever are.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Some criticize the movie for being a bit too cliché. They wrote, that people who would care so much for the dog, that feel so much sympathy and compassion for him, would probably not exist. I don't know, if it's true. But watching this movie makes you hope, that they are wrong. It gives the watcher hope and warmth. And at least as long as the movie lasts, you are part of a wonderful world.It is a movie, which - without any doubt from my side - is worth 10 stars.

100,RobLuvsTheMountains,tear jerker,7,28 August 2019,"This is an entertaining movie and a real tear jerker. The problem is the writing. The writing suffers trying to make a 1930's Japanese true story into an American modern story. Most people probably wouldn't make the kinds of choices the people make in this movie. As a result there are some things in the plot that just don't work and it's no coincidence that it's the same plot lines that didn't actually happen. For instance, how is it that the Joan Allen character does not know that Hachi is no longer living with her daughter, that he is living under a train and being fed by local business owners, and that every day he waits at his special spot for Daddy to come back? This scene, where she finds out that Hachi is doing this, is supposed to be very touching but it was ruined b/c I couldn't believe that the daughter has not told her any of this. After all, 10 years has passed and the daughter lives nearby. Why the mother had to move away is not explained and seems odd. In spite of the movies flaws I would still say it is worth a watch. Unlike other viewers, I don't think there are ""lessons"" in this movie, however, I did shed a tear at the end. I was touched in spite of the bad writing.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

102,prolelol,Easily one of the saddest movie I've ever seen in my life since The Notebook,10,29 November 2015,"I found the saddest movie I've ever seen after a year. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is sad, strongly emotional and beautiful movie. Hachi is a movie which is based on a true story about the dog in Japan, Hachiko.Hachi was a lost little dog at the station, but a man named Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) found him. At home, he cared for him all the time and learned him a lot things. But after a year, Hacki is a smart dog, he often walk with Parker to the station because he couldn't be without Parker. Hachi at the station always waiting for him to finish his job (he knows when he finish) and come to home with Hachi. But for a moment, Parker isn't returned anymore, it happened unbelievable about the dog Hachi after he didn't returned. This movie will show you a strong feelings. Strongly recommend for everyone!

I do cry in really sad movies when the acting is that good that it affects you and makes you think its real. This is probably the first time I ever cried about a movie about a dog. I am an animal lover, Ive always had dogs. Looking into their eyes let me see how they feel. Hachi did just that and my heart broke for him when I watched him waited for his owner every single day. I understood exactly why he needed to do this. My son is almost 9 and hes never cried about any movie before. This one made him sobbed til he went to bed.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
106,kuciak,three reviews in one,8,30 September 2010,"This is a wonderful film. Yes, it is rated G, but it is a G with a lot of substance. If you have ever had a dog before, and know what it is to have love for a dog, it will certainly bring back memories, and thoughts, as it did for me. It is a bit of a tear jerker, I almost had tears, and my girl friend certainly did. Other people elsewhere have written how they were very moved. I could not understand how someone seeing this film would not be moved.The film I believe did not have much of a release in the US, and appears to me now to be discovered on DVD in the US, appearing to have had more of a release in England and Japan, am I wrong? Had the film been widely seen, I believe that lot of people would probably want to be visiting the locations of the film in Road Island. The photography of the film is really first rate. Their are wonderful performances, Richard Gere is very believable as a dance and music teacher, and it is real nice to see Cary Togawa in a film (a very much underused talent I think, I remember seeing him in a film with Ali McGraw that took place in Thailand, and how his performance really made what would have been a dismal film more interesting). A must see film.My second review is not about the film, but about some of the critical paid reviewers who have slammed this movie. They appear to be primarily from Great Britain, and I don't mean to insult the British, as many of the readers of these reviews in Britain have slammed the Critics who just have to hate this movie. I thought I was cynical, but at least I have some heart, what do some of these reviewers have. They just can't believe that Richard Gere could do this film, but for goodness sakes, he is an actor. See the film first, and then go read the reviews that you can find from some of these ""so called movie experts"", either hear at IMDb, or at Mrqe.com, simpily amazing.Finally I do have a quibble with the film. The film for me somewhat gets hurt when you realize that this film is really not the true story. The real story, as the film in the end lets us know, took place in Japan from 1923 to 1934, not in the recent years in the US. Kaneto Shindo, the screenwriter and director of that version made in 1987 is credited in this film. We in the US, have not had access to that film. Perhaps the Gere produced film will be shown to be the superior film, perhaps not. I have never known a film to be made, which is based on something that did happen, but has been moved to a different locale. Some who have seen the original Japanese film have had some criticism, preferring the Japanese version. I believe it was the trailer for the film, that said it was based on a true story, but never have I known to have a film based on a true story to have its locale changed. Gere's produced film somewhat become disingenuous. While I have been moved by the film I have just seen, I am also bothered because of what I know. I wonder what they have thought in Japan.Perhaps Gere's produced will spark interest in people to see the Shindo 87 film, and get a wider release outside of Japan. Had the film made in 87 been released in the US earlier, would the Gere's film have been made? I would suggest that it would not have been. I wonder how well this film, so much loved by people now, will be viewed in the future. I have difficulties in expressing my disappointment in what the producers of Gere's film did, perhaps anyone who reads my thoughts here will understand my feelings, and have some similar disappointment. I guess one could say, I have seen a wonderful film with Richard Gere, yet feel somewhat like I have been had.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

110,ddelamaide,"Dog is fantastic, Richard Gere is wonderful",10,28 July 2020,"Hachi, the dog, of course, steals this show, which I've now seen several times. Presumably there are at least three dogs involved playing the puppy, the mature Hachi, and old Hachi. They are all fantastic. What strikes me every time, though, is Richard Gere's performance. I've not been a big fan of Gere's over the years, since seeing American Gigolo when it was first released. But he is so natural in this film and so clearly having real fun with Hachi, that it is a totally winning performance. Two small points in the Plot Summary: Carl did not teach Hachi to fetch. Rather, as Ken said, Hachi would fetch when it meant something, so the only time he fetched the ball was when he was trying to keep Parker from going to work, mysteriously knowing what was going to happen. Secondly, describing Joan Allen as a bossy, jealous wife kind of misses the point. Many couples decide against having a dog because one of them objects, and in fact she is won over when she sees how happy Hachi makes her husband.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
111,ayaan-bretmitchell,Beautiful. Saddest movie if all time.,10,13 December 2020,"Firstly I love dogs. All dogs are devastatingly loyal (maybe not as much as Hachi) but still. I'm so glad Richard Gere brought a normal caring man/dog personality to the screen. As most of us act like this around our pets as they're definitely one of the family.I could tell this was going to be a sad film after the first 10 minutes. Literally I felt like every 10 minutes I kept saying ""aah bless him"" with how he was. The dogs facial expressions were so real also. Anyway I loved the close knit community vibe and the early bonding of Gere & Hachi.Going into the second half, omg this really isn't a film you can watch outside of your home. It's devastatingly sad. I was crying as I was eating and as soon as you see Parker's wife see the dog after 10 years I was sobbing hard. Why did they never consider a dog has feelings too? Why not let Hachi visit Parker's grave? They could see he was deeply grieving. The daughter gave Hachi a choice, but still check on him once in a while poor thing. My heart was just dying. Someone please just care for this dog...could Mrs Wilson literally not wait a few more years to move (at least until after Hachi died). I could go on. After seeing him after all those years, don't just leave him and go home!When you saw the food vendor guy start weeping set me off again. This movie is painful to watch. You could never watch it twice but it's nice to keep it in my collection.When you see Hachi and his sad face before he dies too. On his own with no one caring for him. Just writing this I'm getting upset. Someone else pointed out that 9/10 years is so freaking long omg. He came out in all weathers. Why couldn't someone ANYONE just take him to his master's grave so he got closure?Anyway it's a great movie. And it does sum up a dog's love for his owner BEFORE anything else like relationship love, family love etc etc. This film was about how much Hachi loved his master and was willing to sacrifice his whole life for. Bless him.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
112,Jerominator,He just wanted to play fetch,8,2 August 2013,"I'm going to keep this short.I would normally steer clear of this kind of film as I find the saccharine formula hard to swallow. But this got such good reviews that I checked it out despite my better judgement.I've got to say that up to about the halfway mark I was regretting my decision and I was getting a little tired of the perfect family, pleasantville, schmaltzy overdose. And while that still kind of grates on me on some level, it really just serves as a set up for the rest of the movie(the important part) so try not to be put off by that and hang in there, safe in the knowledge that the story only really gets interesting in the 2nd half.I still don't entirely understand why this kind of thing is so touching but clearly it just is and I was crying like a baby by the end of it.

This movie is so engaging emotionally that we forget a;; the missing plot points. What was the mysterious loss in the master's household? Who was gone? Who really sent the puppy to the picturesque U.S. suburbs? (And how did the professor afford so much house on his salary?) But no matter. We are taken in by the pure joy of the unshakable affection between man and dog. More meat on the human bones would have helped me as a viewer, although I suspect that others would be just fine with the film as is.

118,p-seed-889-188469,Surprisingly better than the original,7,28 February 2015,"Having now seen and reviewed) the original 1987 Hachiko Monogatari I have come back to this remake with fresh eyes and an upwardly revised opinion. While I still believe this movie in no way reaches the true potential of the ""story"" I think it at least matches and may even exceed the quality of the original.Perhaps of greatest surprise to me are the choices the director made in what he took from and what he rejected from the original story. He has moved the story from 1920's Tokyo to 2000's small town America, and this is not an unreasonable choice. However once the link with the original Japanese story has been so fundamentally severed the world is your oyster as far as story details go so having made that choice it does seem a little perverse to make the dog not just Japanese but an Akita, as in the original. The essence of Hachiko is essentially a love story between a dog and his master, and it matters not one whit if they are in Japan or America, if the master is a Professor of agricultural engineering or of music, or a street cleaner for that matter. It does not matter if the dog is an Akita, a Pekinese or a Great Dane. What is pivotal is the portrayal of a credible relationship between the dog and his master, and to achieve this the casting of both man and dog is absolutely paramount. The Akita is a magnificent animal but if these two movies are any indication it has a stoic personality that presents a challenge to a filmmaker who has only 90 minutes to bring the character to emotional life. Presumably the Japanese market for whom the original was intended knows this personality and compensated for it. In this American version the director cunningly introduces a Japanese character who is able to inform the viewer of the Akita's character, which somewhat mitigates and explains the dog's relatively passive behaviour, but nevertheless it still would have been nice to see a greater level of visible connection between the dog and his master.As I indicated in my other review the conundrum of this story is how to present it without inferring at least some hint of abandonment on the part of the master's family. I think this version does a better job of this than the original, and certainly the character of the Master's daughter and her partner are far more sympathetic than the original, although there is still some lingering unease as to how a dog can remain essentially a stray within the community for a decade or so. In both movies the subplot of neither wife not really wanting the dog is totally unnecessary and simply wastes precious time that should have been devoted to developing the personalities and relationships of the dog his master.Richard Gere is not called upon to do much before he pops off but never the less does a great job. He presents a far more consistently sympathetic character than his counterpart in the original, although to be fair his Japanese counterpart is saddled with having to exist in the less relaxed context and culture of 1920's Japan. It has to be said the director's conception of a music professor as someone who plays music with all the sophistication of three blind mice for beginner piano, and who supervises very strange dances is more than a little naive. We also have to suspend credibility in the first 10 minutes in which Hachiko makes his way from Japan to a small American town – like people always send puppies randomly half way across the world in a rickety kennel with no documentation, no quarantine, no nothing, right? And they are routinely dumped on top of carts of luggage and accidentally dropped by people who seem to be deaf and blind...why did they even bother with this part of the story? This a waste of time that could have been better used to develop the man/dog relationship. In summary a solid if not magnificent re-telling of the Hachiko story and probably as good as can be achieved while sticking to the Japanese framework.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

120,Davidon80,Imagine a really long commercial for life insurance or dog food.,4,31 May 2021,"A small pup is taken in by a music professor and the two form an unshakable bond that stops at the train platform.Based on the legend of Hachiko, which is pretty much the same story based in Tokyo. The legend itself is so famed there is a much frequented statue at Shibuya station of Hachiko, which has becomes the famed meeting spot for Tokyoites out on the town. I've been to this spot many times in the center of Tokyo and such is the popularity of the exit that exit 8 is now named Hachiko exit (exit 8). It's a great story and when hearing it it does encapsulate the bond between man and animal.Now to Hachi: A dogs tale, the Richard Gere movie set ina small town in America which follows the same story. The first question is, why America? It's a quintessential Japanese tale which has its own movie, tv show and statue dedicated to it, so to repackage it as an American tale seems a little unnecessary, but, so it goes. Then to my next point, not much is dedicated to actually telling the story of Hachiko and his master, we don't see much beyond the daily walks, sure we can infer that the two have a bond, but the story unfolds very literally, with time just passing and dog and man in hot step with one another, I'm sure dog owners will tell me that is all you need to form a bond with an animal, but it makes for god awful story telling. Finally, there is the overall glibness of it all. No one can argue that the story itself is not teething with melancholy, but this seems to wallow in the sadossphere before events have even begun, with a score that constantly screams foreboding and lost, single of keys on a piano and a violin constantly trying to make you feel invested in a story, about a real story.Sometimes I despair at IMDB for its wild variations in rankings, with those in one camp going 10 and those on the other giving a 1. Well for once I sympathize with those on the other scale. This movie makes me want to give the 1 score just to balance out the meter, because it is ranked so high on IMDb that it found its way on the 250 list...But I digress, I give the scores it deserves, somewhere between a 5-6 and if I had a dog it may go to a 7, but in truth, 1 is not totally inappropriate.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

One day, Gere never comes home on the train, but Hachi still goes there to wait for him for many years.This movie was based on a true story. The real dog and owner were from Japan in the 1930's. Gere says on the DVD feature that he cried when he read the script. I did also, and so will you if you see this very touching story. It is a story of love and loyalty. It probably got lost amongst all the other big budget films in the cinema but it should not be missed on DVD. If this movie doesn't make you cry, nothing will.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
125,adarshkrockz,The gem 💎,10,22 August 2021,One among the best movie I've ever watched in my life. Can't finish this movie without dropping a tear. Wondered while knowing it's based on true story. Hatsoff to the whole team.,Hachi - A Dog's Tale
126,speedy-droid,A Decent Interpretation of a True Story,7,1 September 2015,"I am struck deeply by the tale of Hachiko. Yes... My ID here on IMDb is based upon the story of Hachiko -- But let me be clear -- it is NOT based upon this film. I have reviewed many films prior to reviewing this one, here on IMDb, using my ""Hachi Ko"" ID. I feel that I can review this film objectively.First of all, after reading all of the accounts of the Real story of Hachiko, I can confidently say that this film is a decent story in its own right, but it is a Very Loose interpretation of the tale of the real Hachiko. It is, for all practical purposes, a Work of Fiction.""Hachi"", the film, barely works as a 1.5-hour film. I did enjoy watching it, but it's not worth a second look. The film is essentially a 1.5-hour melodrama that appears to have the sole purpose of making dog-lovers cry. There is very little in the way of a real plot in this film. The same instrumental music playing over and over and over again throughout the entire film doesn't help.With that said, I'm not going to pretend that I know how the film could have been better. Most likely, it probably just wasn't a good film story to begin with, and should have just been left alone.Basically, an empty-nest guy stumbles upon a dog, and falls in love with the dog, which also falls in love with him. The guy's wife gets jealous of the dog, but before that jealousy can become a serious plot issue, the guy suddenly dies of a freak aneurysm. Then, the dog waits for him at the train station for several years, until the dog finally dies. I'm not trying to make fun of the story. My point is that there is only so much that you can do with that information. Just getting this film to 90 minutes was a stretch. This story was better left on paper.A few points that were brought up regarding flaws in the plot, by some of those who commented earlier:1) 'The dog only went back to the station for the food that the station vendors were giving him.' Actually, in the true story, in Japan, the vendors initially hated the dog and shooed him away for awhile. Eventually, however, they began to respect the dog's loyalty, and began feeding him.2) 'In the film, no one in the family seemed to realize that when the dog disappeared, he was waiting at the train station.' Well, the guy's wife was the only one in the family who would have known that, and she supposedly hated the dog. She certainly didn't want to go retrieve the dog, and she didn't talk about the dog with her daughter.3) As for the dog... Is it loyalty or obedience? Akita Inu are known for their ""loyalty"" and strict ""pack mentality."" If the guy was the ""Alpha"", then the dog would have waited out of Fealty as much as out of Loyalty. Since none of us is a dog, we can't know for sure exactly which emotion drives a dog to be loyal. I have my opinions, but they are just that... Opinions.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
127,paiello-44319,I wanted to like it more but couldn't,6,7 March 2021,"With an impressive IMDB rating of 8.1 my son and I had high expectations for this film but I must say up until the end of the second act almost nothing happens. Also there are VERY FEW laughs which is sort of expected when you watch a dog movie.
The ending of the move is foreshadowed in the first 10 minutes so you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to kind of figure out approximately where we are headed. There are a lot of formulaic scenes strung together to show the relationship growing closer between Richard Gere's character and Hachi. I don't know why Richard Gere has lost his appeal but he's not a believable lead here. Joan Allen is fine as always. The dog is wonderful but the plot just struggled and then the end was a tear jerker.
I think what gets people is what saves so many movies - the sound track which is gorgeous.

129,mikeburdick,"Inoffensive dog film, recommended for kids",6,3 August 2019,"Lasse Halstrom has made some lovely films over the years, such as ""My Life as a Dog"" and ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" While ""Hachi"" is a nice and decent film, it just lacks anything to make it special.The storyline is designed to pull the heartstrings, which it does, sort of, in an extremely predictable way. However, when it comes to character development and dialogue, it has all the depth of an after-school special. Between the small talk and unrealistically perfect lives of the characters, there's hardly a genuine moment.And despite the built-in emotionally charged subject matter, it manages to have very little drama or tension, even where there ought to be. Even the most dramatic moment in the film is telegraphed by a Richard Gere soliloquy that gives away what's about to happen.The worst aspect, I found, was the lack of any reality when it comes to animal care. It's as if no one involved in the film has ever owned or cared for a dog, and picked up all their knowledge from watching Chaplin movies or something.It's not a terrible film, but I'd recommend it to parents who want to share a film with their young kids that has a heart and can teach them some empathy. Probably too sappy for adults, unless you prefer your films really shallow.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

133,Davor_Blazevic_1959,Unprecedented loyalty in a story of age-old friendship,9,4 January 2010,"Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachikō Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It's a story that will go to every dog lover's heart - and everyone else's!I don't think I've cried so much during any other movie - ever.The film is, of course, based on a true story, which happened in the 1920s in Japan. The great thing about this movie is that Lasse Hallström resisted the temptation to make it ""more exciting"" by adding hard-to-believe scenes. The whole film thus comes across as very believable, and one gets the feeling that the bond between Hachi and his master is absolutely real. Richard Gere does a fine job there indeed.For me, he is in fact one of those actors that are like expensive wine: They're getting better with age. I was never very fond of him in the 90s, but his performances in ""Hachi"" or ""Shall We Dance"", for instance, I find outstanding and extremely believable.But anyone watching this film is advised to keep a box of tissues handy, as I cannot think of anyone who would not need them!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The wife finds the dog at the end of the film, aged and still mourning his owner, she hugs him and weeps and then she too leaves(abandons ) him. Does any dog lover think that these are appropriate actions? To see this poor animal, every winter sleeping under a train in the cold/ frost and ice is very upsetting. Yes, for the emotional tug of the story it works, but totally inappropriate to treat an animal like this. If a spouse was so upset at the loss of their partner, and they wanted to haunt the railway station for the rest of their life to be linked to their lost spouse would you let them do it? To put it in human terms the animal was traumatized and needed love, care and attention. They should have taken him to the train station at the time of the professor's daily arrival and then taken him home, loved him, and made him comfortable. But these people just abandoned him. I admit at the end I was sobbing, but I also was very angered, by this story. Poor Hachi...",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it, I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog, I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.., definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen.

144,The_Film_Auditor,Was this written by a 50-year-old hack?,6,22 August 2018,"I was surprised at how poorly written Hachi: A Dog's tale was. This film felt like a made-for-TV Hallmark movie that was written by a 50-year-old. The dialog and many of the scenes were very cliche and stale (ex: the skunk scene), making it hard not to roll your eyes while watching. The writing was also very emotionally manipulative, using a puppy's cuteness and other overly dramatic elements to play the audience. Another one of the major issues I have with this film is the pacing. There were many story elements that I felt should have been cut, and others seemed to happen too quickly. It also did not help that the film was missing a climax. The one moment that could have been the climax of the film took place a little over halfway through and felt abrupt, which I thought was an odd choice. Really, this film should have been much shorter; maybe like a 30 minute short. That would have helped with the pacing and left more of an emotional impact.If you look past the stale writing, the technical aspects of the film are good. I really enjoyed some of the cinematography and visual choices that were made. I particularly enjoyed that all of the Hachi point of view shots were in black and white. This helped distinguish the dog's perspective, allowing the audience to understand Hachi's emotions better. Another aspect of the film I thought was done exceptionally well was the score. The composer's usage Japanese influences and the piano made for a very beautiful and captivating score.Overall, I have mixed feelings about the film. On one hand, the dog is very cute and fun to watch at times, but on the other hand, the film is rather depressing poorly written. For these reasons, I don't think I would recommend this film.The Good

145,Attila_the_gorilla,Spoilers below,6,29 July 2010,"Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing.

I'm sure that with time, it will render enormous props evermore as others learn of the tale of Hachi, the dog who waited for almost a decade at the train station for his dead owner to return. The Japanese dog depicted in this true story has an actual monument in his honor for the impenetrable loyalty he bestowed to his master. Hachi and owner shared a mutual bond beyond description. We should all be so lucky to have unconditional love from someone, or in this case, a dog. Richard Gere was key to making sure this movie was even made as one of the producers. He also ensured it was done right, as he played the leading role. The film was superbly directed as well. Kudos to all for bringing this story to life.

Perhaps the coldness of human feelings in real life makes the pure and sincere feeling embodied in this film more precious.

149,Sam Sloan,This Movie Needs To Be Shown Wherever Dogs Are Eaten,10,13 March 2017,"Yes, I cried and I could simply write another review saying I did what everyone else did who watched this movie but I want to add something else no one has mentioned. This was a true story of a dog that had lived and died in 1934 with the last ten years of its life spent at a train station waiting for his deceased owner to return who never can in this life, but only in the next. And that reunion will leave you in tears, not only for the happy and deserved reunion between Hachi and his owner, but anyone we have loved and lost and imagined and hoped awaited them. But if the reunion in our next life only exists between humans, I for one would be sorely disappointed not to have my own pets I have loved and lost and awaiting me at a place some have called the rainbow bridge. But this reunion between Hachi and his owner takes place where he has loyally and patiently awaited for ten years through cold and warmth, rain and snow. At the end of the movie we learn the true Hachi was a dog named Hachiko that lived in Japan. A statue of the dog has been placed there in a pose sitting and waiting as he had been seen for the last ten long years of his life, living for no other purpose than to reunite with the person he loved. I am often sent letters from animal rights groups asking me to help stop the dog meat trade in East Asia, Korea especially. I have been to Korea and and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I could only stay away from the markets I knew where it was going on to shield my eyes from something I knew I couldn't change. The practice I've heard seems to be dying out as a new generation shows a greater affection for dogs and an inclination for fast food, though the practice still exists with an estimated three million dogs each year being killed and eaten. It is in such places this movie needs to be shown. It would be a wonderful legacy for Hachiko if his loyalty and devotion could be rewarded by helping to change how dogs are treated not only in East Asia but everywhere in the world.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Hachi: A Dog's Tale, which is based on a true story originally taking in place Japan, shows a emotional tale. The movie is a simple story of a dog and his beloved owner. What makes this film strong is that the owner is Richard Gere, a highly credited actor who once again did a great job in this movie. Another strength is that Gere is supported by many great supporting actors and actress, Jason Alexander of Seinfeld being one of them, who all together played their roles great and making this tale a masterful film. Hachi the dog is one overly cute Akita, portrayed by 3 different dogs (different time lines of the film) all trained well. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is truly the best representation of loyalty, love and happiness. No matter how sad you feel, a dog like Hachi will make you feel more happy than a billionaire.

151,wbafanclub12,Superbly made,8,30 March 2010,"I find myself giving this film a lower vote than it probably deserves and perhaps through no fault of the film itself. Let me explain. I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET.

There were only a few films that managed to cause tears in my eyes but for a few minutes I simply could not stop the tears.
From the beginning of the film until before the scane Hachi takes the ball and runs to the train station to bring it to the professor, it's pretty mediocre film, although whoever sees him a second time can cry even in this part.
From this scane, this movie is awesome ,brought tears to my eyes, I really couldn't stop the tears. The moment that broke me most of all is to see old Hachi walk very slowly and reach his permanent position under the abandoned train where he died.

157,jtana1,Great story,5,8 February 2020,"It's a pretty movie with a wonderful love between a man and his dog, but a score of 8 is too much for a film that is somewhat repetitive in the sequences. Yes, the dog is a charm and friendship with its owner is endearing however that was the whole story that at various times declines to be the same again and again.No doubt animals, especially dogs, is one of God's most beautiful creations.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
158,fino134,True Story..True Friendship,8,3 August 2018,"Mmm..I don't know what to say!! The story is so simple, appears to be ideal, but it's true. It is a story about pure love, friendship and loyalty that touches you in more than a scene. Really, there is no need for a movie to be complicated to enjoy it. ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" narrates the story of the statue of Hachiko which stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. I've always heard this story as an example for loyality, but never believed it, dunno why. Back to the movie, it is a bit slow paced, despite its short running time. Actually, I found this slow pace as an advantage, make you feel how deep the relation between the dog and its owner(friend). What deepens this feel is the soundtrack which fits the scenes perfectly-in my view. Cinematography is good too. I have nothing to add as it is so simple as I mentioned before, but one last thing; a special recognition to the dog. I wonder how he acts to be like crying(not kidding). Now, am planning to watch the original(Japanese)version, but this one is worth seeing.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The film really captures the quirks and character of Hachiko, and takes you through his whole life, and it's so beautiful and emotional, I don't think you can get through this one without at least shedding a few tears, and for that, I think this film gets a full on 5 stars, even though it's not a perfect film if you'd go into the specifics. The only issues one might have with this film is the human aspect, because you aren't really too bothered with that, but it didn't and still doesn't take away from the film for me.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Im a dog lover so i knew there would be a chance of liking it. Well!!! This was one of the best movies I've ever seen showing how the friendship/love between a dog and its owner ever. I struggled to keep myself from crying as the story unfolded and we see how this remarkable dog idealizes its owner with unconditional love. Just the thought that this is a true story makes it so heart warming and if the whole world would treat each other with the love/respect as a dog does for its owner we would so much better off.I think anyone that loves dogs/pets should definitely see this as its the BEST movie especially of its type I've ever seen..,Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Only a dog owner can understand the vibes/connection/mutual understanding between him and his dog 3. I gave it 9 points as the movie is different from the true story. The true story is more touching. 4.Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. Never felt like he was acting. Actually i was surprised to see him working in this movie.By his acting ,he added that extra touch to the movie along with the DOG. 5. You may find it weird, but the acting of the dog was remarkable... i mean ... if i had to give points in acting ..then the DOG will earn more points than Richard Gere. Yes ,the DOG acted in this movie rather than jump from one wall, kicking football or doing those crazy Home Alone tricks. 6.This movie is completely powered with acting performance by the DOG and Mr.Richards. They are the soul of this movie.7. Good work done by the Station Master and the Hot Dog Man. 8. Half the credit should go to the director Mr.Lasse Hallström ,as he has put a lot of hard work in getting those perfect expression of the dog and also captured those special moments between the owner and the dog.Summary – I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good.

It is based on the true story of a Japanese dog's unrelenting and beautiful loyalty to his owner.The only movie I've ever cried and still cried before I watched this film was Lilo & Stitch. But this one... left me crying for the last 30 minutes! The script is that good!! It builds up perfectly.Props must also be given to the people in charge of picking the music or composing it. The score is about 50% the reason the film is so sad. The beautiful music is there for every heartwarming moment and it never disappoints.The acting also very good. Heck, even the one who sells hot dogs is good and Richard Gere is ASTOUNDING as the dog owner.Perfect direction, heartbreaking story and also beautiful acting and music all combine to make this movie one of the best, saddest (and most importantly, entertaining) movies I've seen in a long time.10/10 Amazing!!

By exploiting just about every human's love and affection for animals and personal experiences with their own pets. Yes, this movies is well filmed, well acted, and effective in tightening the audiences throat. But let's not forget that this is a film, and there is no plot or dialogue here - nothing happens. What does happen is a perfect idea for a 1 minute heart-warming TV adver. Instead it is stretched to movie length.

Hallström's unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques – dog's eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames – to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutt's loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout.

This is a great true story. And I would hate to think that the real owners of Hachiko treated him with such disregard. But what shines through even in this shallow version,, is that a house, and all of our possessions are nothing compared to love, loyalty, and friendship of a beautiful dog like Hachiko. Too bad they didn't go for something with more substance. I would someone would do this story justice. Never was there a better dog story than this.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

169,MajorFilmFan,A remarkable tale of undying devotion.,10,10 December 2010,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale never got a US release, which is quite sad. This is a very heartwarming movie, that is VERY mature, despite it's G rating. There is no language, violence, sex, or drug content in this film. Just pure, raw, emotion.Hachi is loosely based on a true story. A professor in Japan in the 1920s discovered a Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopted him. One day, the man had a heart attack at work and died. The dog, named Hachiko never figured this out, and waited for his master to return every day for 10 years.Replace Japan with northern Maine, the 1920s with the 1990s, and add Richard Gere, and you have Hachi.Prof. Parker Wilson (Gere) discovers an Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopts him. His wife Cate, is not exactly keen to the idea of having a dog, but Parker's daughter falls madly in love with this sweet puppy. Through learning more about Akitas through his Japanese friend (Akitas are a Japanese dog breed), Parker and Hachi form a wonderful bond. Then, unexpectedly, Parker, a music professor, has a heart attack while he's teaching, and dies. Hachi never figures this out, and, so every day for 10 years, Hachi makes the trek to the local train station to wait for his master, who he believes will one day return. This is a WONDERFUL movie that is quite sad. As I stated earlier, this is not exactly something to show to younger kids, despite it's G rating. I am 16, and I bawled my eyes out. This movie is a MUST for any dog lovers.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
170,dostan-85075,Boring....,10,15 October 2019,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a 2009 English drama film. Based on the true story of a faithful Akita Inu, the titular Hachiko, it is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, written by Stephen P. Lindsey and Kaneto Shindo, and stars Richard Gere, Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer. The film is a remake of the 1987 Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari.
""A Dog's Tale"" is based on a true story of the love and devotion between a man and a dog.The story is told by Ronnie who is the man's grandson. When Ronnie has to give a presentation at school about a personal hero, he chooses to tell the story of his grandfather's dog Shasta unnu (""Hachi"" for short). Despite his classmates laughing, Ronnie describes how his grandfather, Professor Parker Wilson, finds a lost puppy which had been freighted to the United States from Japan but was accidentally left at the train station of the professor's small hometown. The professor ends up taking the puppy home, planning to search out its intended destination and send it on to its rightful owner. However the puppy's owner cannot be found and Parker and the puppy begin to form a close bond. Although Parker's wife, Cate, is opposed to keeping the puppy she eventually relents after realising the bond between Parker and Hachi.Over the next year or so Parker and Hachi become even closer. Parker tries to train Hachi, a Japanese breed of dog called an Akita, but the dog refuses to do normal dog things like chasing and fetching. One morning Parker leaves for work and Hachi follows him to the train station and refuses to leave without his master causing Parker to abandon the train to take the dog home. The next day Hachi follows Parker again who this time gets on the train. When Parker returns to the train station after work he is surprised to find Hachi waiting for him. Hachi learns what time that Parker will be due home every day and constantly goes to the station to wait for him at 5:00pm, quickly becoming their new daily routine.One winter's day, Parker suffers a fatal and unexpected brain hemorrhage while at work and thus never returns home on the train as usual. Hachi, waiting in his usual place for Parker as the train pulls up, doesn't see his master disembark, and instead patiently waits and waits for hours even as it starts snowing. Eventually Parker's son-in-law, Michael, comes to get him. Although everyone tries to make Hachi understand that Parker has gone, Hachi is apparently unable to accept that his master won't be coming home. Instead he returns to the train station each day and continues to wait.As time passes, Cate sells the house and moves away. Hachi is sent to live with Parker and Cate's daughter Andy, her husband Michael, and their baby Ronnie. However Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station. There he sits at his usual spot. Andy arrives and takes him home but soon realises how sad the dog is, especially as he even refuses to eat. It breaks her heart but she slowly opens the gate knowing Hachi will return to the station. Each and every day Hachi waits for his best friend. As night falls, he sleeps in the rail yard. The hot dog seller, Jasjeet who knew the professor well, becomes fond of Hachi and provides him with food and water on a daily basis.On the tenth anniversary of Parker's death, Cate returns to the small township to visit her late husband's grave. She is stunned to see a now very elderly Hachi still waiting at the station. Overcome with grief Cate sits and waits for the next train with him. At home, Cate tells the now ten-year-old Ronnie about Hachi. Meanwhile the ever-faithful dog continues waiting until one day he is seen laying very still in the snow, comforted by a vision of Parker who appears and lovingly beckoning the dog to come to him.Ronnie concludes his story of why Hachi will always be his hero. Some of the students are close to tears - even those who had laughed at the beginning. After school Ronnie is met by his dad and a new puppy which they've also named Hachi. The film ends with Ronnie and the puppy walking down the same tracks where Parker and the original Hachi had met so long ago.The film ends with the true story of Hachiko. He was the pet of Professor Ueno. After Ueno's death in 1925, Hachiko waited for his master for nine years at the Shibuya station. A bronze statue was erected in his honour at the Shibuya station.(Plot from Wikipedia, because I did not watch this movie:)
About the plot of Hachiko I know only from the lips of my friends and also social sites. So I was very interested in this film firstly and started to watch with my friend, after 20 min we became very bored, so just cannot watch it till the end.
So to sum up, It all depends on the person and his interest in something, but for me it was very drearily.Madina(11 B)
Based on the true story of a loyal dog who stole the hearts of an entire nation, Hachiko: A Dog's Story is the Americanized version of an endearing Japanese legend. The film is directed by a Lasse Hallström, who is known for such small but significant films as Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, and The Shipping News. Richard Gere stars as Professor Parker Wilson, an American counterpart to Professor Ueno, with Joan Allen in the role of his wife Cate.Set in the past century ,the action takes place in northeastern U.S,production design by Chad Detwiller, art direction by Jordan Jacobs, and set decoration by Gretchen Schlottman have masterfully created the sense and feel of old Japan with western-style architecture. The plot revolves around Chu-ken Hachiko, which means ""loyal little dog Hachi,"" who had arrived in Tokyo in 1924 with his master, Professor Eisaburo Ueno, who had taken a position at the Imperial University. Still just a pup, Hachiko accompanied his master to Shibuya Station each morning, where the professor boarded the train that would take him to the university. Each afternoon at three p.m., Professor Ueno would find Hachiko in the same spot at Shibuya Station, anxiously awaiting his return.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story of great love and respect between a college professor and the puppy he rescues on a snowy night. It's a very gentle film that quickly engages the audience as it introduces a heroic dog, a man with a loving heart, and an idyllic setting. That engagement intensifies emotions, which later carry the story through the years to its bittersweet conclusion. A bonus is the superb soundtrack ""Goodbye"" that accomplishes the film and makes the viewer to burst into tears.This film is a masterpiece that encompasses pure friendship between human and animal, love and heart-touching stories. The film is suitable for all ages.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I knew dogs can be loyal, but Hachi is the most loyal dog I've ever seen. He's so beautiful and sweet. It makes me want a dog just like him (an Akita).I must admit this movie was sweet AND sad. I was ""ooing"" and ""ahing"" at the sweet moments and crying during the sad moments. Lasse Hallstrom is one of my favorite directors, and this movie is no exception. After seeing ""Marley and Me"" and really loving that movie, I decided to take a chance on ""Hachi"" and I'm so glad I did. I recommend it to any dog lover. You will love it.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
172,ilovelctr,A movie about friendship and loyalty that'd break you down into tears,9,25 July 2010,"First I don't always cry for movies and even if I do, I've never cried so bad like I did when watching this one.It told a story where a cute dog forms up a solid friendship with his master. And a huge twist, something that this kind of dog wouldn't learn to do, happens the day the two friends' (dog and master) fate is changed. Then something very touching and sad happens, which tells us the fact that true friendship and loyalty will never be broken.And so, why was I touched by this film? While a dog can always wait for his master no matter what happens, we people don't always have that much loyalty. Many of us can be a bit ""cold"", or in another word, forgetful at times. We can be forgetful about the happy times and bitter stuff that we've been through with our friends, our loved ones when we argue or fight for just some little occasional conflict for instance. We can be forgetful about those good moments when we pretend that we can't forgive our friends for certain small mistake just because we like to pretend to be serious sometimes. However, this story reminds us of the value of cherishing something that's more worthwhile than some trifles which could possibly break our friendship and loyalty to somebody.The movie is a small-budget one, and perhaps that's the reason why so many still haven't watched it. I highly recommend everyone watch it, even if you're not a dog lover. Actually I don't have a dog either.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Once I had to go away for a few months; I heard how sad she was, so I phoned and I sent home a shirt I'd worn, so she would know I was alive.She was the smartest dog I ever met. But she would never learn to fetch (sometimes she went to get it, but only if she wanted it, she almost never would bring it back), it seemed to me that she had too much dignity.I did always did everything I could to make hers the best life any dog ever lived; I knew how loyal she was, and returned every bit of it to her.That was 15 years ago.

Gere, who plays a married college music professor, falls in love with the beautiful Akita and raises it from a pup. The 2 form an extremely close bond and as Hachi turns about a year old, he begins following Gere to the train station everyday to see his owner off to work and returns everyday around 6pm to greet him back home. When the dog is about 3 years old, Gere suffers a fatal heart attack at work and never returns home. Hachi stays at the train station for THE NEXT NINE YEARS, thru summer heat, winter snow and rain, eating handouts from the train station employees (one of whom is played by Jason Alexander aka George Costanza from Seinfeld) with Gere's widow, played greatly by Joan Allen, trying her best to bring the dog home over the years, but Hachi relentlessly, yes DOGGEDLY returns each day to see his master come home, each day growing sadder and sadder to not see Gere get off the train...it's heartbreaking.I won't tell you how it ends, but it is a tear-jerker all the way, even as the credits roll.

I've watched plenty of sad movies about dogs, and I always cry, but this one impacted me the most. And I believe the only reason for it, is that this story is not made-up and not made from an existing book (that was also made-up). It actually happened in real life, long time ago. THAT is what kills me. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was depressed for literally 2 months after watching it. No movie has ever done that to me, and no movie ever will. You know that feeling when you experience something specific, and you just KNOW that nothing like that will ever happen again? Well, that's how I feel about this movie. This one is THE ONE. The one that no other movie can ever replace in shed tears and emotions I went through watching it.
Girls, guys - no matter how tough you think you are - you WILL cry watching this movie. If you don't...well...just means you have no emotions whatsoever.

This may sound very strange but it's true. The way the dog waited for his master every single day at the same time until he died is just heart breaking. All that hope of seeing his master was in vain until Hachiko was brought together with him after death, which is what I wanted to believe just to diminish the sadness I felt.It was so hurtful in the end that I felt like crying like a baby. After reading a few posts here for the movie, I found one thing common in all and that is how much everyone cried. It really is a tear jerker but a must see. I wouldn't just recommend people with pet dogs to watch it, but also people like me without pets. And not to mention, Hachi was a beautiful dog you are guaranteed to fall in love with him the moment he comes on screen as a little puppy. Over all, it was a simple film with all the lime light on Richard Gere and his dog and the rest, just background actors.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
183,ConallMcCormick,Overly Sentimental,4,19 January 2019,"Last June I watched an Indian film called: ""A Wednesday"" (5/10). A highly overrated film, it was one of many Bollywood films that annoyed many westerners with its presence in the top 250. I must say that, I too, believed that it was impossible that a western film of comparatively poor quality could ever be as overrated. In ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" I was proved ever so wrong. A below average (4/10) film, it is quite baffling as to why close to 217,000 voters collectively deem this as a ""great"" (>8/10) film with its current rating of 8.1 and placement in the top 250 since 2013.Naturally, I understand WHY people have overrated it in their thousands. It's an incredibly formulaic and overly sentimental film that ""only a snob"" or a ""complete cynic"" would turn their nose up at. It even features a cute and fluffy dog (which are admittedly very well trained). I feel I must say that I LOVE dogs- my dream dog is a husky and an Akita is certainly very similar- so it's not that I lack potential understanding. It's also based on a true story which somehow makes it more compelling.The fundamental problem I have with ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is the story itself. The story of Hachi, or indeed the real dog Hachiko, is not a unique incident. As a Scotsman, I am familiar with the story of the dog Greyfriars Bobby, from Edinburgh, who sat on his master's grave following his death. A cursory look on the internet will show many other dogs with similar stories. The premise just isn't that compelling or interesting. To retell this story in over two hours is excessive. The story itself is very limited; dog is adopted by kind master, master dies, dog waits at train station until it dies- THE END. It's very formulaic and lacks any compelling drama or events to add further weight and significance to the story. The subject would have been much better suited as a short film. When the concept of a faithful dog has already been masterfully handled in the ""Futurama"" episode ""Jurassic Bark"" (9/10) in the space of 23 minutes then can you really come back and say that this film is good or even great?!?The other critical problem for the film is its characters. Richard Gere plays Richard Gere. I like him, but he isn't really playing a role here other than himself; a nice middle-aged man, so his performance is limited as the character displays no range of emotion. As Parker Wilson, he finds a dog at his local train station and it is limply established that his wife Cate (Joan Allen) does not wish for Parker to adopt him. The problem here is that, within the space of perhaps two days, she ""concedes"" to keeping the dog. She offers barely any resistance to the notion and fails to have a truly significant experience to convince her. Afterwards, it doesn't really seem that his life has been majorly changed or enhanced by his newfound companion.Perhaps here I can offer some basic ideas to make the story far more compelling. Maybe Parker is a widower who (a grumpy, lonely hermit) is initially unreceptive and begrudging regarding his forced responsibility for the dog before, obviously, establishing a bond and emotional reliance with Hachi. It might be cliched, but it offers far more emotional investment than that which currently exists. The reader ought to remember that the crux of this movie HINGES on the relationship between the owner and the dog. With the relationship between Hachi and Parker as basic as it can be (that of an average dog owner) then your investment and perceived significance of that relationship will be severely limited. Compare this to the relationship between Fry and Seymour in ""Jurassic Bark"". You get to see the way that Fry and Seymour bond in simple yet endearing ways; Fry giving Seymour his pizza and singing ""Walking on Sunshine"" together. The relationship is made to be more significant considering that Seymour represents a link to Fry's lost life having been cryogenically frozen and revived 1000 years later. Ultimately, their relationship ends more tragically with Fry opting not to clone his old dog, believing him to have ""moved on"" from his absence, unaware of Seymour's persistent loyalty to him. In a character driven film, it is critical that this is explored as far, and as inventively, as one can when it is made to be the focus. ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" doesn't even attempt to do that.The extended characters also fail to make a real impact on the story with their lack of a real intimate relationship with Hachi (or with one another). Most feel like cardboard cut outs, mere scenery, and fail to make any impact on the story. Their only purpose is to make basic commentary like ""Hachi's a cute dog!"" and ""his situation is sad"". The problem here is that anyone could have made these comments and specific characters like Jasjeet (the hot dog vendor), Ken (Parker's Japanese friend) or Carl (the station manager) have no discernible personality other than being stock nice people. Perhaps most importantly, we fail to see the significance of Cate in the film either to Parker or Hachi. With Parker's death hitting both Hachi and Cate the hardest, shouldn't you provide focus to both and then attempt to bring the two together?Why not have Cate hate the dog until finally reconciling with him at the very end when she recognises his loyalty? Couple this with a MUCH more in depth look at Cate undergoing her own personal journey of bereavement and prevailing loyalty to the memory of her late husband. Why not have a shifty station manager who seeks to profit from the dog and use him for his own personal gain before Ken or Jasjeet intervenes? Again, simple cliched ideas but ones that would have added more depth or real CONFLICT and drama to the story.To its credit, the film has some decent cinematography and manages to flip the point-of-view from the humans and Hachi quite well. The story is made to be seen mostly from Hachi's perspective, as he is our main protagonist, and allows the viewer to empathise with him adequately. However, the technique behind capturing a dog's POV isn't exceptionally difficult and the idea is by no means novel. I also think that the Parker's daughter (Andy) had, perhaps, the best relationship with Hachi in the film. Andy wants to look after Hachi but instead allows him to carry out his desire to wait for his deceased master. Its rather basic, but it is like, in Hachi, Andy can let go and move on from her father's death with Hachi's departure.I will now talk about the smaller aspects of the film that I found truly cringe inducing. The soundtrack to the film is woefully poor. The ceaseless piano playing in the background feels like an obnoxious prodding stick to stir up false emotions in the viewer. I understand that Parker is piano player in the film, but this only acts as a tenuous link at best. Then there are the moments when it is made to look as if Hachi is aware of what is going around him. This includes when he randomly decides to try and play catch with Parker as well as when he licks Andy's hand before leaving her when she tells him that he can go if he wants. Again, coming across as a cheap attempt to draw emotion. Then there is the kid who tells Hachi's story just to add another cutesy element to the film. His inclusion is an odd one as he does not narrate the film and the order of events are not shown in a way as to adjust a third person overview of the events, rather the opposite as a more first-person view from namely Hachi and Parker's perspectives. The film, overall, seemed to be extremely self-aware about its following of its formulaic story as well as its attempts to draw emotion.Perhaps the best comment I can make is to explain just how and why ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" falls short to contemporary true-to-life films. The film ""Bicycle Thieves"" (8/10), is a film about a working-class man in post-war Italy whose bike is stolen. A film with a similarly simple premise, it is a deeply resonant time-capsule film that represented the plight of many Italians of the time. It featured non-actors who lent authenticity and several dimensions to their roles. Watching the increasing desperate father look to recover his bike, the source of his livelihood, and take care of his son is a tumultuous dramatic conflict that ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" simply doesn't have. ""Tokyo Story"" (7/10), is a film that I personally didn't enjoy but I recognised its objective value. It tells the story of an elderly Japanese couple who are neglected by their children. Its broader message was to stress the potential crisis of identity and loss of values Japan faced post-WW2. The best films represent something far greater than themselves. What does ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" represent that is of comparative significance or profundity to ""Bicycle Thieves"" or ""Tokyo Story""? ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" also compares unfavourably to more modest films like ""Marley and Me"" (5/10). That film manages to signify the importance of the dog Marley to the owners' family and demonstrates the conflict, as well as the changing positive and negative attitudes felt towards the dog by its owners. I am also quite incredulous when people talk about the ""tear-jerking"" nature of this film. It doesn't compare at all to incredibly tragic films like ""Schindler's list"", ""The Deer hunter"", ""Bicycle Thieves"" etc.For all my negative comments about the film I feel I must state outright that the film IS still competently made and most aspects of it are of decent quality. It's just that the film just doesn't have any real weight to it and that no individual component of the film is good. It's perfectly fine if ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is of real subjective value to you, a film that you have a love or an affection towards. I'm not telling you what you can like. However, I ask you to scrutinise its objective quality compared to similar films and really understand its limitations. I am asking you to recognise those limitations and to rate the film accordingly.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
184,Rahal97,Might be the saddest movie I have ever seen.,9,2 January 2017,"Sure, it is a very simple and a low budget movie that tells the story of a dog, but it is a very touching story that made most people cry even those who deny it. What makes Hachi that great is that it is a true story about everyone's favorite pet animal. It is a movie for all ages that everyone would enjoy. So simple but yet so touching and taught us the value of friendship and what loyalty actually meant.No movie ever made me sad as this one, not the Titanic, not Requiem for a Dream and not even Schindler's List! You might think I am exaggerating but that is the truth. Not saying that Hachi will make you more sad than the other movie and definitely not saying that it is better than legendary Schindler's List, but it is a powerful movie you can't disregard.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
185,cantsleepboutique,"""Born Free"" for the millenial generation",10,15 May 2019,"Back when I was a lad I had the good fortune to be born when the Disney studios still had Walt in charge.
Touching family movies like this were released every weekend. Stories about people and animals that made you optimistic that someday people would stop being cruel and indifferent and stupid.
This movie is based on a true story that happened in Japan in the early 20th century. The beautiful thing about that tidbit is it is proof that the human soul can be touched by gentility and decency no matter what land or people you are talking about.
My wife and I cried while watching the movie. The other times I cried in my life while watching a movie was Brian's Song (1971) The Elephant Man (1980) and Born Free (1966).
This movie will introduce you to the dignity of all complex creatures on this planet and anywhere else we may find them. We are the only species in the Universe that we know of that rejects our biological programming. Meaning, humans are cruel and possess few redeeming qualities. But in some weird twist of science and fate, we recognize we are the most defective species on Earth and strive not to be what/who we really are. Animals (Dogs, etc) are logical by comparison. They derive no pleasure from sadism or self-destruction the way people do. Are they better than us? Yes. Do we have more to learn from them, than they do from us? Yes.
All you have to do is be open to the learning, and the realization that wisdom comes from being the hero of your own life. And that requires elevating more than just yourself during your lifetime.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

187,alvispotter-1,Couldn't stop crying but i loved it,10,22 April 2010,"Hachiko wasn't a film i was expecting to see, due to the fact that here in Mexico the translation to Spanish sucked and the marketing did as well. But my brother had to see it for school, and i wasn't going to deny going to a dog's film. I love dogs, and i loved Marley and me with its drama, so i was expecting something like that. What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films. And this film exceeded both things. I recommend it, even though it's inevitable you are gonna cry",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
188,Paranoyia,Dumber than fiction...,1,7 September 2012,"I'll tell you right now what happened in this film. Spoilers or not, you should not care either way as not much happens in this film.Richard Gere finds and befriends a puppy. Puppy gets dependent on Richard Gere because all of his underdeveloped movie family are a bunch of indifferent, neglecting and sometimes even hating a-holes. Puppy turns into a mature hound, every day giving his farewell to and welcoming his owner back the only way he knows how: mainly following Gere to the train station and then waiting for him to return in the evening. Richard Gere gets a heart attack and dies. The dog does not and I emphasize - does NOT get invited to his master's funeral. Dog naturally assumes that Gere will come back one day, since he had seen nothing to prove otherwise. Dog keeps waiting for Richard at the train station. Dog dies of old age. The end.The moral of this story: always invite everyone close to the deceased to the funeral, that includes pet animals. One more thing: this movie is apparently based on the real events that happened in Japan almost a hundred years ago, which goes to show that reality can be a lot dumber than fiction.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

190,anupiya,Touching Story about Loyalty,10,30 April 2018,"If there ever was a movie about 'Loyalty"", this would be it. Well, 'Love' too.Based on a true story which took place in Japan in the 1920's, where today a monument has been erected to remind people that such loyalty matters, this is the story of the Akita dog named 'Hachiko', and his master, a professor who were inseparable since the day they met.Richard Gere plays the main role as Hachiko's master, and his character never takes over the viewer's attention from the lovable pet. In fact, one might think that the main character is played by the dog itself, which is quite true.I do not want to elaborate on the plot, but would only advise the readers of this review, that it is a must watch for people of all ages. It sure will remind us of how important the little time we have with our loved ones are, and to not take it for granted.Highly recommended!PS: You might want to watch this alone, if you do not want the folks around you to see that after all, you're not that tough as you pretend to be.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
191,rzervou,More love than one can take,10,27 October 2015,"When man leaves to forget, the dog stays there to remember. Hachiko had shown feeling of love that most of us, humans, are incapable of. It has shown that love knows no boundaries. An impressive tale, stuck in my mind for more than a month,that has so much to teach us. An americanized - Scandinavian version of the original, that even though portrays ideal behavior of the community in an idyllic setting, invades the inconscient with soft images, a subtle but slowly penetrating soundtrack and Richard Gere in maybe the best and more human role of his long career. I saw him at first as the sex idol in 'American Gigolo' and 'Breathless' and he marked my adolescence, but his mature self is far more enchanting.When God realized Man was far from perfect, he created dogs to counter - balance.The dog sight that dominates the movie which rolls in a very slow pace - as dogs' lives usually do - let us penetrate in Hachi's soul, and that ends up to be both devastating and deliberating. I feel at the same time sorry and so relieved seeing how love triumphs over death. I'm sure that if the movie had the adequate promotion and was on the cinemas for a while, it would have gained a far more higher position in the list.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The story line is a bit thin, the acting isn't the best but Hachi was the star of the movie and he didn't have to act much. I found some of the storyline a little hard to believe and the dog was a bit deadpan by normal pet dog behavioural standards.

196,wryboy,There is something about this movie,10,28 February 2019,"That moves me emotionally like few other movies can. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the Americanized version of the original 1987 Japanese original ""Hachiko Monogatari,"" both based on the true life story of the famous Japanese Akita named Hachiko who lived from 1923 to 1935. Hachi: A dog's Tale is set in Rhode Island and follows the life of Hachi from his haphazard arrival at the train station where the film is set and subsequent discovery there by Richard Gere, the music professor who takes him in and bonds with him. Joan Allen is Gere's wife and, while not particularly enthralled with Hachi at first, ultimately sees the special bond forming between her husband and the Akita and thus comes to accept Hachi.Hachi begins a routine of escorting Gere to the train station each morning and waiting for him to return in the evening where they both go home together. There are a few smaller characters in the film, the hot dog vendor, the train station attendant and Ken, a Japanese professor friend of Gere who serves as the wise man who knows instinctively there is something majestic about the Akita breed -- ""not a dog to play fetch with"" -- he sees this dog as the regal creature that it is. We are reminded of this majesty later in the film, when Ken talks to Hachi alone, in Japanese, one spiritual Japanese talking to another.The are two distinct tragedies in the film, the first being the sudden and untimely death of the main human character (Gere), but the film focuses in its last acts on the second and far deeper tragedy -- Hachi's belief that one day his master will return on the train, thus careening the rest of his life into a never-ending cycle of returning to the train station and waiting in vain for his return. The film uses sparse but effective special effects to show the relentless passage of time and how the poor dog continues, unabated to return to the station. These final sequences place the film squarely in the genre of horror as nothing can dissuade Hachi from waiting and nothing can bring his master back. The animal is doomed to a life of endless waiting.Along with the marvelous dog makeup and training used to present an aged and slowing dog, the soundtrack by Jan Kaczmarek deserves special mention as it is simply beautiful with several memorable themes of mostly piano and strings, used to both playful and melancholy effect. Indeed by the end of the film, it is almost impossible not to weep profoundly for poor Hachi, walking ever so slowly to the train station, in his lifelong demonstration of love, loyalty and hope. It is not an exaggeration to say that few films have such an emotional impact.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Fast forward 9 years later, while a senior in college Dad received a letter from his parents that Dick had died. By accident rummaging through our family heirlooms after Dad died several years ago, I came across a diary book of his and in it was an handwritten eulogy he wrote upon learning about Dick's death. He wrote this in 1934 (excerpts) : ...."" No truer friend did I ever have than this dog. She had much to with shaping my character that is the virtue I possess for I learned from Dick much of the valuable principles of good living...."" This movie is for those who had a strong and stirring attachment with their dog and it does bring tears to our eyes because of it.

203,phoenix_100,Review for 'Hachiko: A Dog's Story',7,1 January 2011,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale, had extraordinary potential to be a great film. The film starts of with Parker Wilson taking in a young Akita puppy. At this point in the movie, the gentle playful music, coupled with Gere's performance was well done, and I though that the movie would go on from there. Realistically however, there wasn't much plot to go on from this point.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is definitely worth a watch, I'm sure that many people would enjoy this movie, however I found the pace a little slow. The plot is good - however as a film, its quite limited. This movie does however have a very good ending (magnificently done) and it does have its moments in which the audience was captured.I would actually like to see a Japanese, Asian produced movie of this, as in the original, it worked well. The background, Tokyo, would also add a nice touch to this film. The highlights of this film include the interaction between Hachi and his owner, Parker. Overall, this film wasn't bad, but it wasn't excellent either, 7/10.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It followed by showing the dog's continued loyalty which meant the community who knew it committed to looking after as best they could, without resorting to trying to find a new home or take him to the pound.The film does not overly play for laughs. It doesn't overly play on sentiment. It doesn't give the dog a human voice so you can only assume what the dog is feeling by watching it's manner and actions. It makes you think about what must be going through it's mind and that is why it was so emotional for me.I had watched the film in tears from the moment the dog didn't want his master to go that day and having stopped at the end of the film, I started again whilst writing this review.Watch it with an open, compassionate mind rather one of cynicism, which many seem to have done.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Arriving home at the train station one evening he meets a stray Akita puppy and, unable to get anyone to care for him, takes him home. His wife, effectively played by Joan Allen, is initially reluctant to take in a pet, but after seeing how much joy he brings to her husband, gives in, and the love story between man and dog begins to unfold.Make every effort to see this wonderful, heartfelt film on cable or by renting a DVD, if available.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Have you ever had a closer relationship with a dog, like this?? This is one of the most heartwarming (and yes SAD) movies I have seen. However, I was looking for a heartfelt and meaningful movie and I found it with this one.It shows, magnificently, the amazing bond that an animal can have with a human in such a sweet and locing way. Yes, I cried throughout the entire movie but that is what I wanted to see.The reviewers who left bitter and nasty low reviews?

I don't know, but I'm glad we did not get the opportunity. I could not contain myself through the last fifteen minutes of the movie.

Great directing by Lasse Hallström! Hachiko was a great dog or I say the best one can get! This is the first movie leaved me speechless!

The film stars Richard Gere and he is also the producer and I can only describe this film as quite easily the saddest film I have seen in ages. Definitely top 5. The story is about a puppy that gets lost, only to be found by Parker Wilson played by Richard Gere and they develop a very close bond with another. Let's just say that's the happy bit of the film and watch the trailer for the sad bit. If you can watch the trailer with out sadness hitting you I suggest you get in touch with your inner emotions or just aren't human. I loves this film but watching it once is enough for me because it is just to sad to watch this one again. Definitely not a film I would buy on DVD for this reason but I don't think it really matters to Gere and he did it because it is a very emotional tale based on a true story and is a must watch, even if it is just once.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Makes me cry every time I hear about it or see it. I love that a powerful and beautiful movie so much . In many ways, other animals are more intelligent, perceive and sensitive than we humans. The fact that it's inspired by a true story makes it more sad. ""He is your friend, your partner, your defender, your dog. You are his life, his love, his leader.

227,nincompoopian,An unforgettable touching story about a legendary Akita dog who sorely misses his deceased master.,10,17 December 2020,"No one could ever forget the touching true story of Japan's Hachiko, an Akita dog who awaited patiently the return of his master at the train station. This went on even after the old man died, catching the attention of the train commuters, who would hail Hachiko as an embodiment of loyalty. While dogs are indeed notable for their intelligence and loyalty to their masters, Hachiko was unlike any other dogs: the bond he developed with his master was so special that he knew his master's about to arrive home by the time his train honks its loud horn from afar. These events are incorporated in Lasse Hallstrom's ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"", which is just as equally touching that I couldn't help but weep to this unforgettable story about love, friendship, and loyalty.The movie begins with a puppy Hachi being flown from Japan to the United States, and then transported to the train station where he gets in the way of Parker, a middle-aged music professor who is married with children (a deceased son and a grown daughter). Parker tries to have him adopted but is surprised that no one was interested, not even his Japanese colleague, Ken, who reveals that Hachi's name means ""8"" in Japanese (the number of which is considered a good fortune in Japanese tradition), and that Akitas' loyalty can't be bought. His wife Cate also wants Hachi adopted by a loving family, but seeing how her husband has come to love the dog, she believes that Hachi has already found a family in them.We then see a grown Hachi that has developed a strong bond with his master. At one point, Hachi escaped from home and chased Parker down to the station, eager to join him aboard the train to work; but the professor is kind and patient and it never crossed his mind to admonish him for being a naughty dog. Hachi would then accompany his old man for a walk to the station every day, and then await his arrival there at 5 in the afternoon. After Parker died of a heart attack, Hachi continued waiting for his master's return in his usual spot for the next 10 years until his own demise. Concerned citizens fed Hachi all kinds of food as he waited, but to my surprise no one bothered to bathe him.The direction by Lasse Hallstrom, coupled with Jan Kaczmarek's beautiful piano-oriented score, really packs an emotional punch. The movie's a pleasure to look at because it's inhabited by characters who are good people. Whether you may have a preference for any animal but a dog, it's hard to hold back tears during its emotional moments. Believe it or not there's a dog-shaped hole in all our hearts, so I urge you to allow the memory of Hachiko fill it.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
228,ctsquared,Very touching movie,9,2 April 2010,"My son loved ""Marley and Me"", which is cool, he's 10. His Father (me) liked it but loved this movie more. Being Japanese American I had heard about the original story from my Mom. I thought the movie was very well done, not going for cheap sentimentality but showing very well the bond between Hachi and the Professor. I have read some other posts where the readers took the family to task for seemingly ""abandoning"" Hachi after the professor died. For one, it's a MOVIE. Also, we don't know where the professor's wife was going, maybe dogs weren't allowed. Also, the daughter had more of a bond, so that is why Hachi went with her. I also don't think she ""abandoned"" him either. She was wise enough to know that she and her family would never replace the professor in Hachi's heart and would be miserable if he stayed.I really liked the way the ""reunion"" was handled. They say your life flashes before you before you pass on. In Hachi's case, he remembered the happy times with the the professor. When the professor ""steps"" through the door and they are reunited, it's like Hachi's 10 year wait has paid off. They are back together and now he can move on as well.The coda with the grandson telling the story to his class and getting a puppy of his own (which he called Hachi) was a nice touch, but not really necessary. The last scene of Hachi in his final ""sleep"" after seeing his master again would have been more powerful.My wife and I had tears in our eyes. My son liked the movie, but made me laugh when he said, ""It's just like Marley and Me only the owner died"" 10 year old kids are sometimes sharper than grown ups!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
229,terephiel,The most touching film ever!,10,18 October 2010,"First off, I have to say that I already knew the real story of Hachiko before watching this film. Reading about it though didn't have the same effect on me as actually watching it for the first time on the Hallmark Channel yesterday. The acting was excellent, the storyline was excellent, and the three dogs that portray Hachiko (Chico, Layla, and Forrest) were absolutely precious. I'm a twenty-one year old man who's always been rather emotional (it doesn't make any man less of one), and not surprisingly, I was bawling like a newborn baby by the end. Hachiko's death and ascension into Heaven with Parker was truly the saddest part of this film for me. I literally can't stop crying and even as I type this, I'm sobbing. Hachiko's undying loyalty and devotion show us what love truly is. I think if I'd known him, I would've stayed right there with him. I'm quite sure that Parker's grandson and his own Hachiko will share the very same bond their predecessors did. No film has ever moved me so much like this one did, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I believe as the human soul lives on after death, so does the animal. I'm sure I'll see my own pets in Heaven with me after I die, and I'm sure Hachiko is there, too.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
230,Aeromaxx777,A rare kind of love not not expressed by humans,10,23 January 2011,"This movie really made me cry for quite a long time. I somehow believed that the greatest love of all is not expressed by humans. Hachi waited for his deceased master for more or less 9 years and never gave up even though professor Wilson was dead. How many people do you think can wait forever for someone special to them? I admit I'm incapable of doing that.The story of how Hachi found Mr. Wilson may be unrealistic to some people since as if destiny brought them together, I wouldn't say anything negative about it or any of the flaws(if there is any) that critics may notice in this film. The way the master and his dog were finally reunited in heaven really warms even the coldest of hearts.

231,tanuj000999,Did Hachi invented loyalty?,10,31 July 2015,"Hi, I think it's around 4.37pm (just finished the movie)it's been years, I close my heart and its emotion part for everyone. It's been three yr or more. I didn't heartily weep what I had or slipped or not even for favors. Nothing can break this locked door but I guess now it is unlocked a little for peek may be. Today I cried like baby, tried hours to hide from my room-partner but at last he came & told me, ""It's OK to watch hachi with wet eyes!"" Cry not because of another fight or break upany human effort but because of sense and gravity of loyalty.""Loyalty does not need any compulsion but devotion"". We are human, we are best breed or creation of GodBut this word 'loyalty' usually we didn't get from humans. I got it from ""Hachi A Dog's Story"" is really heart touching, ice-breaking and in real means of loyalty. I really salute Hachi because of Hachi now I also want a dog like Hachi but it's great if didn't get but if I get that's means it's a miracle. I don't know that much loyalty came from his heredity or what. Nine years' of waiting what kind of love is that? Even a smart dog can tell that no one will come after waiting 24-48hr. Don't you think that he was dumb? No, he is more than that.I also tried long distance relationship so I kind of knew that keep waiting and waiting without any response in real. It looks like dumb specially when you are not there to feel or ever felt it beforebut this waiting part is became hard, harder and hardest with long due process of time. Some left broke but unique one died not because they were miserable but one of strongest one who can stop killing himself and make it own allies to remember its love for one who they really loved or still loving or catch a sense of love with dark-bright faces.The golden question of life is-"" where is the Challenge?""If I apply Golden question of mine here Where is the challenge?To leave and go to next owner even she's a daughter of his real owner or to wait him after his death even if I knew that my owner will not even he wants to. I don't think so that much Hachi can think. He just knows my life is around, from and by Master and he is still waiting for life to catch with his master like the way we spent our time in past time.At last he caught up, surely with his master.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
232,rice_a_roni,"Disposable Pet Takes Center Stage In Mushy, Pointless Melodrama",1,28 May 2010,"This is purportedly a movie about love and loyalty between a man an his dog, but in it they manage to show you everything you absolutely shouldn't do as a responsible pet owner. I wanted to like this movie but I was too busy cringing at the danger the dog Hachi was constantly placed in due to the neglect of his absentee owners. If you really love your pet you should watch this movie and do the exact opposite of everyone in it.Here are some thoughts I had while watching it (*spoilers ahead*):Magic puppy that just sits there being cute and doesn't pee / poop / tear up everything. In reality, raising a puppy is a lot of hard work, and it doesn't get a lot easier once they grow up. This movie will probably encourage more people who shouldn't be pet owners in the first place to go get a pure bred puppy as they make it look way too easy, meanwhile tens of thousands of dogs die unwanted and unloved in shelters. This dog runs all over town but has no collar - what, no leash laws, no mandatory rabies tag? The town I live in would never tolerate this, and for good reason as it is a very real danger to both the dog and the townsfolk. Dog runs all over streets and around active train tracks and ""loving"" owner is unalarmed. If that was my dog I'd be having a cow. Complete absence of cars, even parked ones, till near the end when son-in-law comes to pick up dog. I think this was to keep you from thinking about the dog getting hit by a car while it's roaming the streets unleashed and unattended. I couldn't stop thinking about it though. The dog is anthropomorphized to an unbelievable degree. Look, dogs don't understand complex English sentences, but that doesn't stop every character in this movie from behaving like they can. The two most grating scenes in the movie revolve around this: 1) The first time Hachi follows Gere to the train station, Gere tells the dog to go home and somehow expects the dog to know what he's saying - Gere doesn't seem to care if the dog goes home or not, as long as it leaves the train station long enough for him to get to his job on time, and 2) the sentimental speech delivered by the ""loving"" daughter to the dog right before she opens the gate and allows the dog to run away and roam the streets homeless. The zoned-out wife didn't even realize the dog escaped from the backyard, even though she just got a soft spot for it and fed it treats. Wife quits job and leaves town right after husband dies - with a daughter & grandchild living in town? What, hubby didn't have any life insurance to go with that cushy job at the university? I kind of don't believe it. Perhaps some critical setup / background scenes were cut as it makes no sense? Then again, nothing in this movie makes much sense. Magic Asian meets wife at the graveyard, completely out of the blue, like he's been standing there for ten years, flowers in hand, waiting for her to appear. Entire town seems to be aware of dog story, but entire family that owned dog is completely clueless? Relentlessly syrupy movie music telegraphing every emotion we're supposed to feel - it made me hate the sound of strings & piano (and I really like strings and piano). True story taken so far out of context and time, and given the complete Hollywood treatment to the point where it makes zero sense. Dull, uninspired plot, script, characters, acting - except for depraved indifference to Hachi, nothing really happens. Jason Alexander can't do anything but be George Costanza, why was he in this movie (or any movie for that matter)? Puppy leash removal on train tracks at end, so the whole absentee owner thing starts over again - wasn't once enough?I never thought I would say this, but even Free Willy is a better animal-centric movie than this one.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
233,aidawolf,"Give the dog an Oscar, but everyone else punch in the face! they made Joke out of real story...",4,17 January 2011,"First of all I never cried during watching this film, It was so predictable, and boring, wooden acting of the whole crew was annoying and laughable, and when Richard Gere died in the film, I didn't cry, I started laughing and I said to my husband, look Richard is ruined, they will not let him act till the end of the movie anymore, and then we both laughed... First of all did you people notice how actors in most today's movies act like wooden puppets just going around and talking random words which they do not feel AT ALL, I noticed it, and I noticed how unnatural Hollywood characters are, shallow and impossible to like... I will stick to UnAmerican movies from now on( it seems that Hollywood makes everything through very old recipes, they will make something well known to audience, they will not experiment, they just want money, they don't make films anymore)... Most people here said that this story in unbelievable , but it is very common, it is just that Japanese people appreciate every hero, even the dog... In my country there are many stories of dogs who spend their lives near the master's grave, or died the same day, and for that thing for following their masters to work and back....WELL EVEN MY CAT DOES THAT... if you are connected to your pet you could expect that... But what was really annoying was that plot hole which I noticed when Richard Gere practiced katana, and I noticed it was fishy , and then at the ending, when they said that man who owned the dog was Japanese, and everything happened in JAPAN, I got depressed, very depressed. Here there was again CHEAP Hollywood, they had to move the dog to America and Americanize everything, but that story would be impossible in America, you know why, because the law says so, no dog should be on the streets, without muzzle and so on, you people are full of laws which are taking your money away( well in my country they do the same)...anyway if we would hope your state was not full of those laws back then In 1924 ( professor used internet in the film), lets say story is possible to happen in America at that time... I get this is JUST BASED on a true story, not that it is true story, but why did they butcher so much the true story? People who made this film know nothing about dogs, and they just put one stupid scene after another to make film last longer, it was agony,farce, they made JOKE out of everything! The only one who knew how to act in a whole movie was a dog so give him Oscar, and apologize to him because you put him in one manipulative LIE/JOKE of a movie... Read about true story and see what really happened...One more thing, it is impossible to make movie out of this story, because it is too simple, and it is too beautiful, it should be passed on , but through different media... and at the end I will give this movie 4 out of 10, because I give dog 10, and to the rest I give -2...",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Are you kidding me?,1,22 August 2012,"How could there be spoiler warning in any review concerning this movie when all that happened is that Gere and the dog met and than Gere died and the dog waited and waited and waited... He pretty much waited the hell out of the movie! Some say that his waiting for Gere to come back taught us a valuable lesson about love. I say it taught us how to waste a perfectly good life, it taught us not to move on, to dwell in memories and stay sad and depressed for the rest of your life! That was not love! It was death and withering! Also, I don't know if it was just a bad script or the influence of Hachi, but every time someone got close to him, they got really really frantic, started to call his name again and again and again, saying random phrases like, lets go, good dog, come on! etc... The family that adopted the dog was perfect, so there was no room for a plot developing there and... I don't know what else to write.

Being executed as predictably as possible as well as unable to shake off an aura of artificiality and hollywoodization for placing the story in the suburban United States instead of Japan does not help.If you wish to see a better American film about a dog which is more entertaining, fun and far less predictable you should see the underrated ""Marley & Me"".",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

240,pjamok-692-397387,"Can't say I like it, but it's a haunting movie--maybe for all the wrong reasons",5,26 September 2010,"I still can't stop thinking about it, so that says something. However, I'm really troubled by the behavior of the characters in this movie. Ultimately, the storyline doesn't work in the 21st century.I was troubled that Parker let his dog roam the streets and follow him without even a collar on. And the wife, whose name I can't even remember, doesn't seem to ever attach to the dog for no valid reason as the dog is adorable and loving. The fact that the poor animal is forced to sleep in the tool shed when these people have a huge house with a wonderful sun porch for just the two of them is more than annoying. In fact, the dog is NEVER shown in the house as a grown animal. Makes me think his loyalty is misplaced and nowhere near deserved by these people. Even after her husband dies, she never even says goodbye as her daughter loads the dog up. There is no explanation given as to why she doesn't keep the dog as any creature loved so much by a beloved husband should be cherished and taken care of. The daughter makes a half-hearted attempt to keep the dog, but gives up quickly and never goes to see how the dog is doing. Oh, and how do they explain to the son that they just left grandpa's dog to fend for himself? Makes no sense.The one with the most concern is the Japanese professor who at least attempts to give money to the local vendors for the dog's care. They refuse as they're willing to take care of him, but there's no true care going on. Couldn't the station master give him a broom-closet to sleep in? A dish with some real dog food in it? A blanket or two? And the hot dog vendor only offers some stray scraps of leftover hot dogs. That's not nutrition. And in the true story, apparently the station master did allow the dog to live in the station and made a home for him (which would have worked MUCH better here) rather than allowing him to live under an old train in all kinds of weather. The ending does work well in its uplifting vision of dog meeting master upon his death.The filming is well done, and the black and white images of life through a dog's eyes are creative and just enough to make the point. The setting couldn't be more beautiful and adds to the haunting tone of the story.The screenplay is ultimately really flat to match the characters. The daughter makes an impassioned plea for the dog to stay, telling him how much they love him and want him, and in the next breath says goodbye and opens the gate. Okay, so the premise is the dog needs to do what the dog needs to do, but that's like saying a ten-year-old should be allowed to do what he or she feels like doing. It doesn't make sense. No one goes out of his or her way to help the dog in any meaningful way, not even in a superficial way. And when the wife shows up at the train station ten years later to visit her husband's grave, her interaction with the dog is trite.Maybe the film would have worked if set in the original time period (1920s) if not the original country. And after writing this I know why I can't stop thinking about it. I'm haunted by the loyalty of an animal who is ultimately so neglected and ignored.This film is a sad commentary on human behavior and the emotional, physical waste of this beautiful animal is, even to anyone who isn't a major animal lover, a horrible tragedy. There is no redemption in this film. Just sadness.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
241,ghostsarescared,Should never have been a film.,5,20 December 2013,"This is the first time I am going to disagree with IMDb's ratings.Hachi should never have been made into a film. My main reason being that a dog and its master's relationship is not something that can be completely explained, analyzed or documented. I don't know the details of the true story, but I'm pretty sure not many people do - as it happened in the 1920s in Japan. This just seems to be another example of American filmmakers trying to cash in on someone else's story.While the acting wasn't abysmal, it was pretty damn Hallmark-y. The dog- vision was a bad decision, as it didn't add anything meaningful to the already sentiment-laden mood. This mood pervaded the entire film - which had no real emotional ups or downs. Not helping matters was the monotonous, unremarkable piano theme that never paused while dog or owner was on screen.Supporting cast were typecast and dull. Several big plot holes as well.All in all very disappointing.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

244,benedikt-entner,An overrated dog movie,6,9 December 2014,"I like dogs, but I also appreciate good film making. Without spoiling I am safe to say, the best thing about this movie was the end. There is something wrong with a movie, if the last scene is emotionally most touching and it contains text. Text about the real events that are portrayed in the film (another example would be ""Black Hawk Down"")Everything before was mildly interesting. I was surprised to find out Lasse Hallström directed this, who is most famous for ""Chocolat"" and ""The Cider House Rules"". I must say I am not a big fan of his work, I thought some kind of indie, amateur or semi professional cinematographer filmed this. Hachi was released in 2009, why does it looks 15 years older? The film must have been on low budget? The camera equipment seams poor and everything including the soundtrack feels cheap. Containing the same monotonic piano strumming throughout the whole movie. Sometimes Hachi would have been better without, especially towards the end. you hear more or less the same tune in every scene, and it gets repetitive.The story is based on a true and mildly interesting story, unfortunately the storytelling has some major flaws. You don't get to know much about the characters, they are only sketches. But let's start with the beginning: a Japanese monk decides to send a dog puppet to the United States of America. Obviously lots of Japanese monks to that. The movie explanation is rather stupid: it must have been fate. Hachi and Gere meet each other at the train station. The story: Gere's grandson is telling the story of Hachi in his school as his ""personal hero"". Later on we find out, that his own family didn't care about Hachi at all. After Gere's character dies and things don't work out well with the family dog Hachi, they put him outside the house and the dog runs away, out of frustration. The family should perfectly know where he is. After all he went to the train station everyday to meet with his owner. Everyone in town knows where Hachi is, and it was even in the news. Still they never look after him. Couldn't they at least bring him some food. They don't seem to care. Remember the first scene? Hachi is supposedly some kind of ""hero"" for the family. Another point is, Hachi decides to abandon his supposedly caring and loving family and he is suffering. No dog would do that, not to a certain degree. Not under that weather conditions, not when it is freezing cold and there is no food, not if he still has a home place and people that would provide for him. Why didn't he return to sleep or eat, rather be miserabe? After several years Hachi is found at the train station by Gere's widow. Didn't she knew from her daughter or the news or friends? Is she surprised that the dog is still alive? In the next scene the family is sitting all together inside of their cozy house again. But not with Hachi. They look at family albums with pictures of Hachi, but the the dog is still outside. How cynical is that? The dog is still out there, dieing in the cold, alone, why don't you take him home you heartless bastards, you monsters. Last scene Hachi dies. Like another reviewer wrote: Hachi is nothing more than a 90 minute soppy TV commercial with doggy in the rain and family albums, Christmas, couples, happiness and heaven, and not much else. It is not a bad movie though compared to other ""dog movies"", it shows the loyalty of a dog and that he always waits for you when you come home, to be fair, from all the dog movies I have seen so far, Hachi is still the best. 6/10",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Being a fan of Richard Gere, I thought I would give it a try and I'm certainly glad I did. This is most definitely a movie worth purchasing due to its talented cast and impressive storyline that just can't leave you indifferent. I agree with all other reviewers that you will need Kleenex nearby, especially towards the end. Although I knew ahead what the storyline was all about, I didn't quite expect it to be that emotional. I'm not a dog movie fan; actually I can't even say I'm a dog lover either. Yes I like them, and when friends visit with their dogs, I have no problems, but not enough to own one myself. But after seeing this movie, I almost had the urge to get one. This is how intense this movie is and how well it demonstrate the bond between a dog and its owner.

It is truly heartwarming story, and the acting is well done. I gave it a 7 because it was a good movie, my problem is the story itself. I am not certain how true the movie is to the actual story.... After watching the movie, the opening scene is a sad indictment of the disloyalty of humans, it would laughable if it were not so sad. The young boy seems so proud to tell the story, when in my opinion he and family should be ashamed. Hachi is rewarded for his loyalty to his master by being abandoned. I understand that Hachi was stubbornly loyal, this does not mean he deserved to die alone, after spending the last 8-9 years alone each night under a train. I am sure his owner would have been infuriated by the lack of loyalty his family displayed.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
249,kjvenkatraman,Feel proud that you cried watching this movie... Just that you will share the feeling with many others...,10,19 August 2012,"Every other review here talks about crying at the end of the film. Yes, I cried too. Not once, but every time I watch the movie. I watch the movie just so that I can feel true love and cry it out.This movie is just brilliant. Dissecting it in to 2 parts - the story and the movie. The story - part of the prose in my primary school days (early 1990s) - is a must-know for every human being. Salute Hachiko!!!About the movie - it does all justice to the story. Performances, screenplay, music, direction have all been just perfect with no nonsense / artificiality to them. Spoiler - just that about half the movie is about Hachiko waiting for his master is probably the most impactful element and the highest tribute the movie makers could have paid to Hachiko!!Story very clearly teaches what is love and loyalty. But there is a very subtle message that the movie brings out which probably is hard to figure out reading the story. Spoiler - Hachiko's master dies. His wife moves on in life, children move on, students, friends, acquaintances, everyone moves on in life but for Hachiko. He waits all his life for his master (literally all his life) as if being with his master was the purpose of his life. I'd be proud of myself if I can do even 1/10th that i.e. wait for 1 year for any one person in my life. This subtlety brings out the contrasting attitude of human beings and some of the other lovable creatures - something that Japanese films have time and again portrayed and taught us in subtle as well as calling-a-spade-a-spade ways.This movie lingers in one's mind for a long long time and has a lasting impact - even if that is for just a day, I would think the movie has met success. Just watch this - can't think of another movie / any experience that creates such an impact in 1.5 hrs.Lastly little curious if not disappointed. The movie's overall rating is 8.1 despite almost every review talking about 10 and secondly this movie not making it to the top charts in IMDb (possibly due to fewer ratings). But this one tops my charts. 10/10",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
250,sm22281-1,"Yes, I cried rivers too...",10,29 December 2010,"For me, this was more wrenching than ""Old Yeller"" as love and loyalty from a canine towards his human. This story was told in such a simple way and its raw depiction of plain canine love wrenched me emotionally. Few movies have the power to reduce me to tears like this nowadays.All the actors are excellent. Richard Gere as the human who follows his heart and bonds with the dog early on. The puppy and the grown dog(s) that act out the loving hearted Hachiko... Such pure love from another species... How can we as humans not feel touched by such devotion and loyalty? How can we, as a species, not feel awed by the trust that our dog friends bestow on us so freely? The movie did a very fine job of depicting the special bond in this human-canine duo. I loved it!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
251,JapanGaijin,Enough to make a grown man cry!,10,23 August 2009,"Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

253,coledarcysoderstrom,A difficult movie to rate,4,11 May 2020,"The real life story is heartwarming and is something I will always remember. This movie uses that real life story which makes the film entertaining enough and you'll probably get emotional at some point. But just as a movie this movie has TONS of problems. Richard Gere is good and so is the dog and as I said the true story is great but almost everything that is needed to make a great movie fall short in this movie and that's why it's hard to rate because when I judge this as a movie I can't help but give it a low rating. The cinematography is horrible. It looks like a hallmark film and the score is overbearing and saccharine. The whole tone is quite saccharine and this story in the hands of better writers and a better director didn't need to be so saccharine. I've never seen the original film but I'm interested in checking it out because it's Japanese and the original story took place in Japan and I see now reason why this version didn't. Honestly there probably is no point in this movie even existing if the original is as good as I hear but they were going to make it anyway but I see no reason why this version didn't also take place in Japan and had all Japanese actors. If you want the characters to speak English for North American audiences fine whatever, the people in Schindlers list spoke English not German that does t matter, but when you are telling a true story be as faithful as possible. The guy who played Richard Gere's friend should have played Richard Gere instead of being a forced Japanese connection. Shoot it in the real station where the true event took place. Lots of missed opportunity's and weird desicons. Also the movie drags a lot and repeats scenes over and over and has scenes that serve no purpose. This story is more designed for a 45 min short film rather than a feature. Anyway that's my take. One of these days I'll check out the original",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

How I would love to see more G movies! The cover on the DVD showed a man happily smiling with his cute dog, so I was anticipating some sort of a happy story.The beginning was kind of intriguing, but as the movie wore on, the music was so slow, boring and sad that I knew that someone was going to to die. I had to force myself to stay with this movie, hoping that it would get better. It didn't.I don't know if was the directing or producing aspect of the film that made it so boring, but there was just something missing.I agree that the real-life story is an amazing and interesting one, but watching this movie version of it was not at all enjoyable for me.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It looked like a simple and cute movie about a man finding a dog and giving it a good home. Nothing special...oh how wrong was I.As many others have already stated, ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and devotion. A man who finds a small adorable puppy by accident enters a heartwarming friendship with the animal, who shows the loyalty a dog can have for its owner. Hachi (or Hachiko) is such a devoted and loving dog, following Gere's character to the train station every day and returning one the train whistled for the return of his master. It's truly one of the reasons why I love dogs so much. As time and tragedy occurs, nothing stands in Hachi's way to meet his owner at the train station every day until the end.The film's cast was superb (especially Gere, who also served as a producer) and beautifully shots. A great touch was seeing the world from the dog's POV in an almost sepia filmed shots (as dogs are colorblind). It is such a heartwarming yet heartbreaking story all at the same time! I've seen stories of owners who've passed on and their dogs staying faithfully by their sides (the US soldier whose dog didn't leave his side or the dog who stayed by his Japanese owner's grave). This is just but another example in a film format of the love that animals can bring in a person's life and vice versa.It reminds me of my dog Jett, a jet-black dachshund/rat terrier mix I picked out in elementary school. He was so tiny and I remember petting him thinking ""he's the dog for us."" Years later, I can remember having to take him outside, clean up after him every time he got into the trash or chewed my mom's shoes up, and playing with him at odd hours of the day. But it was my mom whom he bonded with the strongest, following her everywhere she went and waiting for her to play with him or take him outside. He was her constant companion while I was away at college and my sister worked all day and later moved out. Ten years or so later, it was the hardest time when the decision came to put him down to end his pain from an attack. Away from home and as my sister was at work, it was my mom who stood by his side as he passed. I imagine just like Hachi, Jett has images of happier times and of my mother's face as he passed on. I can only hope that when it is my turn, he will be there waiting for me.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

While looking for a theme to highlight mom's life on her 80th BD, I took her to the movies without knowing what was playing and chose this over the 6 other gore feasts. Family loyalty and fidelity are highlighted in a clear and succinct manner by Hachi's behavior, while contrasting the denial of any bond by the grieving?? wife(she came back first to see her lasting Theater legacy before other family remembrances). I agree the modern day setting makes the story implausible, but we will forgive the national narcissism. Gere is splendid in matching the dog's facial expression. The camera work surrenders to the view by Hachi only partially. Great cure for eye dryness!!!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Really, i couldn't find anything special in this movie. Sure, there are no blooper in this movie, a good cast and the right screenplay, but it's not enough to make of HACHI a great movie. Morover, this is a remake of the Japan movie ""HACHIKO MONOGATARI"" (1987): another Holloywood version of a beautiful foreign movie. It's better to see the original.

Was I caught offguard! This very very simple tale just blows your mind. The single mindedness of devotion, love and loyalty is enough to leave you embarrassed, mentally and emotionally.

265,dpbertrand,By far the best dog movie I've ever seen.,9,30 December 2010,"The movie starts off with Parker (Gere) finding Hachi at a train station and not wanting to leave the dog alone. He takes him home for the night until the owner comes back to the station to claim him. His wife (Allen) clearly is not to fond of dogs and tells her husband that there is no way that they will be keeping the dog. Of course no one claims the dog and the wife realizes how much the husband and the daughter (Roemer) love the dog so she caves and lets them keep it. You clearly see the bond between Hachi and Parker with all the time they spend together and Hachi actually starts walking Parker to the train station and waiting for him when he gets back. One day Parker goes to work and has a heart attack and dies, but Hachi continues to wait for him at the station. Even after years of his passing Hachi continues to go back every day to wait for him.I'm going to start by arguing a couple of reviews I have read. First negative review was from UK critic who said he wasn't at all touched by this movie and the only real thought he had about it was how stupid a dog could be for waiting around for 10 years for his dead master to return. This clearly makes me angry, let's be real this is a dog not a human and I'm not saying dogs are dumb on the contrary I think there very intelligent, but I don't believe they no what happens to there master when they die and this movie is a perfect example of that. The last time Hachi saw Parker he was going to work so for all we know the dog just thought he had to eventually be coming back.Second review was how uninspired he was by this story and would have been more inspired if the community would have tried to help the dog understand that his master was not coming back. Parker's daughter, who probably loved him almost as much as parker himself, tried to take Hachi home with her, but Hachi didn't want too he wanted to wait for the one he loved most at the station. Let's be honest, when someone is stubborn and thinks what they are doing is right you can't convince them otherwise. Well that's how I felt about Hachi he was stubborn and no one was going to be able to get him to stop waiting.My thoughts on this movie are clear it was easily the most heartfelt movie in years. When I read all these reviews about how everyone sobbed I was thinking ""Ok, I might tear up a bit, but there is no way I'm going to sob"" Well I would just like to say that my wife and I have joined the sobbing club. I have shed a tear for very few movies and I see a lot, but there was something special about this movie. For me what made Hachi so special is most dogs I know love attention regardless who there getting it from, but of course they love there master just because they spend most there time with them. If a dog were to lose there master and someone else takes the dog and gives it just as much love and attention the dog will love there new owner just as much as the old owner. This wasn't the case for Hachi. He had an opportunity at Parker's daughters, but he didn't want to stay with her he loved his master so much that he was willing to not get the full affection that a dog deserves from another person for the rest of his life for just that one chance that Parker would return to play with him one more time.Hachi is a dog that could teach a lot of people a lesson or two on how to love one another and to not give up on love as fast as many people do now a days. Please rent this movie whether your a dog lover or not. This is not about how much a pet loved its master, its about how wonderful of a connection two friends had with each other.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
266,nowwinaditya,It's God's way of telling us what Loving someone truly is.,10,15 May 2011,"If i am writing review no 132 for a movie,then it clearly suggests i would not have much to say.But still,despite the repeated calls,my heart disobeys my mind and here i am scribbling something about a movie which is beyond the realms of any accolade or criticism.That's what this movie embodies.It is the call of the heart over the mind.It's an eternal classic which goes on in your mind forever.The greatness of the movie lies not just in the fact that it struck a hitherto concealed chord in your heart but in the fact that it will continue to do so even if you watch this movie again and again.It's as pristine as the first ray of sunshine after a long thunderstorm,as melancholic as ""The Autumn of the Middle Ages"" by Huizinga.It grows on you like a vintage single malt.It's prose lies not in the words but in the expression.It's as beautiful as Dante's Divine Comedy,and as long and enthralling like ""The Mahabharata"".I would just like to say that if human emotions were a artist then Hachiko would be the oeuvre of that artist.I would not tell you the story as many people have done that but i would just tell how this movie changed me as a person and what this change means to me.There's a concept called ""Interspecie Altruism"" which even Darwin failed to explain.Now i know why...this movie was god's way of telling us what loving someone truly is all about.To say that i was sobbing by the end of the movie is just as understatement.I should say i was weeping heavily and i can say with firm conviction that anybody who has even an iota of a lovable heart will be deeply moved by this wonderful movie.It made me understand myself better as a human.The essence of Hachiko lies not in being lovely in looks but lovely in heart..and indeed he is.Now if i can say that a dog was more adorable than Richard Gere then you can just imagine what it would have been.His wait for his master is not only epic but the slow pace of that wait signifies a much deeper feeling.The feeling of solitude.When one loses someone in life,life seems so be eating us,leaving us crippled.Anyone who has lost his or her loved one will be very familiar with what i am saying.We usually see pain of a human of that sense of loneliness which overwhelms us.This movie gave us an insight into that sense for a Dog and it was more than i could take.It's a movie which cuts across all genders,class,age and appeals to everyone.It's a bonding shared by everyone who has been loved and who has loved anyone truly.I am truly amazed that how this movie has not been released in USA.In this age of vulgar comedy,bloodbath combats,this movies comes across as a lesson for all of us that you can make a truly timeless movie with the bare minimum one has.Finally a word for the bonding between Richard Gere and Hachiko...the subtle expressions which this movie shows can truly be comprehended by those who have had a pet.It's too real to be taken as just acting.I saw some reviews here which criticized the movie.As i have earlier stated that this movie is beyond any criticism but still i would like to say something to those who disliked this movie.All your points like the movie being slow,too predictable,loose and boring stand irrelevant when we try to get hold of the central message of this movie.It was never intended to be technically perfect or poignantly sharp and witty.It was intended to just make everyone of us realize our most basic emotion-Love. If you have ever loved anyone,human or animal,you have to love this movie.In an era when one can like and even recommend craps like ""American Pie"" and ""Euro trip"" then i find it hard,almost impossible, to comprehend how one can even dislike this movie.Richard Gere has effortlessly produced a gem of a movie for humanity and has brought us closer to the universal truth of love and peace.If a dog can teach us what love is,we can definitely spread the message.To rate this movie is merely a futile exercise as i truly believe that masterpieces like this are beyond any judgement or analysis.It's simply the most touching movie i ever saw.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead.I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years""I feel Hachi was neglected after his masters death, just left alone to fend for himself. Surely it would have been his masters wish that he was cared for after his death.It saddens me that this happened.But the loyalty and unconditional love shown by Hachi will live on forever and it was right to honour such loyalty with a statue at the very station that Hachi waited for his master to return for the entirety of his life.Hachis story will live on forever and rightly so.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

273,kumarabhijit-30262,This movie is pure heart and soul,10,19 July 2020,"This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

And if you're one hardened nut who wont let yourself cry then you should definitely watch it and get melted. Hachi is the epitome of pure and unconditional love and he makes yearn for him even days after watching the film. Just thinking of the film makes my eyes teary.Director Lasse Halstrom's direction does total justice to Hachi's story. The man is a master in directing emotional dramas and last time I had this emotional a movie experience was with his 90's film 'What's eating Gilbert Grape?' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108550/?ref_=nv_sr_1,Hachi - A Dog's Tale

And even lesser words which could actually help you convey what you want to say. The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
277,irwinnormal,A melodramatic tale about a dog.,1,19 September 2010,"I tend to only consider reviewing movies which I either think are great, or, despise. This would be one of the latter. A fluffy tale about a fluffy dog. Carter (Gere) is the perfect American father and husband. He's handsome, carries a briefcase. He wears an overcoat, yet, is artistic, sensitive, educated. He loves his wife. He finds a lost puppy in a trainstation and, reluctantly, brings it home to his perfect American wife, beautiful, artistic; playful, yet stern; in their perfect Conneticut house. Before long, the puppy endears itself to man and woman (as well as perfect daughter) and they decide to keep it. Joy precedes tragedy, etc. The lead character, hachi, is a dog. He is not great, not bad. He had no trouble sitting there, looking cute. But, when it came to expressing himself, he lacked. ""What is it boy?"" I never could quite figure that out. All in all, a film about a sad dog who refuses to let us in beyond his stoic and stubborn gesture of grieving. A montage of familiar actors ooohing and aaahing. A cookie cutter vision of life. It didn't make me weep. Perhaps I am a hard hearted cynic. Perhaps I want to learn something from a movie.... I didn't learn anything here.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

279,inuanimation,Hachiko Lives On,10,8 August 2010,"What many people don't know is that Hachiko was a real dog and the story is true. A Japanese Akita loved his master so much, he waited for him everyday at the Shibuya train station in Tokyo, and they walked home together when he came back for 2 years. Tragically his master died at work and never came back, but Hachiko waited 10 years for him to come home and died at the train station still waiting. Hachi, A Dogs Tale was a beautiful movie about the real Hachiko and the loyalty and love he had for his master. Richard Gere is a great actor and his character is believable and likable, and Hachi (a Japanese style Akita) is absolutely adorable! I seriously wanted to hug him throughout the movie. The setting was a little different (Rhode Island instead of Japan) but it didn't really matter. The story is heartbreaking and lovely as you watch Hachi wait for his master until they are finally reunited. As a warning though: Bring tissues, this movie is super sad!!!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
280,karthick1191-271-529814,Hachi and Richard Gere manage to touch our hearts.,10,31 January 2012,"The moment you start watching the puppy Hachi in the first scene of the movie being shifted from one country to another, you just cannot stop adoring the little fella. He is the highlight of the movie and thats quite intentional as it is centered around him.As many would have read in the synopsis, Hachi is brought home by Parker(Richard Gere) when he comes home from his daily work routine and finds Hachi abandoned at the train station. As many people would try to find its owner, Parker sets to find the true owner(but fails) and starts advertising for adoption. The story that unfolds later may be slow and drab but it is well told and the chemistry between Parker and Hachi is truly commendable and engaging. Small yet cute details such as showing Hachi's vision in the form of black and white are worth a mention. The characters in this movie are few but manage to deliver decent performances such as the hot dog guy, Parker's wife and friend. Without revealing much about the movie, let me point out that its Richard Gere and Hachi who steal the show. Throughout the movie you feel that two are meant to be together forever to the point you doubt sometimes that whether Parker has a daughter and a wife living in his house. Nonetheless, he loves them too.One of the most important talked about point about the movie is its ability to touch everybody's heart and make the audience and viewers shed a few tears for the second half of the movie. This is something I totally agree and this movie is one such rare gem that made me cry the most. Its just so sad in some scenes. I bet all pet lovers would love this movie and appreciate it as a highly engaging and emotional movie. This is certainly one of my favorite movies and since I am not a pet owner yet, am planning to buy an Akita dog and name it 'Hachi' for he is the hero just as the kid mentions.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I was wrong! Until now I keep on thinking what made this film stood out. I did not cry, I almost wept! This movie is not the kind of film that will move you because of too many dramatic scenes (e.g characters crying a lot), it shows the reality of what normally all of us do everyday and how we relate to our pets. I appreciate how the story was presented, it's hard to tell a story about patience without it being boring at the same time making you feel how hard to wait. More importantly I wanted to praise the sounds that was used, the music itself conveys the story of undying love and devotion. All in all I just love the simplicity of the film that will not give you a doubt that this had happened before. Recommended not just to all pet lovers, but for those who wants to watch a story about faith and love.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

His wife and daughter didn't see hatchi as their dog But her husband/fathers dog and left him behind as soon as he died .The movie also appeared that this dog was living OUTSIDE his hole life besides when he was a puppy .. the dog was always seen OUTSIDE & never allowed inside the home .Besides PARKER & the other main people , no one in the family saw hachi as a part of their family but something they didn't care about .Normal people wouldn't abandon a animal because it wants to wait for its Deceased owner . This movie is horrible , when the family would have taken responsibility and kept the dog in the house so he didn't go to the station to wait . When they do go get him at the station they take him home , where hachi waits at the yard gate waiting to go to the station .In reality normal people would never let go of the last thing that keeps them attached to the one they love . No one in real life would let a animal go to suffer years of homelessness /cold/and no love just so they can wait for a owner who's dead .My grandma died and left behind her pet , I didn't let her pet go and say ""it's okay.""

In my compound, my Brazilian neighbors gave me 5 days ago a copy of a movie: ""Achiko"" with Richard Gere. I got so moved that I am now browsing Internet for learning more about some other faithful dogs such as Greyfriars Bobby (Edinburgh - Scotland), Shep (Fort Benton - USA), Fido (Borgo - Italia),... and so many...My neighbors do not like dogs. They like cats! They were so moved by the movie that they knocked at my door a night, and gave me a DVD, saying, ""JP, you HAVE to watch this...""I did. And days later I just think to myself: ""This word is walking on his head. Here, where I am, I see people dying of hunger, malaria, aids... I should think: there are more important matters than just a story between a dog and his 2-legs companion... But, no. It does not matter if it is a dog or not. It matters if you are, again and again, shown that being loved is a true gem, wherever it comes from.""Cinema is not always about technology, pre-conceived ideas about timing, 600 pages stories and things that should happen.Simon & Garfunkel once sung ""the Sound of Silence"" This movie is the Sound of Silence. The silence of love.I am amazed to see the reviews in IMDb. I sorted by ""Hated it"", and discovered than only 8 comments were below the current average of 8.1 ... and the lowest reviewer gave a 7, which is very very fair! I have seen so many reviews about other films in IMDb where at least some reviewers were saying ""it is the worst movie ... ever"". Here no such thing. It is possible to be unsatisfied with some aspect of the movie, but, as it is based on a true story, and the film has not added ""Hollywoodian"" effects, it stays rather simple, somehow difficult to classify, but it lets a print in your soul.TO ANY ONE READING THIS REVIEW: GO, RUN, FLY, go see this movie.

295,StarGlitter,A true story and one of the best films of all time ! (not exaggerating),10,4 February 2010,"I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners. Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him, This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead. I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years. You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiko Or you can just Yahoo!

So many movies attempt to be so much more than they can possibly manage in 90 minutes, this movie does not do that. Its purpose is stated entirely in the title, a dogs tale. This is a simple movie about a dog. Unlike Marley and Me, the movie is not about the OWNERS of the dog. The owners are obviously in Hachi - but the movie is about the dog, its life and its devotion.

It wouldn't be right to say Hachiko is one such title; because it isn't. But what it does do is make you realize that there is love and faith in this world.I am a movie-buff and have seen enough ""tear-jerkers"" to know what that word means. But it was only with Hachi, did I realize that, at times, when things go dead silent and you have given up hope on yourself, there will be someone or something that will tell you, ""You're not alone."" It made me realize that in today's world, where people complain of backstabbing and disloyalty, this movie will always tell me what it takes to be loyal, and realize what true love is.Watch it. It doesn't matter whether you cry or not at the end of the movie. That's not what the movie attempts to achieve. In fact, I still don't know what this movie's objective is, if any.

""Hachi"" has a great cast in Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander, Erick Avari and others, but the real stars of the movie are three Akitas that play the role of Hachi. Chico and Layla play the younger adult Hachi while Forrest plays the older Hachi. And together with the two Shiba Inus that play the role of puppy Hachi, they really steal the show.""Hachi"" is based on a true story of one dog's loyalty towards his master. The dog is adopted when he was a puppy, by a professor who sees him wandering at a train station. As the dog grows up, he gets into the habit of seeing his master off at the train station every morning, and is back at the station in the evening waiting for the professor when he returns from work. After the master fails to come back on the train one evening, his dog shows up at the train station every evening, day after day, year after year, no matter what - whether it is hot or cold or rainy or snowing. Until finally, one evening, the master finally returns, in a manner of speaking, and takes his beloved dog Hachi with him on a special journey.One of the highlights of the movie is the superb background score by Jan Kaczmarek, who won the Oscar for his work in ""Finding Neverland"". In particular, the closing track, titled ""Goodbye"", is a masterpiece. The beautiful music certainly adds an extra dimension to the movie and heightens its impact on the viewer, and the tunes will linger in the mind long after the movie.While Chico and Leyla, the Akitas that play the younger Hachi are both very impressive, it is Forrest, playing the older Hachi with his melancholy eyes, slow walk and a once-gorgeous coat that has dulled with age, who really tugs at the heartstrings. My heart went out to the 10+ year old Hachi the first time he is seen in the movie. I found myself fervently wishing that something good will happen to him after so many years of waiting for his master! All credit to the actors and the director Lasse Hallstrom for bringing the true story of Hachiko from Japan to an American setting and making a memorable movie of it. I would unhesitatingly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and undoubtedly the best dog movie I have ever seen - even when I consider other beautiful dog movies like ""Marley & Me"", ""Red Dog"" and ""My Dog Skip"".",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
304,zwoopmugen,A wonderful story turned into a completely average and predictable film. A 9/10 if it's the first time you hear of Hachiko though (avoid spoilers).,5,23 December 2020,"While the original story is an absolute 10/10, the movie just drags and is just totally predictable.The cast is good at looking cute and relatable but are as shallow as they can get. There's virtually no character development, the sidestories go nowhere and there's never anything interesting added to the original story. However, we all love dogs so it's hard to even notice these flaws while you look at this quiet Akita being cute. However, it seems the director doesn't know dogs either. For example, the Akita fails to recognize the scent of an important character at one scene. The characters talk to him but the body language doesn't match what they hear as a reply. It's also implied that the dog is somehowe special and loyal to Gere, but for some reason forgot about his previous owner. As soon as you start thinking, every scene falls appart.By the first part of the film I was ready to give it a 3/10, but the ending is actually effective despite the poor execution. For example, there's a scene with a tree over the years. There's this dramatic wind that makes it really work, but on every single other instance you can tell there's absolutely no wind on that place which really breaks the immersion. Either way, I was in tears by the end despite predicting it all so I guess it earned 2 points back.All in all, most of the movie was a complete waste of time. If you wanna cry, just skip to the end.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

You wouldn't wait 2 or 3 hours , let alone a day for he or she. Think about it, would you wait all your life for someone to return. Over time we tend to forget, and move on with our lives. That's in our nature, We humans have the tendency to forget. This story is great portrayal of a Dog who's whole revolves around one man, Parker. Its a simple story told in a simple manner, yet it nearly brought tears to my eyes. The scene of Mrs. Parker returning to the town, and finding old and tired Hachiko still waiting explodes the screen with raw emotion.I have a dog, and he doesn't fetch either.Mans best friend has never been a man.SEE the movie............",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I'm a guy i don't cry about movies i know its fake but i gotta say this one caught me by surprise even tho id watched the trailer and read a few reviews already. by the end of the movie i was in tears absolutely broken down crying my eyes out. and saying that i probably haven't shed a tear in about 8 years for anything but i love dogs and this is the most amazing story I've ever seen this is probably the best movie I've seen in about 10 years and i have seen almost everything.as u can prob tell i would advise everyone to see this and stop and think for a moment if we all cared for each other like we know we should like this movie teaches us wouldn't the world be a better place?,Hachi - A Dog's Tale
307,anupd1990,This movie is pure heart and soul,10,27 February 2010,"This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
308,saberjane19,A dog's unconditional and undying love.,10,30 May 2011,"I don't normally cry after watching a movie, so I am giving this movie a credit for being the first one to do that to me. I literally cried while watching it and even after I watched it, I couldn't believe myself. This movie is truly a tearjerker. The musical score is also very good and appropriate at the most important scenes in the movie. This also let me see the movie through Hachiko's eyes - which really invoked more and more emotion and then totally broke my heart. I would recommend this to dog lovers everywhere. With this movie, you are going to appreciate and see how a dog shows unconditional and undying love for his master/friend. After I watched this, I promised myself that if ever I'll be going to Japan, I'll definitely go to Shibuya station and spend some time beside Hachiko's statue.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
309,surfgrl81,Excellent faithful dog story!,10,11 November 2010,"This is the BEST movie I have ever seen about a dog and his master. I loved how when they showed scenes through the dog's point of view that they made it black and white...if you don't already know dogs are color blind. It made the movie more realistic which is another reason why I loved the movie, they didn't add any out of this world plots and made it more down to earth and real. This movie made me cry, more than once too. I would have to say that my favorite part in the movie was when the dog and Richard Gear where watching baseball and eating popcorn together I thought that was really cute! I also loved the scene when the mom was coming through the train station and saw Hachi waiting at the train station and asked if she could wait with him...ya that made me cry lolThis is must see movie for everyone not just kids!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

311,lemonsaresweet1,A lesson about the meaning of love,10,22 August 2012,"After watching this film I was left touched and remained thinking about it for hours. I realised that this film is not about a dog and a man, but about love and loyalty. Dogs, unlike humans, do not misconstrue love for the need for gifts, flowers and chocolates but recognise it as what it truly is; complete appreciation between two people, or of course any two animals. As the story is real it shows the unbreakable bond that love is. When Cate saw Hachi still waiting I exploded into uncontrollable tears, which continued until well after the movie ended. It demonstrated that although Hachi waited every day that Cate was also devoted as she still also felt that longing for her lost husband and made me empathise with the fact that, although Cate had moved on in her life, it was merely because of the different depth of understanding and responsibility between herself and the dog. Nevertheless, this is very much about the bond between Hachi and Parker, and the undying hope of a dog for him to return. Heartbreaking. 10 stars",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
312,romanamuskinja,Simply beautiful..,10,18 March 2013,"I just finish watching Hachi with friends, when the movie finished we just couldn't breath from crying. It's based on a true story from Japan, story about loyal dog named Hachiko. Hachiko is more than statue or a tale, he was a real dog whose story is known throughout Japan and entire world. The word Hachiko has come to be synonymous with loyalty, and for good reason. Such loyalty, devotion, love, just stuns me. The real story set's foot in 1923, when real Hachi was born. I'm animal person, and I like this kind of movies, but so far this one was the best I ever seen.Who ever did not watch the movie, I friendly recommended that they do.

I wouldn't call myself a ""dog person"" but boy did this just pull my heart strings and make my eyes turn into waterfalls. It was a lovely story overall, really showcasing the strong bond between man and his best friend. Richard Gere is charming as ever and the supporting actors were good too.

But all in all it was worth it, as it makes you believe in love and loyalty to the end, definitely worth seeing. The dog, an Akita, was so amazing. It made me want to look into the breed a bit, but I think the idea is that any dog could be this loving and loyal to their owner. The actors/actresses did a great job, and just knowing it was based on a true story made it even more profound in my opinion. I am glad I did not see this in the theater and at home as I am afraid of how much I would have cried with the big screen, bad enough on my TV at home.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

319,shivamwright,A Remarkable True Story,10,4 January 2020,"Many years back, the very first Hollywood movie that i watched was Richard's nonetheless but ""Pretty Movie"", and since then it has been one of my favourites. And today, when i was roaming on my fb posts, i saw the guide of ""Hachii - A Dog's Tale"". Without talking any second thought, i asked to one of my friends to help me share her Netflix's username & password, with me, to watch this movie, but unfortunately, this movie is not listed on Netflix when i logged in, and it got me left with two wondering words: ""But Why!?"" I checked on Amazon Prime Videos, perhaps, due to an online transaction errror, my cards are blocked for online transactions, i couldn't get this membership. So i asked my another friend to help me whether he has any membership. Luckily, he shared the link with HD quality!! Released back in 2009, though I surfed & watched the movie online in 2020... not just watched but invested the hours with this remarkably scripted ""true story"". Not sure, how i negotiated watching this movie a long back. Silly me. I shan't have underestimated Richard. Richard has been one of the fair & balanced actors. Always a luxury watching his movies.Undoubtedly, it's one of my second fav. movies of Richard's have i just watched. Well written & portrayed. Smoothly touched & directed. And the message to be rendered: ""You should neva forget anyone you have loved"". It's all 'bout loyalty & faith that you put in someone.I can co-relate the message with my or even anyone's real life as well, esp. when it comes to love. Love should be from both sides as it's clearly depicted & shown in Richard's & Joan's case in movie. One sided love is as contagious as any lethal drug eva can be & has nothing to do with loyalty, perhaps good part is, the one you love should be loved with all of your heart. It shows how much you love someone not for getting something in return but having 'em with you. Every day & week & month & a leap of years that you spend with someone gets counted & is always valued.This be another reason why i not just like writing stuffs based on reality, but love watching movies based on reality which are unexceptionally true; & belonged to someone's real life as well. Such movies often make you relate things with ur own life (undisguised), ev'n that has nothing to do with it sometimes. Being a writer, i must say,
People may come & go, but what's remnant behind is their memories. Their love remains alive, esp. the one that you do with all of ur heart without expecting anything in return but their presence in ur life.Happened back in 1925, a true story has this amount of impact to shudder the hearts in 2020. Loved watching this movie. Quite heartfelt & much captivatingly structured in terms or dialogues & characters. Layout, scenes & places have been pretty smoothest as well which made it more finest quality to be watching without getting off track. Looking forward to watching movies more which are more alikely to ""Hachii - A Dog's Tale"".",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

A music professor takes the dog home and unwittingly changes both their lives.This lovely family drama inspired by a famous true-life case of canine devotion. Richard Gere might not be the first actor you'd cast in a slushy animal saga but he's actually just right for the role, as director Lasse Hallström is determined not to milk the story for cheap sentiment. After a slightly wobbly prologue illustrating Hachi's unlikely journey from rural Japan to commuter-belt America, the film takes its time in showing how this four-legged akita puppy becomes an essential part of the household of Gere and his sceptical spouse Joan Allen.The following part of the film describes some very lovely,naughty and some sad moments which involve the dog soming to station every day waiting for his deceased owner to arrive and go to their home while playing with him.But the film certainly is affecting, especially when we learn of its inspiration in Tokyo and the exploits of the real Hachiko.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

We are both animal lovers and it became clear early on that this was not light hearted and it became a difficult watch as you watch the dogs story unfold. You dont want to watch at times because it becomes painful but you do all the way to the sad ending!It is a good film and prompted me to watch the Japanese version, the American one was based on the true story as was the Japanese one but this version is easier to follow and more relatable.I felt compelled to find out more and discovered a book written about the ""Loyal Dog Hatchiko"" - Hachi - The Truth of the Life and Legend of the Most Famous Dog in Japan written by Mayumi Itoh. The book is very compelling and sets out to separate fact from fiction using evidence but also give the reader background on professor, journalist and other people associated with Hachi as well as some background on the times and culture in Japan at the time. The book is very detailed and you realise this film is a simplified version and is more of a summary.I must admit that if you are easily upset or have sensitive children you will find this film difficult to watch and it will definitely leave you in tears.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I'm not commenting on the history of the story, but the horrid execution of the telling of it...one which I'm not convinced even needed to be made into a movie.Many of those who have rated this movie a 10 are falling into the same trap as women who think movies like Dear John or A Walk To Remember are great.

That said, if you want to know nothing about the film, don't read this, just understand that if you *truly* love animals and know how to take care of them, you will be disturbed by this film.)We watched this based on the 8.1 rating, and the numerous 10 and 9 star ratings I saw on the mobile app. Little did I know that the mobile app puts all the best ratings first without giving you a way of re-organizing them into love/hate like the regular site does.The idea that so many people liked this film is ... beyond words. Why? Because it means *that* many people think it's acceptable to neglect and abandon a dog without even an *attempt* to assist the dog in it's grief over it's lost guardian. There are so many disturbing abuses in this film it's hard to recount them all but the ones that come to mind are: -- Making a family dog sleep outside in a shed or doghouse as if that's care-taking -- Letting a dog run the streets alone. -- Letting a dog run around without a collar, no matter how small the town -- The abandonment of a loyal and heartfelt friend of the spouse who crossed by the remaining spouse -- The willing allowance of a dog to become homeless (as one person stated here, would you let a 10 year old do anything s/he wanted to do just because s/he wanted to do it?) -- Lack of any obvious nutritional or medical care -- The callous disregard of the dog's grief without an ounce of compassion for the dog or trying to help the dog understand that his human friend isn't coming home. Not only do they do all these things, but the film tries to make it look magnanimous on the part of the characters. Anyone who believes it is acceptable to treat any animal this way shouldn't have an animal under their care. Anyone who thinks this film is 'heartwarming' clearly doesn't have a concept of animals as family members. If they think they do, they are delusional. I work with animals every day and everyday I have to deal with animals who are in grief and emotionally lost because their people treated them like *property*. If you wouldn't do it to your child, don't do it to your dog, or your cat, or any other animal you consider your 'pet.' I just am so angry that a film like this would even be made. I don't know how animals in 1923 Japan were routinely treated, and perhaps this film could have worked setting it in that place and time, and showing other animals being routinely treated badly so that this treatment might look kind in contrast. BUT the film was set in modern day U.S. and as far as I'm concerned, it is *NEVER* okay in *ANY* time or place to treat a dog like they did in this film. I'm just sorry I looked this film up on the IMDb mobile app first. If I had seen some of the more negative reviews with regard to the treatment of Hachi, I would have never watched this film.

But the visualization is simply wonderful.You don't get to see much of ""my dog does the same"" acts like in Marley and Me , but its about one very special dog, well portrayed and beautifully scripted.Movie is extremely emotional and if you are weak you will most likely need lots of tissues.I could not see the the real star of the movie 's name roll in the credits except for the BOONE's animals for Hollywood. Background score is pretty repetitive although it just manages to do justice to the movie.Richard Gere's performance is neat, the rest of the cast put up a just above mediocre act.Hachiko is brilliant although his part of the script does not involve too much tricks other than waiting in the station.Overall .. Great movie... must watch for all dog lovers and even if not this movie can convert you into being one..",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
338,nainwal,Will not leave you the same,10,6 March 2010,"I think at the end of the day, what matters in a movie is how different it leaves you after you've watched it. It could be technically brilliant and leave you in amazement about how a narrative can be structured, leave you thinking about an issue from a totally unique perspective or just leave you thinking.But if you believe that the impact a movie has on you is important - you cannot afford to miss this movie. I've never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.I read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is 'God' in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it's true.It's a must watch movie.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

But the second time, the third time, the fourth time I watched this film, it just fabulously moved me to tears like the first time I watched it. I cried like a kid terribly punished by his parents, teachers and bros, sisters...Unlike other movies which are related to violence, monsters or disasters, this film is simply about the love between a man and his loyal dog which keeps waiting for him more than 9 years. Slow but sure, every scenes in the film just step by step wins everybody's hearts and make them feel genuinely warm (even when they watch it during the middle of a winter) and peaceful.It's a must-see and I'm sure that you will probably register for an account (if you don't have an account yet) then immediately write a reviews for this film.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

346,bednarfp,Prefer 1987 Japanese Film,6,15 November 2012,"While the American made movie was well done, with very well trained dogs, I feel that the original 1987 Japanese Film was more realistic and even sadder, especially the last third of the movie.Contains Spoiler: At the very end it shows Hachiko laying dead in the snow for about 3 minutes. The stark bleakness of the scene really summarizes the heart breaking story of Hachiko's lifelong enduring love for his master very well.And, perhaps being made in Japan where the real events happened serves to making the 1987 movie seem more like a documentary rather than a Hollywood production. There is a short version of the 1987 movie ""Hachiko Monogatari"" on you tube to compare for yourself.its easy to locate.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Hachi leaved me crying for a hour and I never felt so strongly emotional for a movie. I am dog lover, but still this one will brake even the most strong hearted. I have seen War Horse, it was a beautiful movie but this will still top that.Hachi is based on a true story which has explored many emotions in a single story. Joy and Companionship is the first half and Waiting and Sadness is the last. A touching story about a dog who waited for 9 years for his owner or should I write friend/father/who know? to come back from work and who took his last breath still waiting. The moment where Parker's daughter allow Hachi to go if have to and his wife when she meet Hachi on train station at last is heart breaking.Hachi a movie to remember.

If you want to watch a sad film about a dog, do not watch My Dog Skip (still a very good film) or Marley and Me (not the best) you should watch this as you will have trouble breathing because of how much you will cry. This film is absolutely beautiful and will change your perspective on life.If I were to watch this again, it would be in many years and I would have pre-prepared about 10 boxes of tissues.The storyline of this film is very simple, it is about a man who finds a dog and looks after it. Every time the man (Richard Gere) goes to work, the dog would wait for him at the train station for him to come back, but one day, the owner had a heart attack at work and died.

352,dahelms,True Bonds Never Die,10,24 September 2013,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story about Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, and the bond he forms with a Japanese Akita puppy, which is later found to be named Hachiko, he finds at the train station. Following is the chance relationship that develops between the 2 and how the soon become inseparable. Soon, Hachiko is noted by the inhabitants of the small Rhode Island town for showing up each day to meet Parker as he comes home from work. The Akita breed is most known for the loyalty they forge with their companions, whose loyalty is tested for nearly a decade after tragedy befalls Parker.At times, the point of view is taken so that we feel we are Hachiko, which allows us to see the curiosity, intrigue, and sometimes inquisitive thoughts he feels. One such event is when Parker attempts to get Hachi to play fetch, as he looks back at Parker curious of what is wrong with him. In other instances, when it comes to the onlookers, the angle is set such that we are looking up to Hachi. This leads into the end result of the bond formed between the 2, and that such love and loyalty is an admirable trait. After many viewings of the movie, it still manages to pull out the same feelings. The relationship between Parker and Hachi is believable, memorable and shows us what a true bond is really about. Some of you may have seen Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, or are at least familiar with movies relating to the bond between man and his companions, of the four-legged kind. These types of films show the viewers that whether from the view of the man or the animal, a deep bond means just as much to both.The story reached so deep, that I dreamt of seeing the statue dedicated Hachiko, whose loyalty to his master lasted until his last breath. Luckily, I had the privilege when I passed through Shibuya. Hachiko truly made impression on those around him, as this film will do when you watch it.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I enjoyed the bonding between Hachi and 'Parker', leading up to the end where Hachi begins to feel left out and has less attention from Parker, up until the day Parker finally dies.

I know this film is based on a true Japanese account but it is not hollywoodified, it honours this story and gives full credit to it. This film is so moving, so touching and so honourable in showing a dog's loyalty to his master, beyond death, beyond all logic and reason. In the end of life and beyond, all the remains for all of us is love and the memories of love we have shared with others, be they human or animals. Hachi's devotion to his master, timeless, ageless and unrelenting, makes me weep, no film has ever moved me so much and so strongly. I first saw it in the cinema and was surrounded by grown men and women, some who had taken children to it thinking it was a touching tale that could be enjoyed by families, only possibly to find that it was gut wrenchingly sad and heart-breaking in ways that I can't fully describe. To see Hachi at the end, old, aging, weary but still, still, going to that train station every day at 5pm to wait for his master...I am crying now as I type this.God bless directors who can make films like this that touch people far and beyond the original intention.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I had heard of this film, knew the story, and was hoping for a film about a dog and their owner that wasn't trite, sappy, overly sentimental. This film exceeded beyond all expectations. Richard Gere's performance is spot on. The relationship is deep and honest. It is 180 degrees in the opposite direction of all other animal/dog pics. The POV of the human world by the dog in black & white (dogs are color-blind, BTW) only heightens the finale. If you are not crying by the end of this film, check your pulse. You are dead. RIP.

How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors, Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music, the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it, I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it, can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley & Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book, there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.This is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good, I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did, and while I enjoyed Marley and Me, there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog, but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story, it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover, you will love this film, because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good, but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi.

My husband had suggested this movie saying it was a sad movie about a dog...so of course I was hesitant being that I love dogs.Truth be told though, this movie was so touching, heartwarming, moving and made me realize all over again how powerful the love and devotion between ourselves and our pets can be. If you've ever had a dog, wanted a dog or just like dogs in general, this is a must watch.Without giving the story away...the premise behind the movie is about the loyalty that exists between a man and his dog even beyond life in the physical world. It's proof that love never dies and that animals...dogs in particular...have the uncanny ability to just feel and love without boundaries, logic or reason. They just do and once they're loyal to you, they'll love you forever.Interestingly enough, this movie was based on a true story...which makes it even more amazing. Richard Gere was wonderful in his role and Jason Alexander played a great supporting role and the dog deserves an Oscar. Who knew dogs could act so convincingly? You can actually see the thoughts and emotions in the dog's expressions, and what a gorgeous dog it was. I had never given much thought to Akitas before, but I'm deeply impressed! It'll make you want to jump through the screen and give him a hug.I highly recommend this movie. Just keep some tissues around.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I realize it is based on a true story, but if my father loved this dog like Richard Gere's character loved this dog I would never abandon this dog the way his family did. I would be checking on him daily, feeding him, taking him to the vet, bathing him, providing a shelter, making sure he is well. His awful wife character played by a Joan Allen (lay off the injections because you are unrecognizable) let the dog live at the train station with zero regard to the dog's well being. This movie just made me mad. Richard Gere and the doggo made this movie. Good dog Hachi. You deserved better than the hot dogs the vendor fed you everyday.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
395,DennisR-7,Perspective tidbits,10,18 November 2012,"*** may contain spoilers ***I do not want to repeat all of the (quite valid) reviews.I do want to put a different interpretation on Hachi's emotions. I do not accept the notion that Hachi was too dumb to figure out that Parker was gone. After NINE YEARS, he could surely figure it out. This is not an intellect problem. Look at this from the perspective of a grief model (e.g. denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). Hachi was stuck in denial with possible depression. Where others see loyalty, I also see an intensely emotionally wounded creature. Also, I wonder about the symbolism of Hachi taking up fetching a ball on the day Parker dies. It surely has to have some significance: Parker has the ball visibly on the piano and is clutching it as he dies. From Hachi's perspective, he has made some shift in the relationship, doing something ""unnatural"" to please Parker. The expectation in fetch is that the person having the ball returns it to the the other. Parker has the ball. The onus is on him to return it to Hachi so play can continue. Maybe the symbolism is that when Parker leaves that morning, not only will Parker return home to family and wife but that Parker will return specifically to complete a connection to Hachi.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The fist 35 min is the dog waiting at the train station all happy, then the owner dies and the dog moves away (10 min). Then for the remainder of the movie it sits at the train station.

404,rachit-masti,A feeling of detachment accompanied by a non-stop flow of tears!!,10,15 July 2012,"Hachiko is by far the most amazing movie I have EVER seen. It is a simple movie about a misplaced puppy Akita who finds an owner in the brilliant actor, Richard Gere. From there, they build a story which is the dream of all animal-lovers, a story of love, loyalty, faith, and unconditional care.I have never cried in a movie in my life, and had no idea what it would feel like. Hachiko made me cry for the entire duration of the last half hour of the movie, and at some moments I was weeping so bad, I couldn't even keep my eyes open to watch the scene. Be sure to carry a towel, for your tears aren't going to stop even after the movie ends. It will leave you with a sense of detachment from pets, friends, and family members, you have lost in your life, and with a strong feeling to get a new pet dog.Based on a true story, the movie makes you wanna walk into the screen, pet Hachiko on the head, hug and caress him, and sit with him everyday at the station.And, please make sure you do not watch the movie alone, because that would be the most devastating experience ever.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
405,Alex_Lukic,"Sad, touching movie for all ages...",9,20 April 2010,"First of all, I like to point out that I never wrote anything on IMDb, since I had nothing to tell, but after watching this movie, I felt an obligation to do so...As many people who already commented on this movie, I found myself to be very tough and emotionally untouchable by many things, but since I already have a dog (Golden retriever), I could not but to be touched by how loyal this dog, Hach, was to his master. Fact that this is a true story based movie, only made my experience far more deeper than I originally thought it would be. Yes, family of the professor could take this dog, keep him warm, give him home, or at least let him go every day on station to wait for his master and return him back home. I know I would do that, but somehow, producer of this movie wanted to make story even sadder, so he made it look like this particular dog was all alone on himself. I must tell that this fact somehow made me sad. Solitude is something I would not even wish for my enemies.Because story and family involvement could be better, I give this movie a solid 9 and I must point out that this is very strong rating coming from me because I tend to criticize movies for even a smallest mistakes.Must see movie for all ages. Definitively a movie I will always remember!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I can't remember the last time a movie choked me up, let alone made me cry. This movie is a different story however. This movie broke me. I have been on IMDb for over five years, but this is my first ever review because god damn it I had to write something about this one. It touched me in a way nothing really ever has. My history with dogs might have something to do with that, but quite frankly you have got to be one especially heartless and cold individual if this movie does not get to you. I could probably nitpick if I really wanted to, but why would I? What little flaws the movie may have do not take away from the story. Not only is it one of the most incredible stories I have ever heard, but it also just so happens to be a true one. I don't know what more to say, I'm honestly at a loss for words.

As someone who have dogs for many years and knows all the qualities they have, and how dogs should be treated, even though this movie has many realistic things and it's based on true story, there's some things that made me mad and hopefully people who watch this movie will not repeat the same mistakes the family (In this case, Wilson) made:First of all, even though the dog loved Parker, he still had family, but since they didn't give him much attention he was focused on Parker. It's one mistake the family did.Second, after Parker died, the family tried to take Hachi to his new home but he wanted to return to the train station, they shouldn't have let him do it. They had to re-train him with professional help and never let him stay there. I hope anyone who have/will have dogs will never act like the Wilson family did. They abandoned Hachi. They shouldn't have done it. This made me really mad and sad. Maybe if they were a good dog owners, this movie would never existed but Hachi would got a home.I hope dog owners that see this movie would understand better how NOT to treat your family dog.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.Sometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.This is not just a kids' movie.

Such an amazing movie, such an amazing dog, such an amazing story, and such an amazing message. I recommend this to so many people because no movie has ever touched me quite like this one.

The fact that it's based on a true story made it even more affecting. Anyone who is a dog lover ought to see and enjoy this wonderful film. Hachi nonetheless still has enough to make even the toughest of audiences tear up.

First half of the movie we are all feeling warm and fuzzy, laughing at the familiar goings on between owner and faithful dog. Second half of the movie, after owner dies, I get a big sore lump in my throat that won't go away. Shortly afterward I hear sniffles all around. Our dogs get bigger hugs. Tears begin to stream down my cheeks. Full out sobs by the end of the movie. Light go on. Not a dry eye in the house.The day after, I woke up with tears in my eyes. My son is still crying. My 17 year old daughter is mad at me for showing her such a sad movie. But their dad is reading all about Hachiko on the internet and I am writing a review about the movie (which I never do).This is a truly wonderful movie that will leave you feeling sad, but in a good way.

I did not have to ask how the movie was, they all said out loud that the movie was the worst, ever. I have to agree 100%. It has become a joke now - do you want to watch Hachiko? The answer is obviously: ""No, never ever again!"". The movie manages to make you sad, but even more bored. The rating of the movie just makes no sense. I guess IMDb would never put it on top 250 no matter how high rating it gets. The story and plot is given almost before the movie starts. The actors are good, but they make no good acting in this movie, where they are just as anemic as the plot. Life is just too short to waste on this movie.

The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never ""take flight"" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers.

He came with the professor each time to the train and would just come at the right time to pick him up. To me, it was as if Hachi was protecting him. I have so much to say but little words to use. I really wish that there are words to describe how I am feeling. Just at the middle of the movie, I cried. What happened in the movie just came all of a sudden, and we didn't even notice that such a thing can happen. But it can when it comes to stories that begins with a Wonder then joy and then... I'm sure you guys already know this order. Of what happened in this story, i literally hated it. I didn't want such sadness involved in this story but it was. It taught me something that is really hard to teach to others.

I've told many people about this film already and they all want to see it, and I've warned them all.... you may think your tough when it comes to films, but be warned you'll need tissues. any one thats had a dog/has a dog or any pet really will feel this film get slowly stuck in their throat.

Talking to friends, telling them the story I had to realise that everyone knows the plot from newspapers, from their memories. I think it tells something about it and I do hope that this breed will be recognized for their faith and amazingly friendly nature. Seeing this movie reminded me of her, of course.

422,barryrscott-676-307884,Good Film I am sure but...,7,3 March 2010,"I am almost certain this will be a fantastic film but surely a rip off of the tale of Greyfriar's Bobby (1961) set in 1874's Edinburgh, Scotland.Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night watchman, and the two were inseparable for approximately two years. On 15 February 1858, Gray died of tuberculosis. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, the graveyard surrounding Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town of Edinburgh. Bobby, who survived Gray by fourteen years, is said to have spent the rest of his life sitting on his master's grave. A more realistic account has it that he spent a great deal of time at Gray's grave, but that he left regularly for meals at a restaurant beside the graveyard, and may have spent colder winters in nearby houses.In 1867, when it was argued that a dog without an owner should be destroyed, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers—who was also a director of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals—paid for a renewal of Bobby's licence, making him the responsibility of the city council.Bobby died in 1872 and could not be buried within the cemetery itself, since it was regarded as ""consecrated"" ground. He was buried instead just inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from John Gray's grave.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
423,shibainu01,Some trivia,10,14 March 2010,"The puppies that played Hachi early in the movie were ShibaInus, not Akitas -- Shiba puppies are cuter than Akita puppies so the adult Akitas that played Hachi were selected to resemble the Shiba puppies' coloring (the original Hachiko was gray).My wife breeds and shows Shibas. Late in 2007 she was asked to take her litter of four puppies to RI to be used in making the movie. She scheduled a week's vacation but heard nothing more. Eventually she learned that the initial director had quit and filming was delayed. I think it turned out to be fortuitous because they got Hallstrom to replace the initial director. But by the time they resumed filming my wife's puppies were no longer puppies so she didn't get to go to RI. Still it's great seeing the puppies they did use in the film. My wife only watched our DVD until the professor died but no further. She's a nurse and can handle it when a person dies but loses it when a dog dies.In filming scenes from the dog's point-of-view they shot mostly in black & white just as a dog would see it. Nice touch but not mentioned anywhere that I found. I also had Amazon send a Hachi DVD to my son Frank in Colorado Springs. Not only does he have an Akita but he visited Hachiko's statue in Japan and rubbed its nose. He says it's worn smooth.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
424,toxicavenger-690-882166,Well worth watching by the whole family but be ready for tears,9,20 March 2010,"I was unaware of the facts of the story that generated this film. I happened to run across a reference to it online and decided to check it out further. I am so glad I did. Somewhere there was a statement that Richard Gere pushed hard to get this film produced, and if that is true then all viewers should be eternally grateful to him. In my life there had been three films that brought me to tears during my viewings of them: Bambi, Old Yeller, and E.T. Now there are four. This film is not perfect but the minor flaws do nothing to interfere with the beauty of the love and devotion shown between Hachi and his master. If I ever get the chance to travel to Japan, it will definitely be on my must see list to journey to Shibuya Station to pay my respects to the statue of such a beautiful animal. Hachi was truly Man's Best Friend.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

There were parts that almost made me cry.I rated it 8, however, because after Parker died, I thought the film got very slow indeed. It showed all the time how the dog went to wait for Parker, but it showed that for too long, i think.But apart from that, the film was very good, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is not boring, which attracts both adults and children, however it is not childish and has no unsuitable what so ever. Very good film.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I walked into the video store this evening and grabbed it at random because of the dog on the cover and Richard Gere. I just had a feeling.What can I say, no other film has touched me as much as this and I don't think one ever will. Its off the scale. Its starts off slow but it quickly turns into such an endearing film, it makes you think about things you take for granted and a dog does this better than any actor.I'm a grown man, never cry, this film had me fighting back tears because I didn't want people to see me, I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out after it. I even joined this site to encourage more people to watch it.If you have to see one film in your life time, see this.It breaks all barriers. I was going to make a backup of it, but I want to reward the amazing people who made this film by buying it.I don't think I can ever sit through this film again, but I want it on my shelf as a wonderful reminder.Honestly, this is a film that I will never forget and one I will encourage people to watch at any given opportunity.This film will make any human being cry.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

431,eonflores,unforgettable,10,3 March 2017,"I first came to watch this film through a DVD I came across from a cousin. While it appeared to be some sort of TV MOVIE and A picture of Richard Gere on the cover suggests a family fun movie. Little did I know just how nothing would have prepared me for what was in store for me when I begun watching the film. After all my years of watching movies I could clearly say that I had been a veteran of watching other Dog-Master type of movie/TV series that were guaranteed heart warmers like Old yeller, Littlest Hobo, Homeward Bound , Lassie (the movie) and Marley and Me which in it's own right a comedy turned tearjerker at the end that leaves one with a more endearing want and need to hug your pet Immediately. Hachiko was way beyond all that had come before. IT had me bawling my heart out like this was no movie but an actual reality unfolding before my very eyes and that I had to see for my eyes the heart wrenching scene of seeing A dog's noble dedication of waiting for his master every single day fueled by PURE love. The ending was what teared my soul into seven pieces.. An unforgettable film, and if you are not touched by this movie. you are not human.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
432,edsondesign,"A moving tribute, but be prepared for difficult scenes and lingering sadness",8,15 September 2010,"This film left me in a difficult place to review: it's a beautifully told and acted film that I wish I'd never seen. After three days, I'm still melancholy and teary. I would NOT recommend this film if you are very sensitive, nor is it a film for children. I'm a dog owner who is passionate about all dogs-- and the underlying themes of abandonment, confusion and sorrow Hachi endured completely tore me apart.The film is an exquisitely moving story about the ""real"" Hachi (Tokyo, 1923-34.) I avoid cute tear-jerker films, but this is different. You'll see remarkable scenes of Hachi's face and the joyous bond he felt for his master. But be prepared for tough scenes of a collarless Hachi sleeping under trains in the snow and wandering alone in old age. Only searching out details of the ""real"" Hachi helped me move past the film: though Hachi faced difficulties on the street, he did have shelter and was cared for. After running away from several new homes, a train station manager gave him a storeroom to sleep, and Hachi had access to homes of shop owners nearby. Hachi still kept his schedule of waiting daily for his master to return on the train, but his basic needs were cared for as best as people did in the 1930's. He lived to be embraced by many who came to feed him and pat his head for good luck, even attended the ceremony for his own statue being installed. Some accounts even say Hachi saw his master's body at the wake, and sat faithfully near him all night. Stories are exaggerated after 80 years, but I hope it's true, as I've heard this helps dogs understand and ease their grief.If you can handle it, watch this film for an memorable interpretation of Hachi's story. If you have a hard time shaking things off, you'll be better off reading about Hachi's noble soul-- and the enduring devotion he felt for his master, far beyond death.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

434,sadviewer,"Could Be a Fabulous Film, But It's Not",3,28 September 2010,"I'm glad to see there are reviews here that don't just eat this story up with a spoon. It has the potential to be an amazing, inspiring film, but it falls way short on all fronts. As one blogger said, ""it tries to impart an Asian sensibility of 'animal as individual' that doesn't work in a contemporary American setting.""If the filmmaker/screenwriter is going to take the fact-based story (and who really knows how much of that is true) as the bones of a contemporary film set in a completely different country, then he needs to elevate all aspects of the story to match. There are plenty of reviews here that illustrate the major flaws in screen writing, characterization, and the like. But how could the movie have reached the level of that inspirational, life-changing synopsis it claims to be? First of all, there is no rule that the wife can't attach to the dog and love it, and still have the animal's primary loyalty be toward the husband. Many animals bond much more with one family member. Creating a character who comes across as not caring for the animal her husband so loves, leaves the viewer wondering what he saw in her in the first place. It's contradictory to love.If the animal really ""inspires a whole town"" as the synopsis claims, why doesn't a whole town come together and take care of him instead of patting him on the head, saying a brief hello, and throwing a scrap of food? When the dog refuses to stay at the daughter's house and travels miles back to the train station, it's reprehensible that she opens the gate and lets him again find his way back over dangerous (and being an animal on the streets is always dangerous) territory. Why not have her take him back and work out something with the people there (train master, vendors, local store owners) that allows him to live at the station as he so desperately needs to do. She never checks on him again, which leaves the viewer cold and wondering how she sleeps at night.Her son (who starts and ends the story about Hachi his hero) is growing up the whole time the dog is waiting at the station, yet she never takes the child to meet the dog. What a lesson and inspiration it would have been to visit him and bring food and bedding on a regular basis in order to ensure the dog's comfort and safety. Teaching the child that sacrificing for those we love, including our four-legged family members, is part of the experience of life would have enriched this film in so many ways. Instead, the boy, at the end of the movie, says this all happened ""a long time ago,"" as if it were decades before his birth. No one in the family ever seems to check in or make sure Hachi is okay, and the wife only stumbles across the dog, and is surprised to see him, when visiting her husband's grave on the ten year anniversary of his death. The dog sleeps under an old train in freezing conditions, and no one seems to care. The scene where the family is looking at old pictures of Parker with Hachi is heart wrenching and dumbfounding. What did they tell the child: ""Oh, yeah, the dog wanted to wait for Grandpa so we let him run free and fend for himself on the streets. Not sure if he's still alive or not.""Had the town come together to watch over this loved animal and offer him solace and physical and emotional comfort in his grief as a tribute to the man they all have so much respect for, it would have made this the inspirational, uplifting film it has the potential (and right) to be. It never does that.This is not a film any child should see and one most adults (and animal lovers) should avoid. It breaks the viewer's heart--for all the wrong reasons.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

Not many movies move me the way this one did. I loved the scenes when Hachi was a puppy and Parker began bonding with him - especially watching the baseball game together the night he didn't want to leave him alone. I also appreciated the scenes that were shot through Hachi's eyes - watching Parker share his love with his wife and daughter, spotting Parker out of a busy crowd...so sweet. The scenes towards the end, when Hachi is old and still comes to the station every day had me bawling like a baby. Especially when Parker's wife returns and sits with him for a while. The dog that they chose to portray ""old Hachi"" with had the slow gait and sad eyes really stole my heart away. And when Hachi reunites with Parker in his dying dream - - that just got me thinking about every pet I have lost and hope to meet again someday too!! This movie is truly a beautiful representation of undying love and faithfulness and even though it made me very sad, it absolutely captures every emotion of the human spirit and that's what makes this movie so wonderful.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The emotional connection between Hachiko and Richard Gere is absolutely real. If one ever wants to know what love really is, then one should watch the movie and see for oneself through the heart of Hachiko.We assume humans as the most intelligent species but watch for yourselves, isn't there an abundance of intelligence portrayed by the dogs which played the character of Hachiko?

This is one movie in my lifetime that i cannot watch again because it was most difficult for me to watch Hachi's loneliness and yet his never ending love and wait for his master. I actually cried and felt difficult in breathing and I was happy crying because it made me more humane, sensitive and understanding. It told me much about life that its not about being with people for materialistic reasons but its about being and waiting for our loved ones for no reason even if they are not coming back because if we love and care for someone it should be true to our own hearts.

443,jackbor98,Easily the saddest film I have ever seen.,10,2 November 2012,"I was told by friends and family that this movie was sad, having never cried over a movie before, I was skeptical. The film begins when Parker Wilson, a college music professor, finds a dog, Hachiko, at the local train station and decides to bring him home. Parker's wife, Cate Wilson, orders her husband to find Hachi a new home, but, after seeing Parker and her daughter, Andy, enjoy the dog so much, she decides that the dog will be kept.. Fast-forwarding a few years, and Hachi follows Parker everywhere, one day, as Parker returns from work via train, as he does everyday, Hachi is waiting for him, and Hachi walks home with him, this continues everyday for the next few months, until one day, as Parker is working, he has a heart attack and dies...

It's a wonderful sad story that leaves you heartbroken and tearful, and one cannot help but to feel the pain and sadness that Hachi felt. It leaves you wondering how a dog can have so much love and devotion when there are people out there who cant even show half the loyalty and love for each other as much as Hachi did for his master. Knowing Hachi's story I cannot help to feel wanting to be a better person and human, this movie leaves it prints in your heart/soul and is a story you will not forget. I have to say that Lasse Hallstrom did a terrific job with this movie, if not one of the best movies he has made.I give Hachi's story a ten because his story touched me deeply in a way nothing ever has. Living me wondering how unique this dog was and how loved he was and still is by us people who knows his story and devotion, and yes sometimes a dog really is a mans best friend, like Hachi. Undying love and bond for a master who did not return until the day they met again, a day Hachi waited for for ten years. Definitely a movie worth watching.

Bond of the dog with Parker is so strong that it make him to wait for his master from the day of his(parker's) death to his(hachiko's) death. You can't really control your emotions seeing the dog waiting everyday at same time and how the other people like carl,jasjeet feeling the pain. The most emotional scene for me was when Cate comes back after 10 years of her husband's death and see Hachi still waiting for her dead husband at the train station and seeing the dog's condition you just feel a sharp pain. You ask a question to yourself ""if the dog has so much love in his heart why the humans are becoming so cold?""Hallstrom did a commendable job, cinematography is great, portrayal of Hachi's pain and loneliness is very well expressed and Richard gere was flamboyant!

Must Must Watch, I would say... even if you don't have a dog, you would love this masterpiece This was movie part... now coming back to original stuff...The movie is the real story of an Akita dog born in November, 1923, in the city of Odate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924 he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Eisaburo Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo. During his owner's life, Hachiko saw him off from the front door and greeted him at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station.Even after Ueno's death in May, 1925, Hachiko returned every day to the station to wait for him, and did so for the next 9 years, till his death.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
457,Eostrix,Complete masterpiece everybody should see!,10,24 August 2016,"This movie is not only the beautiful movie that is completely well-made by every point of view but it is something that gives you something more. It is beautiful piece of art inspired by real life and the most strongest, most beautiful parts of it. I believe that this movie moves most of the people's feeling and emotions and for me it was definitely a catharsis-like experience. These people who are not moved by this movie...I must admit that I believe they are not been concentrated when watching it or they are the most cold-hearted beings. Movie itself is based on real life story and it's about the strongest connections and feelings between animal and human. And it is so beautifully made - structure, dialogues, acting, music, camera-work...everything is just perfect. It should be watched with your closest ones - with those in front you can naturally cry without holding yourself back because then the catharsis is stronger and you can fully express you feelings and after you get over this movie you can turn to life as a better person.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
458,kukistars,A must watch.!,10,16 October 2014,"If you don't cry after watching emotional movies ,have a shot at it... and its a bet.you cry for sure.. awesome movie..!!! Brilliant play of the actual Hachi story.. Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!""Love and Loyalty"" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never ""take flight"" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
459,treli_katsika,my favorite movie,10,30 December 2011,"This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I could easily characterise it as my favorite one since it's the only movie it've made cry for about 20 minutes.It's a movie which can easily make you love animals and believe in dog's royalty and all these stories have been told about it.It demonstrates the value of love without the demand of response, without conditions and selfishness. That's a love that only a pure and kind animal like a dog can share. It's almost impossible to be found in humans. That's why when you are surrounded by dogs even homeless ones you can never feel lonely or abandoned. Because these cute creatures will treat you like you are their beloved king.Some people unfortunately take advantage of this. So please never treat with cruelty an animal because this is not what their pure loveful soul deserves.Just watch this movie and you'll understand.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
460,JaswanthReddy,One of the Best movie i have watched in recent times..,9,30 November 2011,"I registered to IMDb now itself to write a review of this movie.Firstly i am feeling bad of missing to see this movie for 2 years.Not the least i am glad to see this masterpiece now.I have heard in some others reviews that the dog in the movie should receive Oscar award, its worth giving an Oscar for that one.You wont find Richard Gere acting , he just lived it.I am so moved for one particular scene where Allen meets Hachi(dog) at the station waiting for deceased master after 9 years of his death.The music,photography were brilliant.You wont regret after watching this movie....It will touch your heart for sure and you will remember it for a long time.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

463,arch_garcia,Couldn't help but cry and cry,10,27 December 2011,I got this movie through I-tunes and was watching it on my IPOD at work. Prior to that my girlfriend told me about this movie and that it was a complete tearjerker. So at the second half of the movie when Richard Gere died I felt my eyes started getting watery and when it came to the last part my eyes were flooding with tears and I tried so hard to hide it from my co-workers since I'm a huge well built guy crying out of nowhere. After watching the movie I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her that I've seen it and when I told her about the climatic part at the end I still couldn't help but cry again. A definite must see movie!,Hachi - A Dog's Tale

465,ssmomaya,Everyone should see this movie at least once,10,6 February 2012,"I Live in Mumbai (India), I work for Private finance company. I have always loved Dogs very much but this movie has changed my thoughts about this animal. This was a class of its own movie on really touching story, I do not find words to express my feelings. I don't have words to explain such things. Its beyond my Knowledge & Power. Even a small animal like Dog can show True Love. I m very small person but still I will suggest that every one should see this movie once. Thanks a lot to movie maker team for giving such a wonderful & touching gift. Thanks again. Movies like this will change the way people think about these animals.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It's definitely the most emotional movie I've ever seen with rainy eyes.Good old Hachi gave me a true amounts of love, patience and loyalty that nobody could in my life. He is my Hero, my teacher, my guardian! Love you Hachi.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
467,tyrancy,Sleeper Hit,10,24 March 2012,"Although you may find the trailer to be emotional, the movie pulls you in even more.A story of friendship, dedication, commitment and love. Faithfillness, sacrifice and more.If only humanity, or even couples could find such devotion to each other the world would be a far better place.I can't even talk with friend about this movie with out it stirring in me a deep welling of emotion. There is something about this movie that moves in me a profound sadness and sorrow, yet a deep joy that love, as represented in this film, is possible.Even now tears well up as I relive in my mind the last moments of this film. It is a must for anyone who enjoys a solid plot, character development and animal acting that is imperceptible. As other reviews have said, it is as if Richard and the Dog were a natural fit.This movie is now on my favorites list, but I am not sure I can handle watching it again soon. Have a hand to hold, a shoulder to lean into and tissues at the ready. I am generally a stone, this movie brought forth water from a stone.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
468,lovedrizzymusic,One of the most touching movies I have ever seen!,10,1 May 2012,"I never write reviews for any movie, but Hachi took my heart like no movie has in the past. I just finished watching it an hour ago on Showtime and I just stopped crying a few minutes ago. This movie has shifted my way of thinking and I don't think I will ever forget this movie. I just wish that every movie was as heartwarming as Hachi, the dedication, loyalty and love he showed for his owner touched me in a way that no other movie has. I wish all movies were this warm and touching, unlike the drug, violence and sex filled crap we get nowadays. I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody! After watching this movie, I am definitely considering getting an Akita when I get my own place.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
469,wille-388-100261,A historic cinematic experience like no other!,10,8 February 2018,"Hachi: A Dogs Tale is a masterpiece and a classic. It will move you to tears, and make you laugh. It will even exite you - yes, despite what you might think, there actually are moments of genuine suspense in this movie! It's by no means a thriller, but it still manages to get your heart pumping! I almost jumped out of my seat during the scene in the garage! People need to see this movie, movies like this just don't come around often. In some ways, it even changed my own life for the better. When thinking about Hachi, I always strive to be better than I am, to never give up, and to always believe that anything is possible. This might be the most important movie you will ever watch! It really has everything, an exiting, thrilling and heartbreaking story, lovealbe and relatable characters that are incredibly portrayed by Richard Gere and Joan Allen. This is without a doubt Richard Gere at his absolute best. The fact that he never won the Oscar for this is an outrage. It should be studied (and probably is) in acting schools everywhere because what they have managed to achieve here is nothing short of magical! Every scene, every cut is brilliantly concieved, there are nothing in this movie that is filler or unnecessary. You sit on your toes and are constantly floored by just how magnificent this movie really is. It will entertain you while at the same time cause you stop and think about what's really important in life. I will cause you to question your very own existence, to think about what is possible, what a dog is capable of and what really makes us all human. WOW! This film is history. It stands alone. It raises the bar for how movies as a medium should be viewed in our society. See this movie now, and then see it again a thousand times. Then watch it again.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The dog in the movie is so cute and he is even cuter as a puppy.The movie would lead to an intense consternation,if u have ever lost someone or have ever loved someone truly then this movie is just going to break you down like anything.Although i had already known this true story but never watched this movie but after watching it..i felt it worth watching.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I didn't think I would cry as much as I did last time round, however I cried more, I do cry at films, but Hatchi breaks me. The story is so deep and emotional, it makes my lips tremble. Being the second time I have watched it, I started to cry as soon as I seen Hatchi at the beginning. Everyone needs to see this film. Any film is a 10/10 if it can have this affect on you. The music is outstanding, very heart warming. Even after the film had ended I find myself crying an sniffing still.This is the first review I have ever written for a movie, but I felt it had to be done.

472,eldeniz-axundov,This movie strongly reminds me something...,10,4 February 2017,The movie affected me in a way that I can't imagine and express. In my whole life I always wanted to be a strong man maybe for the favor of my family or myself but this time I release all my feelings and start crying to accept the reality of my nature. I am strong and emotional guy and this movie helped me to better know myself. For the first time I watched I was a member of English conversation club and there was hell of crowd. By that time I didn't know anything about the movie. But after the session I couldn't stand there and discuss and run straight home watched it again cried cried and cried until I felt my tears run out. It reminded me my father. After you lost people close to you you understand one thing. No matter how much you wait they are not coming back. The only thing left from them is the memories you have been in together and those memories shapes your personality.,Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I literally cried my ass off, I don't even remember when was the last time a movie made me cry that much! This is my first review of a movie ever in my life and I signed in just to review this movie. The last 20 minutes are heart breaking and that wonderful soundtrack....oh ...I just have to warn you not to be emotionally drained because it will make you feel sad....just remember that love is stronger than life and death!

475,anyfreegift_com,Excellent movie,10,5 October 2012,"I started watching this with my 2 children tonight. We made it to the part where PArker is in the class with Hachi's ball, then it was time for their bed, but not before recording the rest. I managed to catch the last 10 minutes, and I'm dying to see all I recorded with the kids in the morning.That said, this movie ends incredibly sad, but also included happy tears to see the grandson, especially with his own dog afterward. This movie was beautiful. Plain and simple. No shoot em up action, no curses, no sex nor drugs. Just a beautiful story with a very tear jerking ending.ITs rare that I cry so much, but this movie made me do just that, even as I explained the movie to my wife, hours later.Highly recommended!!!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

477,Jantj2000,Unable to keep your eyes dry,10,15 October 2012,"Let me first say that I really love this movie. Yesterday was the third time I've seen this movie and it still touches me a lot. When the professor dies and Hachi is waiting at the train station for his boss like always, not knowing he won't be coming back anymore, that is really devastating. But Hachi shows his true loyalty by coming back every day.I was very happy to see that Hachi, although he was living like a street dog after the death of the professor, was given good care by all the people around the train station. Even the grumpy train tickets sales man showed some affection after a long time.The saddest part for me is seeing old Hachi stumbling to the train station. At some day the wife of the professor is visiting the town again. On her way back to the train station she is so surprised by seeing Hachi still waiting there. It was really satisfying for me to see that she still had the change to say Hachi goodbye because he would die soon after she leaves again.At the end of the movie old Hachi closes his eyes to remember his boss. Running around as a little puppy side by side with the professor. He knows it is finally time for them to meet again. Rest in peace Hachi!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

This movie is based on a true story of faith, devotion and unconditional love of an unbelievable bond between a man and his dog. Over the years I have seen it several times and each and every time it's like the first. I can be somewhat sensitive and emotional with some movies but, thisHow I cried. It was such an overwhelming feeling that my heart ached for Hachi and his family. I cannot think of a single movie that moved me in such a way that it almost felt real. Richard Gere of course did a fantastic job but, me being a dog lover the majority of the credit goes to Hachi. (I am a true fan!) Thank you Hallmark Movie Channel for airing such a superior heartfelt movie.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I would highly recommend a box of tissues be handy while watching. Such a beautiful dog the Akita. We are the proud parents of two beautiful chihuahua's. A male and female and they are every bit as loving and loyal. They are always happy to see you whether you have been gone for many days or five minutes. They are our sweet babies and we love them dearly. They usually go with us every where we go!We went on a long three month tour of the USA and they went right along with us. They sleep with us. They love us unconditionally. I cannot imagine life without them.

""Hachi"" is a wonderful story about love and friendship.The plot is excellent,music is fantastic and acting is great,too,but this movie is absolutely breathtaking because of it's message,which is quite simple and yet so complex:love is THE prime power in the Universe.I haven't been so touched by a single movie in my life.Not even with ""The Notebook"".I saw this movie with my girlfriend in my room,and we didn't blinked for the last 30 minutes of the movie.Although I don't like to express emotions in this volume,I just needed to cry.In the end,we hugged each other and it was the best hug of my life.

483,l_j_whitaker,90 minutes of utter drivel,1,28 January 2013,"At first I wanted to give it a chance. After 1 minute I knew I was in for a shocker. Firstly the acting was a shambles. Secondly, the acting was a shambles.Thirdly, when is Richard Gere going to give up and move into a home. The moving was as slow as an asthmatic ant with a hip replacement moving a mountain. Why the dog doesn't die in the first ten minutes to solve all the problems I don't know. If I was blind and deaf I still wouldn't give it 10 stars. Frankly, Richard should be ashamed of himself.He has let his country down. My sum of all fears is this movie becoming a success, unfortunately it appears that it may be, so my final question is, who do we blame, the director, Richard or the dog. This is the peoples decision. I can't make this. But you can, please everyone think what you have watched. is poison to the mind and an insult to humanity. One day Hollywood will make a good dog movie, maybe about a war dog, because this is unacceptable. Yours sincerely the most sensible movie critic on earth (apparently).",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It's quite simple story but in the same time great and true story, I liked the performance for all the cast and music it was suitable also the dog was trained well. We got many messages through 90 minutes and really I can't imagine how come the dog for more than 9 years going in same place every day and in the cretin time to wait his friend something I think we can't find in the humanity . I found through that movie how far we are missing Wright now the meaning of love, loyalty and hope which are the greatest feelings in our life ever.

486,banglar-chhele,Best,10,23 June 2013,"Okay, it's not hip to love films that rely so much on sentiment, but...damn, I loved this movie! The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well. It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course. I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the ""toy"" breeds, although they can be cute). It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness. Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog. Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi. And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station (everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him. Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie. The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will. Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and ""cheap sentiment."" (Funsuckers). If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized. That's okay. The story still hits home. And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors! The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's perspective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on. I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work ""The Cider House Rules,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" etc). This is no exception. Two paws up!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

The characters seemed so real, they touched my heart even when I saw the movie the second time around. Hachi's devotion to his master was incredible and yet so real. I remember my own dog waiting for me each day and when she saw me get out of my car, she would try to talk to me as though to say, ""I missed you. Where have you been?"" Now that she's no longer with us, I'm the one who looks for her each day when I come home.

Richard Gere is in it and it's about a dog and I love dogs so let's watch it!"" So I watched it and by the first 10 minutes I was absolutely immersed in it. The cute moments Hachi and his master had with each other, <3 <3 <3But then Richard Gere died and my heart broke. Still I kept watching it. My mom and my older sister were with me and my mom, being utterly emotional, began to sob. My sister and I were stronger than that so we kept watching. Joan Allen moved out of her old house and we felt sad seeing Hachi upset. The dogs who played Hachi did a marvelous job. Anyway, Hachi left his master's daughter's house and began to live homeless, just to get the opportunity to visit the station and wait for his master. Alas! He never came!Now my heart began to melt. The heartbreaking moments began now. Hachi lived by himself, and despite sufferings like cold weather and hunger and thirst, he kept waiting. Who does that?Only dogs! Soon nine years passed by and Hachi grew weak and old. He was slow and suffering yet he walked almost miles just to wait for his master at the station. Who does that? Dogs!One day, Joan Allen returned to visit her husband's grave and found Hachi at the station. Now she could fathom how deeply and truly Hachi loved her husband. ""You don't have to wait for him anymore, Hachi. He's never coming back.""This triggers a tear in me.""Grandma, how did Grandpa find Hachi?"" ""Actually, it was Hachi who found your grandpa.""More tears!""I never met my grandfather, he died when I was just a little baby. But when I hear about him and Hachi, I feel like I know him. They taught me the meaning of loyalty. That you should never forget anyone that you loved. And that's why Hachi will forever be my hero.""I hide my face to hide the tears.Then came the ending. Hachi dying and reuniting with his master. The background music perfectly matched the melancholic yet happy moment.That did it!I sobbed and sobbed and so did my sister.

I watched this movie today and what I felt after watching it that every movie lover must watch this one. The movie is well-scripted and well-acted at the same time that let you connect with the characters more personally. It clearly depicts emotions of an animal towards human especially when it comes to loyalty. The incidents in the movie are well connected and reveal how an animal could be so loyal to his or her master. No doubt, the main character of the movie is Hachi, the dog, but others have performed their part elegantly. Watching such kind of flick is unforgettable as it made me cry only because of its beautiful piece of narration and Hachi. Thank You...",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

493,m_airini,Hachi & Richard Gere = Outstanding,10,8 January 2011,"I've just watched this on DVD. I was intrigued with a synopsis and also, it was based on a true story. Not that I know it was a beautiful crafted story of a dog's loyalty of his master, knowing that his master was in danger and yet still HOPEFUL that he will return. And so he waited for 9 years after until his death.I do watch a fairly amount of movies with dogs or cats as the main actor. However Hachiko was truly different. This dog is smart, love his owner and doesn't really care about anything else. His whole world was about his owner and died with it.Richard Gere and Hachi relationship in the movie was truly remarkable. Both gave a sincere acting that makes you love the dog and love the owner. I ached and sobbed non-stop at the ending which shows Hachi that has aged, looked dirty, homeless and yet HOPEFUL and waited for his master to come home. I also felt relief when he died peacefully.It relates back to our own lives when we searched and looked and ""gave-up"" -- yet this dog never did give up.This is a wakeup call movie that inspires you to do more with your loved ones and love them with unconditional love. You should buy the DVD and watch it over and over again when you feel lost or helpless, because Hachiko never gave up.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I can never control my tears.. this is the movie of lifetime..love you Hachi..Hats of to the director and so much love and respect for Richard Gere who made the movie extremely real and worth watching by his presence.

495,potatohog,Where's the loyalty TO the dog?,1,3 July 2013,"Putting aside the trite story-telling, and the cheap camera tricks, this movie has two glaring problems.For one - it's another example of the white-washing of Hollywood. This is a Japanese tale. Why did it have to transported to America? Why couldn't it be told in Japan, with Asian actors? Why rob more minority actors of roles that should by rights be theirs? Think how much richer and more interesting the movie would have been if it had portrayed an accurate portrayal of Japanese culture for American audiences! But my larger issue is from the animal welfare point of view. Of course Hachi shows great loyalty to his owner - but where is the family's loyalty to him? They abandon him to the streets for 10 years, to survive on scraps and hot dogs, and sleep under rail cars. And then they hug him, and cry, and talk about his amazing loyalty? Then, after Hachi freezes to death, they give the little boy his own akita. Sure, that makes it all better.Thanks, Hollywood, but I expect and demand better.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

I highly recommend this to people of all ages.

But let me tell you that my big brother is 26 at that time, and he was crying even harder than me. He even sobs a lot. And the only time I have ever see him cry was when our Grandpa passed and when we were watching this movie. The moment we got out of the theater, we saw a lot of people with red eyes holding tissue and some even still trying to suppress their sobs. No one talked, no one excitedly chat about how awesome the movie is to each other because I really think that everyone already know and feel how awesome it is without them having to say a word.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
501,tzaoo3,Highly overrated and in fact quite silly,5,25 August 2014,"So I got interested in this movie seeing it had received such good ratings on IMDb and also since people unanimously shared their tearful experiences with this one.My initial gut feeling was: how irrelevant a movie must be that centers such a great deal on an animal character. Was this yet another Lassie type movie? The cover certainly made an impression of this. 1,5 h, also seemed like a pretty modest run time for a movie that is supposed to get you carried away. Despite conflicting thoughts, I decided to not go with my cynical side, caught this movie and loaded it up. Straight away I found my empathy button pushed. The little Hachi is easy to consider cute and I wondered what events would follow the dog's entry in the life of Richard Gere's character, let alone the little creature interacting with the rest of the family- not as thrilled over sudden thrown upon dog ownership. As the movie progressed I got increasingly more unfulfilled, though. There really is not much going on story-wise and the acting is mediocre at best, which makes it hard to feel for any of the characters. Furthermore, the-world-seen-through-Hachi's-eyes-shots are embarrassingly trivial and the absence of these would have made a better film. I guess this story about the dog who waited for his dear master to arrive better suits as an exceptional anecdote, shared on an encyclopedic website, rather than as a full-length feature film. After all, is it possible to depict animal depth with credibility, which this movie tries to do? I started watching this movie with a smile but ended up feeling horribly regressed for having given it a chance. Lessons are to be learned from this, IMDb ratings should be taken with a grain of salt and from this point on I shun movies that feature dogs as main characters. If you wish to get moved, ""The Elephant man"" is a better choice; it has incredible acting and displays immense beauty in the worst ugliness. Moreover, I believe the film ""Turner & Hooch"", which is dog-oriented too, is more enjoyable than his one whilst not claiming to be a masterpiece or as heart-wrenching.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
502,chilukurikrishnabharathr,Excellent Movie............,10,24 August 2015,"Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away. It is the story of bonding between the dog and its owner. The film is moving at slow pace following the events of ordinary life and has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes. Hachi is found on train platform by a professor (Gere) when it was puppy and the professor wants to keep it with him. It is a faithful companion and friend to Owner, alerting him of potential dangers and accompanying him to the train station each morning and meeting him there after his return trip each evening. One day professor passed away, but Hachi comes every day to the station and waits for him to arrive.This film moves around Richard Gere and the dog. Richard Gere makes awesome performance, he bonds really well with the dog and it never feel like watching an actor at all it genuinely seems to be a movie with his own dog. His bonding with the dog is very authentic in its essence. This is a fantastic, feel good movie and recommendable to people of all ages.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

It is altogether incredibly touching, and most families with dogs will be able to relate with the story. It has a very sad ending, which most people have been either told or have figured it out themselves. Before watching this, one should be prepared for a devastating ending. Go and buy tissues before pressing PLAY. This movie can be watched with the whole family, as it does not contain explicit sexual material, but parents should consider whether they want their children to be hit by this movie, as it may affect and impact kids in a way that not all parents would like.

The true story does not translate well to American culture or modern times. What normal family would let their beloved pet live on the streets for 10 years, even through harsh winters? I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.And then the wife visits the town she left nearly ten years after her husbands death and acts like she is so surprised to see the dog living at the train station, like she didn't know that. It was her own daughter who let the dog out to return to the station.The wife didn't seem that distraught at her husbands funeral: the love of her life who died suddenly and prematurely. She acted like she was at some distant cousin's funeral.

This film plays on feelings, with surprisingly simple but so authentic! I, who do not easily let go of tears at the sight of a film, I have confessed that there, I took a huge slap in the face, and I especially cried until 15 minutes after the end of the film. .. he is one of those films that mark you for life, and that you were watching one, two, thousand times, it will always make you the same effect: it will make you melt.

I also found myself questioning Hachi's loyalty for a few brief moments. A famine or, perhaps, a devastating pyroclastic flow enveloping all in its path could have convinced me of his loyalty, but the director removed these scenes from the final cut for some reason.The dog wasn't credited at the end of the film.

515,thomaspaige,Bring a tissue!,10,23 February 2016,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a heartwarming story about a man and his best friend. Based on a true story from the year 1925 in Tokyo, Japan, this film won't leave one eye dry. In this tear jerking film, Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, finds an Akita puppy lost in the train station. With no other option, Professor Wilson takes the puppy, Hachi, home with him. Throughout the movie an unsuspected friendship forms between the two, and they find themselves tangled in an unforgettable relationship that will change both of their lives forever. For such a strong movie, the script is rather simple and a little boring at times, being mostly monologue when Professor Wilson talks to Hachi, you can see the simple responses from Hachi in his longing looks and his deep caring eyes. The rest of the script includes side conversations between the professor's wife, played by Joan Allen, and their daughter, played by Sarah Roemer, just to name a few. Every side conversation throughout the movie connects to either Professor Wilson's past or to his relationship with Hachi. Even though the script is weak at times, I believe it was executed with great taste and worked well with the overall look and feel of the movie. To complement the script, the cinematography in Hachi was simple, but artfully done. The music playing in the background is always the same song - a song to which the professor is choreographing a dance to for one of his classes. The tempo of this song is slowed down and sped up depending on the mood of the scene, creating a more dramatic effect. Along with the music, the color of the scenes throughout the movie change very little. Much of the movie is bland with a gray overtone, causing Hachi's red fur coat to stand out. In some scenes the viewer gets to see through Hachi's eyes. In these scenes, the camera is angled from below, and the film is in black and white, just as Hachi would see it. This was a neat component that brings the viewer closer and more connected to Hachi. Along with the cinematography, the acting was outstanding. Richard Gere does a great job portraying Professor Wilson. Acting with a dog is a difficult task, but Gere did it effortlessly. Watching Hachi and Gere interact was as natural as a bee finding a flower. It seemed as if Gere and Hachi had been together for ages, even though they had only met to film the movie. The bond between them seems as real as the bond between two best friends - it's unbreakable.I don't see how anyone could stay dry-eyed during this movie. This unforgettable film is a great example of loyalty and friendship, and provides a perfect story to show the age old connection between a man and a dog. Hachi: A Dog's Tail is great for the whole family, which is rare to find in this day and age. It's a must see movie, not only for dog lovers, but for everyone.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

To everyone who loves animals whatever they may be, cat, dog, rabbit, bird, watch this movie with a opened heart. They love you if you love them back.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
527,hopephil,Mournful and melancholy,3,3 September 2011,"Before I watched this movie all I knew was that it had an IMDb rating of 8.0, and I'd seen a one-line comment that called the movie ""heartwarming"". I was therefore expecting a family-friendly movie that would be warm and uplifting. It is exactly the opposite.Be prepared for an insipid production that, despite Richard Gere, has no noteworthy acting. The characters are not engaging and even the dog is detached and aloof. There is little of visual interest since virtually the entire movie is filmed at the protagonist's home, or at the small railway station in a dismal town.Although the message the movie tries to portray is one of commitment and devotion, it is a slow-moving and depressing story filled with disillusionment and death.Unless you enjoy movies that offer little other than tragedy, stay away!",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
528,kerry_d-95828,"The saddest, most endearing film. A must watch.",10,17 January 2021,"This film is one of the most beautiful, heart wrenching films I've ever seen. Dogs are just the most precious things in the world. So glad I watched this film, even if I did ball my eyes out nearly all the way through. A true tale of loyalty, love and loss.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
529,srawda-1017473,"We identify with Hachi and feel compassion for him, especially in his later years, because we, too, know what it means to be separated from our Beloved.",10,29 November 2017,"As he grows up, Hachi bonds more deeply with his human friend. The dog is so devoted to the professor that he accompanies him every day to the train station for his commute to work. At night, Hachi waits just outside the station doors for him to return for a joyous reunion and the walk home.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
530,microcare,Incredible,10,3 December 2017,"This is a timely tale, based on a true story, and truly reaches an all time high in portraying the bond between a man and his dog. It delivers in so many ways telling a simple yet powerful story and Hachiko truly steals the show. This might not be appropriate for children under 12 years of age, and indeed its difficult for anybody of any age. The sadness is riveting. Anyone who has ever owned a dog will appreciate this movie from start to finish and along the way you will become totally consumed with what is in front of you. As many reviewers have warned, be prepared for an evening full of tears and far after that as well. It is a movie classic. Richard Gere and Joan Allen are fine. Her rendezvous with Hachi late in the movie is as emotional as it gets. Jason Alexander does a fine job in his supporting role as always This is an unforgettable movie.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

533,bobchorses,One of my all time favorite films,10,29 May 2021,"I value films that get into my heart and mind and this film did that and much more. The photography was excellent, the music fitting and the casting was superb. The location was very well selected. The use of camera views from Hachi's eyes was spot on when needed.Richard Gere accepted a role that put him in the back seat to Hachi and I think judging by his performance, did it with a good heart and it shows in his performance. The dogs used are often difficult to train, but the trainers used did an excellent job and had these loving animals deliver a fantastic performance.I had not view this film until a couple of days ago, however it will stick to me in my heart until the day I die. I am a senior and make no apologies in saying I still cry when I think of Hachi, the real one and the dog actor.Please, if you haven't seen this film, especially if you are a dog over, view it as soon as possible. But be sure to have a box of tissues handy when you do.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale
534,annesteensborg,"If you need a movie to cry to, this is the one",9,6 April 2020,"My SO and I had a gaming day with our computers and I put this movie on for background noise. My attention went to the movie really quickly, and when the movie ended I ended up sobbing for 10-15 minutters. I have watched TONS of sad movies over the years, but this one got to me, and I still tear up whenever it is mentioned or I have to talk about it. It's like a heartbreak I can't really get over. It is only a handful of movies that have touched my soul so deeply, and I think this one takes 1st place of all time. If you need to cry and care for animals (especially dogs) this is your go-to movie.",Hachi - A Dog's Tale

540,nite_nipper,Simply beautiful !!!,10,13 April 2014,"Film the best for me also I think for others too, a film very sad, to me on a shower it was very bad when the owner of a dog has died, and the dog with hope came to it and waited when it to it will return that it to appear, it has very much upset me. I think other spectators will understand something for myself and I will make for myself correct for myself deduce. Thanks the director actors and the fine dogie who has very well served its purpose in this film, thanks all of them for this fine film.
