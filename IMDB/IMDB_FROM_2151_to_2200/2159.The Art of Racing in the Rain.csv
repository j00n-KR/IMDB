0,SnoopyStyle,This is Us + The Dog who knows too much,7,17 November 2019,"Enzo (Kevin Costner) is a sick old dog. He recounts his life with his race car driver master Denny Swift (Milo Ventimiglia) who marries Eve (Amanda Seyfried) and they have a girl named Zoë. The family faces trials and tribulations with Eve's parents (Kathy Baker, Martin Donovan). This is a real tear-jerker. It's basically Milo doing another 'This is Us'. The difference is the constant narration from Costner as a dog. The idea is that the dog is following a Mongolian belief that dogs can reincarnate into human beings. That's where the writer falters in logic and in drama. It would be much more compelling to have the dog not understand as much as he understands in the movie. It would help for Enzo to piece together the story without so much knowledge. The dog knows too much. It's not logical and it detracts from the drama anyways. Otherwise, this is great for dog lovers and melodrama lovers alike.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

Most if not all Fat Cat One Per Center Rich People are hateful, pathological liars posing their own malignant Menaces to Society on only a slightly smaller scale that the present Pachyderm Party POTUS, documents RAIN. Just as is happening across the USA's Southern Border Today, these Money Bags Miscreants will snatch away a working stiff's children, just because they have crafted a bogus national Injustice System which allows them to exercise any demonic whim that strikes their fancy, we learn from RAIN. While England's Queen has her pet Corgis, RAIN proves that dogs are America's Sacred Cows, and it is We the People who lead a ""dog's life"" and are ""treated like dogs."" RAIN argues that any rational working man should flee the USA--as ""Denny"" scoots to Italy--rather than suffer the murderous tyranny of the fat cat bozos.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
2,AlsExGal,"Casablanca it is not, BUT...",8,29 August 2020,"... every now and then, whether we will admit it or not, we all need to watch such a film. If all you watch are Christopher Nolan and Ingmar Bergman films, you will eventually find yourself staring glassy eyed into space, drinking heavily, and wondering, in the words of the 70s band Chicago - ""Does anybody really know what time it is?"".It's the story of Denny, an average Joe with a rather unique occupation - teacher of race car driving and an aspiring race car driver himself. What makes the story even more unique is the viewpoint - a story told in flash back by Denny's dog Enzo as is he is dying of old age in Denny's arms, starting from the time Denny adopted him as a puppy, to Denny's marriage to Eve, to the birth of their daughter, and everything that came in between and after.Kevin Costner does a good job of narrating for Enzo. The pup makes the movie, and the actors don't try to get in the way. It is all about loyalty, determination, grieving, fear of abandonment, and friendship. But I do disagree with some reviewers here. I don't think I'd let a kid under ten see this. It gets pretty heavy at points. And a stuffed zebra has a scene that is as surreal as the Twilight Zone episode I saw as a kid with a bunch of mannequins calling out ""Marsha!"" to a terrorized woman locked in a department store at night. I saw that over 50 years ago and it still scares me. But I digress.I'd recommend this when you just want a watch a film with admirable characters acting admirably in response to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But there is one hissable villain just to give the film a little balance. I'd recommend it.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
3,deloudelouvain,A box of tissues is required.,9,9 November 2019,"I didn't know anything about the movie before watching it. As soon as I saw it was about the life of a dog 'Enzo', beautifully narrated by Kevin Costner by the way, I looked at my wife and told her I will probably cry with this movie. When it's about animals I have difficulties not to cry when something 'happens' to the animal, and that even though I know it's just a movie. And oh boy did I cry with this movie, and so did my wife. At one point we were both balling without ending. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry again, and that's a day later. It's the kind of movie that reminds you previous dogs you owned, or the dogs you have at this moment. I watched it with Lou, my lovely poodle that I rescued, sitting in my lap, and Jef, my Andalucian waterdog, cuddling next to me. You can't help it to compare things from the movie with your actual life and pets. The story itself is not flawless, but it doesn't matter as it is too beautiful to stand still at those little imperfections. The relationship and endless love between Milo Ventimiglia and his dog Enzo is something a lot of dog owners will recognize. I love my dogs so much it hurts just thinking one day I will have to let them go, but knowing they had a good life eases the pain. The Art Of Racing In The Rain is a movie for animal lovers, a movie where you will need a box of tissues. I loved it, but I wonder if I could watch it again.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
4,ThomasDrufke,Enzo Deserves Better Than This,7,23 August 2019,"I will see just about any dog movie that gets released, and that includes the manipulative ones. The Art of Racing in the Rain both nails the essential qualities of the best of dog movies, but it does veer into melodramatic blandness in the second half, only to be saved by brilliantly poignant final moments. One of the film's main faults is that it never gets you to truly care about the dog's (Enzo) relationship to his human companions, mostly because they are some of the worst owners in the history of cinema, which is where you find a good chunk of the manipulative aspect of the story. But if there has ever been perfect casting, it's Kevin Costner as Enzo. Enzo is easily one of the best dogs in film, and that's worth watching.7.0/10",The Art of Racing in the Rain
5,westsideschl,Awhhh!,4,23 November 2019,"Still another talking dog w/handsome bachelor; single for the moment. Enter attractive female to compete for attention. Predictable tragedy as the emotive hook. Dog, as the human's nonjudgemental, faithful (as long as there's food & shelter), companion must also eventually pass on. Except there has to be an afterlife because just dying is not a lot of fun & what better than to be the only species to make it back as a human.

6,slightlymad22,I Laughed & Cries,8,9 August 2019,"I just got out of watching The Art Of Racing In The RainA seriously emotional movie for me, as I had to have my beloved family dog Rocky, put down on Monday, I knew I would cry watching this, and I did.It is not what you think it is. It is not a racing movie, nor is it a children movie about a mischievous dog, its about the people and their relationships told through the eyes of the dog, voiced beautifully by Kevin Costner.It has been 13 years since Milo Ventimiglia starred in Rocky Balbo, yet every time he smiles that crooked smile, I'm reminded of Sly. Amanda Seyfried puts in a touching performance whilst Martin Donovan is simply a guy you will hate.This is a movie that is all heart, I laughed and cried watching it.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
7,UniqueParticle,That Kevin Costner tho lol I can just picture Key and Peele doing a hilarious skit!,10,28 August 2019,"Anyways jokes aside this is the perfect dog and story driven movie! Beyond well written throughout with clever dialogue. You'll laugh, cry a lot, even say wtf, and one thing you won't do is feel gypped at all. This is better than any dog movie you could ever see and among one of the best sport stories ever! I don't really read much but I am tempted to find an audible version of the source novel or something similar, it's a best seller after all.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
8,cruise01,Emotional racing ride that pet owners will love.,8,8 November 2019,"The Art of Racing in the Rain (4 out of 5 stars).The Art of Racing in the Rain is an emotional roller coaster of a drama film about the bond between an owner and a dog. Sure, pet owners will love the film and cherish the moments their furry little friends keeping them company. The film has some fun, cute moments, and some emotional relatable drama that we all go through in life. It is also what I love about the film which balances the tone out with realistic drama being witnessed in the perspective of a golden retriever Enzo (voiced by Kevin Costner).The plot follows race car driver Denny (Milo Ventimiglia) who adopts a puppy Enzo. Journeying through life. He meets Eve (Amanda Seyfried) which he falls in love and have a daughter with her. Dealing with his race career of leaving his family home and dealing with family drama. Which his in laws are trying to tear his family apart about his career.The plot is a relatable drama which we all go through one way or another. The cute thing about the film is it shows the perspective of our pets. On what they see. Enzo witnesses everything. Sees the family being torn apart. Sees tragic moments when someone gets sick. Enzo not as understanding but can tell that they are in deep pain and he feels helpless when he sees them going through rough life patches. The film does get rough with some drama in the second half of the movie were it gets frustrating and emotional seeing characters facing difficult situations in life. Which is heartbreaking but the furry friends like Enzo are always there to help guide you through rough spots in life.Milo Ventimiglia is great with the role playing Denny. He is obsessed with his racing career. He also is in love with his family. Which he is conflicted when it comes a time that he rejects offers to stay home dealing with family situations. Amanda Seyfried is good too playing Eve. Kevin Costner is also a good choice playing Enzo. The narrative on the dogs perspective.The film will have you cheering with joy seeing the precious fun moments. The film will drive you through a roller coaster on taking these human characters in a journey dealing with life, grief, pain, loss, and trying to reunite with families.Overall, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a good comedy drama film. It is cute, the film focuses more on human drama which I love how it shows from Enzo's perspective.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
9,eddie_baggins,The humans let the team down,5,22 April 2020,"If you're here for the cute doggo action (like I'm sure 99 out 100 watchers are), The Art of Racing in the Rain will satisfy your needs for four-legged goodness but in adapting Garth Stein's source novel, proven screenwriter Mark Bomback and director Simon Curtis struggle to engage with the human drama that eats away at far too much of this well-shot films run-time.Racing is most certainly not a film for those that find dogs nothing more than excrement producing nuisances but for canine fans, the glories of seeing photogenic young golden pup Enzo become an even more adorable wise best friend to Milo Ventimiglia's far too kind to be realistic wannabe racing driver Denny, will be a sight for sore eyes, made even more appealing by the fact Enzo is here, through internal monologue, voiced by Mr. America himself Kevin Costner.Without a shadow of a doubt, Enzo and Costner are the stars of the show, with the molding of real life pups and Costner's instantly recognizable American drawl creating an extremely likable centrepiece for the film, that sees Enzo fall into an unfortunate set of circumstances as Denny faces battles in his personal life revolving around his marriage and love with Amanda Seyfried's Eve, his young daughter Zoe (played by Ryan Kiera Armstrong) and his up and down relationship with Eve's unlikeable parents Maxwell and Trish, played generically by Martin Donovan and Kathy Baker.You wish Bomback and Curtis had focused more of their tale around Enzo as you can't help but feel in adapting and changing Stein's source material, that human moments in the film feel both lethargic, boring and predictable with not a lot for us as a viewer to latch onto whenever Enzo is pushed to the side and the generic and lifeless human drama takes over the spotlight.You're constantly feeling as though you should be caring more for the plight of Denny and his desire to be a good husband, father and race car driver but when all is said and done, his simple and likable interactions with his best friend is what makes the film shine in parts and would've made the film far more special had they been given more time to evolve and mature before our very eyes.With the human elements letting this film down, Racing feels very similar to recent doggy adventures such as A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Way Home, becoming a film with cute and heart-warming moments but one that can't help overcome the fact it's too concerned about the generic people components to work as one cohesive and memorable whole.Final Say -Not without its moments and sure to please those seeking dog-centric goodness, The Art of Racing in the Rain threatens at times to become something special but is held back often by a fairly lame plot and some even more irksome humans.2 ½ dancing plush toys out of 5",The Art of Racing in the Rain
10,Ed-Shullivan,Tugs at your heart strings...but in a very good way,10,4 February 2020,"The ending is to die for. No pun intended. Mrs. Shullivan and I are big fans of the film's star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Denny, an up and coming race car driver.
Denny is driving home one day when his eye happens to catch a FOR SALE sign which states ""puppies for sale"". Denny befriends a new puppy, a Golden Retriever dog that he names Enzo, after the famous Italian racing car driver Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team, and subsequently of the Ferrari automobile marque. And so Denny and his loyal dog that he names Enzo become friends for life. The dog Enzo, also becomes our narrator (Kevin Costner is the dog's voice) of this wonderful and enlightening story that reminds us all that life is what happens when you are busy making plans.Both Mrs. Shullivan and I laughed and of course cried as Denny and Enzo lived their lives together and begrudgingly (at first) Enzo agreed to share their little apartment with Denny's new love, a pretty blonde girl named Eve (played by Amanda Seyfried). Marriage and child and eventually a new home follow and Enzo (the dog) explains that he gradually learns to love Eve and the child, a daughter named Zoë as much as his best friend Denny loves all three of them. This is an enriched life for this family of four as Denny's career as a race car driver is slow but steady moving in the progressive direction. While Denny is abroad racing in other countries Eve, Zoë, and Enzo spend some of their days and evenings at Zoë's grandparents very large mansion.Then suddenly the families Cinderella bubble bursts and life as it sometimes happens to us all, takes an unexpected turn for the worst. Without providing any spoilers I will end by saying that the film's ending is poetic and if tears do not swell up in your eyes for this happy ending, well..... then maybe you are neither a dog lover or part of a loving family.A great movie can best be described by stating that the film started and ended long before we wished that it did. A perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!",The Art of Racing in the Rain
11,digitalbeachbum,Terrible owner who is selfish,1,9 May 2020,It isn't a fun movie to watch. I don't care for all of the Deus ex machina used to push the movie forward. I found the dog owners irresponsible and selfish. The script is written to tug on heart strings rather than actually have a story. There could have been a better story. The entire movie should have had only the dog taking. Period. Everyone else should have been mumbling. The humans shouldn't be the focus.,The Art of Racing in the Rain
12,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Art of Racing in the Rain,8,10 August 2019,"8/10 - while the story is relatively familiar, this family-friendly flick remains as emotionally powerful as ever and is sure to pull on anyone's heartstrings",The Art of Racing in the Rain
13,kwenchow,"This is not a comedy film! Too slow, no excitement, not funny! Bored to freaking death!",1,23 November 2019,"This film start with a dog ""Enzo"" lie down beside it's pee, and flashback of a car racer ""Denny"" buying a puppy from an old couple scene! As turnout, this film is about the life story of Enzo with Denny! Entire film full of narrating sound of Enzo! Super annoying and bored! Barely laughable scene is, Enzo poo on the floor after eating the pepper feed by Denny's father in law! The film also lack of racing scene! Only the opening car race scene and the ending Denny testing a luxury car scene! At the end, Denny's wife die! Denny won the custody lawsuit of his daughter against his father in law! Enzo die too! Several years later, Denny agree to be the mentor of a young boy! That's it! Another fake rating film! Pathetic!",The Art of Racing in the Rain

It's predicable for story like this that good start and something sad happen at the end, but so what!!? As long as the actors do a great job and story telling from a dog perspective is amazing. 2nd of all, I don't know why I cried like river when watching this kind of dog with humanity story.

16,rgkarim,This Is US Atmosphere With Furry Legged Friend: Art of Racing In the Rain Review,7,11 August 2019,"Books to movies hold the potential to be some of the best films to hit the screen. With stories laid out for the directors, one would think that an adequate investment could bring the words to life. Yet, as often the case, the movies can only do so much with a budget to get the mindset and perspective the books bring, often not being able to match the magic of the written word. Still, they are a popular option to the masses and often the focus of my reviews. So Robbie K back with a 4th review this week on the latest book turned movie as I look into:Movie: Art Of Racing In The Rain (2019)Director:
Simon Curtis
Writers:
Mark Bomback (screenplay by), Garth Stein (novel)
Stars:
Kevin Costner, Milo Ventimiglia, Amanda Seyfried
LIKES:The Cars
The Acting
The Musical Effects
The Dog HimselfDISLIKES:The Pace
The Dragged-Out Components
The Depressing AtmosphereTo quote my friend Austin, the title sort of gives you an idea of what to expect with this film. It's a beautiful movie that takes life's problems and gives us a unique perspective on how to handle it. With some great dramatic acting, musical overtures to emphasize the emotion, and a wonderful four-legged star to pin your hopes on. Yet, like modern day ABC dramas, especially This Is Us, the movie is super depressing and left many in my theater with teary eyes and sniffles. While I'm sure the book holds much of this too, I myself would have rather handled this content in a book, as my biggest issue (outside of the depression I felt) is the pacing having difficulty balancing the hope and sadness. Still, if you are a fan of dramas like this and want the spiritual, sob fest for a film, then this is the movie for you this weekend. Balancing all of this, my scores are:Comedy/Drama: 7.0-7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0 - 6.5F",The Art of Racing in the Rain
17,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Art of Racing in the Rain,8,21 August 2019,"""This one, definitely this one"". That's my take on The Art of Racing in the Rain. It's one of the most emotional and Forrest Gump-ed films of 2019. ""Bible!"" (that means facts).Anyway, have you ever seen a drama where the dog gives the best performance and the dog's narrator gives the best speaking performance? And have you ever seen a drama where the concept of death feels a little more reassuring? ""Racing"" is that drama and at 109 tear-jerking minutes, it's my latest review.""Racing"", with Kevin Costner as the voice of the dog and Milo Ventimiglia as the dog's race car driver owner, feels like the kind of syrupy sweet endeavor where the syrup ain't too sugary. It's like Terms of Endearment and Wonder made a baby and called it Enzo (said dog's character's name).""Racing"" is feel-good fodder people, with a few dark turns (no pun intended), a story seen realistically through a whelp's eyes, and not a whole lot of actual racing. The casting of actors like Costner, Ventimiglia, Amanda Seyfried, and Martin Donovan is perfect and the Golden Retriever for which the story is centered around, will make your heart melt (heck, the pup even looks like Kevin Costner).""Racing's"" director (Simon Curtis) shoots this flick from a 2008 novel for which it's based upon. It's original and communicable combining stock car racing, demise of loved ones, family squabbling, and ""man's best friend"" (we all know dogs love riding in cars). Curtis is the master manipulator when it comes to pulling the viewer's heartstrings. Whoever he hired to be Enzo's trainer should get an Academy Award nomination of his own (is there such a category?).Bottom line: You're not quite a human person if you can't enjoy a film like The Art of Racing in the Rain. According to ""Racing"", Enzo is more ""person"" than dog. Again ""Bible!"". My rating: 3 and a half stars.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
18,mhorg2018,I hate movies where...,1,28 June 2020,"... The dog dies. But this one was so obviously made to pull at heart strings it's ridiculous. Totally predictable with a sappy ending that one sees coming a mile away. Does Milo Ventimiglia ever do a role that requires some acting? Kevin Costner sounded old and tired and lifeless. Just a bland movie I wouldn't care if I never saw, or thought about, again. Tepid, dull and predictable.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
19,nancyldraper,The magic was not totally lost on me,7,24 August 2019,"I should preface this review by saying that,based on the rave reviews of friends (and strangers), I looked forward to seeing this movie, so, it has a faithful fan base who were of the opinion that the movie full justice to the book. The story was interesting (I was forewarned that tissues might be required). I truly believe that there is not another actor that better portrays the complete, self-sacrificing devotion of a man for a woman than does Milo Ventimiglia (I've believed in him since Jessie in GILMORE GIRLS). Amanda Seyfried is a harder sell for me, though, so that prejudice may have soured the love story for me somewhat. I did, however, learn a lot about racing and driving. The author certainly knew his stuff and was expert in spinning it's metaphors. The love of a man and the devotion of a dog were winsome. The treachery and heartbreak were moving, so the magic was not totally lost on me. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10, and if you need further encouragement to see it, my bookish friend has told me, ""Nancy, I would give it 11/10! I went to see it again. For me, it was about Enzo, the dog who wanted to be ""people"" and the incredible bond between dogs and their families."" So, there you have it! {Drama}",The Art of Racing in the Rain

We were in the dogs head an interesting perspective but just way too contrived to sustain a long movie.What was bad,1, the dogs thoughts were as you can imagine limited.2, the whole plot was entirely predictable and the dog mostly describes what we were seeing the thoughts didn't add anything.3, Kristen Stuart really is a ham, she just had the look for a vampire movie but as a mature actress look elsewhere.4, Mile Ventimiglia has a robust physical presence the movie demanded but thus far has not demonstrated a range beyond an action movie.5, the movie descended into mush and sentimentality quite ridiculous.What was good,1, the dog had a nice shiny coat3/10",The Art of Racing in the Rain

From laugh-out-loud moments, to more sombre and ""think-something-is-in-my-eye"" scenes. I'm still laughing at the evil zebra, and smiling at the way in which the film depicted family life from a dog's perspective. The kind of film that will get all dog owners wondering how their pet views life (and even them).The acting won't win any awards but it makes up for that with heart. A lot of heart.

26,akcenat,"Simplistic and cliche, but perfect as a family-friendly movie",8,26 December 2019,"As a story told from a dog's point of view, ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" is not as cheesy or shallow as some similar movies. The narration voice-over done by Kevin Costner emphasizes dog as philosopher in a film that does not condescend but rather one that has ample to entertain. Kevin Costner sounds more mature than Josh Gad (A Dog's Purpose) or Bryce Dallas Howard (A Dog's Way Home) and is the one consistently good thing about this otherwise simplistic flick. Of course, that this film is not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does its job and gives us an emotionally fulfilling time at the movies. After-all, we go to the cinemas to be manipulated into feeling various emotions and this film may as well be trying to reach into your eyeballs to grab the tears using cancer, animal endangerment and a child custody battle and to beat the emotional response out of you. Ultimately, despite its cliche script, film nevertheless manages to rally for an emotionally touching third act that confirms its place as an inconsistent, yet rewarding little drama. And dog lovers be warned because this film will break your heart, in a good way, and remind you of your hairy friends back home and of the short time you have to spend with them in your lives.Rating: 7+/8- No matter it is so cliche and predictable, it's still quite heart warming family movie.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

Kev has proved in films of the past: Wyatt Earp, Water World, The Postman, etc) that he has to completely dominate the movie that he is in.

30,adrianovasconcelos,"Beautiful golden retriever stands out in very uneven, tragic, and predictable film",5,4 September 2019,"Frankly, I do not understand how anyone can rate this film a comedy, and say that it was a source of mirth throughout. To begin with. we see the dog (Enzo) as he approaches death, and the traditional flashback sets in, during which we find out that Enzo resents his owner's love interest, loves the baby, seems rather ambivalent about the nasty father in law (his big revenge is to poo on the carpet) and detects the cancer killing his owner's wife.If all this sounds rather jumbled... it is.

PG
director:Simon Curtis
starring: Kevin Costner,Amanda Seyfried,Milo ventiniglia,Gary cole,Martin Donovan,Kathy Baker,Ryan Kiera Armstrongoverall rating 85/100The art of racing in the rain is about the special bond between Denny ( Milo Ventiniglia) and his dog enzo. But when Denny falls in love Enzo becomes jealous. But grows to love her and a family is created. But when a horrifying illness and possessive grandparents effects Dennys life he must learn to adjust life for his family even if it involves sacrificing his racing career. Wow what a beautiful film the art of racing in the rain was,so many great components lets talk about these.First up we just have to praise the pure cuteness of the films star enzo ( voices by kevin costner) enzo was absolutely adorable. We got to see his ageing process from a cute puppy to a adorable adult. He bought a lot of humour with his crazy antics either with people he did not like or when he wanted attention. So it was hard not to like the movie with such an adorable star.Next the film had such a heartwarming tone and relatable and authentic real life themes and messages. The film just had a natural charm to it. Seeing the love and bond between pet and owner was incredibly touching and Enzo and Denny were perfect for each other. His romance with Eve ( Amanda seyfried) was lovely to watch and it was great to see the narrative character development between them two and how there family evolved. And also the film touched really well on getting to caught up in your career and missing time with family. Denny was so focused on his racing career that he missed the birth of his child, and i think the film touched really well on realising your mistakes and compromising to be happy with your family which i think maybe might make some audience members think a lot more. And can i just add that Amanda Seyfried did a fantastic acting performance in the film. Her portrayal of someone going through cancer and the effects it can have on the family was excellently done and made her character very likeable.However i do have to add that the films pacing to me felt very rushed. During the first half of the film they went through a lot. of scenes very quickly not in my opinion focusing enough on one particular scene. This to me effected the impact of a lot of scenes. For example the wedding and the birth of the lead characters child was very rushed through with the sudden changes in time so therefore i did not feel as emotionally connected to the film as perhaps i could of been, this was made up for in the second half of the film but this just makes the pacing inconsistent.Now for my final two positives. Firstly i loved the racing components to the film. The art of racing in the rain was not just a cute dog and family movie which in the most part it was, but i loved the racing element, There was plenty of scenes of denny racing that were very entertaining, and there was some beautiful cars shown during the film. I just think it added variety to the plot and will reach out to wider audiences with different interests that could still like this film. And finally a lot of the plot elements i found very clever and interesting whilst watching the film. Having enzo have a voiceover throughout the whole film was really clever. It really made me think as a audience member about whether dogs actually think like enzo does, which they probably do. This made me appreciate the company of dogs and realise there cleverness. I also found it interesting how enzo knew about eves brain cancer before anyone else but he obviously could not say anything there was other situations like this throughout the film. I do also have to add that the film is incredibly emotional in places. Whether its Eves brain cancer diagnosis or Denny trying to adapt to a life without her. Eves death was incredibly heartbreaking and just a heads up bring some tissues before watching.However i do have to end on my final two negatives which i thought bought the film down just slightly. First of all i thought some of the characters choices throughout the film were questionable and made you disagree with there actions. When Denny was spending to much time away from his wife and daughter you really wanted him to realise what he was doing was wrong. And i also did not like when Eve abandoned Enzo for 2 days literally forgetting about him. And there was a incredibly dislikable character here. Eves father was a extremely horrible man. He was trying to control Denny and get his daughter to move in with him. Even going as far as to demand custody over her thus taking Dennys own daughter away from him just after his wife died. He also did many other even worse things but i wont go into any more details. I think you can understand how much of a horrible person he was throughout the film.Overall despite having pacing inconsistencies. The art of racing in the rain is a charming,heartwarming,hilarious and emotional rollercoaster of the film which is not getting enough credit for its great storytelling and narrative.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

It is a completely different movie. There were one or two parts where we said ""that was in the book"" but for the most part the only thing it shares was the dog and racing and the first and last 5 minutes. Having said that, it is a great family film. Not too much language or violence. No Hollywood agendas. Lots of good puppy time and a few laughs. We liked it!

I was expecting just to be entertained by average fare. Instead, I found this movie quite complex and heartening. A race car driver, Denny, has never achieved great success as a driver so far. He meets a woman, marries her, and has a daughter. The dog he bought as a puppy, Enzo, is narrated by Kevin Costner, whose voice you may not even recognize if you were not aware who was the narrator. The dog witness all the struggles and joys that his owner goes through. Denny's wife gets cancer and passes away. Then, Denny has to struggle with his In Laws over custody of the children.

40,blrnani,Story of a dog's path to enlightenment,8,6 June 2020,"So he can acquire enough wisdom to come back as a human in his next life. This charming story possibly offers more opportunities for enlightenment than many human lives are exposed to, but it does help if you are 'just a silly dog' who is consequently privy to sensitive human conversations that would be hidden from other humans (except we lucky cinema audiences). It also helps to have a good script writer, and this one has done a fine job of negotiating a lot of melodramatic situations without the story becoming soppy. The result is a very enjoyable film that portrays the triumphs of the spirit in the face of many tragedies that life can throw in our path. And like the current pandemic, it also shows how the kind solidarity of good people can greatly help us to navigate that path.
But you don't have to believe in reincarnation to enjoy this moving film, which I think ought to appeal to a very wide cross-section of audiences. Don't be put off by the title, which merely symbolizes a healthy approach to life's challenges.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

Except for those of us who fall in the middle. I normally don't watch movies about dogs unless I'm in the mood for something ""light."" Well, Racing is both light/feel good, and heavy. Sort of. Well, it would have had heavy moments if the formulaic predictability of it didn't water down most of the emotional scenes.I sort of enjoyed the ""dog's"" narration and didn't even know whose voice it was but it didn't matter. The only thing that jarred me out of my mild enjoyment of the film's mildness was my confusion over when it supposedly took place. Soon after the opening when we see Denny's car which is a vintage BMW and there's music from the 60's, I thought that's when it took place. But within a few years they had cell phones, albeit older ones, and a couple of other things I can't remember that seemed out of the time period, along with more music from the 60's.

49,untilnow99,A two-hanky movie.,9,19 August 2019,"About a decade ago, as some random guy and I stood at a park talking and watching our dogs play, the guy said to me, ""You should read 'The Art of Racing in the Rain.' I think you'd really like it.""Over the years I have read many many books. Of all the books I've read, ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" always stood out for me as one amazingly touching story.At the end of the book, Enzo's death is masterfully written and makes you cry so hard that you find out what it really means to ""get all choked up."" Your throat will start to close up, tears will flow endlessly and your heart will feel utterly twisted up with sadness and joy.While I enjoyed the movie, I was filled with dread throughout the viewing, hoping against hope that the ending would stay to true the book. The way Garth Stein wraps you up in Enzo's hopes and dreams, the way Stein really brings home how Enzo believes his death is only bringing him to a more fulfilling life as a human----- it all culminates in a truly unforgettable ending. It was one of the best passages I have ever read in a book. So much so, that I took the time to copy it all down to keep. I didn't want to ever forget how Enzo's passing touched my heart.The movie at the end unfortunately changes a lot of the written word regarding Enzo and his sense of freedom. All I can recall now is that Enzo was running free across a field. Then, as he ran, he was saying to Denny, ""Faster, faster.""Despite the changed ending, I thought the movie did an incredible job of showing the connection between Danny and Enzo. It is a wonderful film in that it deftly shows how much love and comfort a beloved pet can bring to one's life.Kudos to the screeenwriters. And, most important: a huge thanks to the dog trainers and their wonderful Golden retrievers who acted amazingly professional. Every dog at each stage of Enzo's life gave a fantastic, scene-stealing perfomance.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

51,brianjohnson-20043,Too goofy to be serious and too serious to be charmingly irreverent.,3,14 August 2019,"I have regal unlimited and thought I'd watch this movie as my B feature following watching Brian Banks, which I enjoyed and would recommend. Even if it wasn't perfect.I didn't have huge expectations going into this movie. I was hoping for a good irreverent golden retriever dog movie. Sort of in-line with a dog's purpose. I grew up with a Golden and love them.Instead I saw a story which wasn't a chronicle of a dog's inspirational life as a real dog. Instead it felt like a story where an typical human intellect was trapped in a dog's body. This makes it annoying when the dog only demonstrates his abilities by acting sharper than a real dog once or twice.I think they felt that the dog had to have a mature understanding because there was some mature complications in the movie for the adults. I just don't agree.I think these stories work better if the dog is treated more like a Forrest Gump character who is mentally underhanded, but still gets to be the hero out of will and luck. And demonstrates that you don't have to be a genius to make a big impact if your heart is in the right place.Another thing that annoyed me:The grandparents lawsuit was ridiculous. Especially the fact that they drew up the papers before they had an actual useful incident to exploit for their benefit. I'm no law expert, but I feel that a spouse of a partner generally doesn't count as a very solid witness in court defending their partner. Even if they witness the event, I feel that a neutral witness or neutral revealing piece of evidence is necessary for the guilty side to have the upper hand. After-all, the guilty side has the burden of proof.I hope our court system isn't set-up so 2 people can bully one person when a fight breaks out between them by the lie of two allies counting more than the truth of one defendant. I'm no lawyer, and I'm aware our justice system is flawed. But I don't think it's THAT flawed. Especially when the decision has the consequences we see in the movie.I also was annoyed that the movie gossiped the unscientific idea that entities have literal souls that transcend your body after death. Is it so hard for writers to say I hope rather than I know regarding something that's so clearly speculative hogwash? Or, if the dog detects a soul, explain how? Rather than have the dog make an empty assertion similar to ones humans make which lead these ideas being so popular in the first place.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

There was just nothing original here, just the usual heartwarming followed by tragedy followed by heartwarming again. The ending, especially, was straight out of cliche central.I enjoyed ""A Dog's Purpose"" and ""A Dog's Journey"" and, while they are similar to this movie, I think the writing and acting is better in those two movies.

53,KyleLicht,"Good Adaptation, But Watered Down",7,18 August 2019,"WARNING: SPOILERS (for novel and movie)So, prior to seeing the movie, I read he book by Garth Stein. I adored the novel and even added it to my list of best books. It's witty, deep, and emotionally powerful. The movie carried the same weight as the novel. It was charming, sad, and amusing the whole way through. The cinematography and editing was wonderful, with only minimal awkward cuts and continuities (funny enough, the dog had the least continuity errors). The casting and acting were also tremendous as the actors were perfect for their roles and held the same weight as how I pictured them in the book. One aspect of the production that really surprised me was the special effects, which were excellent. There were a few moments where there were CGI sequences due to hallucination and metaphorical double exposure of memories going through Enzo's mind. They looked excellent.However, I have gripes with the film. I loved the book and expected the movie to omit parts of the book but they took out the wrong parts. A few minor examples are of Denny playing video games to get a feel for the racetracks before he actually drives on them, a scene where the Zebra was essentially molesting the other stuffed animals (it was changed to ripping them apart), and some aspects of Denny struggling with alcohol. These things were missed but do not make or break the movie.What makes or breaks the movie is removing the entire subplot of a semi-incestual false accusation of child molestation. In the novel, Denny is going on a road trip across the country and kindly takes his wife's niece along with him as she is going to a school in the same direction. The niece is 15-years old and has a huge crush on Denny and mistakes his kindness for flirting. One night while in a motel, she takes his clothes off while he's sleeping and gets naked herself. She attempts to have sex with him but he wakes up before anything could happen, shuts it down, and yells at her. His scorning isn't necessarily too harsh though. He has some sentiment in being cold but she is so upset and hurt that she refuses to accept the situation.
Later on, after Denny's wife dies, the grandparents try and gain custody of Denny's daughter. Soon, they find out about the incident in the motel, but from the perspective of the niece, who spins it around to make it seem like Denny made moves on her. The grandparents use this as leverage and Denny is accused of molesting a child, thus not being able to have custody of his child. This subplot was replaced in the movie by Denny accidentally knocking the grandfather over and being sued for physical harassment. This change is so detrimental to the power of the story, because in the novel, Denny tries to go to his wife's funeral but is kicked out and forced to watch the ceremony from the top of a hill. He's seen as a pedophile and treated like a villain by many and he can't even attend his wife's funeral.
At this point, Denny slips into an alcoholic depression and becomes very low and broken. This is much more powerful considering the circumstances and in the film, it seems like Denny's depression is as significant as a mood swing, especially as this moment in his life is rushed in the film and resolved very quickly. Changing this aspect of the film really watered it down and made it family-friendly, which means the rating is PG instead of PG-13 or R, which means more people can see it and more money can be made. It's a very commercialized or diluted decision and whether it was for money or not, it makes the story less critical and more standardized. This false accusation story isn't told entirely often and it's a difficult and deep problem to deal with. It should be perused and analyzed more but instead of talking about hard topics or doing something different, we're given a situation where a man's life is almost ruined for accidentally knocking someone over. This makes the film lack substance and makes the book really important.
I understand that the film is an adaptation, a different account of the story, and a new perspective. So, of course, there will be changes. I also understand that dealing with minors sexually in a film is not easy and that this topic may deter more people from seeing it. However, this change makes me see the film as a good movie and the book as an excellent book. If the filmmakers value profit and a wider audience over quality and critical themes, then so be it; I'll stick with the book.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

60,rustonreviews,A run of the mill tearjerker that offers nothing new.,4,11 August 2019,"Based on the book of the same name by Garth Stein, The Art of Racing in the Rain follows aspiring Formula 1 race car driver Denny Swift (Ventimiglia) and his Labrador Enzo (voiced by Kevin Costner) as they together navigate their way through the hardships of life. Costner narrates the film from beginning to end as the narrative is primarily told through Enzo's perspective. Although it was indeed a smart move by the filmmakers to have the lovable Lab at the forefront of the film, that's all this run of the mill tearjerker has going for it. Spanning the course of their many years together, there are several instances in which the narrative moves far too quickly. Much of the first act relies heavily on exposition overload and there is a heavy abundance of telling rather than showing. Given the fact that the film moves at such a fast pace, there isn't much time at all for the characters to be well developed. They feel painfully one dimensional and I never once felt an emotional connection to any of them. Bomback's screenplay is an absolute mess and suffers heavily from a case of not knowing exactly what kind of story it wants to tell. What the film feels like is a sequence of events that may work perfectly fine in isolation, but when pieced together the end result is a rushed narrative with dull, undeveloped characters and plotlines that have been executed far more efficiently in better films. Ventimiglia and Seyfried are serviceable enough, but Costner is the real star here. He narrates wonderfully and were it not for him, my assessment of this film may have been a little harsher. Still, The Art of Racing in the Rain offers nothing new at all, and while I've no doubt that the book may in fact be brilliant, this film adaptation is a forgettable affair that packs one of the silliest endings I've ever seen in a film. But hey, at least the Labrador is adorable.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

I admit,I did not read the book and did not do good research on it, Frankly this movie has emotion and depth, leave with an appreciation of how deeply touching and insightful it leaves you.I'm not a dog person, but it doesn't matter. Because we are given the gift of looking at life, relationships between our partners, and understanding the value of our relationship with our pets.

But the storyline includes grandparents suing for custody in a way that children everywhere will think is entirely possible. It isn't, plain and simple. Here they have a seemingly sweet movie but kids with single parents everywhere will wake up with nightmares wondering why it's so easy to be taken away. Shame on the writers of this movie for not toning down that part of the plot, because it scared the living hell out of kids we know. They basically wrote a family movie around one scene toward the end that everyone, including myself, loves. Kids will probably remember that scene for a month, But the fear of being taken away by nefarious grandparents on a lawsuit that hinging on a minor physical infraction the day the father's wife died is potentially lasting.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

They speak and think dog, nothing wrong with that, but it's just not human. However I don't think they are interested in human failures or successes or what's on TV or who wins a car race. Maybe they are more into eating lunch and catching rabbits.The acting is fine and the story is fine, but the Tom Hankish overdubbed dog commentary is a bit much.I think the people that made this have their heart in the right place, but if you are into something with substance then give this a miss.

79,imjaredross,"Another 2019 Dog Film, Still Much of the Same",5,1 October 2019,"The Art of Racing in the Rain is the third tear jerking dog film to come out in 2019 and is exactly what you expect from the over bloated genre at this point. This film has all the tropes: a cute dog that does cute things, family drama for our human characters and the dog being confused about things us humans take for granite. So, truly the film really has nothing new to say or bring to this genre.I do understand the appeal of these types of films as a few of these dog/animal movies I really do like. Movies like Old Yeller, Shiloh and My Boy Skip come to mind, but Hollywood has recently been cranking out these films and has missed everything that made those films work. Everything just ends up like been there done that. We've seen it all before, but audiences come back for more to sit down and cry for a little bit and at a manipulative ending designed to make them cry.What does this movie have though? All around I will say the acting is very solid from all our performancers. The racer/father of the film is played by Milo Ventimiglia of This is Us fame. He does a great job dealing with his family life and balancing it with his racing career. Makes for fine drama. Amanda Seyfried is also very good and has a storyline that can be seen as manipulative especially in the case of this film, but plays the role well. The supporting cast also does a fine job. The only performance that bothers me however is that if Kevin Costner, the voice of the dog Enzo. His gruff voice and sometimes very bland delivery put me to sleep rather than made me interested in this dog.This film also feels at times very pretentious especially when it comes to Enzo's inner monologue where he relates everything in life to racing and rain, thus the title of the film. It feels heavy handed as the film tries to elevate itself over other dog movies, but ends up feeling empty.There are fun moments sprinkled throughout. Good performances being one of them, but the film feels so cliche and self serious and heavy handed at times and ends up not being very entertaining. People who like this type of movie are going to enjoy it no matter what. As for me it was just empty and something I feel like I had already seen.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

Kostner gives a unique feel to the movie. A solid and grounded narrative that could have gone horribly wrong with the wrong voice.
The movie is very well balance, with the chapters of the movie and the themes of love and excitement and injustice and complicated family issues woven into a rich tapestry of a good story.
Very good to see Milo Ventimiglia's career developing so well. I still see him as Peter Patrelli from Heroes. ""This is us"" was ""not for me"". He is excellent in this role. In some scenes I thought that should they ever want to do a Rambo prequel, they have the man here. He has the same slanted mouth thingy that is so much Stallone.

Great Film!,10,15 August 2019,"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" - no other book has ever made me laugh and cry out loud like this one and I questioned whether the movie version would do it justice...it totally did! The actors were superb, chemistry real, and there's so much wisdom Enzo the Dog Star imparts along the way. Through Enzo's thoughts and Denny's behavior, the analogy of successful car racing and life's challenges is made clear with vision and sensitivity. There is much to learn and cheer about in this movie with beautiful scenes of taking care of those we love and never giving up, despite the odds. We also get to see how everyone screws up from time to time but if they keep their eye on what they want and believe in, they win. And Enzo, who's always living in the present, goes ""dormant"" when he needs to avoid distraction of worrying about the past or future.

89,tomfeller,A dog and his family,8,23 September 2019,"The title refers to car racing, and Denny Swift (Milo Ventimiglia) is a Seattle-based professional race car driver. One day at the spur of the moment, he buys a Golden Retriever puppy (voice of Kevin Costner), who becomes the movie's main point-of-view character. Denny names him Enzo after Enzo Ferrari. There is a fantasy element here in that Enzo is so intelligent that he can watch television and understand concepts such as reincarnation. Denny marries Eve (Amanda Seyfried), and they have a daughter named Zoe (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). The main conflict is with Eve's parents (Kathy Baker, Martin Donovan) who do not approve of Eve's choice of a husband.

92,Lepidopterous_,A Color-By-Numbers Hallmark Film Set On Autopilot,2,18 August 2019,"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" is a color-by-numbers Hallmark film through and through. Each moment is filled to the brim with cookie-cutter plastic goodness. The entire cast and crew are on autopilot, as if they are taking on Formula racing literally. The comedy falls flat, but any comedy it does generate is unintentional and usually paired with some degree of cringing.""Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed inside the hospital to hear the diagnosis and the options being discussed.""The above is an actual quote from the family dog. It could traditionally be considered some kind of spoiler if this film didn't have the subtlety of a public bludgeoning. The movie also knows nothing about dogs. It makes zero effort to get inside the mind of the star pup it is supposed to be about. It is more convincingly a horror film about a human with locked-in syndrome stuck inside of a dog's body stuck inside of a vanilla Lifetime Original Movie. And it's a dog with perfect 4K color vision and a perspective & vantage point used only when convenient for the narrative or if the angle fits the scene.The acting is horrific and the dialogue is insufferably bad. It is full of canned phrases, spitting Instagram meme-level wisdom followed by a musical score that is either a premade sample off GarageBand or recycled from daytime TV soap operas. The dog dad (Milo Ventimiglia) is constantly smoldering. Literally every expression he makes in every scene is some version of a smolder... and he is in every scene. The child actress who plays the daughter is barely given any lines, and the one time she is seen bawling hysterically, her face is completely dry. The character who goes through chemo is rocking a beautiful set of long natural eyelashes despite losing her hair and brows. Her overall appearance on her deathbed makes me look like a cancer patient in comparison.I haven't seen a movie this bad in a while. Then again, I have essentially already seen this film.

What is it about sports that could kill you? These racers are not reckless. They are rational, in touch with their engines, suspensions, steering wheel, gears, spoilers. They know the angles and how to take a turn. They are spatially-oriented, mathematical. He even tells his daughter that if she tries this, he'll kill her. It's taking calculated risks. He ends up in Formula One big time with his daughter along for the ride. The first time I saw Milo Ventimiglia he was going underground with Brittany Snow in that show with Tom Verica and Estes (now Jamie Reagan) in American something during the Vietnam Experience.

99,redcanofevil,The Art Of Making You Cry,10,28 November 2019,"The plot revolves around a Golden Retriever that was adopted by a professional race car driver and their ups and downs in life.Straight off the bat this movie is something special, like really special. I'm quite emotional and seldom tear up during certain scenes or try to hold them in. There are only 2 movies that made me cry uncontrollably, one is HACHI: A DOGS TALE and the other is this.Kevin Costner plays a dog or rather voices a dogs conscience and is the narrator of the movie. I will be honest when I hear about someone voicing a dogs conscience my mind doesn't go to Kevin Costner but man was he perfect for it. Every emotional scene gets turned tenfold with his beautiful narrative. Milo Ventimiglia plays the race car driver and after finishing the movie I can't think of anyone better in that role. Even Amanda Seyfried who I'm not a fan of, gave a very good performance. Performance wise the movie has no fault really.The dog is quite the racing enthusiast and almost immediately forms a special bond with Denny(the lead character) sharing his love for racing. This movie basically had everything that made me smile but still managed to make me cry like a toddler . My favourite dog breed, a racing backdrop, intricate bond between man and dog all wrapped in a family friendly tearjerker. I'm not kidding when I say that I loved the dogs character development towards a certain character(won't spoil) and it was so nicely done. When was the last time you heard about a dogs character development in a movie?I also really loved the attention to racing it gives. Quoting Ayrton Senna a couple of times and his complete mastery in driving in the rain is rather very well imprinted in to the main character and is beautifully explored. The Ferrari tie-ins and references to other historic drivers and races are all just very nicely put together. The dog is named Enzo for crying out loud!And don't take its technical aspects for granted either. The cinematography is beautiful although somewhat constricted due to most of the setting being in a normal household. But everytime it gets a sniff of the outside environment it just shifts a gear and completely amazes you. The score is fantastic and the movie is beautifully shot. The racing scenes are impressive and I was surprised they didn't rely on any of the quick cut crap. Especially when it rained and the tires squealed you really get the significance and justification of the title.But interesting thing to note that these are all just the backdrops. The real greatness lies in the day to day activities of the dog and him coping with his changing lifestyle. But it never felt out of place or forced in. The family and dog scenes blend impeccably with the racing setting. The only problem with this movie could be that it focuses on the racing part a little less in the 2nd act but that's about it. And have I mentioned how funny some scenes truly are? Not once did it felt dreary or slow,not once did I felt like checking some other stuffs. I was glued to my seat and enjoyed the ride. And one last time Kevin Costner made this movie truly memorable when it could've easily been a generic dog movie. It's hilarious, warm, entertaining and sorrowful.The use of a Zebra as a metaphor and other signs used to emote what the dog was feeling was simply brilliant. I don't know if dogs are actually this smart in real life or the whole Mongol belief of ""dogs that fulfill their life role come back as human after they die"" and I don't really care for the accuracy or validity of such. All I want to say is they used these elements for solidifying the dramatic and emotional aspects.The 3rd arc is when the movie really starts punching you in the feels. You can see its coming and inevitably hold your breath for the sadness that's coming and it does. But the scene of Enzo riding alongside his best friend for the first time and getting a whiff of the track he never thought was possible for a dog to feel, it really gets you. Those are happy tears but tears nonetheless. And Kevin Costners commentary just makes it harder to hold in the tears. Even the ending that might be slightly outlandish and fairytale-ish get's you in the feels.Honestly I got emotional just writing this review, that's how much I loved it,that's how much it touched me. THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN might just be a simple story about a man and his dog but it meddles with certain storytelling aspects and the little things that really just enhance the experience even further. This is already my favourite movie of 2019 and doubt any movie can take its place, they might be better but they'll never leave their mark on me the way this movie did. It's also highly underrated and wasn't on my radar, but you can be sure as hell I'm glad as hell that I watched it.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
100,rallierf1,As movie is good. However the title is extremely misleading it has nothing to do with racing,4,14 August 2020,"The movie as a drama is not bad and it is actually enjoyable so I would reccomend watching it but not if you're a racing fan as it has absolutely nothing to do with racing. The racing scenes shown either on the TV or the timeline are a huge mess, at one point you see races that were live and the cars from the 70's and at other points from 2018 and 90's and whatever. For me as a racing enthusiast I was trying to establish the era by the footage shown and that was all over the place.
Secondly the racing story is completely unrealistic. Let's say he is around 25 years old at the time the movie starts since he had already a few seasons under his belt. By the end of the movie he must be at least 35-36 years old. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY in the modern era goes from a road car test driver to F1 Champion. He wouldn't even been given the chance to even come near an F1 car. Also the reason he gives why he is fast in the rain is plain stupid and hold no truth whatsoever. Obviously the moviemaker has no idea about racing and possibly never even driven a car.
Change the title into something else such as : The struggle of a man and I would give it a higher score. That being said I wouldn't have watched it.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

I'll never know whether they pick us or we pick them it's just one of those things that's meant to be and you find each other along the way.

Tears of sorrow combined with tears of joy streamed down my face, and this little old lady came over to me and said, ""Honey, are you ok?"" I smiled and just said, ""This book is so good!""Flash forward to the movie, and I literally almost started crying at the very first scene. I hold the book in high regard, and the opening shot of Enzo just brought back so many good memories of the book. As I watched the movie, I felt the producers/director stayed very true to the message of the source material. Do I know scene-by-scene if they stayed true? No, I do not. However, the overall beginning to end conveys the major events that happen, and without a doubt, it was such an incredible struggle not to burst into tears during the final moments of the movie. I was not alone in this as I heard many sniffles in the audience. It was almost sold out on a Tuesday matinee!The overall message is perseverance, love, loyalty, and being true to yourself.

Without giving anything away, the director cleverly chose one of the most emotionally powerful scenes he could think of to open up with, so that the viewer is never given a chance to gradually come up to speed but instead, catilpulted right into a world that only people who have ever loved a dog from beginning to end will understand. I know that includes most of us. I watched the entire film with that old familiar lump in my throat and never one time did that sinking feeling let up, even though it is occasionally punctuated with humor. I'm always afraid to say to much in these reviews because I don't really know what a spoiler so I'll just say this.
After studying Paleoanthropology I'm not even sure if early man would have made it had not dogs been right there with him through the bad times, helping on the hunt and guarding the camps during the long, dark nights.

108,lars-viebrock,A narrator wearing a dog-costume...,5,25 February 2020,"I am a big fan of Motorsports, Scuderia Ferrari, and dog movies. So I thought to myself, this has to be just the right movie for me.
I think dog movies are generally a difficult subject to handle properly. I don't know a single movie, that I'd deem watchable, where a dog talks to humans. So basically there are two routes for a dog movie to be good, either the dog is a dog, seen from a human's perspective, and we can only imagine what the dog thinks and feels (e.g. Marley and Me, Hichiko etc.). The second option is the story told from a dog's perspective, where we hear the dog thinking (e.g. A Dog's journey/ purpose). This movie has gone for the latter, and in my opinion more difficult approach.
In my opinion, these movies are difficult to handle, because the dog has to be interesting enough to be relatable, yet believable enough to be a dog.
The characteristics of a dog is what makes people love them, so there are certain expectations.
And exactly this is, where this movie fails. The dog fails to behave, think, speak, and act like a real dog. They could have just taken a narrator instead, and in many scenes, it would have hardly made a difference.There is more problems this movie has.

If on the other hand, the name Ayrton Senna means anything to you you will understand why his absence from the movie was so glaring.

No way that dogs understand words! They understand actions, myabe emotions but not words!
Dogs are so overrated.Back to the movie, the story, without Enzo's perspective, is dull, unoriginal and fake. So, not interesting.Don't get me wrong. I find Enzo cute.

There is enough sadness out there these days. Dog films I like but they always runs the risk of an unhappy ending. I tried but I could not race down this road in the rain past the early and premature demise of the protagonists wife knowing I still had to watch a dog die in a reprisal of that first scene (presumably, did not finish movie). 4 stars just for combining racing and dogs but the way they were combined is a travesty.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

Director shot every part beautifully. I was really impressed by the racing shots. Most of the time we see that an emotional movie like this just focuses on story itself and does not care much about the side shots.

Even if you dont have any dog, lives with you but you really have a strong bond with animals, such as, mercy and love for those little things that can not speak as human can, they have feelings too.

188,jeffsswearingen,What a piece of great art.,8,12 October 2019,"The art of racing in the rain tells the story of a dog and his owner Denny Swift who played by actor Milo Ventimiglia and the dog Enzo is voiced by the legendary Kevin Costner. Near the end of his life, Enzo remembers the day that he meet Denny Swift who is an aspiring race car driver. Naturally Denny finds and meets the love of his life Eve whom is played by the beautiful Amanda Seyfried. They head together into life and start an family and we learn the ups and even a few downs in the lives of the Swift clan. I loved the acting and the story itself. It's based on a book and someone whom I know has read the book told me that a few lines she remembered from the book where in the movie preview of racing in the rain so the movie may not be much of an departure from book. I laughed at the cute scenes and even cried at the sad and tragic scenes when we learn of an major character that may die from terminal cancer. I found it to be fairly family friend with an PG rating for mild swearing like the words hell and Jesus spoken in anger and perils due to car accidents while race car driving. If you want an movie that you can enjoy with the family then may I suggest ""The art of racing in the rain"".",The Art of Racing in the Rain

We have action-packed movies to put you on the edge of your seat, we have horror movies to scare the sh** out of you... Can't we have tear-jerkers without everyone getting up in arms.

This film felt very intimate. This dog, with Kevin Costner's breaking voice has insights into the human world that make you wonder... Are they really sensing these things?

I didn't feel a connection between the dog and any of his human Co stars. It just felt like he was lonely and neglected his entire life. The lead (pardon the pun) was flat and just a poor dog owner.If you want to watch a real connection between a man and a dog, then stick on ""Togo - The untold true story"".

It was actually quite good.I thought listening to Kevin Costner drone on for a couple hours as a dog's inner monologue would be tedious, but the nuggets of wisdom peppered with the occasional witticism provided ample entertainment. I often felt like I was watching the ""Thoughts of Dog"" Twitter account played out in cinematic form. I absolutely loved both Milo Ventimiglia and Amanda Seyfried in this. The daughter was also played especially well by Ryan Kiera Armstrong. The relationships between themselves and also with Eve's (Seyfried) parents was perhaps a bit banal at times, but overall was still believable and endearing - although I felt like hitting the dad with my car at several points.Afterwards, I overheard several people tell the studio rep that they hadn't expected the movie to be a ""tear-jerker"", and the sobs coming from the gentleman seated next to me seemed to confirm that. However, I found the story to not be overly sorrowful or sad, but inspirational. A guide, if you will, for how to become an exemplary person shown through the filter of a dog's belief that by gaining this knowledge he'll be reincarnated as a human in his next life. (I know it sounds silly, but it was actually quite poignant.)",The Art of Racing in the Rain

It is a full blown story of life, and I would recommend it for everyone, dog lover or not. This should be what movie making is all about. Forget all the gore, violence, foul language.

the story takes place in the wonderful world of good feelings, with dramas that always happen to shatter this tranquility,you encounter the same clichés and ""déjà vu"" scenes common to so many TV movies,the acting is not impressive at all, with actors playing the same way most of the time,no risk in the direction,etc...If you like very much dogs and TV movies, it may suit you, but otherwise it is just another common production in the galaxy of flat movies.Conclusion : trust your impression, not the reviews.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

234,review_forum,Another Hollywood Gem.,8,16 August 2021,"This movie is adopted from the novel ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" by Garth Stein. Watching the story from dog's eye is a unique concept so the movie feels fresh. I think director Simon Curtis did a great job because making any animal act is the toughest job and he did not cut the original story at all. Story in this movie is so accurate that the movie feels like the visual version of the novel. Also the actor Milo Ventimiglia deserves a true appreciation. All pet owners can connect themselves with character Denny that Milo played. The bonding, relationship, love, loyalty between him and the dog seemed very much real. All these emotions we experience in 2 hours so the movie throughout is engaging doesn't feel stretched. Besides the technical department also did a great job the car races in the movie gives you the vibes of real racing track.

It wasn't until this dreck ended that I learned the voice was Kevin Costner. I could forgive the terrible acting, cartoonish characters, and predictable plot because I love watching dog movies.

It certainly is a true masterpiece, but I am very worried - as the studio people, I suppose, are - that all those who need to be constantly remembered that ""dogs don't talk "" or ""dogs aren't allowed inside courtrooms"" may lose some of the important plot points.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

261,mrsamyhanson,I adored this movie,10,7 September 2019,"I read the book several years ago and really enjoyed the doggo character. The story itself was wonderful but it was hard to watch Denny go through everything he experiences and see him go to such a dark place (though totally understandable). I feel like this movie took all of my favorite factors in the book and focused on them. You have this brilliant, compassionate, WISE dog and this truly good Dad (Denny).I thought the casting was so spot on. Milo Ventimiglia nailed it and really embodied a GOOD guy that was struggling but stayed true to his honest and good nature. That parity and their relationship (Enzo and Denny) is the core of the story and they pulled it off beautifully.Definitely prepare to bring tissues. This movie catches you in the feels as it goes through joy, fear, loss, love, despair and back around again. Love and joy are at the heart of this movie. The characters (especially Enzo) say such wise and insightful things that help put this wild world we live in into some perspective.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
262,keithgtaylor-14580,Very Poor Writing,4,31 December 2019,"It started off fairly alright. Big spoilers below.
It all went to bad writing when Eve and their daughter Zoe left Enzo for days. I get that it is to show Eve's memory starting to fail her but I doubt it would be that long without someone mentioning the dog and even if it didn't get mentioned why would the daughter Zoe not remember? Especially considering that Enzo was suppose to be considered a brother to her and she misses him so much all the time.
The second bit of bad writing that triggered me was the court case for custody of Zoe - that whole scene was built up for awhile and then was over in an instant with next to no suspense.
Third bit of bad writing is over the Enzo car accident. Denny ran with Enzo on a leash every time it showed them running in the city and then he suddenly decide to run with him at night during a heavy rain strom in a fairly busy city without a leash - ridiculous. Denny is an idiot, unforgivable.
There was other smaller poor writing things that also affected enjoyment of the movie for my family and I but those are the main big ones I can think of.
Too much forcing of heart warming and heart breaking moments that the plot suffered.",The Art of Racing in the Rain

269,dbgbca,Wow,9,3 September 2019,"I'd suggest that a ""good movie"" is one which makes you evaluate your life, and sticks with you. This movie definitely rises to that bar, but it also can be emotionally wrenching.
(Spoiler alert) As a 65 yo guy I have vivid memories of 4 years ago when my Golden Retriever came into the bedroom as my wife was struggling for her last breaths, and he laid on the floor directly under her head and looked at me with eyes expressing enormous concern, and wondering what was going on.
....
I thought this would be a fun, happy movie, but I was in tears all the way through.
Was it a good movie? It made me reflect a lot, it was beautifully done, the actors Gino and Amanda were wonderful.
I'll never look at my Golden quite the same way ever again, as we age together, but I also tell my daughters that this movie hits too close to home, there is no upside to seeing it and dredging up all of those memories.

( If you watch This is us, then you should know what I mean.) This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! A movie from the dogs perspective, about life and family.

The videography and ""Enzo"" (the dog), especially having such detail in his motion and expression, really adds to the almost cathartic experience of watching this film in conjunction with living with a dog.

Also using a Milo from This Is Us was okay, but I think the film depended on his cuteness and emotional expression rather than his talent as an actor.

325,hopecqrdo,This movie means more to me than I can explain.,9,10 November 2019,"My daughter handed me this book to read during my flight home after visiting my dying father. She had no idea of the impact of that loving gesture.You see, my father was a racer in his youth. He raced stock cars and did some rally racing. Non professional, of course, but he truly loved driving. And racing. He could make a car do things I never thought possible. And he loved dogs.We always had dogs when I was growing up. A few cats. A few mice. A rat. But always, always dogs.So....this book came into my life at a time when I was broken. At a time when so many of the passages and chapters held such a deeper meaning to me. When the words on each page touched such raw and sensitive pieces of my being.This book and movie may not have had that impact on others as it did me, but I can assure you, that if you are a dog lover and if you have had a love in your life that has been absorbed into your soul, you will enjoy this movie. And of course, the book.Thank you Patrick Dempsey for seeing that this remarkable book should be shared with as many people as possible.Thank you, my beautiful wife, for sharing your soul with me and making me understand true love.Thank you to my daughters, for accepting my into your lives and makíng me a better man.Thank you to my father, for my love of cars and making me understand the importance of the unrequited love of a family dog.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
326,marojni,Emotional movie,9,5 February 2020,Such an emotional movie .... for dog owners tears would come down easily .... thanks for such great feelings,The Art of Racing in the Rain
327,idadudes,A must-see for all dog lovers,9,17 November 2019,"It took a lot of self-control not to cry during the opening scene. I mean, gosh, I've read the book, I know what's gonna happen. But this movie is a lot like having a dog - you know they'll be gone in the end, yet it's still much better to be in for the ride than not having been with them at all. I love it. 🐕🏎🌧",The Art of Racing in the Rain
328,daphnegeessink,Emotional film,10,6 June 2020,"I laughed, enjoyed and most definitely ugly cried. I'm absolutely not an emotional person, but it was such a beautiful film wherein you get to see a dog's loyal, loving, caring life with all its up and downs. I also loved and enjoyed the narrating of Enzo's story and how it fits perfectly with the script of Denny and the others, even though they could not hear Enzo.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
329,juliann-93460,Worth the ugly cry!!,10,9 November 2019,"Loved the relationship between the owner and his dog in this! Loved the acting, story telling, the musical score, it was fantastic!
Knew I couldn't see it in a theater because of the ugly cry, but it was worth it!
Always love Milo Ventimiglia, and this made me love him even more!",The Art of Racing in the Rain
330,belacnosdoh,I could watch this movie over and over,10,18 August 2019,"The scene where the Dog (Enzo) says goodbye
to Danny is one of the saddest things you
will ever witness. As Enzo takes over the baby's
body to become human, Kevin Costner's
goodbye speech to Danny will make you
weep. I've heard also that if you mention that
you've watched this movie at official BMW
dealerships they'll give you a free Kevin Costner
scented car freshener! I would say that I was
disappointed with the lack of ABBA songs that
Amanda Seyfried promised would be in this
film, but her brain cancer made up for that.
One of my favorite quotes from this masterpiece of a movie:
""Ain't about how fast we get there, ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb""

331,joaoalbuquerque-32841,My first 10!,10,11 November 2019,"For many years I didn't watch such an intense movie. An enormous roller coaster of emotions from the beginning until de end.
All from a perspective of a dog.
Just love it.
Be prepared for being embarrassed :)",The Art of Racing in the Rain

333,jedroyaragon,One of the best story!,9,21 November 2019,My teary eyes flooded when I watched it with my wife. Can't contain,The Art of Racing in the Rain
334,cce-16288,Fantastic,10,10 August 2019,This was one of the most heart wrenching movies I've seen in a while. It kept me engaged because i love dogs and it kept my husband engaged cause he loves racing. The mixture of both things was a nice balance.,The Art of Racing in the Rain
335,dafan-56245,AWESOME movie!,10,2 December 2019,"This is one awesome movie. It will have you glued to the movie from start to finish. I'm no expert, but I thought the acting was great, good blend of scenery, and you do NOT have to be a racing expert at all to enjoy it. As someone who had to put my golden down a few years back, you may likely experience the same feelings I did. But no matter, go see the movie, especially if you are a dog lover. Had funny moments too!",The Art of Racing in the Rain
336,jasonbracy,Great Movie,10,10 November 2019,"We rented this movie, and I don't really get emotional at movies. Get some tissues or part of you shirt because this movie elicits so many emotions. Truly a wonderful movie.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
337,ambjur,Transcendenal,10,3 August 2020,"At first I thought that it would be a soft family film with comedy exaggeration but ....
Context is based on compassion - human (spectator) is through the movie looking through the eyes of dog in wide context of the conscious experience of ""How would it be to be a human incarnated in the dog body will total acceptance to be a dog?"". So we can say that compassion opens up a transcendental experience which teaches us to understand Life in form and Life it self which teaches us about our Self more and more and digg deaper and deaper into Thee Self it self. Trancesndental experience so teaches us through comation understand and experience and tune into the Self. And because the experience is experienced within it teaches us about Thee Self immanent which Realization is the Ultimate human experience.",The Art of Racing in the Rain
