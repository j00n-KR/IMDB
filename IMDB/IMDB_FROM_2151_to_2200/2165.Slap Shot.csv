0,MartinHafer,Fun...but you ought to be embarrassed for watching $&% like this!,8,3 February 2013,"""Slap Shot"" is a very, very adult sports film. It features LOTS of profanity, lots of politically incorrect language, references to masturbation, nudity and LOTS and LOTS of violence. Even by today's standards (which, admittedly are pretty low), it's a very adult film. But, it also is very funny and, like a terrible traffic accident, it's something you may not want to watch...but you keep on watching! The Charlestown Chiefs are a lousy minor league hockey team in a lousy city. Their fans don't care and the team seems imminently in danger of either being sold or folding completely. However, the player-manager of the club (Paul Newman) is a bit crazy and has come up with a plan to POSSIBLY save the team and his career--get his players to play as dirty as possible to create fan spirit. And, after playing like a squad of nothing but goons, the team starts to win and fans come pouring into the stadium. And, to further excite his team, he begins spreading false rumors about a buyer for the team. It all culminates in an incredibly stupid finale at the championship game. Unfortunately, it's no longer a sport--just a punch of thugs hittin' folks!The bottom line is that ""Slap Shot"" is a funny and distasteful film. My wife even enjoyed it--and she normally doesn't like sports films. It's also pretty wild seeing Newman and some of the other actors on skates--as well as those Hanson brothers...who are kind of like Napoleon Dynamite combined with three Tasmanian Devils! Crazy fun.",Slap Shot
1,bkoganbing,Gonzo Hockey,7,18 December 2005,"One of the knocks that has always been given to Paul Newman was that he was not right for comedy. When you're talking about stuff like A New Kind of Love or Rally Round the Flag Boys that's probably true. But Slapshot shows that what Paul Newman needed to be good for comedy was something not quite so sophisticated.Slapshot ain't Oscar Wilde, but it's not quite to the level of the Police Academy movies. It's just right for Paul Newman as the veteran player/coach with a team of misfits from one of hockey's minor leagues who's forever looking for a break from the majors.The Charlestown Chiefs who seem to be the hockey equivalent of the New York Mets are having a perennial losing season. The town itself is one flush away from despondency with a mill that was the main employer in the town shutting down. That means the paltry attendance the Chiefs already have will diminish more. It's an uncertain future.So with nothing to lose, Newman's boys turn the sport into a hockey facsimile of the World Wrestling Federation. In no other sport are fights among the players so accepted. But Newman ratchets it up to an exponential level. And his team actually starts to win and the Charlestown Chiefs become a gate attraction. There's a lot more to the resolution of the team's problems, but that championship game is unforgettable. All Hail the Brothers Hanson.",Slap Shot
2,SnoopyStyle,Funniest hockey movie,8,1 December 2013,"The Charlestown Chiefs is a hopeless losing hockey team in fifth place. The team has to do ridiculous events to make extra cash. Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is a player/coach with a rag tag team with the latest being the goonish Hanson brothers. Their best player Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) has a jealous wife (Lindsay Crouse) who hates the small town. With the town's mill closing, the team has to close at the end of the season. Reggie Dunlop decides to pump up the team and attendance by planting a story of the team moving to Florida and starts playing goon hockey.This is an inappropriate movie and it's all the more funnier because of it. It is possibly the funniest hockey movie of all times. Director George Roy Hill rejoins Paul Newman after the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. It is more fun and more hilarious than either one. However you have to prepare for the language, the homophobia, and the goon hockey. It's certainly not a pretty movie.",Slap Shot
3,Hitchcoc,"It's So Stupid, It's Actually a Hoot",7,23 December 2016,"Like ""Bull Durham,"" the sport takes second fiddle to a bunch of intrigue. It's about aging players, greedy owners, manipulation, on and on. Paul Newman decides he has to take action to make sure his team manages to draw. In the small city where they play, there is a mill. The people who work at the mill are the fans. The mill is going to close, which will render the place a ghost town. This moves into an anything-for-a-laugh hockey movie with some totally unforgettable characters. When the Carlson brothers show up and goon hockey starts, we are amazed at the way the whole game becomes nearly surreal. Don't take this seriously.",Slap Shot
4,Woodyanders,A hilariously raucous and raunchy sports comedy treat,9,11 December 2006,"This wonderfully wild, riotous, raucous and raunchy humdinger about the blithely amoral do whatever you gotta do in order to win hyper-masculine sports mentality was an undeserved box office bomb when it was first released in '77, but has since rightly amassed a sizable cult following which considers the film to be one of the best, funniest, most gleefully rough'n'rowdy sports comedies ever made.The Charleston Chiefs are a strictly mediocre hockey team who invariably lose one game after another. Audience interest in the Chiefs is rapidly dwindling and their no-account, conniving cheapskate owner Joe McGrath (an excellent, uproarious comic turn by the late, great Strother Martin) informs them that their current season will also be their last one. Paul Newman gives one of his finest, most enjoyably down'n'dirty performances to date as Reggie Dunlop, an aging, womanizing, chronically infantile veteran player/coach who leads the team on a sudden winning streak by inciting his crude, childish, insecure fellow players to use every last petty, loathsome, audience pleasing illegal trick in the book when playing against rival teams. Pretty soon the Chiefs are back on track and on their way to a big championship game with Reggie's formally sagging career on the up and up.Directed in a terrifically adroit and punchy fashion by George Roy Hill, who makes the most of Nancy Dowd's coarse, astute, smack dead on the money barbed script, edited with fluid swiftness by Dede Allen and shot with tremendous invigorating élan by Victor Kemplar (the bang-up all-out hockey games seriously smoke), this boisterous and often sidesplitting dilly offers a marvelously pointed and frequently hilarious critique of the puerile, silly and actually quite pathetic overgrown kid mentality evident in both the fiercely competitive athletic macho guy mentality and cheerfully dumb, maturity be damned bull-headed machismo in general. However, despite the picture's acrid edge, the Chiefs still manage to be a nice, charming bunch of idiosyncratic manly man bozos; my favorite moment is when our jock heroes occasionally make a few raw, angry comments about a soap opera they're all watching together in a bar! Moreover, the cast is uniformly first-rate: Michael Ontkean as a touchy college grad who disapproves of Newman's boorish tactics, Lindsay Crouse as Ontkean's fiery, irascible, dissatisfied wife, Jennifer Warren as Newman's patient, neglected wife, Melinda Dillon as the flighty Suzanne, who's one of Newman's many sexual conquests; Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson as the moronic, barbaric, bespectacled Hanson Brothers (watching these geeky maniacs pulverize the opposing teams with their ferocious anything-goes tactics is an amazing gut-busting sight to behold), M. Emmet Walsh as local sports journalist Dickie Dunn, Swoosie Kurtz as one of the player's chatty, catty wives, Andrew Duncan as smarmy, motor-mouthed hometown sports announcer Jim Carr, and Paul Dooley as a rival team's hometown emcee are all fantastic. Ontkean's climactic striptease on the ice rink is a definite comic highlight. Brash, profane and hysterically unruly, ""Slap Shot"" overall rates as an absolute hoot and a half.",Slap Shot
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Funny Takeoff On Goons In Hockey, But Be Warned About The Language",4,20 March 2008,"I had to shake my head watching the outdoor NHL hockey game on New Years Day this year (2008) at Buffalo. In between periods, NBC announcer Bob Costas reminisced about his favorite sports movie. It was this one: ""Slap Shot."" Although I did enjoy this movie 30 years ago, I can't say I echo Bob's sentiments today, but I laughed along with him when it came out in 1977.It seemed that films in the '70s were either outrageously good or ridiculously sleazy regarding language, sex, or irreverence. Most tended toward the latter. Many movies - like this one - had tons of overdone profanity, As for sports movies, none was more profane than this one which, in essence, was a real takeoff on goon style of hockey. Kudos for that, and the NHL finally woke up 30 years later and cleaned up its sport.After not seeing this in over 20 years, I was shocked it looked and sounded so seedy with almost every sentence seemingly having a cuss word!. It sounded like slob-like Animal House mentality on ice skates. However, I do admit there were a lot of funny scenes and I'll always remember the Hanson brothers, along with Oggy Ogglethorp."" If hearing the Lord's name in vain constantly doesn't offend you, you'll get a lot of laughs out of these characters, on and off the ice.",Slap Shot
6,moonspinner55,Mangy and hostile...,3,7 September 2007,"George Roy Hill's underachieving ""Slap Shot"" wasn't a huge hit when released in 1977, but cable and video turned it into a word-of-mouth success and now the film is defended with solemn righteousness--as if it were anything more than a violent cartoon. Scrappy Massachusettes hockey team plays dirty to win, with player-coach Paul Newman getting to show off a rare mean-spirited side of himself which doesn't sit particularly well (the whole movie is full of gratuitous put-downs, but hearing Newman tell a bitchy woman, ""Your kid looks like a fag to me"" has no kick to it--it's just ugly). Nancy Dowd's screenplay purposefully makes the characters mangy and vile, though Hill still wants us to respond to them with hearty merriment (this isn't quite ""The Longest Yard"" where abusive Burt Reynolds grew up a bit). By putting the audience in the same position as the dolts in the stands who cheer vicariously, ""Slap Shot"" is actually rather insulting. *1/2 from ****",Slap Shot
7,Quinoa1984,This is a f**** the world punk rock movie and a wonderful sports comedy.,10,20 November 2016,"Fierce and unapologetic, helmed by a tough mother like George Roy Hill and scripted by a woman (yeah!), this is a hockey movie for those who love hockey and also those who have no idea what hockey is much about aside from the fights- and believe me there are lots and lots and lots of fights here. When it ended my wife (who has become a hockey fanatic over the past few years) commented on how it's a movie where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts: it's not a terribly quotable film, but you leave having gone through a full experience.Slap shot is grimy and sometimes very sleazy, and with the exception of Harry S Truman from Twin speaks, the Chiefs follow coach/player Paul Newmans lead: we got to get people seeing this team again and win some (bleep) games, so he goes for a sort of nihilistic approach: screw it! Get in fights! Rile up the refs! Get the audience involved! Then maybe the team won't be folded and shut down by the owner but rather sold to some Floridian.There even is an arc for Newmans character somewhere in the midst of what is a precursor to Animal House, a raucously anarchic studio comedy, only they're out of college and working class dudes who don't mind getting some teeth knocked out or getting a lip sewn up post (or dying) game-play. It's extremely slight though and if anything the players overall desire to get the hell out of their current state (i.e. they try to play 'old fashioned' hockey without uh violence and then when they hear from blustery p'd-off old Strother Martin there are NHL scouts in the stands, that's all that registers from the managers motivational speech so BACK TO THE CREAMING THOSE BASTARDS!) makes it that much funnier.There are stretches here where the laughs aren't plenty - it's much a 70s movie that way - but much of this is so hysterically spot on because it is all about behavior. Sure, the players on their bus (plus some local girls following on another bus) mooning some angry rival team onlookers is one thing, and that can be funny. But Hill is smart as a director to let so much of it be about the personalities of these players - those three brother goons who play with their electric train set and seem more like one entity with three heads and pairs of glasses are a prime example - and also how Newman does a lot with just a look or a reaction, how he interacts with his friends girlfriend as she drives at top speeds in her van, how he is both 'don't give a f***' but giving a f*** at the same time for what counts.Did I mention how wonderful Newman is here? Kind of? I must say again that he is the heart and soul of this movie, a true star who continues (maybe at this point caps off) a career of anti establishment I-do-things-my-way forces of nature like the Hustler and Cool Hand Luke. He can be brash and crude as this guy, but damn is he charming and clever and a character only a complete stiff upper lipped being couldn't get behind.Slap Shot is a great comedy for the reason that we as the audience see all the truth that is there, in this case the dirty, foul mother and scabrous lives of (semi) professional hockey players, and that they are not in on the joke of themselves. And if my wife was somewhat correct that on a first viewing its not the most quotable thing ever, there's a constant energy to nearly every scene where the comedy is big and bold and brutal and unapologetic. I love that kind of comedy, and in a blue collar 70s milieu that is deep down, at the end of it all, political too (working class vs the rich, a town closing a plant so jobs gone, how will they go to hockey games, etc).",Slap Shot
8,wes-connors,The Icemen Cometh,8,21 January 2013,"Despite getting up in years, foul-mouthed ice hockey coach Paul Newman (as Reggie ""Reg"" Dunlop) still plays with his young team. Unfortunately, the ""Charlestown Chiefs"" are big losers. Then, they start to play rough. Violent antics end their losing streak and Mr. Newman's brawling icemen are suddenly bruising for the championship. They're also filling the stands with blood-thirsty fans...With outrageous comedy, writer Nancy Dowd and director George Roy Hill capture the sport well; there is a lot of truth here, satirical and otherwise. Newman receives his main support (more or less) from closet exhibitionist Michael Ontkean (as Ned Braden) and their possibly gay manager Strother Martin (as Joe McGrath). As a boozing neglected wife, Lindsay Crouse (as Lily) is a stand out. Especially noteworthy are the hilarious ""Hansons"" (Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson & David Hanson).******** Slap Shot (2/25/77) George Roy Hill ~ Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin, Lindsay Crouse",Slap Shot
9,michaelRokeefe,"Minor League hockey at its worst. Rough, mean & hilarious.",6,18 August 2001,"This movie caused some change of attitude toward Paul Newman by his fans. Newman using prolific vulgarities and scheming dastardly deeds on the ice is pretty far out from his norm. He is great. His mean spirited and sneaky deeds turn out quite humorous. A failing ice hockey team led by playing manager Newman is on the auction block. Three geek-like brothers come to the team and are well practiced hoodlums on the ice; they also help turn the team into a gang of thugs hated by the rest of the league.Included in the supporting cast are Michael Ontkean, Jerry Houser and Strother Martin. The classy Jennifer Warren is Newman's estranged wife. David Hanson, Jeff Carlson and Steve Carlson play the three brother wrecking crew.Strong language and moderate well placed violence prevail; but the dark comedy itself sells the movie. Paul Newman like you have never seen him before, but hey that's alright! He pulls this one off as smooth as ice.",Slap Shot
10,sunwarrior13,Slap Shot Is One Great Sports Comedy And Social Commentary,10,25 October 2011,"Slap Shot is a film that depicts the Charlestown Chiefs,a minor league hockey team that resorts to violent play to gain popularity in a declining factory town.It stars Paul Newman in a wonderful comic performance together with Strother Martin,Michael Ontkean,Lindsay Crouse and the famously known ""Hanson Brothers"" namely David Hanson,Steve Carlson and Jeff Carlson.The plot has Newman play Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a pathetic minor- league American hockey team,Charlestown Chiefs. His career at a standstill and his marriage in tatters, Dunlop has nothing to lose by taking on a new group of players who are one evolutionary step above Neanderthals - the Hanson Brothers namely Jack,Steve and Jeff.Only when the team begins winning does he decide to get behind these players, and to encourage the rest of the team to play as down-and-dirty as the newcomers. Straight-arrow team member Ned Braden,played by Michael Ontkean,resents this influx of gonzo talent, preferring to play clean. As the film's multitude of subplots play themselves out, Dunlop does his best to keep the outraged Braden on the team. To keep them motivated, Dunlop plants a story with sportswriter Dickie Dunn that the Chiefs are being sold to a prospective buyer in Florida. The owner turns out to be a rich widow who couldn't care less about hockey. She intends to fold the Chiefs and take a tax write-off. Disgusted with her, he storms out, and realizes that his lies blew up in his face. One last playoff game remains, and Dunlop reveals to the players that there is no buyer and he made the whole story up. After apologizing to his team, he decides that this is to be his last game, so Reggie wants to go out with dignity and not like a goon. Despite being conned, the team follows Dunlop's lead and vows to play clean.Unfortunately,the fight ensues later in the game.Braden, sulking on the bench after refusing to goon it up, finally snaps. He skates out to center ice and strips off his uniform. Both teams stop fighting and stare in amazement at Braden's striptease, hypocritically more offended by Braden's antics than the violence they have been engaging in.Slap Shot has become a cult classic especially among Hockey fans.Its nonstop barrage of profanity and its raunchy action sequences are of such intensity is probably what the movie will be remembered for.But it is more than just a comedic film for it is about a man, a town, a team, a league and a sport that are all dying, and Hill has created characters who are desperate, selfish, lonely, deceitful and violent.As for the themes or should I say ""dark"" themes of the film,it was basically a social commentary about the attitude of ""winning at all cost"";the power of the media;the Americans'love for sports and their fascination for violence as professed for the sport of hockey; and a view to the world of capitalism.Aside from that,it also touches on broken marriages, selfishness, manipulation and deceit, sports-fan blood lust, battle between players and team owners and the effects of an economic downturn to a blue- collar town. George Hill created an absorbing flick that is frank,violent and extremely hilarious and the same time that states something about our society.It was one of the greatest sports comedy I have seen in my life.It was raunchy,violent and very funny.Slap Shot will rank among the best sports comedies and social commentaries ever made in cinema.",Slap Shot

12,hitchcockthelegend,"Funny, cynical and irreverent.",8,27 September 2008,"Paul Newman is the coach of third rate failing minor league hockey team, The Charlestown Chiefs. The town is hit hard by unemployment and this appears to be the Chiefs' last season, however, if the coach can whip up the team up into a winning frenzy, then the unknown owner might just find a buyer and save all their carers? The management bring in three odd looking brothers who, once unleashed, take the whole team on a blood thirsty winning streak right to the championship final. The crowds flock in thirsting for more blood, but then the problems start to arise.Slap Shot is a tremendously funny film, it's also incredibly violent and often vulgar in dialogue, but be sure to know that both things go hand in hand here (or should it be glove in glove?) to create one of the smartest sports pictures in the modern age. The hockey sequences are excellent (especially to a non fan like me), and the script bristles with course and biting humour. Slap Shot on its initial release was frowned upon by many critics, it was considered too profane and overly harsh with the win at all costs theme driving it forward. However, it's now rightly embraced as the smart and intelligent piece that director George Roy Hill wanted it to be seen as. A new generation of movie fans have started to seek it out and its reputation and fan base grows ever more larger by the year.Newman was a bona fide star, his hair silver grey but his good looks still firmly intact, his performance has a grace about it that oddly sits nicely amongst this cynical stab at professional hockey; even if his characters' clothes are, in truth, icky. It would be a big disservice if I didn't mention the impact of the Hanson Brothers, surely one of the finest combinations to have ever graced a sports movie? They are at once unassumingly likable, the next gleefully violent, they are the glue that binds the whole picture together. Film is filled out with sparkling support work from the likes of Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse and Jerry Houser.Not long after originally writing this review, the legend that was Paul Newman sadly passed away, he left behind a movie legacy that few can touch, and trust me, this is one of them. A sports movie that never gets old and continues to pay off on repeat viewings. 8.5/10",Slap Shot
13,Hey_Sweden,Essential viewing for any hockey fan.,9,6 January 2019,"Paul Newman, once again working with his ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Sting"" director George Roy Hill, has one of his finest roles here. He's Reggie Dunlop, the fun-loving player / coach of minor league hockey team The Charlestown Chiefs. The outlook for the team is not good; they've been struggling for a while. But after the lively Hanson brothers (bespectacled, goofy Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson, and David Hanson) join the team, Reggie is inspired, and the team turns their fortunes around by beginning to play dirty.Considered by many to be the greatest hockey film of all time, ""Slap Shot"" is not just a must-see for fans of the sport, but also people who love a good comedy and fans of the actors involved. The film does take on a circus-like attitude when the players give in to their more primitive instincts and not only participate in fights, but instigate them. This leads to a lot of great on-ice action, complete with plenty of bone-crunching and face-smashing. Written by Nancy Dowd (whose brother Ned was a technical advisor and plays the much-talked-about character Ogilthorpe), ""Slap Shot"" is highlighted by a hilariously profane script that allows the cast to throw out all sorts of obscenities.Adding some gravitas to the story is the ""depressed working class town"" atmosphere, in which the potential closing of a local mill could spell all sorts of trouble for the team and the citizens.The actors work together wonderfully: the cheerful Newman, the priceless Strother Martin (Newmans' nemesis in ""Cool Hand Luke"") as the weaselly manager / P.R. man for the team, Michael Ontkean (as the goal-scorer who won't get with the program and play rough), Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse, Jerry Houser, Andrew Duncan (very funny as the toupee-wearing local announcer), Yvon Barrette, Allan F. Nicholls, Brad Sullivan, Stephen Mendillo, Matthew Cowles, Kathryn Walker, Melinda Dillon, M. Emmet Walsh, Swoosie Kurtz, Christopher Murney, Paul Dooley.Rough, tough, and rousing, ""Slap Shot"" is a sure audience-pleaser. It's a classic sports comedy that loses none of its appeal over 40 years later.Followed by two direct-to-video sequels.Nine out of 10.",Slap Shot
14,dbborroughs,Really funny,9,29 September 2009,"Foul mouthed (this was one of the first films ever rated R for the language alone) comedy that has held up beautifully over the years. The story concerns The Charlestown Chiefs a minor league hockey team thats on the way out. The coach, played by Paul Newman doesn't want it to happen and so he takes matters into his own hands in order to assure that the team's attendance goes up and they have a shot of playing on. There's much more going, I've forgotten to mention the infamous Hansen brothers, three guys who a few short of a dozen but can fight and play hockey like nobody's business. A hysterical adult comedy, this is also one of the great sport films of all time. The film works, and has held up over the past 30 years, because the film is ultimately not so much about the jokes or the hockey, but about the characters and for the most part you'll like everyone of them. This is a wonderful movie. Just keep it away from the kids if you don't want them to pick up some very colorful language.",Slap Shot
15,view_and_review,Maybe For Hockey Fans,5,12 November 2019,"I think if I had more interest in, or simply knew more about hockey I would've liked this movie more. It was somewhat entertaining and I think I gathered the gist of it.The Charlestown Federal League hockey team is largely a losing team. They turn things around for themselves when they adopt sheer brutality as their MO. The team begins winning, fans are filling the arena, and they even gained a booster club. But, are they making a spectacle of the game just for the sake of putting butts in the seats?Sports has a culture and hockey has its own culture within the sports world. Understanding sports culture in general and hockey culture in particular would go a long way with this movie. There were some things I didn't understand about the movie and the motives and actions of lead character, Reggie (Paul Newman). I don't know if this movie was aimed at ridiculing hockey and its fans or not. It sure seemed like it to me.Whatever the message or point of the movie I know I missed it and that doesn't help for enjoying a movie.",Slap Shot
16,anaconda-40658,It Scores the Goal.,9,13 January 2016,"Slap Shot (1977): Dir: George Roy Hill / Cast: Paul Newman, Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse: Hilarious hockey comedy about taking chances. Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, an older coach and hockey player whose team, the Charlestown Chiefs are at a losing streak. Dunlop is manipulative and uses various tactics to ensure a win, including making remarks about a goalie's lesbian wife. Eventually he hires the three Hanson brothers as a trio of goons who delight in brawling on the ice. This sparks interests from fans as well as a winning streak. George Roy Hill hit big with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting and here again directing Newman at his best. As Dunlop Newman struggles in balancing the future of his team with his wife. Strother Martin plays the team manager who is about to cut the team loose until Dunlop brings on his newest brand of manipulation. Michael Ontkean plays Ned Braden who desires to be a real hockey player and avoid the antics his coach pushes him to do. Jennifer Warren plays Dunlop's wife who is tired of her husband's antics and inability to balance time with her. Lindsay Crouse plays the depressed wife of Braden. She has resorted to drinking and steering clear of Dunlop's advances. While the humour is questionable in terms of the merits, the film succeeds in showcasing a harmless sport becoming a media frenzy brawl. Score: 9 / 10",Slap Shot
17,HotToastyRag,Pretty dated,2,10 July 2017,"For the life of me, I have no idea why Slap Shot is a famous movie. It's so incredibly dated! I'm really sorry, Paul Newman, but you've made so many other better movies; if I write one bad review, I hope you'll understand.Newman plays a hockey player and coach in this utterly 70s sports movie that seems to be both spoofing itself and taking itself entirely too seriously. The players and fans get into brawls during games, in order to gain attention and popularity. It's really silly. Maybe forty years ago, it was supposed to be funny, but it isn't anymore. And since it's also a pretty lousy sports movie, I can't really think of any reason to recommend it, even to Paul Newman fans. If you want to watch a Paul Newman sports movie, try Somebody Up There Likes Me instead.",Slap Shot
18,mm-39,Dated but funny,7,29 December 2001,"This film helped ruin hockey, most people don't understand that fighting in hockey is usually done to protect the better player from getting hurt form a cheap body check, but enough of the hockey lecture.  I seen this movie too many times, but it still makes one laugh.  Some of the humor is dated, goes back to the 70's, but its still enjoyable too watch.  I love Doctor Hook Mc Craken in this film, he plays a 70's hockey goon perfectly.",Slap Shot
19,Mr-Fusion,One of my favorite sports movies,8,8 January 2016,"To be completely honest, ""Slap Shot"" would've charmed me simply for being a hockey movie. We could do with more of those, without Emilio Estevez. But it earns its place among the better (best?) sports movies not for having underdog skill, a committed dream or thirst for winning, but for dabbling in the gutters of blue humor and distilling the sport down to its most low-brow of beer-guzzling violent fun. The closest thing I can think of to compare this to is ""Major League"", which is a compliment unto itself.Even if you don't like the sport, the movie is absolutely worth your time for an unusually profane (and always likable) Paul Newman and for the psychotic Hanson brothers.Thoroughly entertaining.8/10",Slap Shot
20,MovieAddict2016,"Maybe a bit dated in its ""shock"" value but still very funny",8,26 September 2005,"""Slap Shot"" caused controversy when it was released in 1977 because it was essentially marketed on the basis that it was the rudest movie you'll ever see - and it starred Hollywood's famous ""clean man"" icon, Paul Newman.The movie is a bit outdated now in the sense that its ""shock"" value isn't relevant - it looks tame compared to anything else profane out there (in terms of language) like ""Nil By Mouth"" or ""Casino."" However, in terms of humor it still delivers. Paul Newman stars as a hockey coach who tries to revive a dying team - they begin to use on-ice antics such as swearing and violence to help win games.The Hanson Brothers (a trio of nerdy, vulgar players) are responsible for most of the outrageous humor whereas Newman relies more upon the stuff he's always been good at.The overall finished product is hardly great but it's effective. This was yet another George Roy Hill/Paul Newman teaming and it showed once and for all that they really are a terrific duo (like Scorsese and De Niro or Burton and Depp) and even when ""Slap Shot"" is failing it's still amusing because of Newman's presence and Hill's direction.",Slap Shot
21,KineticSeoul,Underdog story about a team that plays to reach the top in a immoral way,6,14 May 2012,"This is a hockey comedy and I can see why this movie is known by some people as one of the best hockey movie that adults and probably teens can enjoy. It just has certain elements that make it a cult classic. But I don't know, maybe this movie just wasn't for me because I didn't find it all that enjoyable, it was entertaining. But just didn't meet the hype that I was expecting from this cause just about every movie critic seems to have enjoyed this. The plot is about a constantly losing hockey team run by Reggie 'Reg' Dunlop(Paul Newman) and the team is hated by everyone because of there constant losing streak. But soon the team builds a reputation for being hockey goons and some dislike them but they also gain a lot of fans and most audiences want to see them play. So basically they turn hockey into WWE smackdown on ice and the audiences just seem to enjoy watching violence more than a game of legit hockey. And Dunlop is all for this because his team is starting to get popular. And there is bunch of comedic moments thrown in between or in the game. Paul Newman was good in this as a carefree coach that just wants his team to survive and get popular over how good the team is in hockey which makes him some enemies. His carefree but ambitious attitude just worked well in this flick. Despite it not feeling all that engaging for me as an audience or feel really connected to the team or anything like that or most of the characters. It does have legit aspects to it, since there is no special effects and everything that happen on screen is basically real. Now like I said I can see why this movie has elements that make it a cult classic but I can also see why this movie would appeal to small audiences.

22,sddavis63,An Over The Top Caricature Of Hockey In The 70's,3,14 February 2010,"""What do you mean this is a serious game?"" asks the referee to one of the players. ""This is hockey!"" That about sums up the movie. It starts out with an amusing scene of a hockey player (played by an actor using an atrocious French-Canadian accent) ""explaining"" the rules of hockey to an American TV audience. From that point on the movie becomes a very exaggerated caricature of the game. Made in the era when the ""Broad Street Bullies"" (the nickname of the Philadelphia Flyers) were brawling their way to two Stanley Cups, this follows the exploits of the Charleston Chiefs and their player-coach (played by Paul Newman). The Chiefs are perennial doormats in the minor league ""Federal League"" and their owner is about to fold the team when Coach Dunlop stumbles upon the key to success - fight and brawl your way to the top - as a way of making the team attractive to potential buyers. There's references to the battle between those who like the new style and those who want to play ""real"" hockey ""like Eddie Shore"" - presumably a deliberate irony, since Shore was a very dirty hockey player in his era. I thought the movie spent too much time on the players' personal lives, although it made the point about the players' wives having to put up with the dreariness of minor league cities, while the players had to put up with the interminable bus rides. This is somewhat amusing, although the caricature gets taken way too far by the end, when the Chiefs' opponents for the championship change their entire roster the night before the championship game to bring in a bunch of toughs, and the player stripping on the ice at the end was just plain dumb. To its credit, the on ice action (when it was portraying hockey rather than hockey fights) was pretty well done, but overall I didn't care much for this. 3/10",Slap Shot

The film parodies the violence in hockey, and it had some potentially interesting bits in the class aspects of a blue collar town facing a plant closing, as well as a mostly faceless owner who disdains the sport and simply looks forward to a tax write-off, but unfortunately these don't come to much. Worse is the cringe-inducing homophobia. The best part of the film are the hilarious Hanson brothers, and the film could have used a lot more of them.",Slap Shot

The hockey action is pretty exciting as well with some amusing fights, and great humor as well. It's also very similar to what was happening in Hockey and NHL at that time with all the goons in hockey, so I also enjoyed that too. There's lots of vulgar language,blood, nasty humor and I absolutely loved it, cause i love controversy, as I believe this is one of the best Sports movies ever made it has everything you want. There are lots of funny jokes in this film one of my favorites was Strother Martin's joke about the Masturbator as that cracked me up big time. Overall Slap shot is a must see for any film buff as it's a true classic and hasn't dated one bit in my opinion.The Acting is very good. Paul Newman is terrific as Reggie Dunlop,he was funny,cocky but never overbearing and always had this great charm about him that you couldn't help but love he really is a class act I believe this is one of his finest roles!. Michael Ontkean is good as the hot shot Ned Braden who Doesen't like to fight as he has a classic moment near the end where he strips off his gear and starts doing dances that was the highlight for me.Strother Martin is good as the crook Owner he just brought lots of class and laughs to this. Jennifer Warren is OK but nothing spectacular as the love interest, and didn't really have much to do in my opinion her chemistry with Newman was OK. Lindsay Crouse is decent as Ontkean's love interest but got on my nerves with her constant snotty attitude. Jeff Carlson,Steve Carlson,David Hanson are all hilarious as the Hanson brothers and cracked me up whenever they were on screen as they were the highlight for me.",Slap Shot

There are endless scenes of home and road games that do little to propel the narrative. Newman is the player-coach, although he's too old to be playing and is not shown doing any coaching. The characters are undeveloped and uninteresting. This is inexplicably regarded as one of the best sports films.

It is not the best way of winning but still counts as victory.I liked this movie because it had a nice and simple plot with many funny moments. The interpretation of Paul Newman who played as Reggie was not the best but it was good enough for this movie. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Michael Ontkean's who played as Ned Braden and he was very good as well. Regarding the direction which was made by George Roy Hill I have to say that it was very good and he presented very well the story of each character separately without being boring while he presented much of action from the matches.

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Good if you can keep the foul-mouthed, political incorrectness in perspective",6,8 January 2009,"If you were writing a paper on political incorrectness, dirty language, and obscene behavior in film and you were trying to find its roots, you would certainly find ""Slap Shot"" to be one of the earliest examples. For 1977, this film is absolutely littered with it, and considering it's that old, some of what was politically incorrect back then is even more politically incorrect now. This is not a film for the sensitive people, particularly sensitive people that are feminists or homosexuals--unless you can keep it all in perspective.""Slap Shot"" is a sports comedy, but by sports comedy I mean it is more a celebration of childish, hyper-masculinity. The legendary Paul Newman stars in one of his few comedic turns as Reggie Dunlop, the player head coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a B-league hockey team with abysmal attendance and a losing record. When the local mill announces it will shut down, putting townies out of jobs and without cash to support bad hockey, the Chiefs announce it will be their last season. Dunlop, now staring retirement in the face, decides to promote violence as a way to energize his players, win games, and draw attendance in hopes that the team will be sold.The premise alone glorifies violence (operating on the assumption that people will pay to see it) and the film showboats physical humor. Hockey games consist of almost nothing but fight scenes. It's funny at times, but quite redundant. Insulting other players is also part of the agenda, whether calling them gay, their spouse gay, or other insults to their manhood. Some of the humor is the absurdity of the insults and the absurdity of these low-life hockey goon characters that shout them.Bottom line is this a guy's film. Don't even watch it with your girlfriend, that's how politically incorrect it is. Even the obnoxious masculine humor aside, the drama consists of following these guys around and showing their even worse off-the-rink habits. Even if you're girlfriend loves Paul Newman--and he's good--but he's good in the not very socially acceptable way. These characters are all uneducated, except the one who not coincidentally doesn't fight, and know nothing else but hockey. You kind of even pity them at times.That's not to say this film uses that stuff as a crutch, because there is comedy that is a bit more acceptable to all in the film, but the pervasive attitude is dirty, plain dirty. You either have to like that or be able to deal with it to enjoy this film.",Slap Shot
29,videorama-759-859391,"hard slapping comedy, steered by blue eyes, definitely scores",8,4 August 2015,"Watching this again, made me realize, just what a great if uniquely natural actor we lost. I'll be honest, I don't really like films, centered around sport, especially basketball or golf, although I did like Blue Chips and Caddy shack. What makes Slap Shot a winner, owes much to it's script, that really screams profanity, and doesn't mind getting bloody, hence the R rating, with comedic themes, and great characters. The Chiefs, a dying ice hockey team, led by Reggie Dunlop, (Newman O,naturel and great) earns their wins with dirty plays, instigated by insults, towards the opposing team. Slap Shot also has another plus: The Hanson Brothers, savages, who join Reggie's team. They also brought their little toy cars, and train set, which I guess, really makes them unique. The only guy, not for the dirty play is Newman's second man, Braden (Ontkeon, who's cheating on his average looker of a wife (Crouse, who's so entertaining, thanks to her anger) We have an older randy player, who likes to ramble on with old tales, as well as some ethnic players, one not really getting the character exposure he should of, while the other one, opens the movie, in what you could say, is a funny and hurtful interview. Why I like this film so much, to me is an enigma. I guess partly, it's because the players really get bloody, where the blood looks real, but too, like I said at the beginning, a lot of thanks, goes to the screenplay. We have two young female fans, in matching attire with matching hooters. One scene has Newman, going off at a would be female representative, who folds, as she can make more money the other way, thus making Newman spout an unsavory remark, firily, about the woman's little boy. We pretty much know how the film ends, with that ""last game must win"", scenario, only this victory doesn't go the way you think. Newman's performance really pulls you in, and there's fine work, from veteran, M Emmet Walsh, as a sports writer, while other performances from our other playes (double meaning) captivate too. Slap shot is a well made sports film, just as good now as it was then, comedy with does of drama then blend beautifully, with a great beating music track, attached. Definitely one for sport movie fans, regardless of the movie's age.",Slap Shot

Nobody's coming out to see the games, despite an onslaught of cheap, misguided promotional campaigns, and several seasons' worth of meager attendance has killed the team's chemistry. When ownership ponders throwing in the towel, Dunlop goes for broke, abandoning his ideals in favor of the bloody, fists-first melee method. If you can't beat 'em with finesse, in other words, beat 'em with your fists. That sudden about-face, plus the introduction of three nearly identical, horn-rimmed goons (Irish triplets, it turns out) catches on with the working class locals and the team becomes a hot ticket overnight.It's an off-color premise, and a film that's certainly not bashful about probing the dirtier attitudes and actions of the traditional locker room culture. The unrelenting foul language was a big deal when this first came out, but that's less of an eye-opener today than the rampant homophobia. But hey, in both cases, it's an accurate portrayal. This is a seedy situation, in a particularly seedy era, occupied by generally seedy people. Even the screen looks filthy. A lot of the humor missed me, though, and when that fails it's a major drag. Too long, too single-note, too drab; it wants to be a rollicking good time, riding the fresh buzz of a wild night with reckless friends, but more often resembles the shattered, smokey aftermath of such a party.",Slap Shot
31,smatysia,Ice hockey cult-classic film,7,29 December 2005,"""Slap Shot"" is apparently a cult-classic hockey movie. As a Texan, ice hockey is utterly irrelevant to me, but this is still a flick worth checking out. Paul Newman is, as always, utterly believable in his character. Lindsay Crouse, and Melinda Dillon were notable, as were the Hansons. The language is pretty salty in this film, and in this day and age, I'm surprised that I noticed it, but I did. And some of the clothes! I didn't dress like that in the seventies, but I suppose a lot of people did. That coat with the fur collar Newman wore! Whoa! The officially-allowed fighting was what made hockey a minor/regional sport back then, and the memory of it keeps it in that place to this day, whereas international/Olympic hockey is somewhat watchable even down here.",Slap Shot
32,slokes,The Goon Show,7,13 December 2004,"Man, I needed one complete viewing just to get a load of Paul Newman's wardrobe! Checkered pants. Fur-lined jacket. Buff leather jacket and matching pants. Great artists sacrifice for their art, and Baby Blue Eyes certainly does so here. Dropping a few F-Bombs must have been nothing to him after dressing up like that.It's for a good cause. ""Slap Shot"" is an enjoyable, one-of-a-kind sports film. Like many other sports films from the 1970s, such as ""North Dallas Forty"" and ""Rollerball,"" there's a strong focus on how athletes are used and abandoned in a capitalist society, but the message here is leavened, and largely bypassed, by the over-the-top humor, courtesy of Newman, Strother Martin as a shyster owner, and a team full of colorful misfits led by three brothers named Hanson whose thick Dilbert glasses and love for toy race cars doesn't distract them from committing felonies on the ice against their fellow men.""Slap Shot"" is about as much a guy's movie as can be, so naturally the screenwriter was a woman, Nancy Dowd. She wallows in all the profane banter, casual misogyny, and random acts of brutal violence in a way that might play a bit on the page like ""Clockwork Orange"" but is saved by the film's amiable humor and sense of fun.The darkest thing about ""Slap Shot"" is the premise. The Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team, are about to fold, and player-coach Reggie Dunlop schemes to turn his motley crew into winners by getting their blood up, along with their fans, by transforming them into thuggish winners to attract the attentions of an outside buyer that might keep the team running in friendlier climes.As played by Newman, Dunlop is very likable in his rascally ways, even while taunting a goalie about his lesbian wife for a cheap score. Newman throws up some vivid detail in this scene and others that must have caused a few people to blanch when ""Slap Shot"" hit theaters in 1977, but his banter is perhaps a bit less scandalous today and the movie as a whole seems to be improving with time. It's about the only thing out there, other than maybe ""Youngblood"" and ""Miracle,"" for hockey-loving moviegoers, and it remains the most popular, perhaps even best take on one very odd sport.The film is disjointed, though, with a strange subplot about one player named Braden who resists Dunlop's ""gooning it up"" and Braden's long-suffering dipso wife. The story here seems to strive for pathos a bit, and to give us something other than jokes, but as the pair are played by the unlikeable Michael Ontkean and Lindsay Crouse, it's hard to care much about them or how they turn out. They only slow down every scene they're in.The film scores better in the dramatic department with Dunlop's attempts at winning back his estranged wife. Dunlop's sincere in this, but easily distracted both in his machinations to save the team and by all the easy quail he finds on the road. One of the best things about the film is that it doesn't tie this plot thread up so neatly.""Slap Shot"" works best as a comedy. Like when Dunlop blackmails the owner's identity from Strother Martin, or how one mild-mannered player transforms himself into a guy named ""Killer"" who shows up at the big game wearing a Dracula cape. There's a driver who takes a sledge hammer to the team bus to ""make it look mean,"" assorted opponents who look like they escaped from ""Oz,"" and especially the Hansons, who are used very well because they are used sparingly.Director George Roy Hill was never wedded to any one style, and this is as far as you can get from other films he made that same decade, like ""A Little Romance"" and ""The Sting."" He does very little to dress up ""Slap Shot,"" even the credit sequences are perfunctory, but he knew how to make a good movie, and did so here. If you don't mind sports films that are a little raunchy and mean of heart, you will be entertained by this one.",Slap Shot
33,dworldeater,Classic,8,27 March 2020,"Slap Shot is a rough and tumble hockey drama/comedy that holds up through the years. In some ways the film is terribly dated with some of the worst music and fashion from the period. But, where Slap Shot succeeds is the brutally honest portrayal of the material. Paul Neuman was great here and was a very talented and charismatic leading man. He plays a coach and lifelong professional hockey player on a team that is to play their final season in a dying working class town where their factory is closing and laying off 10 thousand workers. The team so far has'nt been doing well and things start to turn around for them when The Hanson Brothers join the team and start knocking heads. Paul Neuman's character is a shyster as well, lying to his teammates and resorting to dirty tactics to win the game, not to mention trying to bang everything that moves. The film is pretty gritty and brash in its presentation and is quite violent. I think director George Roy Hill used this as a commentary on violence, but uses hockey and the bleak, downtrodden 70's urban landscape as a backdrop. The Hanson Brothers are the glue that holds the film together and being real professional hockey players gives the movie some serious credibility and are the coolest characters in the film. While the film is quite brash, it still is funny and most importantly a very good entertaining film that pulls no punches in getting it's point across",Slap Shot
34,caspian1978,The Ultimate Guy's Movie,8,28 March 2005,"Slap Shot is not your typical Paul Newman movie. Although Newman's addition to the movie makes it somewhat serious, this is by far a different sports comedy in its own right. Listed as one of the top ten ""guy"" movies on several if not most top ten lists, the rules are broken as a struggling hockey team fights on and off the ice in this crazy comedy. While the story has more to it than that, it is the characters of the movie that has made this somewhat of a cult classic. It's safe to say that every sports bar in American has a picture of the Hanson Brothers above or near the bar. For hockey fans, this is the best hockey movie ever made. For Newman fans, this is one of his more interesting, yet challenging films. While on the bus, off the rink and during the games, the audience relates to their struggle and the hilarious bond the team shares as brothers. Newman leads a cast of jokesters in this comedy ""classic"" if not soon to be classic. Don't take this movie too serious, the point of the movie is to make you laugh.",Slap Shot
35,onepotato2,A mess (not recommended),3,12 May 2004,"This is as mistaken as a comedy ever got towards thinking moviegoers seeking a few laughs required an elaborate plot (or any plot). There is no scene involving Paul Newman that is funny or interesting. I just didn't care if he repaired his marriage and understood why his wife wouldn't want him back. His character is a doofus. The movies merits and fun have nothing to do with plot or star power. If you're distracted by the snooze-inducing plot, you might miss some funny situations and lines in the middle. The Hansens are a very funny idea especially considering the timeframe; the further development of the anti-hero to the point where they even cease being physically attractive.The 60s anti-establishment viewpoint is eeking into absolutely establishment movies like this. Newman reasons his way to a now untrackable blow-up for unknown reasons. Whenever a laugh is needed you can be sure gay men and women will provide an easy punchline. The combative Lyndsey Crouse subplot is wrong-headed in every way. To see Jill Clayburgh young, playing this dumb, horny role is strange and unpleasant. Michael Ontkean plays a constipated pretty boy. God the 70s were hideous. Awful sound recording/mixing and really ugly technicolor process.Dozens of sports movie tried to recapture it's success.

39,TOMASBBloodhound,Convoluted script didn't make me laugh enough.,5,26 November 2009,"With so much adulation heaped on this 1977 satire of minor league hockey, this critic was prepared to laugh hysterically. But sadly there were only a few big laughs and some muted chuckling that escaped my lips. All the makings were here for a terrific sports movie. It's just too bad the film tried to do so much else when it should have just stuck with the on-ice antics or the antics on the road trips. The locations, wardrobe, and cheapness of minor league hockey at that time are all spot-on. The dialog is crude; scandalously so for the time it was released. But that's the way these guys would have talked to one another. The Hansons...... oh those Hansons! Absolutely hilarious! But why so much time dedicated to the wives and girlfriends??? Paul Newman is top billed here as player/coach Reggie Dunlop, a man who was once a great player but is now barely hanging on in both respects. His team stinks, his wife has left him, and he just seems helpless. And that's part of the problem with Newman in this film. He really doesn't add up to much. The supporting characters seem to get all the interesting lines and things to do. By the end of the film, the viewer could certainly care less if he wins his wife back even though we are constantly brow-beaten by this subplot. We are led to believe that he is sleeping with a teammate's wife, but this subplot also seems to go nowhere. Strother Martin steals every scene away from the blue-eyed star as well.I don't know if the film meanders mostly because a woman wrote this script or what exactly is the deal. Since her brother had experience as a hockey player, she should have just stuck with the team and their plight. Too much time is wasted on relationships that end up having no bearing on the team's performance. There is much made initially about the town's main factory closing, and then this is dropped too. There is much talk about the team perhaps moving to Florida, but this is just a ruse devised by Newman.... for who knows what reason. It just isn't clear what any character's motivation is. The film churns on for just over two hours and really, besides the parts with the Hanson's antics, turns out to be much ado about nothing. Is this a sports movie, a relationship movie, a social commentary about industrial towns??? Maybe it helps if you're a hockey fan.... 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Slap Shot

This movie is about that time in hockey, old time hockey, when bloody fighting was a necessity. It's a comedy. Look no further than Paul Newman's stylish duds to solidify that statement.

It had some laughs, and was farcical in parts, but not enough to make this film a genuine comedy, and it didn't work as a drama either.None of the characters are really developed or win our sympathy. The coach's marriage has fallen apart, but why shouldn't it have? He's quite an obnoxious hole, really. The Hansons add comic relief by being overgrown boys who happen to be extremely dirty players, and they induce the rest of the team to do the same and they start winning by abandoning their former clean play, though one player stops playing in disgusted reaction. On top of that, the movie is full of profanity, nudity, vulgarity, and cheap homosexual jokes. Anger at the woman who was about to let the Chiefs fold for profit is one thing, but calling her little boy a fag who would suck cock when he got older was genuinely ugly.Lowbrow entertainment can be funny; this isn't the case here.",Slap Shot
44,virek213,Puck You!,10,18 March 2020,"What DOCTOR STRANGELOVE did for Cold War politics and nuclear war, and NETWORK did for television news, the 1977 film SLAP SHOT does for ice hockey: It skewers the sport in a way that is so scatological and blackly funny. And moreover, it got us to see and hear Paul Newman in a way that we had never heard him before.Under the assured direction of George Roy Hill, who directed Newman (and Robert Redford) in two incredible box offices smashes (1969's BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID; 1973's THE STING), and a truly explosive, four-letter-word-ridden screenplay by Nancy Dowd, SLAP SHOT stars Newman as the coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a once-proud minor-league franchise that has fallen on a lot of hard times...as in, they haven't had a winning season in ages! Worst of all, the steel mill in town is getting ready to shutter its gates forever, leaving the few fans left in Charlestown without jobs, and hence without enough money to get to see a franchise that continues on the downhill slide towards obsolescence.But then the Chiefs' general manager, played by the inimitable Strother Martin, concocts a scheme that pays off dividends: He hires three brothers, the infamous Hanson Brothers (Jeff Carlson; Steve Carlson; Dave Hanson) who, how shall we put this, have a far different idea of how hockey should be played. It is with fists, brutality, and a bit of blood being spilled. Newman has already gotten into part of the act by baiting the opposing teams' players and coaches with all manner of imprecations, but the presence of the Hansons just ups the energy even more. The Chiefs suddenly become the toast of the Federal Hockey League and their hometown fans, especially when Newman, over the radio, offers a $100 bounty to knock the living stuffing out of the Syracuse coach during a game. But as it turns out, everything isn't quite what it seems....Even after having played some fairly non-conformist characters like HUD and COOL HAND LUKE, it isn't likely that audiences had ever seen anything what they saw in Newman in his role here as Reggie Dunlop. The man literally swears like a Marine in this film; and the stuff he says had to have been considered outrageous for the late 1970s. After films like SCARFACE, FULL METAL JACKET, and practically any Quentin Tarantino film you can name upped the four-letter-word quotient into the hundreds, it probably seems less so. But since it was a woman who wrote the screenplay, it's still a bit hard for some to take. The scenes of hockey violence, though far less gratuitous than what was to come, are still fairly savage, given that they are often spiked with the scatologoical language and humor, though the ""strip tease"" thing at the end, done by the one Chiefs player (Michael Ontkean) who mostly refuses to indulge in the blood and guts aspect of the thing, does ""lighten"" the mood up, so to speak.With some solid supporting turns by folks like Melinda Dillon, Lindsay Crouse, M. Emmett Walsh, Swoosie Kurtz, and Jennifer Warren, SLAP SHOT remains easily one of the most jaw-droppingly funny black comedies of all times. Just don't let the under-age set watch it unaccompanied.",Slap Shot
45,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"I looooved it! Take a shot, viewer",8,3 April 2013,"This profane comedy sport classic, is really a slap in the face, if you happen to be in the warring path of the Charleston Chiefs, a loser ice hockey team. Newman again owns the movie as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of the team, a true supporters who'd back any of his players, if in a rut. Only out there on the cold rink, there's more pucks hitting the skin of faces of the opposing team, instead of disks. Newman loves to provoke the opposing players with personal insults, one of them, involving doing one of the player's wives. The chiefs will use any violent or under the belt tactic to win. One of them, Brandon (Michael Ontkeon) Newman's right hand man, isn't comfortable with this play either, describing one of their shots as ""A bulls..t win"". Yes, it's dirty out there on the playing field, more blood, than victory. Slapshot is a lot of fun, but also the film, has a really good script working for it. The opening scene with a nervous Iranian player, being interviewed, yes one of the chiefs, will crack you up, for starters. The real stealers of the film come later, a twin brother trio, who you don't want to judge by the electric car set they bring, giving an angry Newman some great lines. Basically this team is being sold down the river. They're on the way out, hey but the bad news bears quit. No. Same moral applies here. I loved the scene with Newman confronting a woman sponsor, who has a change of heart, telling him, the games too violent. You should see how Newman responds, which makes for one of the great savoring moments of the film. Newman even has a player on his team, named killer, (Jerry Houser) a lot of fun. Incidentally Houser played Marsha Brady's husband in The Brady's Comeback Reunion, only here, he's another player, you don't want to rub up the wrong way. We also have two young twin groupies with big, you know, an older randy player, another of the chiefs eating them up with his eyes, behind stinking beer breath. Another player that's a plus here, was Ontkeon's wife, who's pi...d off at hubby, cause he's sticking his, you know what, in every woman. You should see her in a rage, especially when she's behind the wheel. Her and her bigger shaggy dog, end up crashing at Newman's. One thing certain, I could see a mile off, was that Ontkeon was eventually gonna slug mate, Newman, who ends up smiling, glad he took the initiative. Another Mitchell confession: Slapshot is my favorite sport movie. Why they brought a sequel out over thirty years later I'll never know, even though I've never seen it. It even marks the return of that same deadly trio. Believe it. This film was just so enjoyable for some reason. Newman, as well as being such a fine actor, has one of the most killer handsome smiles, I've ever seen, a smile that launched such an acting great, who like many other greats, are no longer with us. Highly recommended for any sport movie fan. Almost a must see.",Slap Shot
46,romanorum1,Raucously Funny Hockey Farce,8,8 May 2018,"In the film's beginning, at a sparsely attended hockey game a woman yells at a French-Canadian player, ""frog pussy!"" The viewer would then know that the movie will be profanity-laced and downright raunchy. Paul Newman stars as aging veteran player-coach Reggie Dunlop of the Charlestown Chiefs, a Pennsylvania minor league hockey team on a losing streak. That is, until the participants begin to play with extreme fierceness with the addition of three Hanson Brothers, who wear thick eyeglasses and who play rough and tough. They can certainly skate. Brawls abound as the fans cheer, and Dunlop approves of all this. With the dirty tactics, the Chiefs start to win right and make the playoffs. They sell out games. Then there is the irony that I will not disclose here. Meanwhile the local mill will soon be closing, and without support the team will also fold. It looks like the last season. As Dunlop incorrectly believes that the team will be sold to a Florida interest, he plants a story in the local newspaper. The story has several subplots. Paul Newman is in his element. In fact, he stated that he had more fun making this movie than any other. He's fun to watch as usual, but his heated discussion with the team owner near the end is over the top. Strother Martin plays crafty old-timer General Manager Joe McGrath. Andrew Duncan is madcap sportscaster Jim Carr. In a minor role, Melinda Dillon as Suzanne displays her lovely boobs for us to see. Brooding Ned Braden is played by Canadian Michael Ontkean, who disapproves of the rowdy play. He wants to make it to the National Hockey League (NHL). Lindsay Crouse as Lily is Ned's long-suffering wife. Screenplay is by Nancy Dowd, whose brother Ned Dowd was a minor league hockey player who made it for a short time to the WHA (World Hockey Association), which rivaled the NHL for a few years. Ned Dowd himself plays brutish Ogilthorpe. By the way, the hockey team really is the old Johnstown Jets of the North American Hockey League (and before that the East Coast Hockey league), as the ending credits thank them specifically. They actually won their league championship in 1975. The movie, filmed before helmets were mandatory, was filmed in New York and Pennsylvania.

Loving hockey, I saw this in the theater and still see it as a small town story. It may have a cult following, but that is not to say it doesn't light the red light for new fans as well. Quoted as much as Spinal Tap and The Godfather, the writing is crisp and action hilarious as Paul Newman works his con man act on a memorable team of cast offs. This film remains both relevant and funny with some really silly scenes countering a few heartfelt moments. I said, a few, as the transformation of this hockey team of cast offs into a goon-a-thon on ice.

This one is a totally hilarious parody of machismo, without moralizing thank God; there are gestures toward conventional Hollywood morality, but they are almost always brutally undercut. The characters are all recognizable types that you never see portrayed in movies with such rigor, eg the sex-crazed teammate who is also totally disgusting (he keeps wiggling his tongue). And now I understand why the Hansons are punk-rock heroes, they are absolute superstars in the Warhol sense of the word. An American film that actually refers to Peterborough, Ontario by name; meanwhile Canadian features were doing everything possible to conceal where they were made in the name of being more like American films!

Well, regardless of the unreality of it all, it's still quite a good movie. Newman brings his trademark skill to the role of a seasoned hockey vet determined to turn his losing team around, by any means necessary. I'm no hockey expert, so I have no idea why he hopes to do this by having his players start fights on the ice right before every game, but it works. From his initial tactic (telling a goalie a very interesting fact about his wife) to jail to the final game, it's a film that almost never skews preachy (until, of course, the obligatory final locker room pep talk scene so typical of sports movies) and culminates in a rather unsettling manner involving a hockey uniform.The movie's strength is in its tongue-in-bleeding-cheek humor and fantastic cinematography, as well as (you guessed it) Paul Newman.

50,mOVIemAN56,Funniest film to date,10,28 October 2005,"Slap Shot is the comedy film. My father had always told me it was hilarious but I never thought it could beat out such comedies as Happy Gilmore and Blazing Saddles, it has. Slap Shot covers a far-fetched story of a minor league hockey team about to go under.Paul Newman plays their aging coach Reggie Dunlop who is out to win, but after discovering that his team is going to fold at the end of the season, decides to work a new plan of offense. With the help of his players they take a more aggressive plan by fighting, insulting, and swearing with opposing teams to win. In the end they're are able to fight their way to the championship. Along the way, one player (Michael Ontkean) takes a stance against the violent ways and brings about the question of what they're doing is exactly right. Paul Newman is in one of his best roles to date. He acts with enthusiasm and skill and comes up with a great line in every scene. It seemed every time he got angry he said something that made me fall out of my chair laughing. Michael Ontkean is next in his fantastic portrayal of a man taking a stand against violence. But above Newman, above Outkean, are the Hanson brothers. The three idiots of hockey. They're violent, they're stupid, and they're all look like Jesus. They hold the funniest scenes in the movie with the senseless punches and acts they do and even managing to get thrown into jail. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Every scene, every line is funny in its own way. I couldn't' believe it at first. Slap Shot is the tied with Dumb and Dumber as the greatest comedy ever made.

The fact is this movie is a spoof, an enigma , simply, a caricature of hockey and sports and life in general. What a genius flick. I truly mean that . Every scene was thoughtfully done with ironic splendor. From the last scene where being nude is a MOCKERY... LOL, but shedding blood is not. Paul Newman gave a great acting performance . This movie rocks and I especially love the scene where Paul Newmans character parades into the lady owner of the Chiefs and declares they are 'human beings'.... thus human beings that are predatory animals . This movie was simple yet deep. Deep and hilarious, can't beat that. This movie was , in fact, a microcosm of life in general. This showed human emotions beyond the realm of sports and hockey of course. Simply put , a very underrated movie and a classic to be sure. The Hanson Brothers were fantastic and really the wild card of this movie.

The players who carry out Dunlap's message are the three Hanson brothers and they also become the heart and soul of the squad.  And the result isn't nasty as the original ""Rollerball"", but it sure produces plenty of shockingly funny moments that range from what the Newman character says to the antics that the Hansons resort to on and off the rink.

53,jeremy3,Maybe I was just tired?,4,13 July 2007,"I watched this movie fully for the first time ever on video late at night. I wasn't that enthralled by the movie. Paul Newman was not that great or dynamic in this role. I thought the hockey violence was exaggerated, even by hockey standards. The Hanson Brothers were funny, but they were a side story to the plot. The movie seemed awfully dated. I think in 1977, it might have appealed to the libertarian audience who wanted some entertainment. However, today the movie seems awfully dated. I also felt that there was poor character development. You never really got to know what was really going on between the hockey player and his girlfriend. Then, suddenly the young hockey player sees his girlfriend and starts stripping. Is this supposed to be fantasy, reality, or satire. It was never clear. The ending was very confusing. I guess the part I did like was when Newman's character goes to meet the snobbish owner of the team. It really highlighted how business could be so cold and impersonal. In general, I wasn't that impressed by this movie, and found it a bit boring. I don't think that the hockey World is that insane. And if this was supposed to be comedy, the creators of this movie couldn't decide whether they were making a comedy or a documentary.",Slap Shot
54,kyrat,"depressing ""slice of life"" movie - but NOT a comedy",4,18 December 2007,"I was improperly prepared for this film. I was told it was a comedy. I found nothing amusing. I then decided it must be a inspirational/message film about team work, ethical playing, violence, trying to make money by any means necessary, a gender and class commentary. Maybe just a commentary on violence, sportsmanship and game playing. Wrong again. If I had just been told it was JUST a film showing what life was like in a minor hockey league in the 70's I might've appreciated it more instead of looking for humor or meaning. There is no payoff. No growth in the characters (in fact they degenerate into nothing but goons).It was just a sad movie about some pathetic losers who were losing their dreams, their livelihood and their spouses. Very few of the hockey players were likable people so it was hard to keep watching when you don't care what happens to them. I think Paul Newman's character was supposed to be sympathetic but I thought he was just selfish and rather despicable.There were so many sideplots that could have been developed and would have interested me more. A town losing it's entire point of existence? Barely mentioned. The alienation and clinical depression of the wives? Shown, but not really addressed - just a given. A few hints at a critique of the violence taking over the sport - but in the end there was just an embrace of the new ""style"".It's also hard to watch from a modern sensibility. Having spent decades trying to overcome the sexism and homophobia of previous times-I really have no desire to return to those days (though it might be instructional for younger audiences who have no idea what it used to be like). The epithet F*G and the word lesbian used as an insult were pretty much the entire dialogue. While I respect that it is probably an accurate reflection of the times and the dialogue - I no longer find it funny.***SPOILER***The end was just sad. Watching them give up on sportsmanship; lose their jobs (was Newman lying about his new gig like he'd lied about most of the rest?);and delude themselves into thinking they'd stay with their wives.

There had never really been the ultimate hockey movie before Slap Shot came out in 1977. As a matter of fact, I don't know if there was a hockey movie before 1977. It does not matter, as Slap Shot is the only hockey movie worth discussing. Hockey is a funny sport. It has lots of action, fighting, men who drink buckets of beer. Why has this not become a more popular sport??????? All of the charm of being in the world of hockey is captured in this movie, written by Nancy Dowd (North Dallas Forty, Ordinary People) and directed by George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting), on ice action is only matched by off ice shenanigans involving a minor league hockey team that will be folding at the end of the season. Paul Newman plays an old, ready-to-retire-4-years-ago player coach who has to motivate a bad team that is about to fold after the local plant shuts down. The lasting image of the movie is of course The Hanson Brother, 3 lugnuts straight out of Canada who only know how to fight. Their fighting leads the team into a ""new attitude"" that makes them the most feared team in the entire league. They ride the fighting all the way to the top, at the expense of self pride in some of the players. There is lots of cursing, but it roughly captures the spirit of a hockey game, so don't be put-off by the four letter words. You also do not have to be a hockey fan to get the movie either. There is enough human aspects to the movie to entertain most audiences, and the comedy is brash and hilarious.",Slap Shot
57,GMJames,...and a hockey game broke out.,8,8 May 2001,"This was the first time in a number of years I checked out ""Slap Shot"". I remember the movie being very profane, dirty and extremely funny. It still is a funny film after all these years though I did notice a number of things in the movie that made it even more than just a funny sports movie.Nancy Dowd's very observant screenplay and George Roy Hill's sharp direction showed the trials and tribulations of being a minor league hockey player: the long road trips, the drinking & partying, the competition against other teams that are going through the same lifestyle.(Arguably, writer/director Ron Shelton did a slightly better job dealing with the same plot in a different minor league sports movie several years later: ""Bull Durham"".)The characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) who makes Yogi Berra's malaprop statements sound grammatically correct, the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: ""This is disgusting...."" How about that for irony!I do have to admit that what still has me laughing but not as much as before was the overall homophobic atmosphere in the movie. To insult another player (or, most notably, the Chiefs absentee owner) is to call someone a derogatory name. Despite mentioning this observation, I still laughed out loud when Dunlop taunted a competing team's goaltender, among other names, a lesbian. As a hockey fan since the 1970s. I believe screenwriter Nancy Dowd was very accurate in depicting what goes on inside and outside the locker room. At the same time, when it comes to trash talking, and the possibility that the person on player may trash, might be gay (e.g. a character in ""Les Boys"". For the record, I was not too impressed with the movie.), I wonder if ""Slap Shot"" is more dated that I first thought (bad fashion notwithstanding).The relationship between Reggie Dunlop and his still married but separated wife still sticks out to me as very bittersweet. Jennifer Warren's performance stood out for me when I first saw the movie and it's one of the many strong aspects of the movie. I got the feeling that as much as she loves Reggie, she was not a happy woman in the relationship.Paul Newman gave some great performances before (Hud, Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler) and after (The Verdict, Nobody's Fool, arguably, The Color of Money & Absence of Malice) ""Slap Shot"". I certainly don't think it's his best work but I though he did a good job of what it was like to be an ""old man"" in a young man's sport.Note: For legal reasons, a number of songs that appeared in the movie on the big screen and on cable TV do not appear on the U.S. home video version. They include ""Get Right Back Where We Started From"" by Maxine Nightingale, Elton John's ""Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word"", Leo Sayer's ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"", Fleetwood Mac's ""Rhiannon"" and a song called ""A Little Bit South of Saskatoon"".",Slap Shot

60,BoomerDT,Aggressive Hockey is Back!,10,21 December 2014,"It's the mid-70's and Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the ancient player-coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team in the Northeast. Reggie, the Chiefs, as well as Charlestown are pretty much on life support, barely hanging on. He has a motley group of players, not exactly hot NHL prospects. But Reggie and his team all share one thingthey absolutely love playing hockey and everything that goes with it, the male camaraderie in the locker room and road trips, drinking, poker and their groupies. Unfortunately, with the steel mill getting ready to close in Charlestown, the team will be folding at the end of the year unless an out of town buyer can be convinced to purchase the team-so Reggie Dunlop figures the best way to attract attention is to raise the level of violence on the ice to a new pinnacle.What unfolds is absolutely hilarious, but it's not just the action on the ice. Although to do a sports movie well the participating actors have to look somewhat authentic and hockey is not an easy sport to play. You can't fake it and everyone, including Newman are believable in their hockey skills. SS has some memorable dialogue and moments, whether they are about hockey, sex, marital relations, machismo hanging out with the Chiefs for 2 hours is a blast.Newman is the only really big star and he's terrific. But some other memorable faces in this including Strother Martin as the teams seedy GM, Michael Ontkean as a talented ex-Ivy leaguer who enjoys the life but has a wife (Lindsay Crouse) who hates being a hockey widow. Jennifer Warren plays Reggie's estranged wife-they are still in love with each other but she's realized it's time for her to move on. Melinda Dillon, who would become famous for ""A Christmas Story"" has a memorable nude scene with Newman, as the ex-spouse of an opposing goalie who also has discovered she's bi-sexual. Swoosie Kurtz also plays one of the wives who delivers a few memorable one-liners.

For many people, that is all it needs to be.I really like how it looks. The extensive use of natural lighting, the grainy quality of the film is appealing. I also admire George Roy Hill's visual style. There are a number of interesting compositions.The opening credits begin in a cutaway section of what was previously the blue square of an American flag. The finish concludes with a parade for the Charleston Chiefs. The Chiefs win using disreputable tactics. It is hard to deny that Slap Shot is making a statement about the falsity of American life; i.e., Americana.Then there is the homophobic quality (which Gary James mentions in his 8 May 2001 review). If one reads between the lines, Slap Shot can be viewed as an out-of-the-closet statement for Paul Newman. (If not Newman, then his character, Reg Dunlap.) Contrary to what many have written, Newman's Reg Dunlap does not originate the idea that if the Chiefs become a goon-squad it will bring in a financially depressed crowd. Reg Dunlap is a classic weather vane. What he thinks this minute is determined by who is around him. He cannot decide which woman he wants. He also repeatedly contradicts himself about what style of hockey he wants his team to play. (He even tells the police he thinks the Hanson brothers should be locked up, then works for their release.) Given the transient nature of Reg Dunlap's opinions, and the clearly identifiable scenes where Dunlap encounters the subject of homosexuality, it seems easy enough to interpret these scenes as Newman (or Dunlap) acknowledging that he has a gay impulse, regardless of what Dunlap says about homosexuality in scenes where he is more in control.Slap Shot depicts not not just the corruption of hockey, but also with American society. We are made to believe both are acceptable. Like the team's fanatical boosters, we are rooting for the Chiefs to win by using disreputable tactics.There is a powerful sense of indoctrination in Slap Shot. It does make the audience welcome thuggishness and the breakdown of civil society. (If the CIA made it that would explain why.) I laughed from start to finish, and the introduction of the Hanson brothers to ice is a riot. Slap Shot is amusing. There are many layers of interest beyond the mirth.",Slap Shot

It has set a new standard for comedy across many movies. With Paul Newman in here he kind of gives this movie a soul. Maybe not a great one, still something is in here. Lately there have been many sports comedies such as Dodgeball, Balls of Fury and many of Will Ferrell's movies. Yet none of them, except maybe Dodgeball have reached the originality and such witty lines from Slap Shot. I think this movie really has something more to it than just the comedy. It actually displays the faults in hockey and professional sports in general. It really shows that to many owners that the idea of having a team is like a cool new toy. All kids eventually get bored with toys and give them away or just throw them in the trash. This is exactly what we see in Slap Shot with the owner, she just plays with all their lives and can just make them a simple tax write-off. It also shows the desperation of the players. Paul Newman talks about going out with style about as soon as hears scout are at the game he quickly goes back to the team's brutal and dirty tactics (This made out to be a hilarious scene). The difference between this and other sports comedies is that it actually has a lot of realistic situations ( THough sometimes exaggerated). I would definitely recommend this.",Slap Shot

Growing up in southern California, hockey definitely wasn't on my radar until I finally went to a game in 1975, compliments of my dad once again. I became a major hockey fan and Slap Shot instantly became one of my favorite movies ever. In the 90s I was lucky enough to play a few games with ""Killer"" Carlson and he was a great and humble guy. Good hockey player too! I ended up becoming a referee for USA Hockey for over 15 years all because of this movie.See this movie because it takes you back to the good ol days when people didn't get offended at the drop of a hat. It's a fun movie to watch with my kids and I am looking forward to seeing it with my grand kids someday. I still thank my dad, who is now a spry 85, for the wonderful day he gave me.10 out of 10 for the fun the actors must of had making this movie. 10/10 for the pure comic book violence that is so over the top, you can't take it seriously. 10/10 for anyone who has played the game knows that some of the craziness shown in the movie is in fact accurate.",Slap Shot

What strikes me first about the film is how how low budget it looks - very much in keeping with team and the town it is set in. Its the gloomy 1970's in factory town, and like in a Bruce Springsteen song, the factory is closing down, with rumors of the team moving to Florida. Newman's own (ha) character, Reg Dunlop, is too old to be playing but doesn't have a great record to make him a desirable coaching candidate. So, changes are made...It's a fun movie, but also very much about the human condition - limited success in life, bad relationships, bad choices. Throw in the Hanson Brothers, a nutty Quebecois Goalie, a profane pervert and a college boy and you have a colorful cast of characters.Oh, and if you think the violence is a bit overrated, a couple of years ago I was treated to a minor league hockey brawl in Jacksonville, Florida where the Orlando Defenseman actually BIT a Jacksonville player and was suspended for 5 games.",Slap Shot
69,animal_8_5,"Toe Blake, Dit Clapper, Eddie Shore & None O' That Stinkin' Root Beer",10,12 April 2005,"Every hockey fan I've ever met, no matter how pedestrian, identifies with this profane, but prophetic 1977 cult classic. SLAP SHOT perfectly nailed the circus we know of as the now-defunct Johnstown Jets: a former farm team of the World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints. Real life is truly stranger than fiction, but SLAP SHOT seems to combine the best of all worlds.As legend goes, screenwriter Nancy Dowd got the brainstorm of doing a documentary on minor-league hockey, spending a few months in Johnstown, PA with her brother Ned Dowd. Ned, who was working his way up with the Jets from the U.S. college ranks, toward the WHA Minnesota Fighting Saints, was Nancy's inspiration for Michael Ontkean's Ned Braedon character.Nancy, whose 1979 screenplay for ""Coming Home"" would cop her an Oscar, was like a fly on the wall when all of these bizarre events began to play out before her eyes. She managed to capture ""the spirit of the thing"" and compose what is surely one of the most spectacular sports film plays in the history of cinema.As the storyline in SLAP SHOT was true to life, names had to be juxtaposed to protect the innocent. The Johnstown Jets became the Charlestown Chiefs. Real-life Minnesota hockey-playing siblings, the Carlsons became the Hansons. Real-life player ""Killer"" Hanson, inspired the ""Killer"" Carlson character. Brophy, the tipsy captain of the Hyannisport Presidents was so-named for juxtaposing with the Reggie Dunlop character, allegedly patterned after a career minor-league player named John Brophy, who went on to coach the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs.Everyone who lived in the seventies reported sightings of one incarnation or another of toupee-wearing sportscaster Jim Carr. And when it comes to sports-writing, Reggie Dunlop said it best: ""If Dickie Dunn wrote this, it MUST be true!"" Some of the classic character names in this film must be honored also: Barclay Donaldson, Tim ""Dr. Hook"" McCracken, Andre ""Poodle"" Lucier, ""Ogie"" Oglethorpe, Ross ""Mad Dog"" Madison, Clarence ""Screaming Buffalo"" Swamptown and Gilmore Tuttle.With all the other strokes of brilliance and genius SLAP SHOT has become famous for, we cannot forget the contribution of the star Paul Newman, who is believable and sympathetic as washed-up Chiefs player-coach Reggie Dunlop.Minnesota native, the late George Roy Hill, who also directed ""The Sting"" and ""Slaughterhouse Five,"" could arguably claim SLAP SHOT as the master stroke in his illustrious career.Miraculously, several stars of SLAP SHOT would go on to make other hockey movies: Yvon Ponton starred in the French-Canadian TV series ""He Shoots He Scores"" and the ""Les Boys"" film series; Paul D'Amato starred in ""The Deadliest Season""; Jerry Hauser appeared in ""Miracle On Ice.""",Slap Shot

72,rtrnt,"Boisterous, bloody hockey flick that hasn't aged well",4,7 September 2020,"Paul Newman stars in this in-your-face comedy about a failing minor league hockey team in middle America that badly needs a shot in the arm. Enter a new crop of players, known as the Hanson Brothers, who re-energize the team and who along with Newman's free-wheeling coaching style somehow catapult the team into contention, against all odds.As rough-and-tumble and mayhem-driven as this film may be, its loutish, violent and profane humor becomes a bit repetitive at a certain point and you will start to wonder where it's all going. Having seen many sports films since this one, I can vouch that this script is pretty low on any emotional investment in the proceedings. As pure mindless entertainment, it makes the grade. As utterly antiquated cinematic anarchy, it will be a fascinating watch for quite a while. But as a timeless film from a certain era, this most definitely falls short due to the lack of depth in any of the characters and an inch-deep portrayal of the grit required to compete in such a barbaric sport. Not recommended, except for film buffs who have a wicked fit of nostalgia.",Slap Shot

The player who checks himself in the mirror whenever he gets the chance. etc.Even if you don't like swearing in movies you'll agree it is a relevant part of the script in this very enjoyable movie.",Slap Shot

By 1977 I'm sure a lot of people didn't know very much about hockey, and weren't interested, but an Academy Award winning director decided to bring a story to life. Casting Paul Newman as the lead actor in a sports comedy was a good idea, he is really fun to watch in every scene. The movie is outrageously funny, especially when the Hanson brothers show up, and the beginning of matches. I recommend this to everyone, nobody will be disappointed.

Some of the humor is dated, goes back to the 70's, but its still enjoyable too watch.",8,26 January 2003,"Slapshot is my favorite sports movie for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out the most is this: it is not like every other run-of-the-mill sports films. Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness [both of which I like], it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win. Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way. In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer. A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles. The team had some hope. Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie: to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing? Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where. Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character! Slap Shot is without a doubt, the greatest hockey movie ever made. If profanity and violence are your thing, that this is your movie! If you are a major hockey buff, this is your film! If you like to laugh, this is your moving picture!  It seems like massive beatings are handed out by the second! Enough blood to fill a small swimming pool... not to mention enough profanity to last for the rest of your life... but hey, that's hockey! Any hockey fan will tell you that this movie is the best in the genre, so why should I tell you different?  Also Slap Shot"" takes the time to investigate an array of pro sports themes: sadistic player violence; boorish sexuality; fan behavior; fan loyalty to athletes and vice-versa (or total absence thereof); the bloodless, detached world of athletic club ownership. But the film is better than the snide satire it has been portrayed to be, and in its own manic way, it conveys much of the joy of sports. That was what made some of the films of the 70's great. They weren't the predictable fare we see today. Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun. What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman? ""Slap Shot"" is a movie that is more than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Also the characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) , the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: ""This is disgusting...."" How about that for irony! The only thing that could improve this movie is for their to be more Hansons arrive and to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways   Paul Newman sees the ""Boys"" playing with their slot cars and comments that they ""brought their TOYS with them!"" on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time. This is too bad because they are the best part of the movie. . But if you are like me and want to see cool hockey footage of guys playing without helmets, wacky stuff happening at the rink, the Hanson brothers doing their thing, etc. , there just isn't enough of it there. If this movie was made today, there would be less social commentary, less human interest, more Hansons, and more hockey. And, sadly, it would probably be a better movie because of it.",Slap Shot
77,Momcat_of_Lomita,A fun film that's going to appeal to a relatively small audience.,7,10 July 2011,"Reviewing a movie that came out in 1977 means thinking about what kind of people might want to watch this movie, because you're basically up against everything else that's on the shelf at the DVD store or that you see scrolling through the listings on Netflix or whatever.First of all: ""Slap Shot"" has a lot of swearing. A LOT of swearing. F-bombs, among other swear words, being thrown helter-skelter all over the place. It also has some ""boobs and bums"" shots, including what was probably the largest group mooning scene prior to the battlefield mooning scene in Mel Gibson's movie ""Braveheart."" And it drops some homosexual epithets and some graphic sexual references. So this is not a movie that you're going to want to sit down with the kids or the church pastor or your elderly and sensitive mother to watch.Second, this is a movie that is really about hockey. Hockey does frame some relationship sub-plots and there's some slice-of-life background stuff, but it is unabashedly a sports movie. So people who don't like sports, and especially don't like hockey, are going to want to take a pass on ""Slap Shot."" Third, this movie is set in a time (the 1970's) and place (a small semi-industrial town facing the closing of the factory that is the major employer) that younger people may just not understand or identify with. So people who are still uphill from thirty may draw a blank on this film.So who is going to want to watch it? Well, first of all, if you're a Paul Newman fan, you're going to want to see this film. Newman plays the lead, Reggie ""Reg"" Dunlop, a player who is also coach for the minor-league hockey team the Charlestown Chiefs.If you enjoy a movie that's full of bawdy, raunchy fun; that speaks of dealing with disappointments and the powerlessness of being just a depreciable asset on somebody's balance sheet without being preachy or angry or depressing; and that is about loving hockey, and minor league hockey at that, in the days when players didn't wear protective head-gear and a brawl with intervals of skating was the way to play the game, this is your kind of movie and you're going to love it.Newman's character, Dunlop, is middle-aged, this is probably his last season in hockey as a player, it's been his whole life. The Chiefs, the team he plays for and coaches, are one of the few entertainments to be found in a gritty blue-collar town that's facing the closure of the factory that's the major employer. Always on the ragged edge of perdition, stocked with players who are one waiver away from having to get a REAL job, the Chiefs are facing disbandment by the unknown owner because, as a business proposition, they're a dead loss.Dunlop's wife, played by Jennifer Warren, has long ago gotten tired of the role of hockey wife-- husband forever on the road, the vagabond life of moving when he gets traded, the groupies who go after her husband, the uncertainty-- and has left him. She's just had enough and without bitterness or angst is moving on. Dunlop hasn't accepted the finality of her decision, and throughout the movie he keeps trying to find a way to make her change her mind.Dunlop's assistant and fellow player is Ned Braden, played by Michael Ontkean. Braden didn't come into hockey through the blue-collar route of junior leagues and working his way up through the minors; he played on a scholarship at college, he's preppie, he's got a future outside of hockey if he wants it. His wife, Lily Braden, played by Lindsay Crouse completely deadpan, is also college-educated. She comes from a wealthy family and she HATES the whole minor-league, small-town, small-world, hockey-wife scene. She doesn't fit and she knows it, and endures it only by drinking early and often.Dunlop finds out the team is to be disbanded, and decides that if he can somehow cobble together a winning season, he can persuade the anonymous owner to sell the team instead of dissolving it. And so he sets out to inspire his rag-tag bunch of no-hopers and losers to win, to scratch and scrape and fight out victories any way they can.And he's aided in this by three new players who've just arrived, the Hanson brothers, who are certifiably nuts but can skate, can shoot, and can FIGHT like junk-yard pitbulls, and who are happily madly satisfied to win any way their coach tells them to.And that sets the stage for all the rest. Make no mistake, this movie has some howlingly hysterical moments, including one of the all-time best striptease scenes ever made.I loved this movie, and if you like sports movies and aren't a sensitive soul who cringes at the language and the non-PC references and nudity, and especially if you enjoy watching Paul Newman, you're going to like this movie too. It's a real gem of it's type.",Slap Shot

It's funny, its got some brutal hockey, and even more brutal fashions on Paul Newman, its got just about every curse word, and some pretty wild characters on the Hockey Teams.

79,gga,A gem of a movie,9,6 April 2000,"A Canadian friend of mine recommended me this movie as one of his favorite comedies. Since he loves hockey, I did not give it much thought. But, eventually, I rented it.It stunned me. This is a movie that is just too smart for its own good. A fabulous script that any studio nowadays would reject. This is a film that an be read on so many levels. A jewel of American film that has been disregarded by critics and audiences. By the reviews here, it seems even hose who love it might not have seen how deep this movie goes.This is a movie that is in the comedy genre, but just as with Chaplin's films, it switches back and forth to drama, too. And just as with The Great Dictator, there's a huge irony and social criticism behind it.On the surface, it is a comedy about a small losing hockey team and how they turn their luck by the use of violence. With this new tactic, they end up attracting fans, critics and disorienting rivals as the team rises to the top. The characterizations are vivid. Paul Newman's character is given a true motivation behind his antics: to win back his wife, who is about to divorce him. This is all standard Hollywood stuff, but still is some of the best. The scenes are terribly realistic, the dialog is never direct but subtle, and the comedy, except for the fights in the ice, is never played for laughs. There's excellent slapstick humor, but there's also some great lines that fans of the movie will probably repeat forever. The main characters are so real that it feels you can touch them. Paul Newman's role is a complex one and this is one of his best performances I've seen from him, with many facets. Both manipulative, romantic, womanizer, workaholic, leader and father figure. And the other characters share also that complexity: the other players, his wife and the wives of others, the team manager/agent, etc.But... this is just the surface. Sure, violence in the NHL may not be such a hot topic now that new rules have been put in place and sanctions have become more severe.But it is the secondary themes that really earn this movie my respect. It is in these areas that it has aged so well. In some aspects, it is even more important today than when it was made. The isolation of the wives of the players, enduring cheating and struggling with drinking and divorce. A real reflection of the dark side of our society then and now -- an analogy of the struggle between work and family, between professional and personal success. There's a good punch aimed at the sports media, another topic that could not be hotter in a time where basketball, football and even golf players are quickly turned into movie stars.Watch this movie once. Watch it twice. Watch it several times. It will keep getting better each time.",Slap Shot

81,artbreyfogle,Fav Sport Flicks? Ya Gotta Add This One,9,16 November 2011,"""Slap Shot"" is always in the running when folks start the list for their top sports films. First amazing thing about the film is that it was written by a Ms. Namcy Dowd and she based it on her local hockey team that had her brother on the rooster. Paul Newman turns in one of his best overall performances as the beleaguered losing player/coach, Reg Dunlop. The supporting cast is tops all down the line but the one stellar stand out is the GM of the team played by Paul's perpetual co-acting buddy, Strother Martin. The skating scenes are authentic as they used many real hockey types for the team roles. Even Newman does his own stuff on the ice and he isn't that bad. Latter versions of the tapes and DVD's of the film had a different music soundtrack...seems there was a contract problem with some of the music on the original print. Try to watch the theatrical release on Netflix to capture the original flair and feeling of ""Slap Shot"". The humor is raunchy and real and if you are like me you will watch it over and over again and still laugh out loud at the right places. If you have never, ever seen ""Slap Shot"" I am amazed...BUT don't sit there. Get up and turn it on now!

83,barrwell,"Its raunchy, its funny....and maybe the best sports comedy ever!",9,28 October 2010,"If you like offbeat sports comedies like 'The Longest Yard' or 'Bull Durham', or if you like the irreverent realism of a movie like 'Mash' and haven't seen Slapshot...you are in for a real treat. Although the aforementioned titles still pop up on TV periodically, and I even caught the similarly gritty, rowdy cult classic 'North Dallas Forty' on a premium movie station recently, unfortunately Slapshot seems to have disappeared from cable TV. Like many of the other forgotten classics from the 70s (the greatest American movie decade ever), Slapshot, which contains so many great lines and satirical scenes, should go on the need-to-rent list.Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, the aging player/coach of a third-rate minor league hockey team the Charlestown Chiefs. Reggie has been chewed up and spit out by life and as the film starts, his team of misfits is losing on a regular basis. Attendance is down and the news comes out that the local mill is closing and this is going to kill ticket sales. Reggie sees his playing career (as well as his marriage) is about over and figures the only hope is that the team can get sold and relocated. This is going to require a winning streak and it just so happens the chiefs general manager Joe McGrath (the incomparable character actor Strother Martin) has just finagled a deal for three near-adolescent, coke-bottle glasses wearing brothers name Hanson.In one locker room scene one of the veteran players ask the Hansons what they are doing as they wrap their hands, one of the Hansons answers ""putting on the foil"". At this point Reggie is appalled and swears these guys will never leave the bench. Its funny to watch all the players reaction to the Hansons and when Reggie finally gets desperate enough to put the Hansons in a game -thats when the fun really begins. To say the Hansons are dirty players is an understatement, and that initial scene where they hit the ice is hilarious.So Reggie suddenly changes his tune and decides the chiefs will become the dirtiest, rowdiest team in the league. Before long they are on a winning streak and rumors start floating around about the team being sold to some buyers in Florida. One of the great, cynical scenes in the film is when Reggie finally meets the teams female owner (Kathryn Walker) and finds out the truth. It's not a politically correct scene by any stretch, but its a hoot and sets the stage for the third act.Newman's performance hits the mark(as usual)as Reggie, and Micheal Ontkean also scores as the brooding Ned Braden. Braden had formerly been the chiefs golden boy before the change, he doesn't like the chiefs new ""image"" and his playing time has been cut. Ned also is having problems with his wife (Lindsay Crouse) and this sub-plot with Ned forms the basis for the rousing, crowd-pleasing finale.In the climactic game between the Chiefs and Syracuse, the top team in the league, we find out that Syracuse has brought in some thugs of their own and the result is literally a riot! This is when both Reggie and Ned see their fates converging and both see the foolishness of their lives and their decisions; -Reggie, for his abandonment of ""old time hockey; Eddie shore"" and Ned, for abandoning.. his life, and his wife. Reggie probably can't save his own marriage, but he may yet save Ned's.The final scenes on the ice bring together both the insanity and the redemption in a heartwarming and still uproarious montage. It's a very satisfying conclusion and one more reason I score this so highly.For as funny, cynical and satirical as Slapshot is in its best moments...for example, when Reggie keeps buzzing past the opponents goalie disruptively shouting ""your wife's a lesbian!...she's a lesbian!""...it also finds a way move us...high praise indeed for a sports comedy!",Slap Shot
84,hipcheck,The one great hockey film.,7,7 October 1998,"There haven't been many hockey movies, but among the small lot, this is easily the finest.  It takes a cock-eyed look at the sport, and what it takes to make it work at the lower levels.One of the most violent anti-violence movies, Slapshot puts itself right in the middle of a debate between using ""goonism"" or not, in order to win hockey games.  Newman is the player/coach of a failing team that is suddenly ""blessed"" with a trio of goons, the Hanson Brothers (no, they don't sing). Through them, the team starts winning by beating up the opposition, which causes an argument over the ethics of it, and how it affects the game.  The answers are given on both sides, making its statement that the only clear path is ambivalence.Another good theme is the look at the small-town life, when the industry is failing.  Newman and his troops, like all the workers in the town, must show a lot of passion for their work, even when it's tough to see the light at the end of the tunnel.While there is a decent degree of seriousness in the movie, it is the physical comedy that prevails, offering the funniest moments ever seen on ice.  The great thing about ""Slap Shot"" is that is doesn't try to do too much, it just plays itself out, and like Newman's character, is what it is, and that should work just fine, thanks!This won't make any movie-of-the-year lists, but it's worthwhile watching for some very funny moments--if you're a hockey fan, then it's indispensable!",Slap Shot

Paul Newman plays the captain of an inept semi-professional hockey team trying to stay afloat in a dying industrial town; when the team adds a trio of blood-seeking brothers (alone worth the price of admission), the team's notoriety catches fire with the depressed community. Hill captures this with a flat, no frills, documentary-like style and with Newman's intuitive ability to play on his aging charm, the film is absolutely convincing in its detail. Newman's contribution to cinema cannot be overstated: as an actor growing his immense talent through his beauty, he has given us insight into our preoccupation with our ideals of the American physique throughout its lifespan. He insists that aging has its grace and comedy and he's ruthless when it comes to examining himself. Hill also deserves credit for presenting Nancy Dowd's well-written screenplay directly and with a sense of timing that causes you to double over with laughter even as you're affected by the characters' plights.

90,jinchelsea,"Wild, woolly, insanely homophobic but lots of fun",8,22 May 2011,"Yet another film directed by George Roy Hill, one of the best Oscar-winning directors (THE STING) who is barely (and unfairly) forgotten, a man of great style and humor who deserves far more credit than many of his flashier contemporaries (check out his credits on IMDb). Paul Newman gives one of his wildest, most delightful performances as the crafty, foul-mouthed, aging player/coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a failing ice hockey team that is energized when it starts playing fast, loose and dirty. Hard to forgive the homophobic, guys-will-be-guys language, but but it's still pretty funny, and Newman gives it his all. And what ever happened to sensitive, hunky Michael Ontkean, a Canadian actor who showed amazing promise, but whose subsequent film choices (VOICES, WILLIE AND PHIL) pretty much killed his future starring career. Strother Martin, one of Hollywood's most popular character actors, was always fun to watch, and the on-ice pummeling keeps the action moving. And three cheers for the Hansen brothers!",Slap Shot

I had to go to the theater to see it again over and over to be able to hear the dialogue well enough. (I looked older than my age.) These were the days before videos and DVDs. I can recite the movie line for line, word for word. I had a HUGE crush on the Hanson Brothers! I couldn't decide which one I liked the most, and my girlfriends all called me crazy! Hey, I guess I have a thing for the long hair and the glasses....This has to be Paul Newman's BEST movie, and he was totally convincing as a hockey coach/player. The Hanson Brothers were the funniest guys I have ever seen or heard ever!! Their scene with the toy slot cars is hilarious, a totally a classic scene. The movie was so realistic. I grew up in a hockey town surrounded by hockey players in my neighborhood, so I was impressed. They couldn't have cast this movie any better. The use of real-life hockey players and former/retired players from the minor leagues was a great idea. Things were way different back in the helmetless era of hockey, which was just winding down at about the time the movie was supposed to take place. Everything about hockey was more exciting back then. I was so impressed that a woman, Nancy Dowd, wrote this screenplay. She really humanized the players, not just portray them as ""goons."" I thought that the swearing and constant cursing throughout the film only added to its charm. Most guys talk like that in that kind of environment anyway. It seemed so real. Buy or Rent this movie, pop some corn and get yourself a stinkin' rootbeer (or just beer!), and watch ""Puck Talk with the Hansons"" on the bonus features, too!

Worst Hockey movie I had ever seen!,3,29 March 2021,"I love a lot of hockey movies (Miracle on Ice; Miracle; The Mighty Ducks; D2; Youngblood; Goalie - Terry Sawchuk; The Rocket - Maurice Richard) so I had to finally watch this so called classic, and after all of the great reviews I thought it was a shoe in to be great. Boy, was I ever wrong! The beginning had some great humor at times, but got old during the middle and end to which it not only lacked humor , it lacked everything! This movie was pure garbage! I loved Paul Newman in ""The Hustler"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"" , but his character had not much to go on here as the story had zero plot, and just a story that makes no sense of absolutely nothing going on. It's just like a hockey spoof movie, only a spoof would of been much better. This was absolutely meaningless with random fights that were poorly directed. The best thing I liked about this film was that the coach was actually a player, too. It was a different approach to hockey that can actually make sense in real life, as the coach playing can guide them during play opposed to time outs. The thing they actually did that wasn,t supposed to make sense, actually makes sense to me. Well, that's this movie for ya. Don't expect much lol.",Slap Shot

97,Retroman40,Edgy In 77 But Tame By Today's Standards,9,6 January 2014,"I was a high school student living in a minor league town when this movie came out and it instantly became a ""must see"" among my friends. I think some of our teachers got sick of hearing some of the quotes. While the language was considered extreme in 1977, it is tame by today's standards. I recently took advantage of a frigid winter day to actually count the F-Bombs. On my DVD there are a total of 68 with Reggie Dunlop leading with 28. The funny thing is that none of them are gratuitous or forced and just seem to naturally fit in with the characters.This movie is a nice trip in a time machine. You have to love the vehicles all the players drive. Newman's outfits are so 70's it isn't funny. Back before the internet we actually got news from papers and not instantly like today.The action scenes are very well filmed and come across as very real even by today's CGI enhanced standards.Sure there are a few plot holes but it's a movie, not a documentary. Every character is believable to a certain extent.If you are a sport movie fan not only is this a must see but I have to wonder if it doesn't make your top 3 (it's my number one as well as making my all time top 25).This movie is a joy to watch over 35 years later.",Slap Shot

In my whole life, this is the only movie that I have preferred in a translated version (they are usually awful and ruin everything that made the original great except for the graphics), so if you speak French, at least enough to understand the weird way the guys said root beer in French, than I believe you should try it out if you liked the original.Et pour ceux qui parlent français seulement, j'ai dit que c'était le seul film que je préférais en français plutôt que dans la version originale, simplement à cause de l'humour typique québécois, mais que les deux versions étaient bonnes.",Slap Shot

106,defdewd,Like a @#$% time machine back to the 70s,10,11 March 2006,"I grew up in south 'jersey when the Flyers were still the Broad Street Bullies and all lived on our side of the Walt Whitman Bridge. They had handlebar mustaches. Many spoke with thick French-Canadian accents and wore wide ties, jackets with lapels you could park a truck on, and more than the occasional leisure suit. Many were just kids when they were pulled from the farmlands of the North and found themselves in the middle of suburbia by day, and at night, playing ""Old-time hockey"" while the chanting and organ music echoed to the rafters. Now whether you played pro hockey like they did, or were on the semi-pro Johnstown Jets that inspired the crew here, there seems to be a prototype player who played a certain style of game for the rest of us to watch. Sadly, that era is long gone. Marketers and big business have left the game in smoldering ruins. But we still have Slapshot. It perfectly captures what the game used to be and the guys who used to play it. Paul Newman is incredible as Reggie Dunlop, the aging player-coach who seems to be the last guy to figure out his team is on the verge of folding. The fictional town has hit the skids so that means no more hockey team. But instead of going out with a whimper, Dunlop has a scheme to get his crappy team back in the standings and the fans in the stands. And as the plot develops there's locker-room talk that would make even today's teenagers shut up and take notes. Nancy Dowd's story, which she wrote after seeing her brother Ned play in the minors during his career (and parody in the movie as Ogie Oglethorpe) translates into a total classic. The raw banter between Newman and his GM, between the players -- literally all through the movie -- makes for the most quotable flick I know...but I have to be so careful where I can recite my favorites. One such place was out on the fishing boat of a hall-of-famer from the old Flyers. (It's rumored one of the characters in the movie was modeled directly from HIM.) Slapshot brought even this guy to his knees with hysterics. Just rehashing a few quotes from the movie triggered his REAL stories of his own team that won the Cup two years in a row, and then never again since. That's how well the movie tells the story of hockey. There's a lot of social commentary here, too, if you are into such a thing. Lots on relationships, male bonding, machismo and the like. Some of the subplots take the story off the ice for too long, and the movie tends to drag in spots, admittedly. But when play is on, the brutal scenes reach such a sublime level of violence all you can do is gape and laugh in astonishment. The players here have all become like Reggie himself: They don't seem to notice that they've gone too far and they are creating a goonathon just to fill arenas. Meanwhile, those with real talent get benched right along with the national anthem. It's pretty clear -- both on the screen and during the times when the movie was being made -- that Old Time Hockey was on its way out. But it didn't go with a whimper, either, and at least Slapshot was there to give it a send-off to remember.",Slap Shot

The script zings along like they're all just making it up off the top of their heads. Truly inspired and probably slightly shocking to today's audiences. Even better, there are no clunky sentimental plot threads. The ""romantic"" story lines are realistic and touching in a blunt sort of way that really rings true.

I think the movie is one of the most underrated pictures ever made. There's more to it than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Fans of Paul Newman criticized his decision to play this role, but nobody else could have pulled it off. It was one of his best efforts, and in interviews over the years, he has maintained that it was one of his favorite films to work on, and Dunlop was one of his favorite characters.",Slap Shot

112,kickacan,Slapshot has not aged well - only Hansons score,3,28 January 2013,"Too often Slapshot is mentioned at the top of such lists as: best sports comedy, best sports movie, best hockey movie etc. - sometimes even best comedy. I recently saw it again after many years and it has not aged well. The main problem is with the script and dialogue and that is a very serious problem. I appreciate the main plot and themes of a minor league hockey team struggling to survive, but the actions and events are very contrived, especially the climactic striptease scene. The other ""comic"" actions and the ""comedic"" dialogue don't just fall flat, but they are outright embarrassing. Even Paul Newman manages to induce cringes. The only redeeming parts of the movie, and the reason for my score of ""3"" is the appearance of the three ""Hanson"" brothers. Played by actual pro hockey players, the scenes where they are prominent are a joy to watch. Not only is it obvious that they are very good players and skaters, but their comic scenes are the only genuinely funny scenes in the movie. The only reason to watch Slapshot is to observe the ""Hanson"" brothers in action. They don't appear until nearly halfway through and they only have about a half dozen short scenes - so keep your thumb near fast forward.",Slap Shot
113,FranklinOR,One of the Best,10,11 March 2007,"Truly one of the greatest sports comedies of all time. There are plenty of comments which are saying just this for good reason. Not sure how one could have a spoiler in this one since there are no major plot twists (no major plot save a low-level hockey team trying to stay afloat). Paul Newman is the lead car in this character-driven flick. He doesn't over-shadow the rest of the excellent cast, many of whom have seemingly remained in obscurity, save this one great. Yet many have had busy, interesting careers. I've seen Slap Shot several times and it ages very well, better than most of its time and genre. Though the men have better-defined parts (it is a story about hockey, after all), the women are great in their subtle, shadowy roles. They definitely help balance out what could have been simply (only) testosterone run amok.Of course: Hanson, Hanson, Hanson! Heck, I think I'll pop it in again!",Slap Shot
114,jon_m_hunter,"if you cant beat em, beat ON em *spoilers perhaps*",10,22 January 2004,"Slap Shot is truly the greatest sports film of all time.  It took a serious issue, such as violence in hockey and showed exactly what it did to the sport.  With subtle humor, it shows that violence in hockey has made a mockery of the sport.  At the same time, a clever story which also includes a sports issue that is rising to importance in current society is included. Owners versus players.  Another serious issue is the fact that Charlestown (think Charleston West Virginia) is dying, as the region has been in real life.All the subtle humor (Ned the gambling winner, homophobia, drunkeness, hockey wives missing husbands, the Canadians totally out of place, strange promotions, the ignorant stupid sportswriter, and the oblivious sports commentator) blended with the physical humor (the hansons flipping over the hotel guy, the 70s styles, hockey puck to the head of the organist, mooning the chiefs protestors).  Its a perfect blend of hilarity and yet a perspective on life as it is.  I own the movie (and have a poster with the Hansons on it) and I have seen it a million times and I havent found a better sports movie out there.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. 10/10",Slap Shot
115,mike-lovells-phone,Official Member Of The Slap Shot Booster Club,8,10 January 2015,"Every now and again, a movie comes along late on a Friday night being aired on some obscure cable channel that pulls you in and keeps you there, despite the premise being something that interests you less than collecting rocks - and Slap Shot is one of them.Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, an ageing Ice Hockey coach who is torn between a genuine love for his soon to be leaving wife, and an undying love for the game that has allowed him to remain a child all of his years. On the back of a series of heavy defeats, he decides to tear up the rule book and bring what is described as 'aggressive hockey' back to his side of dysfunctional misfits, the Charlestown Chiefs, in order to draw attention to the side in the vain hope that the team won't be foreclosed along with what appears to be the entire town.That's the premise, but what lies beneath is something incredibly fantastic; a genuinely funny, raucous and carefree movie that has clearly benefited from not only the time in which it was made, but also from the seeming freedom the director had when making it.If you don't like Ice Hockey or any sport for that matter, it doesn't make a blind bit of difference. This movie works in the same way that Airplane! and Blazing Saddles does - with an effortless fluidity and style that will have most viewers going back for repeat views again and again in search of another comedic nugget of gold.The character combinations here are superb, and the casting agent did a wonderful job getting Paul Newman on board, who seems to revel in this sort of role - this movie makes you feel good because it's clear from the start that it was a whole bunch of fun to make.Full to the brim with one-liners, appropriate and hilarious cursing, memorable catch-phrases and all the dysfunction you could ever hope for in a slick 123 minute runtime. Some of the scenes are genuinely laugh out loud funny; my favourite, the Charleston Chiefs organ player who gets clouted in the head and knocked off his chair by a stray puck shot from distance, only to appear in his next scene resplendent with a protective helmet - I had to spit my drink out.As mentioned in other reviews there is a small amount of social commentary here, but not enough to spoil the jokes, of which there are plenty. Hilarious, compelling and wonderfully carefree in a way that studio executives dare not entertain in this day and age, Slap Shot will surprise and revive you on one of those rainy Wednesday evenings after a bad day at work. So spend a couple of hours with the Chiefs - you'll be glad you did.8.1 / 10",Slap Shot
116,Xyon,Ever heard of an English movie who's actually better dubed?,10,26 December 1999,"The original English version of Slap Shot is great. For many it is considered a cult clasic. But everyone who doesn't understand French are missing one of the best Hockey movie of all time. It might be a cult clasic in English but in French it's a masterpiece.First it's about Hockey and we French Canadians are the bigest Hockey fans in the world. Second, we have shall we say a distinct dialec with our French. While most movies are dubed in France this one was actually dubed in Québec Canada. So you have a Hockey movie that's using our expresions so where can you go wrong?But still like I said it's still good in English. This is the kind of movie that grows on you. After seeing it once you might hate it and think it's the worst movie ever, but just try to watch it a second time and you might change your mind. This is exactly what happened with Siskel and Ebert. They gave it two thumbs down and a few years ago while on the David Letterman show when asked if they ever changed their minds they both replied that yes they did after seeing Slap Shot a second time they both gave it two very big thumbs up.So judge by yourself.

After looking at a few b-movies, I came across a film by the name of ""Slap Shot"". At first, it looked a little dated, but then I noticed that Paul Newman was in this film. After much debate with my friend, I decided to purchase this film, as it was only £5.99 (about $10). I must say that, after watching the film, I was rather pleased with myself for discovering such a good film.Okay, so it may seem a little dated, and some of the jokes are a little dated, but for the money, it was a great laugh. Essentially, the film is a slick blend of comedy and violence (lots of it). All of the characters have their little quirks about themselves (such as the Hanson brothers and Ogie Oglethorpe), and Newman is excellent in the lead role.A very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone (expecially those who enjoy a bit of humourous violence and a good laugh).",Slap Shot

Hard to believe that an adolescent could watch ""Slap Shot"" over 100 times and grow up to be a mild-mannered schoolteacher who doesn't utter a word of profanity. Slap Shot is a not a family movie...profanity abounds, and the sexual talk is frank and realistic. Paul Newman, who plays lead Reggie Dunlop, taunts an opposing goaltender, with whom he's shared a bed, by bringing up her lesbian sexual encounters with another player's wife. However, while the dialogue is frank, it does ring true. Slap Shot is a classic movie which both highlights, and degrades, the sport which is at the focus of this movie: hockey. Strong supporting performances from Strother Martin and Michael Ontkean, as well as a host of unnamable foreign hockey players, further serve to strengthen this 1977 underappreciated sports classic. Easily one of the ten best sports movies ever made, and definitely the best hockey film ever made (then again, what is the competition, Rob Lowe's low-brow 1980s movie Youngblood?), Slap Shot is definitely worth a viewing...or even a 101st!",Slap Shot

A legendary film in the hockey world, as well as in the sports world in general.The Chiefs, a team in the minor Federal League, faces a challenge as their team is expected to disband. With the team seemingly down and out, three brothers come to the Chiefs from the Iron League. Jack, Jeff, and Steve Hanson (who all three were actual hockey players at the time) come to the team and goon up the game, bringing the fans to the games. Although the fans and some of the team embraces the new style, leading scorer Ned Braden disapproves, going so far as to risk being benched to keep his game clean. To keep the team's hopes up, player/coach Reggie Dunlop makes up a story about the team relocating to Florida, rather than disbanding. He even goes as far as to lie to the town sports writer to make the story seem legit. When he finally meets the actual owner of the Chiefs (who, to his surprise, is a woman), she tells him that the team won't be sold. When they play in the championship game, Dunlop encourages his team to play clean hockey. But to their surprise, they are playing against the meanest players in league history. After a grueling first, they revert back to goon hockey and win the championship game.In the end, Dunlop is offered a coaching job in Minnesota, and states he plans to bring the Chiefs team with him.If you're a fan of great movies and purely hilarious comedy, then you're already a fan of this movie.

They are in the crosshairs of writer, Nancy Dowd as she takes aim at every male character (and men in general) other than Ned Braden (played by Michael Ontkean), the reluctant recruit to Reg's (Paul Newman's) goon squad.Every man in ""Slap Shot"" (other than Ontkean) are homophobic (or just plain homos), misogynistic, puerile and outright delusional.Yeah, we get The Hanson Brothers, and references to ""Eddie Shore"" and it's all supposed to be yucks and fun and games, but Dowd is pulling one over on everyone.All the women in the movie have power over men (not vice versa) including the owner of ""The Chiefs"" who will not go along with Newman's scheme to turn the minor league operation into something bigger. For her, it's just a tax write off. Newman's own ex-wife not only leaves him, but the small town drama behind to set up shop cutting hair in New York. Unlike Reg (Newman), she isn't bound by the illusion of staying young forever. She's the adult to Newman's puer aeternus and makes adult choices leaving Newman to play Captain Hook with the lost boys on ice.Dowd's greatest achievement is pulling one over on the men who gush over this movie as one of the greatest sports movies of all time.She thinks you're all idiots and even more so for laughing at her so called comedy, while in reality it's a blistering critique of men and sports, while elevating the female characters in the film at the expense of a one-sided- portrayal of caricatures supposedly cast as men.",Slap Shot
128,dvsden,"Don't Ever, Play ""Lady of Spain"" Again!!!",9,12 February 2005,"An absolute classic and must see for anyone who is a fan of slapstick or hockey. I remember in January of 1982 when 18"" of snow paralyzed St. Louis on a Sunday morning. That night, after we found out we would not have school for several days, the whole family watched 'Slap Shot' on ABC. Even the edited version was hilarious. When we got back to school, everyone was talking 'Slap Shot' and recreating all the best scenes. I think the entire snowbound city watched the movie that night. Although the movie slows in spots, the comedy and characters are classics. The first night the Hansons play, complete with slapping the puck at the organists' head, is some of the best comedy ever. The Championship game, with all the thugs from the '70's Philly Flyers-esqe Syracuse team, contains one of the only really original endings in a sports movie. (My favorite line from the game: ""We'll straighten you out, you little PR*CK"".) Great Fun, although not for the humor-impaired or overly PC-Types.",Slap Shot
129,mikedelo,A great comedy...,9,22 February 2021,"Slap Shot is to hockey what Caddyshack is to golf and that's saying something. Newman and his ragtag group of misfits show the sport's minor leagues in a hilarious romp. What makes this movie click are the characters. From Newman's grizzled veteran to the insane, over-the-top Hanson brothers, this movie has it all. It is not overly dirty or raunchy but it definitely isn't for the kiddos either. If you like sports at all I highly recommend this movie.",Slap Shot
130,folkpicker959,One Of Newman's Best!,9,13 April 2011,"One of the best Newman films I remember seeing, although I was somewhat taken aback at first by the level and quantity of profanity, although in retrospect, I guess I shouldn't have been. The film was made about Professional Hockey, not the High School variety. I was also very surprised at the level of skating demonstrated by both Mr Newman and Mr Ontkean. Those who for some reason feel it is necessary to burden us with their intricate knowledge - real or imagined - of Hockey Team and League rules and regulations, and how the movie appears at times to play loose with them, should keep in mind that ""Slap Shot"" was not ever intended to be a Primer for anyone wishing to know all about the sport of Hockey, nor was it intended to portray a 100% accurate bit of source material. It's not supposed to be a history lesson, it's supposed to be entertainment and - well - a very good movie. It does both quite well.",Slap Shot
131,chris-packham,"Ridiculous - of course, but Clever - absolutely.",10,30 April 2006,"Despite how many times I've been told that Slapshot is just a stupid sports movie, I am willing to take my admiration for this film to the grave with me. Slapshot is easily one of the most clever comedies ever written, and most definitely one of the better sports films of all time. What it lacks in seriousness or artistic merit that a movie like Raging Bull might have (it's hard to compare Slapshot with Scorsese), it makes up for in extremely clever, pointed dialogue and a brilliantly written relationship between the entirety of the cast. Michael Ontkean is outstanding, even more so than he was as Sheriff Harry S. Truman in David Lynch's Twin Peaks, and of course Paul Newman gives the movie the star quality it probably needed to flourish.Don't knock this movie for being just a stupid sports film. It may be exactly that, but for Slapshot, that's all its trying to be, and it's not a bad thing.",Slap Shot
132,Slegnam,One of the greatest sports movies.,8,17 October 1999,"Slapshot is my favorite sports movie for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out the most is this: it is not like every other run-of-the-mill sports films.  Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness [both of which I like], it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win.  Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way.  In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer.  A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles.  The team had some hope.  Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie: to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing?  Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where.  Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character!  Newman is excellent as the aging coach/player who wants one more chance before his idiot owner sells the team or puts it into bankruptcy.  This is the best hockey movie, [The Might Ducks offer little competition] and is a cult classic that any sports fan will love.  There are so many great scenes in the movie, from Newman taunting a goalie by calling his wife a lesbian, to the infamous ""the stupid machine ate my quarter!"" line, to anything the Hansens do on the ice.  This is a great movie that is severely underrated. A true sports classic, I recommend it to everyone.",Slap Shot
133,adamshame,Old-time hockey at its finest!!,10,25 January 2000,"I remember the first time I saw SLAP SHOT; I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to puke.  The best thing about this movie is that all the banter between the players, the attitudes, and the jokes are ALL TRUE!  I worked in the locker rooms for a minor-league hockey team  and I saw every character in this movie:  the aging veterans, the eccentric goalie, the lazy pretty-boy, the young players looking for a chance, etc.  It is so true to life and accurate, moreso than any other sports related movie out there.  And having all the actors do their own skating is a big plus also.  I really can't find a fault with this flick.And for my most favorite part of the movie?  No question it is Moe Wanchuck! I have yet to find a character in any movie that everytime he open's his mouth, I go into hysterics.  Along with Chunk from THE GOONIES and The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI, Moe is up there towards the top of my list of favorite characters in any movie I have ever seen.You know you have a classic film when the topic of SLAP SHOT comes up with your friends, or even people you have just met, and you spend hours reciting all your favorite quotes, trying to out-do each other.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie so you can be part of the fun!",Slap Shot

Any one who has played hockey past the level of Pee Wees or who has spent any quality time in Small Town U.S.A. for that matter can relate to something in this film. Everything from the ""Ratty Rinks"" to the team bus rides to ""Putting some ""F""in Downey in these uniforms."" This satire is dead on. The gritty accuracy of the struggling minor leaguers brings me back to so much I loved about playing and love as a fan. It truly is Old Time Hockey at it's finest. As a former player and a season ticket holder to the Tampa Bay Lightning I traditionally begin every season by watching this film. A must for any hockey fans movie collection.",Slap Shot

138,al-613,Best hockey movie ever - Only cult hockey movie,10,30 May 2007,"Slap Shot just gets better every time I see it. Quotes are in my day to day vocabulary. It is definitely a cult movie worldwide which I can't say about any other hockey movie. Let me tell you guys that the french version is fantastic (I'm a french Canadian from Montreal). It was doubled in Quebec, so it swears in Quebec french... as opposed to french from France. All out and mind blowing! It was so much popular in Quebec that I originally thought it was that popular because of its out of the ordinary translation, but later discovered by selling Slap Shot products that it is a cult around the globe (see www.madbrothers.com). Slap Shot is in my blood...",Slap Shot

If you have any respect for quality films, please take my advice and pass this one up.",Slap Shot
140,bradjohnhopwood,Love that 70's period,8,9 March 2012,"Being a little young to have seen this in the theatre, I can certainly appreciate it now, and especially enjoyed it when I was in High School. Amazing to of had such a talented and respected Director, his background being Czech I'm sure added to the 'realism' placed on action scenes and the mentality of North American hockey players of that time period. To some extent still permeates in today's professional hockey leagues, Euros always promoting the idea that they have all the skills, and North Americans all the grit and heart... Anyways, the movie is for sure in the top 10 all-time great sport movies; grittiness, dank and dark steamy arenas, the clothes, vehicles, hair styles, the characters, humour and empathy you can't help but feel.",Slap Shot
141,jln-3,The hockey of life,9,29 January 2005,"Just watched the movie again. It is a very witty movie that comments a lot, not only about hockey, but the American way of living in general and the average man as a part of it. The minor league hockey team in a small industrial town is in trouble. The team has obviously no future as well as their home town. Factory is closing down. People are losing jobs. Today, when every pro sportsman seems to be a zillionaire, it is quite surprising and refreshing to see how Slap Shot portraits the faceless and nameless minor league players as average working joes. Clever coach/player Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) develops a new disinformation and game strategy to help the team survive. Women of hockey are portrayed as a three types. Reggie Dunlop's wife Francine is already on separating stage and will eventually leave his husband and hockey for good, Wife 2 is a solid figure who has accepted her role as a hockey wife, and Lily, whose husband is a skillful scorer and a sissy player Ben, will have in the end finally closer ties to his man than ever before. Part of coach's new strategy is to play hard, even criminally, and that is illustrated by the retarded Hanson brothers, who use every illegal trick imaginable. Team begins to win. They draw fans. Violence draws the attention. Violence is a way to gain followers. The main figures are men, so there are many male references to sex but naturally it doesn't belong to the ice rink, until at very last moment, when Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) starts his famous strip tease number. The Syracuse Captain Hook type sees it as blasphemous. That eventually leads to the Charlestown's victory. Hockey as an example? TV as an example? When Reggie Dunlop finally finds his way to the owner of the team, he will hear the owner's kids are not allowed to watch hockey. The owner believes - categorically and straightforward way - that it gives harmful ideas. Right after that scene Reggie Dunlop hears on his car radio how one of his players, nicknamed ""The Killer"", praises his religion and peace of mind! When the hard hockey guys gather to the bar, what show are they watching on TV? A melodramatic romantic soap opera. Things are not so simple indeed. What Slap Shot really brings home, is the idea that the whole thing called ""hockey"", as any performance for the audience, is just a set of patterns. Violent patterns by Hanson Brothers are as possible as those blasphemous patterns by Ned Braden. If the coach Reggie Dunlop could dictate the rules, he would like to show class and play ""old time hockey"", but that idea leads to disaster in the first period of the final game. It's too late. Let's find out something else. Finally, in the victory parade, where whole township gathers to celebrate, we see the military bands, old war veterans, and they receive the victorious team as winning soldiers. This is the base where sports as well as every competition has been founded. To defeat the enemy and every obstacle. It is useless to criticize just hockey, in the case someone wishes to do so. It is just a part of society. And as we have very clearly seen, the hockey individuals are individuals from sex maniacs to followers of Eastern mystics. To make a generalization here, any generalization, is false. Essentially, whatever Slap Shot tells about ""hockey"", it tells about life. That's why it's such a great movie, and darn funny too. And finally, has there truly ever been winners and losers in the game of life?",Slap Shot
142,Grugster,THE Hockey Movie,9,26 January 2006,"Paul Newman was asked of all his roles, which one was his favorite. He replied that he didn't really have a favorite, but if you were interested in which role was closest to Paul Newman's character, he said Reggie Dunlop.This is a laid back look at the 70's. The economy was headed for the toilet, people were trying to understand what was happening around them as traditional values had been held up to ridicule by a generation that was still trying to figure out what to do with themselves. The movie can be taken on many levels if you begin to consider the mantra of ""old time hockey"". The story never tries to provide a definitive answer, but shows that when you try to answer the big questions, only more questions will arise.It ranks up there with M*A*S*H, Fast Times, and Caddyshack. Each has its own merits and makes various comments on society, some more deeply than others. If any of those movies appeals to you, then you will enjoy this.",Slap Shot
143,eakrigbe,Great Hockey Conundrum...,5,9 March 2020,"Let me preface this by saying - I do enjoy the morally devoid film from time to time. Rating and reviewing this film is an interesting challenge because it can be looked at as groundbreaking in some ways (appears to have inspired films such as Semi-Pro) and yet it seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. It attempts to create an atmosphere devoid of hope and yet insists upon being a raunchy Americanized comedy. The comedy does tend to shine through at times but the lack of chemistry and empathy by characters is odd and forces a sense of disconnection.Another potential issue is that there are an abundance of morally bankrupt characters (such as Wanchuk) that are so deplorable that it nearly begs you to dislike the ""heroes"". In some ways nearly every character in this flawed so greatly that they are anti-heroes.Profanity argument aside (that part I take no personal offense to) - this film seems an imperfect time capsule from the late 1970s. I really wanted to enjoy this - so many 9s and 10s and I enjoy hockey as well. To me this has not aged well but likely was quite a gem in the early to mid 80s. Well this may fit into the category of cult classic bear in mind that not all cult classics are great movies.",Slap Shot
