0,MartinHafer,Don't discount this movie simply because it's stupid!,9,26 April 2009,"Most of you are probably familiar with the plot. It's about two dopey teens who are assisted by a time traveler to do a history project and get an A in their class. Otherwise, if they fail, the future will be irreparably damaged. In other words, their passing this class is THE pivotal point for mankind--if the boys blow it, the future will suck but if they pass it, it will usher in a new age for the human race!While it's all very hard to believe (given that Bill and Ted are idiots), you don't spend much time thinking about the impossibility of the situation because the movie is so fast-paced. The film literally jumps all over the place in time and eventually they meet up with a ton of famous people ranging from Lincoln to Joan of Arc to Billy the Kid to Freud!! And, in a completely improbable twist, all these characters agree to come to California in 1989 to help our unlikely heroes!Sometimes some people are too uptight and look down on films that are totally silly and mindless. Such comedies aren't sophisticated enough for them and the humor seems ""low"" and possibly beneath them. As for the major critics, many often dismiss such a film or gave it a mediocre review without considering one very important factor--does it make you laugh? In other words, you can't just discount a film for being childish or dumb if it makes you laugh out loud. This is exactly the case with BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. Sure, it is often pretty immature and silly...but it makes you laugh out loud--hard and often. And, as for most of us, there really are times we NEED to laugh and let go. I know that when my wife and I saw this film, our lives were pretty tough. We NEEDED a film like this to make us laugh and forget about our troubles. Watching a romance, drama or an Ingmar Bergman movie would not have done this! So before you sell this cute movie short or think I am an idiot for giving it a 9, just remember--it WILL make you laugh...again and again and again!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
1,TheLittleSongbird,Nonstop hilarity from start to finish!,10,6 October 2009,"No matter how silly this movie can become, it is still a hilarious and engaging comedy, and an utter delight from start to finish. The screenplay was intelligent, original, uproariously funny and witty. I also loved the film's plot, about Bill and Ted going back in time to make sure they don't fail their history exam. I will admit I don't care for Keanu Reeves that much, but as Bill and Ted he and Alex Winter turned in honest, appealing and likable performances. The soundtrack is hip and cool too. The film is full of wonderful characters and scenes, the Tudor scene was indeed fun, but any scene with Napolean and Beethoven are guaranteed to end you up in hysterics. The adventure is fast-paced, imaginative and never has an unengaging moment. All in all, a hugely enjoyable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
2,Leofwine_draca,Likable '80s comedy with a great storyline,6,9 November 2015,"BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is a film that works thanks to the excellent, one-of-a-kind storyline that's the very definition of high concept: a couple of high school slackers risk being kicked out of school if they fail their history project, so they utilise the services of a time machine to assemble various historical figures to help them out. I love that, I love the concept and the execution is above average here.Bill and Ted are also a lovably goofy couple of creations. I remember when Mike Myers ripped them off for WAYNE'S WORLD a couple of years later but I hated his creations, whereas these guys are actually funny. Their quirky dialogue is quite delightful. It's the historical stuff that makes this film work, though, and while it's never really laugh out loud funny, there's plenty of absurd humour that arises naturally from the premise. Plus it's impossible to dislike a film where henchman extraordinaire Al Leong plays Genghis Khan...",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
3,SnoopyStyle,Most Excellent!,8,1 April 2016,"The future is perfect but it's in danger. Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) play in their garage band Wyld Stallyns in San Dimas, California. The two slackers are in danger of failing history unless they ace the final oral presentation. Ted is threatened with military school by his dad. Rufus (George Carlin) travels 700 years from the future in his phone booth to help them pass their history class and stay together to form their most excellent band. Napoleon stowaways with the phone booth and arrives in the present. The boys decide to bring historical figures back with them to do the report.This is simply a fun time with two adorable slackers. It is silly. I hope nobody takes the history lessons too seriously. One can certainly dissect this until all the fun is drained out of the movie. However, the lovable duo of Winter and Reeves cannot be denied. Also the diminutive dictator Napoleon is loads of fun.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
4,kosmasp,Most excellent adventure(?),7,26 September 2020,"It's easy to dismiss this or cherish it over the top. It just depends on your mood and how open you are to the movie and its characters. The movie is flawed in many places, one of the reasons being the budget. Though to be fair, you couldn't actually tell most of the time, since they had some luck with certain costumes or locations.Still you have to lower your standard, if you have a high one. This is not a history lesson, this does not care to be accurate about things and it has two central characters that some might call the ultimate Dudes. It also manifested a common theme and believe that Keanu was exactly like that character. Which he is not. And while I would still not consider him anywhere near an actor like De Niro or others, Keanu as a human might be one of the most down to earth and decent ones amongst us.Just gave you this as a bit of background, some may know or felt that way others not. But it is important to be on the ""Dude"" level to enjoy this. No matter the gender, if you can dig it, you can enjoy it. And yes from time to time you may think: but this doesn't make any sense at all?! Yes you are right. Just go with the flow if you can. If not, better stop watching. The fact that George Carlin is in this alone made it something special for me for example. Even if he is just a side character. In a ""normal"" world, where our main guys are quite illiterate but have a golden heart, it is not tough to root for them. Especially if they are on a mission (unwillingly) to save us all ...",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
5,gavin6942,A 1980s Cult Classic,7,16 September 2014,"Two seemingly dumb teens struggle to prepare a historical presentation with the help of a time machine.This is the film that launched Keanu Reeves' career and brought George Carlin to a new generation of audiences. Those who grew up in the 80s and 90s may know him better as Rufus than as a comedian.The film has aged a bit in the last twenty-five years, but that is to be expected. Unfortunately, because it is a music-themed film ,this was inevitable. The film is and will always be a ""cult classic"", but the idea of the future as expressed here is a bit more bizarre than even originally conceived.The film could also be seen as misogynist, or at least anti-feminist. With the possible exception of Joan of Arc, there are no strong female roles. Missy exists as a trophy wife, and the princesses serve no purpose other than to be brides or girlfriends. A feminist critique would be interesting.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
6,lee_eisenberg,"Dude, this was like...totally cool!",10,30 June 2005,"I didn't come of age in the '80s, so I missed the era when people mindlessly called each other ""dude"" and said ""totally"" a lot. But fortunately, I've seen ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", so I have some inkling of that culture. The movie of course focuses on SoCal high school students Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill Preston (Alex Winter) who want to start a heavy metal band, but are flunking school. Little do they know that the fate of the universe in 700 years will depend on whether or not they ace their history report. No worries! Rufus (George Carlin) comes from the future and gives the two boys a phone booth, and they go back in time and pick up Socrates (pronounced SO-krayts), Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ludwig van Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Billy the Kid and Sigmund Freud. Needless to say, these historical figures are a little befuddled when they arrive in San Dimas, and the people in San Dimas are befuddled by them.Mostly, the movie is an excuse to have Bill and Ted be the dopey dudes that they are. Whether it's Ted saying that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife (which, it turns out, some people actually believe), or the two boys getting slinky with some medieval princesses, the movie's got something for everyone. It is TOTALLY AWESOME! If you ask me, they should have also picked up Mahatma Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock.One more thing: Stephen Herek scored a personal triumph with this movie, as he did with ""Critters"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus"". Too bad that he drug himself down with fare such as ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Rock Star"" and ""Life or Something Like It"".",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
7,jboothmillard,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,8,23 April 2007,"I saw this film a couple of times when I was younger, and I'm glad I could appreciate it when I grew up as a genuinely enjoyable and funny movie, directed by Stephen Herek (The Three Musketeers, 101 Dalmatians). Basically, in the year 2688, humanity exists in unity and peace due to the music of the Two Great Ones, William ""Bill"" S. Preston Esquire (Alex Winter) and Ted ""Theodore"" Logan (Keanu Reeves). The Three Most Important People in the World (Clarence Clemons, Martha Davis, and Fee Waybill) task emissary Rufus (George Carlin) to travel back in time to 1988, San Dimas, California. There, young Bill and Ted are dim-witted high school students, and have dreams of becoming the next big band, ""Wyld Stallyns"". But they are both failing history in their studies, they will be flunked if they do not improve their grades, and Ted's father, Captain Logan (Hal Landon Jr.), is threatening to send him to military school in Alaska. They are assigned to describe three historical figures and their importance in the modern world. Rufus arrives outside Circle K in a time machine shaped like a phone booth to meet them, he has come to help them pass their history presentation, and to secure the future. They are initially hesitant, until they see an identical phone booth appears, with future versions of Bill and Ted to greet them, saying they are going to have an ""excellent adventure"". The future Bill and Ted briefly discuss their situation with Rufus before disappearing in the time machine. Rufus gives present Bill and Ted a demonstration, transporting them to 1805 where Napoleon Bonaparte (Terry Camilleri) is leading his forces against Austria. Whilst departing, Napoleon is thrown by an explosion, dragged through the Circuits of Time to the present. Rufus tells the duo that while they can go wherever they want in history, their own time is running normally, so they must be back in time for the presentation. As Bill and Ted discuss where to go next, they find Napoleon. This gives them the idea of kidnapping historical figures and bringing them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon (Frazier Bain) before travelling. The first pick up Billy the Kid (Dan Shor), the famous outlaw, in the Old West, and then pick up Socrates (Tony Steedman), the Greek philosopher. Then then make a stop in 15th century England, where they become infatuated with princesses Elizabeth (Kimberley LaBelle) and Joanna (Diane Franklin). They get into trouble with their father the king, but Billy and Socrates rescue them, they all escape, but the booth is partially damaged during their departure. Bill and Ted wind up in the distant future, discovering the society based on their influence, and inspired to complete their presentation, with ""extra credit"". So, they go on to kidnap Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, 16th century German composer Ludwig van Beethoven (Clifford David), 13th century French heroine Joan of Arc (Jane Wiedlin), Mongol leader Genghis Khan (Al Leong), and the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln (Robert V. Barron). Meanwhile, Deacon introduces Napoleon to ice cream and ten pin bowling, before ditching him when he becomes irritating. After a brief stop in prehistoric times to repair the booth, Bill and Ted program the machine to return to the present. But they end up transporting themselves to Circle K, on the night they met Rufus. Bill and Ted convince the past versions of themselves to listen to Rufus, while he reminds them that they must be on time for the presentation. They leave the other historical figures at the mall to learn about San Dimas while they look for Napoleon at a local water park. The historical figures get into trouble and are arrested by Captain Logan. Bill and Ted execute an escape plan based on using the time machine to set up things in the future to use in the present. They are reunited with the historical figures and arrive at the event just in time to give their presentation to the school. The presentation is a rousing success, and they successfully pass history with A+ grades. Sometime later, Rufus returns to Bill and Ted, bringing with him the two princesses, who will be part of their band, and two new guitars. Rufus asks to join the group as they play, and they start to play, which does not sound good, but Rufus assures the audience that ""they do get better"". Also starring Bernie Casey as Mr. Ryan, Amy Stoch as Missy / Mom, and J. Patrick McNamara as Mr. Preston. Reeves and Winter gives fantastic performances as the moronic teens with their memorable catchphrases (""excellent"", ""dude"", ""babes"", ""bogus"" and many more) and occasionally playing invisible electric guitar riffs, and Carlin is likeable as their friend from the future. With infectious airhead lead characters, amusing historical companions, great rock music and knowing cliches of time travel movies, this is a most enjoyably funny comedy adventure. It was number 41 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
8,ccthemovieman-1,"A Wild & Fun ""History Lesson""",7,3 December 2006,"It's hard to get upset at two very likable dummies who wouldn't hurt a fly. That's Bill and Ted, two Valley-type teens from back in the late '80s who play two really two guys who wind up going on a time-travel trip while trying to help themselves pass a history presentation.I've always enjoyed time travel stories but they've all been fairly intelligent......not stupid, like this. However, this was still fun to watch. Any time you get to see Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Socrates, Beethoven, Napoleon, Joan of Arc and others all in the same movie - especially with these two modern-day airheads - is pretty entertaining.Keanu Reeves was perfect for the role because he sounds stupid no matter role he plays! Alex Winter, I don't know. George Carlin has been goofy for 50 years so anything stupid he says wouldn't surprise me.This is comedy at its lightest but it's pretty inoffensive, safe viewing for most anyone and if you need a laugh - even from something dumb - this would fill the bill.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
9,rmax304823,Clever Teen Comedy.,6,24 October 2010,"I've only been able to catch snatches of this comedy so, though I know the essentials of the plot, I don't know how it ended. Presumably in a triumph for Bill, Alex Winter, and Ted, Keanu Reeves. Just a few comments.One is that the writing and the performances are concordant. Winter and Reeves both play their characters -- high schoolers in search of material for a term paper -- with open-mouthed stupidity. They're both pretty good too. There's hardly a second that they take seriously.Another is that the writing matches the plumbless depths of the characters' ignorance. Sigmund Freud becomes ""Frood,"" for instance, and Beethoven becomes ""Beat-Oven"" and Socrates turns into ""Sew"" and ""Crates."" They think ""Thekid"" is Billy the Kid's last name, as in ""Mister Thekid."" A third observation is that, amusing as the story can be, it's a pastiche, not as original as it thinks. The two characters, to whom everyone is ""Dude"" (pronounced ""Dewd""), are clearly derived from Sean Penn's character, Jeff Spicoli, in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which appeared -- and became a hit -- seven years earlier. Winter even resembles Sean Penn. The movie also borrows the time travel device from ""Back to the Future"" and its sequels, which began to appear -- to great commercial success -- four years earlier.This film itself was sufficiently successful to generate its own sequel -- ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"". ""Back to the Future"" had two sequels. And that's not to mention the several television series and merchandising.I laughed frequently while watching this thing. It raised an interesting question though: How stupid can you get? I mean, not just Bill and Ted but Hollywood and its MBAs. Is there some meaning to Bill and Ted's life other than facile self gratification? Is there any meaning in Hollywood other than a huge number preceded by a dollar sign? Has the well of imagination dried up? Is there anything at all left in it?",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
10,Tweekums,Totally awesome dude!,8,7 November 2012,"'Ted' Theodore Logan and Bill S. Preston are two high school students in San Dimas, California and they are about to flunk history... all they know is that Napoleon was a 'short dead dude' and Joan of Arc was 'Noah's wife'! This shouldn't be a problem for anybody but them but as future society is destined to be based on their music it is essential that they pass their history presentation with an A+ grade... if they don't Ted will go to military school, the band won't form and the future is doomed! To ensure they succeed Rufus returns from the distant future with a time machine so they can learn about history by visiting it. This is a good idea but Bill and Ted come up with a better one; why not bring back real historical figures to give their presentation for them! They come up with the idea after accidentally bringing Napoleon back to the present; they then embark on an excellent adventure that will see them bringing back Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, Socrates and Joan of Arc amongst others. While travelling they will have run-ins with some dangerous characters and when they return the historical figures will have a lot of fun visiting the mall before giving a presentation nobody will forget!This '80s comedy may be pretty dumb but it is a lot of fun. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are just right as unlikely heroes Bill and Ted. The way they jump around through history does make it fairly episodic; a few minutes here, a few minutes there... in fact things are best when the action is in the present; Napoleon at the water park was funny and there were some genuinely laugh out loud moments when the various historical figures go to the mall... what Genghis Khan did in the sports shop was hilarious. The rest of the cast do well enough with their roles although they are playing amusing caricatures rather than real characters with the exception of George Carlin's character Rufus. The special effects are pretty ropey even by the standards of the day but that just adds to the films low budget charm. If you want a good laugh with little to offend then you could do a lot worse than this.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
11,ma-cortes,Sci-fi comedy with lots of entertainment and fun,6,18 July 2006,"The movie concerns on two geeky and stupid teens(Keanu Reeves,Alex Winter).They confront to prepare a historical presentation but their professor(Bernie Casey)decides to give them an opportunity;if they can do an oral exam of how famed historic personages might adapt themselves to modern times,they will be allowed approve their history final .If not Ted will be placed in military academy.Rufus(George Carlin)an emissary from the future comes to help them in his time machine,a telephone booth.They pass through the universe and their lives are enormously important for the future of mankind.They meet get to know some of the history's most famous personality:Sigmund Freud(Rod Loomis),Gengis Khan(Al Leong),Socrates,Abraham Lincoln,Napoleon,Billy the Kid,Joan of Arc and carrying them to St Dimas little town.The picture is a Sci-fi comedy with action, giggles,tongue in check and is pretty entertained.Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make a completely surrealist and delight duo.The motion picture obtained success in the box-office and in the video rentals and nowadays is well considered as a cult movie.The film is rightly directed by Stephen Herek,previously he directed a hit called ¨Critters¨.It's followed by a cartoon TV(Bill and Ted's excellent adventure,1990) series and a sequel(Bill and Ted's journey,Peter Hewitt,1991) by the same actors, big budget and better FX but the freshness,inspiration and magic had gone. The picture will like to teens comedy fans.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
12,BA_Harrison,Still excellent after all of these years.,9,22 July 2012,"I had some reservations about showing Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure to my kids and their friends, not because of the content, which barring a rude subtitle is strictly PG, but because I feared that it might have dated really badly (I hadn't seen it for many years and I didn't want my kids laughing for all the wrong reasons). I needn't have worried: although the film is unmistakably a product of the late 80s, with some truly heinous fashion choices on display (Alex Winter's cropped top is most egregious!), its unprecedented sense of fun and silliness ensured that everyone had a most triumphant time.Bill & Ted, as played by Alex Winter (from The Lost Boys) and a young Keanu Reeves, are a pair of likable dolts from San Dimas who are destined to become the saviours of humanity, but only if they pass their imminent oral history report with flying colours. To help ensure their success, the pair are provided with a time-travelling phone-booth by cool-dude-from-the-future Rufus (George Carlin). This set up allows for loads of bodacious time-travel chaos, with the duo bouncing through the ages, collecting famous historical figures along the way.Obviously, this all sounds extremely daft, and many might quickly dismiss it as worthless, brainless nonsense, but the script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon is surprisingly astute, with lots of ingenious parodoxical moments to boggle the mind, plenty of clever historical jokes (I love Bill and Ted materialising in front of Joan of Arc like a vision), and even a totally cool message: be excellent to each other (and party on dudes!). All this plus Genghis Khan (played by everyone's favourite mustachioed character actor Al Leong) cleaning a toilet, Napolean experiencing the joy of water flumes, the lovely Diane Franklin as an English princess babe, and some early classic examples of Reeves' trademark 'Whoa!'. What else can I say but 'Excellent!'.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
13,paul_haakonsen,It was indeed an excellent adventure...,6,4 September 2020,"Well, ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" was most definitely bodacious when it came out in 1989, and having sat down to watch it again in 2020, I can honestly say that the movie still is well-worth watching and is entertaining.""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" was certainly one of the most memorable movies that made it from the late 1980s, and I suppose that was primarily because of the two characters Bill (played by Alex Winter) and Ted (played by Keanu Reeves). And they definitely made terms like ""whoa"", ""party on dudes"" and ""excellent"" famous and a household thing to say. Love it or not, but those phrases are memorable.The storyline in ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", while being sort of quite simple, is actually enjoyable and entertaining. Lots of interesting characters and some fun along the way as well.""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is one of those movies that you just need to have watched at least once if you have a love for the cinema, and it is a classic in its own rights.The movie has an impressive cast list with the likes of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter in the lead roles. But the movie also have appearances from the likes of George Carlin, Tony Steedman, Rod Loomis, Al Leong and Bernie Casey to name but a few of the very familiar faces if you grew up watching movies in the 1980s and 1990s.I am rating ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" a six out of ten stars.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
14,Quinoa1984,A great duo in a good movie,9,15 February 2000,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a sleeper hit of a film because it brings a great duo into a good movie.  Without the characters Bill and Ted, this movie might have not been as good, but thanks to their crazy antics (and a performance from George Carlin that is one of his best) this film pulls through.  Especially because they are a group that is stereotyped for their time and they are going on an adventure in the past.  Not all the performances are good, but that is something you wouldn't look for in this film.  One of the best films of the 80's.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
15,Hey_Sweden,"""Dude, strange things are afoot at the Circle K.""",8,15 December 2011,"It's a testament to the entertainment value of this incredibly engaging time capsule movie that it continues to be very funny over 20 years later. It's a time travel comedy with an inventive gimmick: the title characters, two of the most definitive slacker dude archetypes in the business, along with Sean Penn's Spicoli from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", seem destined to flunk their history course, but thanks to the intervention of Rufus (legendary comedian George Carlin), they get some much needed help: a phone booth that allows them to access places and times in history, and collect a wide assortment of history making individuals. This allows for some truly side splitting fish out of water material. Stars Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are extremely well cast and work well together as the inseparable Ted ""Theodore"" Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esquire, who are determined to see their rock band Wyld Stallyns become a reality - with or without Eddie Van Halen. The movie is breezy, snappy stuff with some utterly hilarious moments, with the memorable Terry Camilleri as Napoleon completely stealing the show with his hammy performance - whether he's pitching a fit at a bowling alley, hogging the slides at a water slide park (appropriately named Waterloo), or greedily gulping down ice cream. The rest of the actors playing the historical figures are all funny, too, including Dan Shor as Billy the Kid, Tony Steedman as Socrates, Rod Loomis as Sigmund Freud, Jane Wiedlin (of rock band The Go-Gos) as Joan of Arc, Al Leong as Genghis Khan, Clifford David as Beethoven, and Robert V. Barron as a smiling Abraham Lincoln. Whether it's Billy and Socrates trying to pick up girls, Freud trying to analyze a detective interviewing him, Joan of Arc taking over an aerobics class, or Genghis Khan raising Hell in a sporting goods store, the antics in the final third get pretty hysterical. Hal Landon, Jr., as Ted's ticked off dad and Bernie Casey as teacher Mr. Ryan are good in support; 80's babe Diane Franklin has a small role as one of the princesses, screenwriters Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon have cameos as the ultra annoying waiters, and real life music industry celebrities Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, Martha Davis of The Motels, and Fee Waybill of The Tubes make cameo appearances as well. And how many of us guys would have been happy to have a gal like Missy...I mean Mom...in our house? The soundtrack is pretty cool, and 22 years later, this movie is overall just too upbeat, likably silly, and clever to resist at all. Followed by the sequel ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" two years later, and two short lived TV series, one live action and one animated. Eight out of 10.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
16,view_and_review,Champions of School Reform,6,11 February 2020,"""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" was a cry for school reform and I'm with it.Bill S. Preston Esquire (Alex Winter) and Ted Theodore Logan (Keanu Reeves) were both failing history. On the surface it would look like that they would much rather be jamming on their guitars in the garage than go to school. OK, so that's true, but maybe there's a reason why. They can't tell you anything about any historical figure and I can't blame them. History is boring. It's nothing but names, dates, places and events and many of those things seem to have no relevance to a teenager (or to most adults for that matter).If they fail history Ted is going to be shipped off to the military academy thereby breaking up their happy friendship as well as their potential band and jeopardize the fate of the future. Apparently, Bill and Ted are extremely significant figures in the future and their remaining together is crucial for that future. For that reason, a man named Rufus (George Carlin) is sent back to 1988 from 2688 in order to make sure Bill and Ted ace their history report they must give.So, with a time travelling phone booth, Bill and Ted went from era to era collecting historical figures in order to give the most epic history report that could possibly be given. It's a comedy so don't worry about the butterfly effect upon the space-time continuum or the phone booth that holds people like a clown car. What's more important is that Bill and Ted learned something (only if they learned to speak without the surfer dude accent). They learned a lot more by traveling and experiencing than by sitting in a classroom. Bill and Ted are champions of school reform and that's why they were such important keys to the future, and that's why they got their own cartoon.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
17,neil-476,Keanu's finest hour in inspired comedy,8,9 April 2011,"Poor old Keanu comes in for some stick, but Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure (or BATEA as I shall refer to it from here onwards) showed that he had a distinct propensity for understated exaggeration - that might sound like a contradiction in terms, but both Bill and Ted are very subtly pitched at a level just on the wrong side of accuracy.The idea is brilliant, and the time travelling misadventures of the empty-headed pair are inspired. The script is immensely strong (both story and dialogue - how often I see films full of resources and potential which fail dismally because they don't have a script worth a dime koff koff Sucker Punch). As well as the central conceit of the two slackers and their history project problem, there are some inspired elements arising from both the time travel conceit (Bill fooling himself with the fingers) and the time travelling guests (who can fail to be tickled by Napoleon in the water park or Beethoven delighting in the wonders of electronic instrumentation).Plus there is a moral, and George Carlin. Huge fun!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

Very 80's, and very stupid, which makes this film wonderful.

With stupid logic, and luck, they manage to present their report.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
19,Mr-Fusion,Most righteous,8,1 January 2015,"""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is about as goofy as it gets, but that's totally its charm. And I can't really think of anything that's not likable about this movie; the historical figures at the mall, Napoleon and the waterslides, Bill's stepmom... It's got a surprisingly catchy soundtrack, some great one-liners and a winning sense of humor. The two leads are perfect choices for the eponymous dimwits (can there be a role more suited to Reeves' ""Whoa"" persona?). It all just works here, even if the time travel logic is threadbare. This is just good cheesy '80s fun. But most of all, I just love that George Carlin's in this. On paper, he seems unlikely, but fits like a glove.8/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
20,siderite,Take a trip in time and see the last great peace loving band that never existed,7,30 August 2015,"The movie was not particularly smart, but it did kind of represent an era that we will never really forget: the excellent 80's. Meet the two completely spaced out losers that don't want anything else than to start a heavy metal band and will let nothing stop them, not even their lack of knowledge of their instruments. Helped by a man sent from the future, they travel back in time to gather celebrities in order to get an A+ in their oral TV show like exam. Beat that, Sly and Arnold!The film has gained a cult following immediately after, not because it was a good movie, but because it took no prisoners and it didn't take itself seriously for one second. That kind of courage from the entertainment studios was also a sign of a dying age, unfortunately.Like with the classic celebrities adolescents are forced to learn about in order to understand history, it would be criminal not to see the movie, if you ever want to know film. And for old folks like us, it is a trip back in time to happier days, when movies were fun and the world was dreaming of end to poverty and war.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
21,JamesHitchcock,"Not, perhaps, excellent, but certainly not egregious",6,29 November 2009,"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is a film I thought I wouldn't enjoy. I missed it when it was in the cinemas, when I was twenty years closer to the age of the main characters than I am now, and caught it recently when it was shown on television one Saturday afternoon. (It seems to be a standard assumption on the part of British TV executives that anyone uninterested in the sport which forms the largest part of their output on Saturday afternoons must be a lover of old films). I knew that it was primarily made for the teen market and that it concerned the adventures of two schoolboys, so I assumed that it would be horribly dated. (Nothing, after all, dates more quickly than youth culture, especially teen culture).Actually, the film is both more enjoyable and less like something from an eighties time capsule than I thought it would be. Certainly, the two leading characters speak in an outlandish slang with only a passing resemblance to Standard English, but I suspect that it would have sounded pretty outlandish even in 1989, at least in Britain where nobody, not even teenagers, ever spoke like that. A central feature of this dialect is that it takes words which normally are used only in formal contexts and uses them as colloquialisms. Thus something very good is ""excellent"", whereas something very bad is ""egregious"" or ""heinous"". ""Bogus"" also means ""very bad"", instead of its normal meaning of ""not genuine"", and any human being, especially a male one, is a ""dude"", pronounced ""dood"".William ""Bill"" Preston and Theodore ""Ted"" Logan are two teenagers from San Dimas, California. (In keeping with hallowed Hollywood tradition, they are played by actors in their mid twenties). Their great passion is for rock music and their ambition is to found a rock band which they have provisionally named ""Wyld Stallyns"", even though their talent as performers is minimal. Their talent for academic work is equally minimal (as evidenced by their eccentric spelling), and they are on the verge of failing their high school history class. Ted's authoritarian father has threatened him that unless he passes history he will be sent to a military academy in Alaska.They are saved by the intervention of Rufus, a time-traveller from the future. (Rufus's time machine is designed to look like a phone booth, a detail borrowed directly from Dr Who's Tardis). It would appear that several centuries from now the music of ""Wyld Stallyns"" serves as the basis of an entire civilisation, so Rufus has to ensure that Bill and Ted remain together as the consequences for future history if their rock group is never founded will be too heinous to contemplate. They have the idea of using Rufus' phone booth to travel back into the past and of kidnapping various historical figures to help them with their assignment. So the likes of Napoleon Bonaparte, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln and Socrates (whose name Bill and Ted insist on pronouncing as ""So-Crates"") find themselves transported forward in time to the San Dimas of 1988. In another development Bill and Ted, travelling to 15th Century England, fall in love with the King's daughters Princess Elizabeth and Princess Joanna (not actual historical figures).We see the reactions of the historical characters to the California of the late eighties. Thus Napoleon discovers the delights of ice cream and water slides (which play a large part in the film, largely because San Dimas is famous for its water theme park), Joan of Arc (who Bill and Ted discover is not married to Noah, as they had previously thought) joins an aerobics group and Ludwig van Beethoven becomes a fan of rock music. The real Beethoven was of course deaf, but this is not a film which places a premium on historical accuracy. I thought, in fact, that more humour could have been derived from the contrast between modern life and life in the past, but this opportunity was missed, possibly because the film was originally aimed at those with a knowledge of history that was only slightly greater than that of Bill and Ted.Nevertheless, the film is generally an amusing and entertaining one; Keanu Reeves (who has since gone on to become a big Hollywood name) and Alex Winter (who hasn't) make an appealing pair of heroes. Certainly, ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is just so much frothy nonsense, but even nonsense can sometimes be enjoyable. Not, perhaps, quite excellent, but certainly not egregious. 6/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Excellent!,8,12 November 2003,"Ah, the days when Keanu and Alex were both struggling actors. I joke with my friends when we watch this movie and I say ""If you could go back in time, would you have ever imagined that Keanu would make it after this film?"" LOL! But both actors have come a long way and are very respected in their work.This is a very fun film. Is it silly? Oh, yes. But you have to admit that there are more than a few moments where you are laughing on the floor in tears. I mean, come on, ""How's it going, royal ugly dudes?"" LOL! Every line in here is pretty much a catch. Yes way, Bill and Ted, they did have an excellent adventure. Go on the adventure with them, you won't regret it. It's a fun movie.8/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
23,MovieAddict2016,"Excellent, Heinous, Awesome, Righteous, Dude, Bogus: Enhance Your Grammar with Bill and Ted",10,27 April 2003,"*Some Minor Spoilers*Do you remember in high school, when you had a day to come up with something good or you were afraid of flunking? I think we've all had times with one thing or another where we had one day to put together something we knew nothing about. Well, that's how Bill and Ted feel in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" when they find out they have one day to present a history speech at school, or they will flunk.Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are two high-school clowns from San Dimas, California, without a clue. Literally. They don't know a single thing about history and are as dense as dense can be. Bill believes Napolean to be a ""short, dead dude,"" and Ted thinks Joan of Ark was Noah's wife. But they try to clean their act up after their history teacher threatens to flunk them both unless they come up with a good history presentation that same day. Things turn even more heinous when Ted finds out his father is going to ship him off to military school in Alaska if he doesn't pass. Whoa.The two dudes are in most righteous trouble. If Ted is shipped off to military school in Alaska, Bill and Ted will never complete forming their rock band, the ""Wyld Stallyns."" But they have no idea of just how important they are in the future until Rufus (George Carlin) comes back in time from the future with a time-travelling phone booth. He tells the two dudes that in the future they solve world hunger, bring peace to the world, and stop war, all through their music. Sounds like ""The Beatles."" Anyway, the two teens are surprised and take Rufus' phone booth through time, trying to learn history first-hand. But along the way they learn that instead of taking history from their surroundings mentally, why not take history from their surroundings PHYSICALLY?  Bill and Ted start to pinch historical figures and bring them back to the eighties. These figures include Napolean (who takes a trip to San Dimas' ""Waterloo"" fun park), Socrates, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, Gengis Khan, Billy the Kid and Abraham Lincoln. But the two pals still have a lot of obstacles in their path if they wish to successfully pass history class. Dude!""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is one of those movies that is hilarious in the beginning, funny in the middle, and outrageously, screamingly hysterical towards the end. I'll admit the first time I saw this film I didn't enjoy it much, but I saw it at a local video store for a few bucks on DVD and couldn't pass up the deal. I bought it along with ""Spaceballs"" and left ""Bill and Ted"" for last viewing. I finally watched it again today, and it was more than surprising. It was great! It cleverly combines eighties-type-humor with an original, if somewhat borrowed plot.
It's predictable, yes, but on a scale of enjoyability it scores a solid ""4"" out of ""5."" A lot of times we can forsee many events, and unlike the ""Back to the Future"" films, the idea of time travel itself isn't played upon as much as it is there just as a reason to get historical figures into the eighties. The phonebooth had a lot more potential; and when they did start phone booth paradoxes, most of the time they were never fully resolved, and didn't make sense. But that is not really what the film is here for. It isn't ""Back to the Future."" The story isn't centered around the time machine and/or what it can do, but rather what you could bring back with you. ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is nowhere near as good as ""Back to the Future"" Part 1 or 2, but I didn't expect it to be.The best parts of the film are when they play on what historical figures would do given the chance to be thrusted into a new year. Bill and Ted bring the different characters into the San Dimas mall, where Genghis Khan proceeds to wreck a sportshop, Joan of Ark tries her hand at becoming a fitness instructer, Beethoven plays the electronic piano in the mall, Socrates goes ice-skating, Sigmund Freud hits on women and asks cops about their mothers in an interrogation with another psychiatrist, etc., etc., etc...I won't ruin anymore for you, nor give away the specifics and outcomes of this mall exploration, but I will tell you that there is nothing more enjoyable for a Friday night then watching important, key-historical figures from different time eras exploring the 1980s. I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie, but I think it's all good fun.Much like ""Back to the Future"" played on time-travel and its impact, ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" plays on the epic question, ""Just what would historical figures think of modern-day life?"", and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as ""Back to the Future,"" it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you, if nothing else.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
24,KineticSeoul,A bit weak...,5,7 May 2013,"This movie could have been a really good one when it first came out, maybe even great. But lack of development and not enough clever ideas make this one a passable duo adventure flick. I can sort of see why this movie was a hit when it came out but watching it now, it's just has quite a bit of flaws. The plot is basically about Bill(Alex Winter) and Ted(Keanu Reeves) who are in a garage band. They are both basically airheads that likes to air guitar. And because of certain circumstances they get a phone booth time machine and travel around collecting historical figures so they can pass their history class. But the thing is there just isn't much historical elements in this film. And just show very slight glimpses of the past while kidnapping historical figures. Sure it slightly humorous watching how the historical figures cope with being in 1989. But there is nothing to know about the historical figures in this flick and nothing really to adventure about in each of the time period Bill and Ted visits. There isn't anything clever about the execution as well. Bill and Ted are a likable duo but this adventure just seemed weak despite the time travel thing going on. Also Keanu's role in this stayed stuck on him throughout his career...Fortunate or unfortunate that maybe.5.2/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
25,lost-in-limbo,"""They do get better"".",8,20 March 2013,"Maybe because of nostalgia reasons, ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" remains as one of my favourite bodacious comedies. It mixes creative time-travel shenanigans (love the cheesy computer effects) with enthusiastic slacker humour leaving no pretensions. Light-hearted and quite juvenile, but infectiously amusing with many quotable dialogues and very fitting performances by duo Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as two slacker teenagers Bill and Ted who are more concerned forming their rock band, The Wyld Stallyns that they're flunking history big time. Now they must pass their final history report with an A+. As Ted's dad (played sternly by Hal Landon Jr.) threatens to send him to military school meaning the end of the band. However their guardian angel from the future, Rufus (the laid-back George Carlin) turns up with a time- travelling phone booth to help them ace their report by heading into the past to actually learn from history's influential figures. The support cast do shape up nicely in their iconic depictions; Terry Gamilleri (the pick of the lot as Napoleon), Dan Shor, Tony Steedman, Jane Wiedlin, Clifford David, Rober V. Barron, Al Leong and Rod Loomis. Also showing up is Bernie Casey as the history teacher. Its one-idea gimmick keeps in character and crafts out some enjoyable, goofy interactions of the iconic figures adapting to modern times. But in all it's the energetic chemistry of Reeves and Winter that make it a complete blast, duuuude. ""Gentlemen, I'm here to help you with your history report"".",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
26,Lejink,Teen time-travel trippers,5,20 November 2009,"Not quite sure just why I watched this popular teen comedy-adventure film from the 80's but I was a teenager once myself and I enjoy a good time-travel yarn and with hopes of a ""Back to the Future"" type entertainment thought I'd give it a shot.Okay in hindsight, I'd probably have enjoyed it more if I was actually still in or just out of school, but it was enjoyable all the same. The nods to predecessors like the afore-mentioned ""Back To The Future"" (meeting themselves in time, the lightning bolt exits and entries), Dr Who (even down to using a phone-box as their time-travelling craft) and ""Quantum Leap"" (with the Rufus character as their Admiral Al mentor and cajoler) are obvious and of course it plugs into the same nerdy humour which made the ""Wayne's World"" movies equally successful.I enjoyed the first half hour more when the dynamic duo's catch-phrases and mannerisms were fresh but lost interest in the rest feeling that there could have been better interplay among their historical kidnapees. One or two of the jokes made me smile (Freud quizzing an interrogating cop on his feelings for his mother and Bill owning up to a mildly Oedipal complex over his sexy step-mom) and the two leads obviously have fun outgorm-ing each other.I could have done without the so-dated 80's pomp rock soundtrack, even as I felt that the movie was crying out for an Eddie Van Halen cameo appearance, but I can't judge this too harshly. Okay, so maybe ""Time Bandits"" did it better, but this was pleasant lightweight inoffensive fun and a lot less vulgar than most of the teen-market aimed output from latter-day Hollywood.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

When a man from the future travels through time and gifts them with a phone-booth time-machine (a nod to 'Doctor Who (1963-), no doubt), the pair decide to recruit a series of historical figures to give the speech for them. So begins a thoroughly strange adventure that's never quite as enjoyable as it ought to be. Of course, 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)' is full of charm and has a general feel-good vibe to it, with a central message that encourages everyone to ""be excellent to each other and party on"". It has several enjoyable set-pieces and a couple of nice time-travel moments, too. Though it does seem stretched somewhat thin in its mid-section, the movie manages to come together quite nicely in the end. Overall, it's difficult not to like.

30,Cineanalyst,Intentionally Stupid,4,10 September 2020,"I don't find much value in an intentionally stupid film such as ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure."" Sure, some of it's funny, but a lot it's just stupid--and not only the dated homophobic slur and the (quite literally with the time travel) medieval babe-treatment of women as prizes for the heroes. It seems the intellectual equivalent of a pratfall from, say, the Keystone Kops to me. Plus, it's evidently in the fashion of a stoner comedy, but absent any drug references to go along with its PG rating amidst a heated period in America's drug war. It's almost painfully very much of the 1980s despite the time-travelling history report premise. I suppose one could call it a pivotal picture of the so-called ""slacker"" generation.On the other hand, I appreciate how economically it pays homage to, or rips off, other time-travel pictures. The opening scene, with the playing of music too loudly and their being late for class recalls Marty McFly in ""Back to the Future"" (1985), as well as, perhaps, that Bill, too, has ""a minor Oedipal complex."" Meanwhile, the phone-booth time machine is straight out of the ""Doctor Who"" series. Some of the best gags also take advantage of the procrastinating nature of the duo by their figuring out that with a time machine they can help themselves now by putting off the hard work for later.

31,g-bodyl,Way Better Than I Expected!,8,26 July 2014,"I don't know how they did this, but Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure actually turned out to be a decent movie. There were some laughs to be had and the sci-fi is actually pretty darn crazy. In other words, this is a dumb film, but so dumb that it turns to be good entertainment. If you manage you turn off your brain and not expect anything serious, you will probably like this. (And no, there are no explosions here.) This film is about two doofus high school students named Bill and Ted who are on the verge of failing their history class, unless they pass their final oral exam. But with the help of this one mysterious figure, the duo use a time machine to head back in time to get their history for their project. But is it enough? Now, I wouldn't call the acting great. But everyone has just enough charm in order to make things work. Keanu Reeves in one of his very early film roles does an okay job and so does his mate, Alex Winter. I will say their characters are mildly irritating at times. There are also some cool cameos here, including the great George Carlin.Overall, this is a film that has no right to be good........but it is. It's an hour and a half of cheap entertainment that has some laughs and gives us a different look at time travel. Their take on the future is ludicrous, but pretty funny.

There's something that really impressed me about this movie. When it showed them going back in time, I thought they'd just have the foreign characters speak English. It wouldn't make sense, but that's what everyone really does. Instead, they did all speak their languages, so the movie's creators really did work hard on this! Dang, Keanu Reeves looks young.This might be the movie I've seen that had the most screen time of George Carlin. And yes, it probably is the best movie he was in. I really did find myself rooting for Bill and Ted in this movie, especially in the end when they did the oral exam. I mean, it really is a sincere series of scenes.

I'm not one of those, because if I were, I would like him much more. As much as he has irritated me in most films, I have to admit that here he has played a dumb teenager fantastically and is unexpectedly likable and funny.Bill and Ted are high school students who want to start a rock band, but because of their dullness and laziness, they are threatened with expulsion from school. If that happens, Ted will go to a military boarding school and there will be no band. Their last hope is that they deserve the highest marks in a history presentation.

Most people seem to consider this movie stupid, but I think that it is just great. In some cases this movie is having a little fun with Doctor Who, namely by stealing the telephone version of the time machine, but where Doctor Who's Tardis has been permanently fixed in place as a police box, this time machine was designed as a phone box and operates like a phone box right down to the please dial again message when they try to go to a time that is not connected.Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are inseparable airheads whose dreams are about to be shattered when they are informed that they will flunk history if they do not come up with a good presentation in 24 hours and if they flunk history then Ted will be sent to Alaska. Bill and Ted have visions of becoming great rock and roll stars, but can't play one musical note, though this is not going to stop them, but this problem is dealt with in Bogus Journey, we are just told that they do get better.Bill and Ted, destined to flunk, are saved when an man from the future comes along and lends them his time machine. Sounds pretty silly, but the reason this happens is because if the fail, they don't form the band, and if they don't form the band then civilisation will collapse. As their history presentation must be impressive, they decide to go back in time and collect figures of historical significance, and then take them on a tour of the home town, San Demas, and then take them to the high school and have them tell every body, on a very flashy sort of way, what they thought.The way Bill and Ted act is quite amusing, they come across more like wide eyed tourists not realising the danger that they might be in. They wonder through a medieval castle and decide to have a sword fight, even though they will be treated as spies and killed. In the wild west they stuff up a poker game for Billy the Kid and almost get lynched, yet they still come out like tourists. They kidnap Abraham Lincoln and Sigmund Fraud, Ted charms Joan of Arc into coming with him, and lure Gengis Kahn away from his harem with a Twinkie.This movie lacks intellectual depth, but in my opinion it doesn't need it.

38,sol-,Going back in time,6,1 January 2016,"Provided with a time machine by future beings with a vested interest in seeing them pass History, two high school slackers travel back in time and capture assorted historical figures in this popular 80s comedy. Given how nonsensical the plot is (the film assumes that interactions with historical figures will not alter the past - plus the Beethoven of the film is not deaf), the movie relies heavily on the charm and likability of its young protagonists to carry things through and fortunately the chemistry between stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves is spot-on all the way. The pair mispronouncing names such as Freud and Socrates admittedly grows groan-inducing quite quickly, but there is something to be said for the way Winter and Reeves seem able to predict one another's moves, often saying and doing spontaneous things in synchrony. The film also gets some good laughs from having historical figures at a loss to twentieth century living (Freud's constant psychoanalysing of everything is great), however, contemporary interactions with Napoleon were done more cleverly in 'I Dream of Jeannie' and the film does not feature anywhere near enough scenes in which the historical figures bond with each other; one of the best scenes has Socrates and Billy the Kid trying to hit on girls together like high school pals.

Bill and Ted are total metal head idiots and when placed in the scholarly context of history, this blatant contradiction is at the least amusing. ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" sort of makes short order of its time travel concept, moving so quickly that the premise never has time to fully cook and so neither do the characters, but the fast-paced teenage mischief humor works in its own way for this movie to be enjoyable.When Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are on the verge of failing history, we learn that if Ted fails, he flunks out of school and his father will ship him to military school. As a result, he and Bill won't be able to pursue their dreams of forming their own metal band called Wild Stallyns. That's when they get a visit from Rufus (George Carlin) of the future, where apparently Bill and Ted are worshipped. Since the future depends on Bill and Ted staying together, Rufus provides them a time-traveling phone booth to complete their report.The boys travel quickly through time, treating everyone from the ancient Greeks to the medieval Englishmen like 80s surfer dudes. While they're not met with open arms wherever they go exactly, no one seems to notice their 80s duds and poor English. The historical figures that they capture don't exactly seem too alarmed that they're being jammed in a phone booth either. ""Bill and Ted"" prides itself on everybody being stupid, I guess, but with that in mind one begins to appreciate the shenanigans for the absurdity they are. I mean, Napoleon going bowling and cursing in French, followed by getting kicked out by some middle-aged white dude, is funny in its own way.Bill and Ted aren't totally lovable characters, but their naivety makes it hard to dislike them for their dumb behavior. Neither is a particularly good actor (even though that didn't seem to stop Keanu Reeves from finding future work) and their 80s lingo and jokes are pretty hit or miss with the more subtle, intelligent jokes that you have to listen for to pick up on registering the highest marks. The other good parts of the film come toward the end with how the historical figures react to the 80s.""Bill and Ted"" is a good movie for tweens and those who have some sort of nostalgic connection to the 80s, everyone else will find it amusing and likable comedic material, but nothing much beyond that considering it doesn't make much of an effort to do so.

But what I find appealing about it is that it never descends to mawkish sentiment like John Hughes movies (""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"") for example and his imitators' films always do. In fact one of Reeves' immediate follow-ups, ""Parenthood"" which starred Steve Martin, was exactly such a horrendous film. The ultimate point of this movie, saving the universe by way of Steve Salas and Joe Satriani-style whining blues-less guitar rock solos, is just as absurd as its main characters.The interesting thing about Bill and Ted as a comedy duo is that neither of them are the ""straight man"" in particular. There's no attempt to paint either of them as particularly more attractive, intelligent, or interesting than the other. To some extent George Carlin's Rufus acts as a straight man but he only appears in a few scenes and seems to share Bill and Ted's excellently poor taste in music and grammar. Basically the humor and the appeal of Bill and Ted are the same thing -- they are just so stupid and so optimistic that I think it'd be hard to really hate them. They do the same kind of comedy that Pauley Shore and Adam Sandler did for the next decade: valley-guy moron over his head in whatever situation. But because there's two of them they don't get annoying like those guys do, because there's an endearing quality in their friendship and their trust in each other.The reason I wouldn't rate the movie very highly is that a lot of the jokes do fall pretty flat upon a repeat viewing and the movie loses a lot of steam in the middle sections set in Medieval times. But compared to its sequel and most other movies of this type it's a masterpiece because it's actually watchable.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
44,southdavid,Carlin back the years.,7,18 September 2020,"""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is one of those movies that in the first 15 years of my life I must have watched dozens of times, but in the last 25 hardly ever. So in rewatching the film, ahead of seeing ""Face the Music"", I was happy to discover that it holds up pretty well.Bill S. Preston esq (Alex Winter) and Ted Theodore Logan (Keanu Reeves) are two young men who dream of starting a rock band and becoming famous. Their plan is threatened though, as if they don't ace their History oral exam, they will flunk out of school and Ted will be shipped to a Military academy in Alaska. In the future, a utopian society, based on the musical teachings of their band - Wyld Stallyns - cannot let this happen, so send Rufus (George Carlin) back in time, to lend the boys a time machine so they can experience history first hand.I was struck by a few different thoughts as I watched ""Excellent Adventure"" for the first time in a while. I was never not surprised by how young Keanu Reeves looked. I suppose it's because his whole life is there on screen for us, but he almost looks like a different person than he does as ""John Wick"" - he's so fresh faced and joyous. The films jokes are better than I could have hoped and there are a few more that as a child I wouldn't have got, and now do. However, there are less of them than I might have anticipated for what is essentially a comedy - especially in the films middle section.Though I couldn't argue against accusations that it's thin and flimsy and could have done with a better second act, and that some of the logic of time travel don't really make sense, or question why a school would turn out to watch students do oral history reports, or who's doing the lighting for their presentation ultimately I was won over by the good natured fun, the pairs happy-go-lucky nature and the massive nostalgia buzz - and realising how much effect on my language the film has had - I call everyone dude.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
45,Vartiainen,Innocent and fun romp through time,6,19 September 2020,"Ted ""Theodore"" Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esq., played by Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, respectively, are two young high school students who are in the process of setting up a most excellent band. Unfortunately the two of them are not the brightest lightbulbs at the factory. I dare even say that there are a couple species of fireflies that have them beat. So they are failing history. Hard. And as such their band is in jeopardy because Ted's father wants his son to shape up.So, what are these two gentleman to do? Well, get visited by a man from the future, get access to a time machine and kidnap famous people throughout history in order to cheat on their presentation.Obviously.What follows is in no way a masterfully told story. It's rather episodic in nature, flows jankily and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. That being said, it's a lot of fun. The scenarios and time periods visited are creative. The characters are a whole lot of fun. The hijinks are hilarious and the time shenanigans are actually kind of clever.Plus there's this innocence to Bill and Ted. They're dumb as a sack of bricks, but yet they're so earnest that it never feels like were laughing at them. Rather the humour comes from the absurdity of the situation. It helps that Reeves and Winter have excellent chemistry together. And that George Carlin plays Rufus, the man from the future. His deadpan, slightly snarky delivery is the cherry on top.I can safely say that they don't make comedies like this anymore. There's not even a hint of meanspiritedness to be found here and that what makes it timeless. Be excellent and party on, dudes.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
46,hellraiser7,Time Traveling without a Clue,10,26 October 2012,"I always love time travel stories because there are just so many things you can do let alone ways to have fun with. It's true that the only weakness these stories have is in the inconsistencies but personally I never cared and nor does this movie because it's doesn't care about being logical but simply having a wild ride.This film is one of my personal favorite comedies, I've seen this when I was a child and I still love it now. I was drawn in because this film had two of the many things I love in life, Rock n, Roll and Time Travel, both mixed together and made a tasty combo. On one hand you could say the film has a lesson on how people are always capable of becoming something great and making history. But on the other hand this film is just plain stupid fun but done right. The effects and production value is good and so is the music.I love their time machine, yeah I know a phone booth seems kinda stupid (let alone dated) but trust me the way it works will make you a believer. It cool because it's a non cliché time travel device which is something I rarely see only other time travel that uses a phone booth is ""Doctor Who"". The film sort of have a bit of that wish fulfillment quality, just simply wanting to meet and take with you any historical figure you want, for them to be your friends and have a good time with you; one I'd love to bring would be Bruce Lee. The historical figures don't disappoint there all really just exaggerations of the persona's which make them funny, my favorite is Gengus Khan he's sort of reminds of cartoon characters ""Tazmanian Devil"" or ""Captain Caveman"" since both characters don't really talk much or at all and justly simply let loose when they feel like it.There is also this concept which is both fascinating and ridiculous at the same time, this of course is the infamous Time Game where if you say you'll go back in time and get or do this then it will appear or become possible in the present, it's pretty much the concept of being one step ahead. If I say I want to go back in time and I bring Keira Knightly to come at a certain spot and a certain time to help me out of a jam, then that would happen. Yeah, I know ridiculous but that the point which makes it all the more hilarious.But of course what really drives the film are Bill and Ted themselves (played excellently by Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) I love the buddy buddy chemistry between them there's good back and forth. Both are practically one character since both have the same persona, they're both actually smart if not geniuses (then again how many really can be), talk in sort of surfer tone. But what makes them all the more fun is that their naivety, both are fans of heavy metal and rock n' roll but most of all how both of them have an ambition of being a great rock band and are trying to make it a reality. That I can emphasize with because the thought of being a rock star one time crossed my mind when I was a child and I'm a fan of rock n' roll and heavy metal music. Both just have dialog that is fraking hilarious, the things they say are deliciously fun and bad that you'll both groan and laugh at the same time. And most importantly it's just plain fun seeing two unlikely and slightly clueless travelers just have fun with both the historical figures and the decades they come from, likewise for the figures that come to our present. One favorite scene of mine is when both are in knight armor and are playing ""Star Wars"", just like that movie itself those reference jokes never get old.So just turn your brains of and dial in for an excellent ride.Rating: 4 stars",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
47,jadavix,Hard not to like,7,19 March 2019,"The secret to the success of ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", as with ""Wayne's World"", is that it's just so hard not to like it. The whole thing has such a disarming, goofy charm, that to say you didn't enjoy it would make you feel like an a-hole.And come on, how do you not like a movie about a couple of teenage idiots who travel through time in a phone booth picking up historical figures? And where Napoleon Bonaparte gets an award for eating an enormous icecream sundae? And where one of the said teenage idiots sword fights with Joan of Arc - who he previously belived to be ""Noah's wife""?The scenes where the characters encounter the historical figures aren't as successful. They're believable enough, but not that entertaining.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
48,FilmCriticLalitRao,The comic tale of an amazing adventure directed by Stephen Herek.,10,26 September 2014,"Director Stephen Herek has made his film in such a manner that even a future star Keanu Reeves appears more of an actor sans all the fuss of an arrogant star. As great American philosopher John Dewey (1859- 1952) rightly remarked : ""we only think when we are confronted with problems"", an important lesson learned by two teenage boys who embark on a mission to meet some of history's greatest figures in order to complete their class' history project. This is the commencement of an amazing adventure of astronomical proportions wherein two dimwits get a chance to hobnob with some of mankind's greatest personalities namely Socrates, Lincoln, Napoleon and Freud. It would not be an understatement to express that all films try to entertain their viewers. However, there are certain films which succeed in killing two birds with a single stone. ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is one such film which provides oodles of entertainment with adequate doses of pertinent messages about teaching especially techniques of imparting lessons in history to young people. The small town setting does enormous good to this film as it is depicted as an ideal place for young people with limited opportunities who yearn to showcase their creativity at any cost.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
49,drqshadow-reviews,An Underachiever's Overachievement,7,27 November 2018,"If you weren't around in '89, when this became a surprise cultural phenomenon, well, you kinda had to be there. Looking back with critical eyes, it's a rather thin, desperately low-budget production that doesn't probe beyond the superficial layer and constantly winks and nudges the audience to ensure they know when to laugh.Yet, recognizing all that, I found myself wrapped up in its oddly naive warmth and charismatic magnetism. The jokes and gags are hammy and contrived, but I still snickered. The most memorable lines are clumsy and blunt, but I gladly recited them (surprising myself, as I hadn't seen the film in twenty-plus years). Bill and Ted themselves are the narrowest of stereotypes, basically the male equivalent of Frank Zappa's valley girls, yet I felt a rich tingle of satisfaction when they saved their academic careers. It's one of those films that defies logic, succeeding in spite of itself, and there's something of value in that.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

(The Terminator as a comedy in reverse!) The two guys in lead are practically brain dead and need the help. They are given the time machine to round up such historical figures as Napoleon, Billy the Kid, Socrates, and Joan of Arc and give a truly excellent report!

52,Lechuguilla,Comedy With Some Deep Themes,8,18 November 2013,"As with most comedy films, the viewer needs to be in the right mood for ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"" to work; otherwise it will fall flat. With help from the enigmatic time-travel guide Rufus (George Carlin) and a magic phone booth, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) go back in time to learn firsthand about, and kidnap, historical figures as a way to pass their high school history course in 1988.The historical figures are all stereotypical of their contemporary public image, and include among others: Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Lincoln, Napoleon, and a couple of ""dudes"" who Bill and Ted refer to as Sigmund ""Frood"" and that well-known Greek philosopher ""So-craits"".Indeed, part of the fun is the inane jabber between dim-bulbs Bill and Ted. But the dudes are charming and energetic and mean no harm. Of the two, Ted, whom I refer to as mop head, is probably the funnier. At one point he addresses Billy the Kid as ""Mr. The Kid"". And when So-craits says: ""the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing"", mop head responds cheerfully: ""That's us, dude"". Marvelous.The film's first half contains some good humor; the second half becomes ever sillier, from the shopping mall sequence on to the end. The sequence in the auditorium where students give their reports is not the least bit funny, and is loaded with juvenile clichés. None of the script's dialogue contains any subtext. But that's to be expected when we have such bodacious characters that only want to ""party on"". The plot centers on physical action, not cerebral mind games.There's a lot of CGI in this film, and it is done rather well; the special effects do not get in the way of the story. Casting is acceptable. But it's the photogenic Keanu Reeves who really makes the story interesting. Acting is about what we would expect for a popcorn flick.However shallow the characters may be, and however silly some of the plot elements are, there are some deep messages here. The film offers a satire on suburban youth culture in the frivolous 80s. It also speaks to how different our contemporary culture is from bygone eras, thus offering historical perspective. And of course, ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"", despite the comedy or perhaps through it, veritably oozes contempt for the failure of American education. The film's thematic depth thus renders it a serious study of suburban youth culture in the latter decades of the twentieth century.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
53,snoozejonc,Strange things are afoot at the Circle K,8,19 September 2020,"Two high school friends must pass their final history assignment or face the end of their dreams of forming a rock band.I saw this movie aged nine on its original release and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think my mind was blown by how cool it made the subject of history seem and how harmlessly likeable the main protagonists were. Unlike me, my parents, who are Baby-Boomer generation, sat through it with me and did not appreciate Bill and Ted's dumb valleys, surfer dude, stoner-like personalities. Much to their distain I rewatched it more than once.My mother said on one viewing 'How can you watch those two ignorant American boys?' To which I replied 'Can you tell me about Socrates and Lincoln?' Just as I suspected she could not tell me anymore than the film could. In fact she'd never even heard of Socrates or any other Greek philosophers. From that moment on she never uttered a word.I watched it yesterday, aged forty with my four yearly daughter and appreciate how it might have come across to my mother at the time. However, the key to enjoying it as an adult is not taking it the slightest bit seriously. The dumbness of the main characters is part of what makes them so charming and the concept that a future of civilisation will be based on a Californian teenage sub-culture is a joke you just have to buy into and enjoy.The basic plot structure is solid and it uses all its silliness in a clever way with the time-travel sci-fi moments. I love the little details like the stolen car-keys and Ted forgetting to wind his watch.Some jokes hit the mark more now than they did for me as a child, particularly some of the innuendo involving Bill's stepmom and Bill's confirmation to Sigmund Freud of his 'minor oedipal complex'. Ironically, looking back at this time-travel themed movie is like taking a journey back to the 1980s with it's fashion, music and shopping-mall culture.Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are perfect as characters who are essentially two halves of the same brain. George Carlin is to coin a phrase 'excellent' as their guardian angel type friend from the future. Also, the visual effects during the time-travel sequences stand up reasonably well by today's standards.I took a lot of entertainment from it as child and my daughter stuck with it till the end.For me it is a 7.5/10 but I round upwards.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

When Ted's father warns him that he will be enlisted in military school if he doesn't pass his history exam Ted and Bill (realising that this would put an end to their dreams of being rock stars), decide to knuckle down and study for this exam. However, they receive help from an unexpected quarter namely Rufus a man from the future who may just be the key to Bill and Ted passing this important exam...It's been a long time since I watched Bill and Ted and my memories of it were sketchy, but I'm glad that even after all these years that I still found it to be enjoyable...Whilst the characters of Bill and Ted are fairly basic and generic what makes this film work is its rather original take on how it turns a couple of failures like Bill and Ted in to 2 of the greatest history students. At the start of their adventure, they are wet-behind-the-ears, but as time moves on they start to form an odd sort of bond with each of the historical characters, but the film becomes more fun when the historical characters are placed in the modern era and begin interacting with the public (whom you sense aren't quite ready for them!!).The performances from Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are pretty spot on; at times they come close to being annoying, but just about avoid it in my book. The supporting cast of historical figures all play their parts well each managing to inject a bit of fun into their respective roles (my favourite character was Sigmund Freud whose psychoanalysis of seemingly every person he meets providing much amusement).Another selling point with this film is that it is also ageless; as it is essentially a fun romp through history it will never get old and it's perhaps only some of the special effects that may age the film (although they still don't look too bad tbf).Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is not a film I could watch over and over again, but it's a fun piece of escapism and an amusing journey through history.It is mostly excellent dude!!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

I have to admit, that until I watched this when I was younger, I didn't really know who half of these historic figures were or what they had achieved.The main characters have to do a report on how the people of the past may view the late 80's and how the world has changed and they do it with style. Gathering icons from all over the world and in time. Perhaps we can all be guilty of taking the world we live in for granted and should try to see it through the eyes of Ghengis Khan or Joan of Arc to appreciate the advances we have made and the luxury we live in comparatively.

60,a_chinn,Two very endearing lead characters carry a weak comedy,7,12 July 2018,"Bill & Ted for a time became the common nomenclature for two dumb guys, which is kind of surprising since this film was never considered a classic, but it's also not so surprising since this comedy is as likable and unpretentious as it's two main characters. The silly story has the two not-so-bright So-Cal dudes, Alex Winter (Bill S. Preston, Esq.) and Keanu Reeves (Ted ""Theodore"" Logan), hoping to form their band Wyld Stallyns, but Ted's dad is going ship him off to military school because of failing grades, which the only way he can bring them up is by nailing his history report and presentation to ""Express to the class how an important historical figure from each of your time periods would view the world of San Dimas, 1988."" Enter a time traveling George Carlin as Rufus, who gives the pair a time machine to kidnap historic figures to help him finish and nail the assignment. The duo go back in time to kidnap Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc (Jane Wielding), Socrates, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and Beethoven and mild hilarity ensures. Time travel is a ripe premiss for any number of genres and it's roots in comedy go back to the days of Mark Twain, where he mined similar culture clash humor of past and modern day ideas and values. However, that may be overstating the level of the humor in this film. Bill shouting ""You medieval dickweed!"" is pretty funny, but that's about as funny and clever as this film gets, although Al Leong as Genghis Khan tearing up a sporting goods store is a close second. Despite the mediocre humor, I think the under appreciated element that made Bill & Ted work is the likability of the two main characters. Bill and Ted are kind, caring, and earnest, even if they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Winter and Reeves fully commit to their dumb-guy roles. So well in fact that it took Reeves years to not automatically be pigeonholed by audiences as a doofus, despite appearing in plenty of straight roles ranging from ""Speed"" to ""My Own Private Idaho"" to the underrated and somewhat forgotten ""River's Edge.""

Bill & Ted are the pinnacle of moronic (but entertaining) underdog comedy heroes, and their Excellent Adventure marks the pinnacle of 80s teen comedies, and in particular, 80s teen science fiction. It one that, like the Goonies, has remained a timeless classic. First of all, you have a story that will probably never be achieved with modern films, at least not in the mainstream. The absolute fun of two rather stupid high school best friends who are able to pull together a most bodacious history project by being able to go back in time through the help of a phone booth. And they're not obnoxious. They're not ultra-rich. They're just happy-go-lucky Bill and Ted and they have a most excellent adventure. Maybe that's because it's like an English Composition theme we'd probably get in real life: how would historical figures behave in modern environment? What a fun idea to make a movie out of. Why can't modern teen genre movies utilize the same fun themes instead of lingering on old film's themes? Although, granted, as is the dilemma of most time-traveling films, there is some narrative confusion (if time kept repeating itself as we see from Bill & Ted running into future and past versions of themselves, then Rufus must be one busy dude and on permanent call to keep the galaxy from destruction).Everyone in it is fantastic from Napolean, the honorary ""Ziggy Piggy,"" to Misty, Bill's step-mom and the cause of his ""minor oedipal complex,"" to Ox the dumb jock who gives the ""computers are more moderner"" speech. Plus, the soundtrack is excellent (particularly the ""In Time"" song played when Bill and Ted meet the Three Most Important People on Earth and ""Do You Want To Play"" played during the mall scene.

70,sme_no_densetsu,"Party on, dudes!",7,18 March 2010,"I'll be honest, ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is a childhood favourite of mine so this review is probably going to be tinged with feelings of nostalgia. That being said, having just rewatched it I think that it holds up well.Bill (Alex Winter) & Ted (Keanu Reeves) are a pair of hard rockin' high schoolers who find themselves in danger of flunking history class. This impending misfortune would result in Bill being sent to military academy in Alaska, thus putting an end to the duo's fledgling band, Wyld Stallyns. Luckily for them, help is on the way in the form of a time machine from the distant future. To quote Rufus (George Carlin) from the opening scene, ""Don't worry, it'll all make sense"".The story requires considerable suspension of belief but it does have its own particular charm. While other favourite films of my childhood no longer hold the same appeal this one holds up pretty well. In fact, it might even be more rewarding now, since today I get some of the subtler jokes regarding the various historical personages.Reeves & Winter work well together as the dimwitted duo at the centre of the story. Both nail the dumb but lovable vibe that gives their characters their appeal. The incomparable George Carlin is also present in a small role while the actors playing the various historical figures are uniformly effective.The direction by Stephen Herek is above average for a comedy and the special effects have even held up better than I would have expected. The soundtrack doesn't have much in the way of recognizable content but it all fits the movie and the time period to a T.Ultimately, ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is an entertaining comedy that captures the spirit of the time in which it was made. It's no ""Citizen Kane"" but it's well worth a look for anyone in the mood for a lively comedy with a uniquely goofy premise.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
71,Howlin Wolf,The title says it all...,8,25 July 2007,"... This is indeed a wickedly fun ride. Just because the film's two main characters are lovable doofuses doesn't mean the comedy in the script can't have a brain, and it has lots of fun with the perceived stereotypes of a variety of historical figures. The film's premise is some form of bizarre genius, but the fact that it consistently manages to swap timezones whilst always maintaining some sense of narrative direction is an all too rare achievement for fantasy stories.Amidst all this hectic back and forth, to have it find time for throwaway running gags at all is impressive, but how funny they actually are in practice is nothing short of remarkable! My favourite is Bill's own pressing Oedipal dilemma, and the psychologically based funnies don't end there, as along the way the duo run into old Mr. Sigmund Freud himself! ""How's it going, Frood-dude!"", they exclaim...To conclude, I'm almost as excited over this film as Bill and Ted are about WYLD STALLYNS!!!!!!!!!!!! *triumphant air-guitar*",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
72,vithiet,Of course it's dumb but I get the appeal,6,30 June 2020,"As a child of the 80s who's seen every other movie like this one it truly is bizarre I never managed to watch this cult-ish one until now. There is no denying this is a stupid movie and everything about it is not great: script, acting, etc. and I don't even think it was as self aware as something like a Big Trouble in Little China when it came out so it's hard to see it just like a joke movie. If I had seen it as a kid in 1989, I might have liked it and would still have fond memories of it, making it worth re-watching. Watching it now I still had some good nostalgia-induced laughs at some particularly ridiculous scenes and I had a good time overall. I would not necessarily recommend it to newer generations as a must-see from the 80s though.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
73,mentalcritic,Enjoyable? Somewhat. Well-written? Not on your life.,5,21 March 2005,"The 1980s were once thought to be the absolute nadir of Western culture, with America producing so much throwaway drivel that some of the best examples of art from there during this decade were made by outsiders. It is only because of the sheer vapidity of the 1990s and 2000s so far that we can look back upon the 1980s with any sense of longing or nostalgia, and the titular duo of this film give us a good understanding of why. The film begins with a great dialogue from George Carlin about this great and wonderful future that was inspired by two legendary musicians. Okay, so far, so good. It is a concept that, while not totally brilliant, can be made to work if exploited properly.The problem here is that the subjects of the film are so utterly vapid that they flatten their own story. They claim to be rebelling against a society that does us all wrong, and that part is true enough, but one fundamental law is that one should never kill a tyrant until one knows whether his successor is an improvement or not. Bill and Ted, as a model for society, definitely aren't. I have read some previous comments that note the fascistic undertone inherent in the film, and I can only agree. Anything that the heroes disagree with or don't like the appearance of is bogus, apparently. One can just sense the kilns being fired up for the autistic or phobic individuals in the San Diemas of the future.Another interesting point is the whitewashing of history that occurs in the process of retrieving the historical figures, all of whom present far more interesting characters than the titular heroes. Apparently, maidens from France of the Middle Ages look exactly like gunslingers of the New Mexico of colonial America, who in turn look exactly like modern Californians. Sure, the inclusion of Napoleon helped with the European element (not). After all, we all know that French military leaders are foul-tempered midgets with bad personal relationship skills. And it is probably best to say nothing at all about Genghis Khan, since he never gets to say anything at all during his performance. About the only opportunity with these characters that gets any exploration at all is Socrates, who provides an interesting insight into the idea of an ancient Greek philosopher being transported into modern times. Unfortunately, since Robert Heinlein had a lot of ideas that Socrates expressed thousands of years ago, such as people being made to make decisions of conscience before they vote in affairs that affect millions, I can honestly imagine Socrates would find Bill, Ted, and pretty much everyone at San Diemas High abhorrent.The film's strengths, which are few in number, include the aforementioned George Carlin. If Doctor Who had been an American show, but had the similar lengthy, sometimes controversial, history that the BBC gave it, it's a safe bet that Carlin would have at some point played the good Doctor. Carlin displays the cool that Bill, Ted, and every San Diemas citizen who gets the slightest screen time seems to want to have. Indeed, part of the fun of Bill And Ted is taking note of how much the so-called good guys act like the dickweeds that they are so fond of calling others. Dan Shor gives a very good performance as Billy The Kid in spite of physically being totally wrong for the part. Shor looks as if he is at least four inches too tall for the part, and is far too muscular. Not to mention that his front teeth are not prominent enough, but that gets back to the Orwellian rearranging of history recently talked about. In spite of these mismatches, Shor at least sells himself as someone you'd take seriously if you met him in the Wild West.Interestingly enough, the film sat on a shelf for two years before Orion bought the rights to it from the De Laurentiis Group and released it upon an unsuspecting world. They must have liked the teen market a lot, since a mere four years would pass before they retooled one of the biggest artistic triumphs they had ever financed for such a market, and as a happy result, went bankrupt. I understand how cutthroat the film business is, but you'd think that film studios would look back at history to see this correlation between disrespecting one's audience and a poor box-office return.One more positive of this film is that it doesn't give a lot of detail about the future that Carlin's character is trying to protect. This allows the audience to fill in some details for themselves, which in turn makes the vapidity of the folk we are told it is based on somewhat less objectionable. With people like Rufus in power, it is easier to believe the future is not dominated by complete morons like the present.Like the sequel, I gave Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure a five out of ten. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, it is an okay way to pass ninety minutes. But if you want something to watch that will do more than fill time, then there is nothing to see here.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
74,phubbs,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,9,20 April 2014,"This could quite possibly be one of the most original and well created comicbook style movie franchises that didn't actually start out originally as a comicbook. Yep believe it or not this cult franchise started out with the first film which was ingeniously written by two fellas called Matheson and Solomon, this film was not adapted from a comicbook source.I used to watch this film when I was still in school back in the day, it was massive! I adored it and watched it all the time. The basic premise is so simple yet the film has been so well crafted I fail to see how anyone can not enjoy it. Bill and Ted are a couple of metalhead school flunks in the present day, yet through a bizarre series of events both will eventually become the inspirational 'Great Ones' that changed the human race into a peaceful utopian society...through their music. The problem is if they don't pass their history class Ted will get shipped off to military academy and this future will never happen. Enter 'Rufus' to help and assist the bumbling duo in passing their final history test/exam thing.Watching this recently I guess the main things that stand out to me are...well actually there are a lot of things that stood out and still hold up today. The visuals are great fun, sure its not as colourful as the sequel but I'm still really impressed at how good each period looks mainly. The duo travel across a few eras and I must say everything looks pretty darn good considering this was a bit of a tacky throw away teen flick. Each period is only seen briefly but it all holds up even though you might only see a single room or street. For example when they pick up Beethoven we see a really elegant 18th Century room full of aristocrats or noble folk and it looks good, believable. There's a real castle with a nice interior for 15th Century England (God knows where), a small taste of ancient Greece with pillars and statues, a section of a wild west town etc...My point is they clearly have had to stretch and struggle to create each period but full kudos to them as it all looks amazingly solid.Not everything looks that good these days of course, some of the periods are a bit thin on the ground visually eg. Napoleon's war camp, prehistoric San Dimas and Genghis Khan's tent which is obviously an easy cover for not showing anything else. But again on the plus side all the costumes look really good and the casting is really good too. I still found Terry Camilleri's subtle performance as Napoleon to be hilarious with his little French mutterings and facial expressions, he fit this role like a glove, brilliant!. All the other cast really do look good with some nice makeup work, Abe Lincoln is especially good looks and performance wise, as is Beethoven and the almost mute Socrates. Honourable mention to Al Leong as Genghis Khan. Despite the age and silliness of this film I have no issues with any of the historical elements really. I'm just amazed it does look as good as it does because we all know how shitty these things can look with less care.I mean apart from the joyous adventure there is so much to praise here. The soundtrack is awesome, pure awesomeness, yeah its totally 80's of course but if you like 80's tunage then you'll love this selection. There are some truly electric sequences which are bitchin' simply down to the musical track that accompanies them. Add to that the full on retro vibe going on here, I just love every minute of it, the sneakers, cars, tunes, technology, clothes etc...there is one scene where Billy the Kid and Socrates try to chat up these two girls in the mall. Oh my these girls are visually the epitome of the 80's, not that that's a surprise of course but little things like this brings the memories flooding back and really helped me enjoy the film. Oh and my God one of them is super cute!.Admittedly the film does take a bit of a dive as you near the end. The whole history test thing they gotta take always did seem evil to me, what kind of high school test involves standing in front of an entire hall full of students and giving a lecture on history?! Jesus!. And lets be honest here, the presentation Bill and Ted give is pretty nondescript really, it is essentially a bunch of people giving them a pat on the back, its more of a magic show. There are bits I could pick at throughout the film like the fact they somehow manage to squeeze so many people into one phone booth and when they drop all the famous history figures back into their own times wouldn't their new knowledge and visions of the future change history dramatically?.But lets be honest here, this film isn't anything more than a wild ride that probably wasn't expected to do much more than hit the videoshop shelves and rot (many similar teen flicks over the years did just that, 'Bio-Dome' anyone). There's a reason the franchise became a cult and that's because this first film is so damn enjoyable. The cool phone booth concept is genius, the ultra cool Rufus played by Carlin, the quirky and amusing looking 2688 future humans and of course the iconic dialog which has become a part of modern pop culture and predates the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pizza surfing spiel. A most triumphant time travel fantasy which is pretty much a hidden gem these days, full of surprises and a franchise that Keanu Reeves was actually perfectly cast for.9/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
75,Stampsfightclub,a most triumphant comedy,9,26 May 2008,"Alex Winter (The Lost boys) and Keanu Reeves (Dangerous Liaisons) star as Bill and Ted, two teenagers in danger of failing their history class. A man from the future comes from the future to give them good news. He gives them a time machine where they can travel through time to collect historical figures for their report.This Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) picture is the true catalyst of comedy, with excellent physical humour and sharp witty dialogue with ace brilliant catch phrases from the two central protagonists. Beautifully directed, this 1989 fantasy comedy is brilliant in justifying the genre, making a wonderful light hearted film.Winter and Reeves make a great on screen partnership with their timing, catchphrases, facial reactions and companionship making them one of the best male comedy partnerships over the last twenty years. Using typical teenage conventions such as stupidity and slang, we can relate to the characters and their motives and, though stereotypical, are fun to watch.The plot is ""most excellent"" with a very consistent baseline, sharp dialogue, great direction, action sequences and visual effects. Jumping through all different times, the film makes great use of settings and jumps on opportunities to capture the essence of each time well and from the comedy perspective, it is used brilliantly.The use of historical figures is also a great device to gain acceptance into the comedy genre with Billy the Kid, Socrates, Beethoven and Genghis Kahn the most interesting and funny, though none will match Napoleon who was by far the funniest character of the entire film, especially the bowling scene which will get you in stitches.It is most simply, most excellent and you must watch it dudes!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

Looking back with critical eyes, it's a rather thin, desperately low-budget production that doesn't probe beyond the superficial layer and constantly winks and nudges the audience to ensure they know when to laugh. Yet, recognizing all that, I found myself wrapped up in its oddly naive warmth and charismatic magnetism. The jokes and gags are hammy and contrived, but I still snickered. The most memorable lines are clumsy and blunt, but I gladly recited them (surprising myself, as I hadn't seen the film in twenty-plus years). Bill and Ted themselves are the narrowest of stereotypes, basically the male equivalent of Frank Zappa's valley girls, yet I felt a rich tingle of satisfaction when they saved their academic careers.

78,Angry_Arguer,Bad Trip,1,29 February 2004,"I wasn't surprised with what I saw.  This takes one gag--insanely idiotic guys--and beats it to death by having them display their ineptness through history.  A few 80s movies tried this after 'Back to the Future', none lasted because they didn't understand the context.Here we have two Biffs and no Doc to run the show.  The historical figures themselves aren't interesting because they rely on the stereotypes we have in our minds.  'Kid in King Arthur's Court' also had these problems.  There was so much potential here, so why did it fail?I found the sequel more interesting because it explored the darker philosophical territory of life, death, etc. rather than simple textbook journeys like this.  There was also the heavy duality motif that's absent here.There are some good points like the self-referential Incest Joke.  The writers improved on this the second time around, but it's pretty deep stuff for a light movie.  Also, there's the irony of Keanu.  From airhead to Messiah, that's society in a nutshell.The music, vocabulary, and production design are throwaways.  Fortunately, the writers had another chance with better crew to set things straight--and to Hell, literally, with nostalgia.I liked sequel self-reference of 'Bogus Journey' to the history-bashing here.  From there came 'Wayne's World' and Beavis & Butt-Head, two icons of early 90s culture.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
79,aesgaard41,What Is It ?,7,10 May 2002,"I only like this movie for the time traveling aspects, and that's about it. In all, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one. It's not a teen movie, but it's not a fantasy. Two low-achievers are given the assignment to save the future. The reason is extremely far-fetched; it alleges that their music plays a factor to world peace. If that was the case, I can name twenty other more talented singers, vocalists and entertainers with a lot more brains and talent who honed their craft by hard work who are far more eligible. The boys will fail if they don't turn in a history assignment which just so happens to be set up for them to be able to yank historical personages from the past. Isn't it likely they were more likely to fail ? How could this so-called future have existed to send them a time machine to pass when it they were most likely to fail the test ? I think someone in that future rewrote their history to depend on the two idiots. The other facts about time travel are pretty close when it comes to being able to travel both a few minutes forward and backward, but there are historical contradictions a plenty on the characters, most obviously is the t-shirt tan on Socrates. Anyone from Before Christ would be a lot more tanned ! The actors are matched up solely on appearance to the roles they play and the script depicts them well, but it is less kind to Bill and Ted themselves. George Carlin is the only character to watch in this, but he has few scenes as a would-be Obi Wan to Bill and Ted, two characters sharing a brain - and both of them thinking the other has it.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

Anyway I thought it was awful. I had always enjoyed the little snippets that people used for entertainment value but the whole movie was just too much.There are a lot of reviewers talking about how only a literary genius could come up with this idea. Give me a break the only people who could come up with an idea like this were stoned at a frat party when they thought up this gem.Now I realise I am not the target audience for this movie so I rated it a solid three.

84,the red duchess,"Accurate, prescient and dispiriting.",1,10 January 2001,"If one were feeling charitable, one could call this 'comedy' the nadir of post-modernity, where history is flattened out, where the dead, largely white, largely European-American, largely male Great Figures are made the subject of infantile mockery, taken out of the period in which they dominated and dumped into one where the majority of yokels don't even know their name.  It is post-modernity with a moral - you can't simply rearrange history to suit the present, as most of the students in Bill and Ted's school seem to do - the relics wreak suitable havoc on an archetypally inane mall.  Except there is no moral.  One jock caps a poisonously conformist paper with the cliche that it's what Lincoln would have wanted.  You hope, as with Marshall McLuhan in 'Annie Hall', that the hallowed President steps up and clips the young fascist on the ear, but, oh no, our friends from times past consecrate the idea of history as progress and improvement, and take to the vapid airbrush that is modern America like the proverbial pigs. 
And you can see their point - most of these figures lived in times of great historical repression and violence, even if one or two of them (eg Genghis Khan, according to this film, the father of chop-socky) were doing the violent repressing.  America may be a dolt's paradise, but you are unlikely to be burnt for hearing voices, shoved into an oven for being the wrong religion, or poisoned for having the wrong ideas.  This is America, after all, and Joseph McCarthy, Vietnam and South America are nightmares that never happened.  Because post-modernity would have to have been invented for America if it didn't exist: without historical amnesia, it would be forced to live with itself.  And so, great classics or periods of history are stripped of politics and social analysis, and turned into neutered love stories.  We are all Bill and Ted, we get the culture we deserve.Ahem.  Sorry about that, bit of a rant there, very old-fashioned.  I know a lot of normally sensible people have a lot of affection for this film, despite its visual paucity, its negligible script, its gauche 'acting', its hitting on a half-clever idea AND DOING NOTHING WHATSOEVER WITH IT.  people dream of meeting all these historical figures and questioning them.  it might be okay for our heroes to say 'duh!' and 'So-crates', but did the filmmakers have to join them?  Couldn't they find SOMETHING funny, interesting, ironic, subversive for these great people to do, instead of standing around gaping , while Bill and Ted gurn infuratingly with only a thin screen between them and my fist.

85,LebowskiT1000,Totally Excellent!,8,27 August 2002,"""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is most definitely just that!  This is just an all around FUN movie!  The plot is far from anything serious, but deep down there are some good morals and such things to take from this film. ""Be Excellent To Each Other""  That is some good advice, is it not?The comedy in this film is just superb!  I've seen this movie more times than I can count with my fingers and every time it gets even better!  There are so many lines in this film that you just can't help but repeat, because they're just so funny and well done!  There are a number of times that I find myself just cracking up at the scene, situation, or what have you.  If you don't laugh at least a little during the course of this film, then I think you've got some problems.The acting is great.  Everybody knocks Keanu Reeves for his acting, but I think he's great.  And he does a great job in this film.  Alex Winter also plays a great part.  The rest of the cast is great too.Not only is the comedy and the acting great, but there are some REALLY good science fiction sort of idea's in this film.  The scene where Bill and Ted meet the future Bill and Ted is just amazingly well done, and such a cool idea.  I love that you first see the scene from the perspective of one set of Bill and Ted's, and then later the Bill and Ted that the story follows becomes the other set of Bill and Ted's.  Did that make sense?  Well, anyway, see the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  There were a few other really good scenes and ideas throughout the film.All in all, I would definitely recommend seeing this film, it's not a complex story by any means, and just a whole lot of fun.  Try not to take the film too seriously and you'll hopefully enjoy it.  I truly hope that you enjoy this film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
86,Horror-yo,Fun concept. Fun watch,7,9 September 2016,"The two characters really are endearing and the concept is fun, more than this is a great comedy at all. On its own, the film is mediocre and very limited in content. But the concept and the two main idiot characters are carried out well enough that an hour and a half of this makes for a fun ride nonetheless. Some gags are fun, others actually funny, and others yet are more of the ordinary stuff we're all now used to witnessing in such commercial mainstream comedies.Overall the concept and the Bill and Ted characters were good enough to make this a really good, maybe great comedy - but the filmmakers didn't bother and rather went with an effort-economic solution of developing very slightly, just enough to make it a sellable product.Elements like ""Hey Missy...I mean, mom !..."" or the pretty hilarious vocabulary of our two protagonist idiots, their likable idiocy and stupid remarks, the time travel idea with the booth and the Rufus character, the ""princesses""... all that was really good comedy material, but as a film, there just isn't enough.A generous, partly nostalgic 6.5/10.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

The whole movie is fueled by fun humor that is pretty easy to enjoy. Although it has some light sci-fi elements, it is by no means an action comedy, nor does is have an interesting story. The plot basis is fine, but there are no end twists or earth- shattering revelations and there are no time traveling issues (e.g. Marty McFly almost preventing his own birth by interfering with his parents' past). For those who haven't seen the movie, the essential plot is that Bill and Ted are failing history and cannot graduate high school without acing their final report. To make matters worse, Ted's dad is threatening to send Ted to military school if he flunks out. With help from a man named Rufus (George Carlin) from 2689, they travel through time to find historical figures to help them make the perfect history report.While these two excellent dudes are presented and even treated like a unit, they are given individualized home situations and slightly different personalities. Ted (Keanu Reeves) is a bit more cheerful and goofy than Bill (Alex Winter), who has a few moments of irritation. While academically incompetent, they actually have some pretty good ideas and moments of resourcefulness throughout, rather like Harry and Lloyd in Dumb and Dumber. The whole time, they surf speak (e.g. ""Excellent,"" ""Triumphant,"" ""Bodacious,"" etc.) and play air guitar solos as they collect their historical figures. These small quirks are what I feel makes this movie so enjoyable.Of course, it isn't award winning in any regard. As mentioned before, the story is given very little thought. The scattered moments of sci-fi have pretty poor visual effects. Of course, it is a comedy so these technical aspects are not terribly important. Besides, the acting and scripting is satisfactory from the main characters, minor characters, and one- liner parts. The comedy has a consistent personality and mood to it, but there is a pretty good balance of situational and verbal humor. The comedy is presented blatantly and doesn't have much Home Alone style slapstick or Monty Python style British humor. The back half of the movie has lots of gags involving eight historical figures being put in California in the 80's. Bill and Ted have some pretty funny lines, but it's also quite amusing to just watch their non-verbal reactions to various situations. The humor is family friendly, though not written like a kid's movie. If that is confusing, it's essentially Wayne's World style comedy on a PG level, but again it isn't a kid's movie.You can watch this in almost any setting and not decrease the viewing experience. There's no problem if you watch it with a semi-boisterous crowd. If you don't find it funny or enjoyable after ten or so minutes, I would recommend turning it off. Your first impression of this film will probably be close to your opinion of it at the end. So in short, it's worth a try in search of a good comedy, but is by no means a masterpiece. Overall Rating: 8.7/10.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
90,DavidSim240183,Two heavy metallers jamming they're way through time,10,15 November 2007,"I'll bet when screenwriters Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson pitched Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure to the studios it raised quite a few eyebrows. The very idea of two teenage wannabe rockers hurtling through history in a time travelling phone box must have sounded off the wall. But you can never really gauge people's tastes. Or what they will buy into. And quite unexpectedly, Bill & Ted went on to be one of the surprise sleeper hits of the late 80s.It may have helped that only a couple of years previously Universal had a major hit with Back to the Future, the similar story of a teen travelling through time. But Bill & Ted isn't a complete ripoff. Far from it. Even though it has the same spirit and similar good nature about it, it is quite a different film.The film begins far into our distant future. 2688 to be precise. The world has become a Utopian society through two young men, Bill S. Preston Esq (Alex Winters), and Ted ""Theodore"" Logan (Keanu Reeves). Bill & Ted actually live in the late 20th Century, but their band the ""Wyld Stallyns"" has inspired others for generations to come.But Bill & Ted have a task to accomplish before fulfilling they're destiny as saviours of the Earth. Passing History. Bill & Ted are in danger of flunking (""most heinously"") out of high school. If that happens, Ted will be shipped off to military school, Wyld Stallyns will never take off, and our future is history.But they have help from Rufus (George Carlin), a visitor from the future. With the aid of a time travelling phone box, Bill & Ted head to different points in history, gathering historical figures from all over the world, all over time. In a last ditch effort to graduate from high school.Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a film that shouldn't even begin to work. And yet oddly enough it does. It's the lightness of touch director Stephen Herek brings that makes the film fly. Not to mention two ""excellent"" performances from Keanu Reeves and Alex Winters.They play their parts with perfectly gormless charm. They're two affable lunkheads who look and sound completely spaced out. Its easy to forget this was the beginning of Keanu Reeve's career. For all of his later success, Reeves is a terribly wooden actor, with hardly anything in the way of expressive performing. But he is absolutely perfect as Ted.Reeves has the whole heavy-metal teenspeak down pat. Its almost good acting on his part. His slow-witted monotone voice is ideally suited to that of a laidback dimwit. I think Reeves missed his true calling in life!Sadly Alex Winters' career never took off into the stratosphere the way Reeves' did. But he is just as good. He gets the lions share of all the lingo: ""Bogus...heinous...non-triumphant."" Reeves and Winters are so superb together. Every scene that pairs them together is a joy.The film gets a lot of its comic mileage from Bill & Ted's inability to comprehend the enormity of they're endeavour. When they arrive in Mediaeval England, they assume being thrown into an iron maiden is a meeting with the band of the same name. The witty screenplay by Solomon and Matheson is full of funky amusements. And that's all before we get to the inspired second half.Once Bill & Ted have returned from they're time-trip, all they're guests are unleashed on sunny California. Napoleon discovers the wonders of the water slide. Joan of Arc leads an aerobics class. Even Beethoven makes the logical leap from piano to electric keyboard.Bill & Ted may be entertainment of the lowest gear. But its still entertainment. It's even unexpectedly clever at the unlikeliest of moments. Like when Bill & Ted meet future versions of themselves, who have come back from the trip they're about to take.And we mustn't leave out George Carlin's Rufus. He's just as mellow and laidback as our heroes. I would have liked to have seen more of him. He's such an engaging screen presence. He quite lights up the film whenever he's around.If the film has any flaws they're only minor. The idea of a time travelling phone box is something that's been ripped off from Doctor Who, and the film perhaps glosses over some of history's darkest chapters, but nonetheless, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is supremely silly and good-natured. It gets by on its sheer sense of fun alone. The sequel is a polar opposite, and makes for an interesting companion piece, but its the original that rocks!Party on dudes!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
91,willcundallreview,Fun adventure with a phone booth time machine,7,21 August 2014,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is an adventure comedy and also a Sci-Fi that is funny, fun and has two likable yet very stupid characters. The story is not drawn out or anything and is one of the best things about it, it doesn't try to be a fantastic movie and knows where it's limits are. It kind of thrills all the way through and at certain points you may really be rooting for Bill and Ted. I felt the film was just about good, and here below is why so.The story as said is fun and also comedic and that really mixes well here to create a film that will make you laugh but also let you just enjoy yourself whilst watching it. With the element of the time machine it just gets more fun, yes the film is goofy and very silly and can even seem like a stoner comedy without the drugs, but it is just consistently an enjoyable ride and one you can't help but like.Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter have a great friendship chemistry that is perfect in this type of movie, they even seem like brothers at times. As a whole the entire cast is good and they have good fun all the way to the end, I liked Terry Camilleri as Napoleon who is just hilarious and I won't ruin it for you but what he does is one of the highlights of this movie and along with other historic figures they all get caught in stupid things.Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon make a solid script which is really one of the highlights of this movie and the basis for much of the laughs. Stephen Herek directs it well too and he seems to do a good job when it comes to the travels Bill and Ted go on. For the 80's, it has some cool effects and although not awesome, they are still good to see, and the sets sometimes are well just a little crazy.The film isn't always funny, misses the odd joke and that is why it isn't THE most funny film although no comedy is perfect. I think what I said about the stoner comedy but it doesn't have stoners part is also a reason this isn't great, very teen orientated and I can see why some people disliked this movie quite a bit, although yet again this film never claims or I think wants to be perfect.If you want a comedy that goes along the lines of many other 80's comedies then this is one to watch and it also has the added bonus of being slightly like a parody similar to Back to the Future. I think if you don't like the goofy films also made in the 80's then this isn't for you, very much a film that isn't afraid to target only teenagers as a market, but I think now the biggest fans from 1989 are way past there teens.Overall I did feel this was a Just About Good film and one I thought at first could have been an even higher score. Give it a go and literally chill out whilst watching this and you will have a massively good time, if you watch as a brutal film critic then you will well dislike it. But always remember watching this that it's just a funny teen film and I hope you have a most excellent adventure.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
92,TheAll-SeeingI,Eighties Icons Forever,9,6 September 2019,"The most excellent Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure is firmly in the pantheon of great Eighties period pieces, yet the cultural traction it continues to gain proves its ongoing appeal to mischievous teens of any generation.Ted Theodore Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston Esquire (Alex Winter) load up on the SoCal ""accent"" and coinciding Eighties vernacular and take it right over the top, joyously pushing the envelope separating authentic acting and totally self-aware exaggeration. The casting and resulting acting, in fact, can truly be argued as the drivers of the film's long-term success : It takes serious acting power to play fun-loving knuckleheads while at the same administering a healthy dose of knowing satire, yet neither Reeves nor Winter really have received the kudos they deserve for knocking these roles out of the park and transforming these characters into true cultural icons that remain in our public consciousness decades later.Check your film snobbery at the door, crack a cold one, and give in to all the lovely nonsense this classic comedy has to offer.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
93,lordzedd-3,Surprisenly funny flick.,9,11 November 2006,"As silly as the premise is for this movie, I got to admit I liked the characters. The story is good, and the cast does a great job with this slightly far fetched concept. Alex Winter who looks a lot like Sean Penn is great, and this is Keenu Reeves break out film. This is what is called a sleeper hit, people didn't except it to make a ton of money. Let alone a sequel and a short lived animated series. Which I also enjoyed. Bill and Ted are cool characters, they are likable and have good hearts. These are the kind of underdog who love to root for to win. The effects are cool, and the humor is very funny. all though I would have liked to seen a dragon in dark age time. That would have cool. But such is life. All and all a near perfect flick and worth watching over and over again. I give BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVNETURE...9 STARS.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

96,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,22 February 2005,"Another great, innocent eighties teen movie about rock, hope, the future, the past, the present, babes etc. As i've said before in other reviews it makes rock fans seem dumb, these two are, but it is a comedy and wouldn't work if they weren't. The idea that the future depends on these two is not as far-fetched as you would think- who honestly thinks politics and suit wearers can save the world? Anyway, the film is simply about friendship and trying to do something worthwhile in your life, that even a high school nobody can make a difference. Hardly original ideas, but given a totally excellent twist for the genre.Bill and Ted are two typical high school losers from San Dimas. They love their rock music, dream of being in a band and meeting some radical babes. Reality states otherwise- that exams are approaching and if they fail, it's off to military school. AS they believe that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife, their prospects of passing their history final are not good. One night, hanging around the Circle K, they meet themselves-from the future, and a guy named Rufus. He tells them they must pass their exam or there will be grave consequences for the world. They must travel back in time to find historical figures to bring back for their exam, travelling in a phone booth of course. On the way the fall in love, meet many people and get into a few scrapes. Soon though, their historical figures run riot in a local mall and get arrested. Time is running out- but they have a time machine...A silly idea, but very cleverly executed, and the result is much smarter than you might expect. Keanu and Alex are both excellent in their roles, and the rest of the cast are all very good. Special mention to Terry Camilleri who is very funny as Napolean. He gets some of the best lines-'Le Glace?' and 'Idiot!' amongst others. There are many one-liners, the film creating an inane language of its own which is both repeatable and harmless. The plot does fly all over the place, but it remains easy, and deals with the concept of time-travel much like Back to the Future did. There are many references which rock fans will get, modern audiences may not understand half the film now and will no doubt see it as extremely cheesy. The dialogue and fashion may have dated to some extent, but so will all today's teen shows and movies. This however retains charm over the years, and is still cool. There are many interesting ideas here, some very funny moments, and is more original than many would admit. Good solid entertainment, executed with a unique style.9 out of 10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
97,HelenMary,Excellent comedy with quite a lot of genius!,7,3 January 2014,"This film is an 80s classic, as far as I'm concerned in the same category as things like Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Everyone has seen it (if not HOW?) and everyone loves it, films like Real Genius too. 'Excellent Adventure is comedy at it's best; entertaining, funny, cleverly written and stands the test of time as good clean fun. It's great to watch over twenty years later, and still surprises whilst feeling warm, fuzzy and totally familiar. The premise is simple; two slacker kids with big ambitions get some help from the future where their simple rock band have brought harmony and peace to the world, ended poverty and seen in a Utopian age. It's silly really and naïve in many ways but the writing is most certainly not. It's like Innerspace, funny, daft and if you pay attention you might actually learn something (pulmonary alveoli came up in my Biology A-level so a quote from Innerspace was quite useful by way of revision) and if you know something already some of the jokes in BATEA are actually quite brilliant - watch Freud's corn dog in the Mall ;-) The script is brilliant, with some great and memorable one-liners, it's family fun, relatively clean and innocuous (quite rare these days), and whilst the main characters are supposed to be slacker idiots, they are actually quite profound and are fairly good role models! Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves play the lead roles (Bill and Ted respectively) and clearly had a LOT of fun making this film (ditto the historical figures) and the chemistry between them was excellent - apparently they were/are friends in real life. They look like they are having fun, the characters had fun and the viewer has fun. It's a popcorn movie, and what films should be about; feel good and uplifting. It's a joy. Their facial expressions and physical comedy are so enjoyable; Reeves especially (more well known now) is just fabulous to watch, and makes me smile all the way through the film. George Carlin is great, and I particularly like the actors who play Napoleon, Freud and Socrates. The SFX whilst a little simple are good and do the job, and haven't dated that much (a bit), and the music/soundtrack is worth an honourable mention.It's not perfect but then neither is life, and at least this tries to make life a little bit better by existing. ""Be excellent to each other,"" is a good maxim, and the moral behind this film is as bodacious and relevant today as it was in the 80s.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
98,jcbutthead86,An Excellent And Hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy Cult Classic.,10,2 March 2016,"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is an excellent(no pun intended),hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,great laughs,a fine script,a memorable score and soundtrack and amazing special effects. All of those elements make Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure one of the most entertaining Comedies of the 1980s and a Cult Classic.Set in San Dimas,California,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure tells the story of teenage best friends Bill S. Preston Esquire(Alex Winter)and Ted Theodore Logan(Keanu Reeves)who are failing history class and are in danger of being separated forever. But when a man named Rufus(George Carlin)shows up in a phone booth time machine that can help them with their history project that can save their grade and friendship.Released in 1989,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a brilliant and hilarious movie that was a surprise hit at the Box Office grossing 40 million dollars above it's 10 million dollar budget and becoming a Cult Classic while introducing movie audiences to one of the coolest movie duos of all-time in Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan AKA Bill and Ted. From start to finish Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a movie that is an absolute blast that gives viewers plenty of laughs,Adventure and fun that just never stops and keeps viewers glued to the screen and is a movie in my opinion that ranks alongside the Back To The Future trilogy as one of the most entertaining time travel films of all-time. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of those movies that(along with it's underrated sequel Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey)remains re-watchable to this very day and for 90 minutes is most triumphant and never takes itself too seriously because it's not going to be thought-provoking nor will it make you think but it's a film you will never forget. It's one of those films that takes you back to the 1980s and tells viewers to turn off your brain sit back and have fun with this movie. The Comedy and laughs in Excellent Adventure are fantastic with over the top moments that are smart and outlandish and will have you roaring with laughter. The Humor not only comes from the scenes with Bill and Ted but with the historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln,Napoleon,Billy The Kid,Beethoven and Joan Of Ark deal with modern day and how they deal with the modern world and society(circa 1989). While it's historically inaccurate and very silly it goes with the offbeat style of the movie. The time traveling scenes in Excellent Adventure are dazzling and imaginative using a Telephone instead of a car or watch The Screenplay by Chris Matheson and Ed Soloman is funny and at times smart with dialog and scenes that are clever and over the top with great comedic timing. Bill and Ted are one of the classic duos that are just iconic from the moment you see them on screen with memorable lines that are quoted to this very day such as excellent,dude and others. It's obvious that Bill and Ted aren't the smartest guys in the world and they don't always better themselves(they want to form a band but can't play their instruments)the two always remain lovable despite their flaws and we root for them to succeed in trying to pass History. Bill and Ted are among my favorite movie characters of all-time and are legends that will live on forever. The ending of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is amazing,fun and filled with surprises and laughs that will put smiles on viewers faces. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are excellent and hilarious as Bill and Ted,with Winter and Reeves bringing laughs and chemistry. George Carlin is delightful as Rufus,a man sent to help Bill and Ted. Terry Camilleri is hilarious and memorable as Napoleon,the French soldier. Dan Shor(Billy The Kid),Tony Steedman(Socrates),Rod Loomis(Freud),Al Leong(Ghangus Kahn),Jane Wiedlin(of 80s group The Go-Go's,Joan Of Ark),Robert Barron(Abraham Lincoln),Clifford David(Beethoven),Hal Landon Jr(Captain Logan),Bernie Casey(Mr. Ryan),Amy Stoch(Missy/Mom)and J. Patrick McNamara(Mr. Preston give good performances as well.The direction by Stephen Herek is terrific,with Herek bringing an energy,pace and visual style to the film. Great direction,Herek.The score by David Newman is outstanding and memorable,with Newman's score matching the light tone of the film. Fantastic score,Newman. There is also a terrific Heavy Metal/Hard Rock soundtrack that adds to the film.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI films or both,I highly suggest you see Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure,an excellent and hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that you will never forget. Highly Recommended/ 10/10.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
99,Trevor-Kerensky,It's most excellent!,7,19 March 2021,"I remember seeing this movie at a summer day camp when I was like 9 or 10. It was so funny and I learned about so many different historical figures. It was probably the first time I became aware of France's very own Joan of Arc. I even did a book report about her in Sixth Grade. Sure, the movie was ridiculous but it was funny and enjoyable. George Carlin was the best part and the time travel was cool too.

101,eshwarmail,Silly good fun,8,6 January 2017,"Reviewed August 2011Whoa!! Dudes!! The current number system may not be sufficient if you count how many times Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) utter this through the movie. My rating has nothing to do with the film making prowess or narration or acting. Just the entertainment value. Bill and Ted are teenagers on the verge of failing their history class if they don't come up with a presentation. They are also budding musicians yet to learn how to play an instrument. They come across a Time Machine to gather 'Historical Figures' of the past for their presentation.This was my first introduction to the concept of time travel and the fun that can be had fantasizing it. One of those movies that is so silly with really bad dialog and ridiculous acting, you'll start enjoying it. The concept of time travel is utilized to the full extent without a bother about neither the logic nor consequences which is good. Both leads play ball as morons with goofy mannerisms. A movie such as this has a thin line between working alright and being a disaster. This one just crosses the line.Silly good fun.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
102,ReelCheese,Charmingly Harmless,6,5 September 2006,"BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is one of those charming, harmless comedies which, if you grew up in the 1980s, you probably saw once... or twice... or three or four times.Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are gnarly as the title duo, two high school headbangers (read: morons) whose future, it turns out, is crucial to the wellbeing of the planet! Trouble is, these dudes are about to seriously flunk history, and if that happens, the entire space time continuum could suffer. Enter from the future Rufus, sent back to the '80s to provide our dimwitted heroes with a time-traveling telephone booth. With it, they round up a who's who of historical figures -- Socrates, Billy the Kid, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon and the like -- to highlight an educational presentation that will be their academic saving grace.Nothing is overly spectacular about BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. It's neither roll-on-the-floor hilarious nor ingenious nor packed with amazing special effects. But it does deliver quality over quantity, nicely filling out its 90-minute running time with some chuckles and smiles. The first half is particularly strong as the guys venture from the Old West to medieval castles in search of people whose names they can't even pronounce (Beethoven becomes ""beeth oven"" and so on). Seeing them try to sweet talk Socrates with rock lyrics and lure Genghis Khan with a Twinkie is good for a laugh. The same fish-out-of-water scenario doesn't work quite as well when these figures enter contemporary times, but everybody puts in their best effort forward. And sometimes, that's all you can ask of a film. A kickin' soundtrack adds to the fun.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

It was no surprise that the plot was just crazy, and should not be taken seriously obviously. To be honest I didn't enjoy the first 40 or so minutes of the movie, however as the story just kept on getting crazier, I started to enjoy it a little bit. It's one of those comedy movies where you should forget about logic and just enjoy it if you can. I can see why some people might not like it, but I would definitely recommend it.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
104,Quebec_Dragon,Honest look 20 years later at what was a most excellent movie.,6,26 January 2013,"Two Californian wannabe rock star teens, one played by Keanu Reeves of Matrix fame, are going to flunk their history class. Thankfully, a time traveller from the future, where those 2 same guys are revered as icons, comes back and gives them a time machine in the shape of a phone booth. Our heroes proceed to kidnap famous historical figures for their final expose. This is one of the quintessential 80s movies that was better in my memory than it is now, but still manages to be rather amusing. The main attraction for me this time around was their ""most excellent"" way of talking, full of slacker-surf lingo of the 80s. Our heroes seem dumb, but they have their hearts in the right place and are somewhat more clever than initially appears. This shows in the complicated words they sometimes use and in how they use the time machine to their advantage in the final part.The ""kidnapping"" sequences of the famous historical figures weren't particularly good, nor were those famous people particularly well characterized, at least in the beginning. Most of the sequences with Napoleon were weak and overstayed their welcome. I would have done without him (especially the long waterslide sequence) and also with some lame sequences that really don't work. Not only that but the Napoleon actor obviously didn't really speak French. However, when the famous historical figures start interacting in the present, with the exception of Napoleon, the movie gets way more entertaining. It struck me how the second half was much more fun and inventive than the first, with the exception of Bill and Ted meeting themselves in the first part, that was a great idea. This reminds me that because it tells us outright from the start, you know that things are going to end well. I would have preferred less information so there would be at least some suspense (despite the fact it's a comedy). The special effects aged surprisingly well, even the time travelling parts. In the first half, I thought the movie was somewhat poor with a few snippets of enjoyment, and that perhaps time had altered my perception of it. Thankfully, the better second half, when the famous people get to the present, redeems it and makes it worth watching and not just for nostalgia's sake, although nostalgia does help.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

108,Gubby-Allen,An absolute pleasure,10,17 March 2002,"1 of only 11 films I've given 10/10 to out of 400, it's almost perfection. It's a sad state in England when there's more exposure to the Worlds most significant historical figures in one 90 minute American film than you get in 20 years of education here. Even allowing for the inaccuracies & toning down of Billy & Genghis it still teaches you more, infact even acknowledging these figures existed & when they lived is more than most TV does and most viewers sadly know.I wouldn't actually call this a funny film, ie laughing out loud. That seems to be the one reason people have for disliking it. It's highly enjoyable & a highly amusing film. People sadly see it described as that and stupidly expect it to be a Leslie Nielson type film.Only Back to the Future has made time travel as enjoyable. It just baffles me what anyone can dislike about the story here, your mind can wander off for hours during and after, and every character is loveable and brilliantly written into the story.

109,VideoPokerAddict,It has its moments.,3,15 June 2002,"First off, I'd definitely like to say that I don't hate this movie. It's just that there was so much potential for ripe humor and very little of it was tapped. Also, the plot holes in this flick are HUGE. ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" isn't meant to be a sophisticated comedy and that's fine. However, a little more effort could've been used to bring out the humor. It is made abundantly clear at the very beginning of the movie that Bill and Ted aren't the brightest of guys and they have their own style of talking. Unfortunately, words such as ""dude"" and ""heinous"" are way overused. The focus of the film should have been more on the historical figures once they had already been brought back to the present. Watching these two guys go back in time over and over to retrieve people isn't funny or very entertaining. Scenes such as Genghis Khan brutalizing a store mannequin are much more interesting. Overall, ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" has its funny and feel good moments but it doesn't strive to be all it could have been. That's bogus.  4/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
110,moviedude1,I used to love this movie...,6,1 December 2008,"A film that became a classic, two dopey high schoolers are threatened to be split up by one of their fathers if they don't ace the oral presentation in History. The problem is that someone else doesn't want them to part ways, and sends them on a special trip...into the past.Having recently saw this film for the ""umpteenth"" time, these two ""dudes"" obviously aren't that stupid in real life (maybe they watched Sean Penn's character ""Spiccoli"" in ""Fast Times at Ridgemount High"" for incentive on their character), but that shows how good they can really act. No one knew at the time what heights Reeves would rise to, but this film definitely begins to show what range he can achieve.If I'd written this comment and voted for it the first or second time I saw it (when it originally came out), it would probably have received a higher vote, but, alas, I have grown and my tastes in comedy have matured (No way, dude!) 6 out of 10 stars!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
111,lagriff05,Funny and original.,7,30 December 2008,"Here's one that most people seem to love unconditionally, and I can see why. It loosely makes fun of movies like Back to the Future and other 80s movies with its silly characters and obsession with rock music, the settings are cool, the plot is...creative, and most of all...THE HISTORICAL FIGURES! Best part of the movie, seriously. All of them were insanely enjoyable (so much that you forget that Bill and Ted themselves are so boring most of the time). Joan of Arc was a cutie, Abe was damn cool, Genghis Khan, Freud, Beethoven, Socrates and Napoleon were all hilarious and the whole package makes for a hilarious joy ride that you will never forget.With that said, most of the writing in this is pretty damn bad, and George Carlin stands out, as much as I hate to say this, as an exceptionally lackluster actor, with his ending monologue being perhaps the most cringe-worthy scene, right next to the beginning of the ""Wild West"" segment for pure inanity.Still, good stuff, very fun and silly.

This is also one of the reasons of why I miss the 80's.Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is pure fun. Bill and Ted need to pass their history exam, and there is more to this movie than one thinks. I will not give anything away, but our two heroes go back and fourth through time in a phone booth which leads to some great fun and a history lesson to all.This is THE fun movie. I have seen this a great many times and still does not get old. This movie is not about acting, it's not about winning awards, it's about fun. One other note is how this movie explains time travel. It's quite ingenious.The Last Word: Excellent! We get a fun movie and a history lesson. You can shut down your brain of keep it on. Either way, you will enjoy this.

113,MichaelMRamey,Excellent Surprise!,7,19 July 2019,"I recently went on a Keanu Reeves marathon so this was one film I know I need to watch and I had low expectations. In fact I was fully expecting to not like it, but this film has a charm to it that is thanks to Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter; this could have easily been a bomb/trash film. I understand now why this stoner comedy is an iconic film and it doesn't hurt that I like time travel films. Usually there are rules in place and consequences if those rules are broken during time travel, but this movie laughs in the face of those films and it's all the better for it. I'm sure this line has been used many times on here, but this film is EXCELLENT!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

115,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,This is a most excellent film.,8,23 June 2012,"Bill & Ted are two likable simpletons whose only mission is to pass history class. Them, combined with the ever-wonderful George Carlin as Rufus, make up the trifecta of tr-awesomeness. All the people they meet throughout history are playful, with Mr. The Kid being my personal favorite. While the phone booth seemed rather stupid to me, it was only one of the criticisms I'll give. I think the best scene is the Waterloo trip, because it was filmed in Phoenix.I'm usually not one for old movies, because movies rarely age like wine.

116,FrankBooth_DeLarge,A fun time,8,24 July 2005,"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is really funny, and it is fun to watch. It doesn't require much thinking to watch this, and that's a good thing. It isn't the greatest movie of all time, but it is very funny, and it never becomes real stupid. This movie follows two teens, Bill & Ted, who have to do a good history project in order to succeed later in life. A man named Rufus(George Carlin) comes to them with a time machine, which is also a phone booth. Bill & Ted go back in time and try to bring some of history's most important people to the future so they can use them in their history project. Not all goes well though, as the historical figures get into some trouble. The humor in this movie is never dumb, it never becomes raunchy, and it always stays funny.This is a great way to pass a couple of hours. It's a very entertaining movie that doesn't have a real complex plot. It's just something you sit back and enjoy. I recommend this movie for just about anyone. It has a pretty wide audience, as it never becomes too inappropriate for kids, teens will probably find the antics to be funny, and adults will probably find something good about it. Watch this movie anytime. While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it's a fun viewing experience.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

I'll tell ya, this is just a laugh a minute, as two unsuccessful musicians Ted 'Theodore' Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) get a visitor from a time traveller named Rufus, played by George Carlin, who tell Bill & Ted that they have to pass their history report in order to save the world. There's a lot of hilarious banter between them and the laughs start when Bill & Ted meet different historic characters, such as Billy The Kid and interact with Napoleon. The part where Napoleon takes over Waterloo Waterslide is the most funniest!

I love it when stories come full circle like that! It also shows that Keanu Reeves could act at some point in his career, even if he seems almost robotic now! There were a couple of deus ex machina moments, like the tape recorder, but...it's a travel travel movie! There's no bigger deus ex machina than a time traveling phone booth! The movie is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a late 80's popcorn flick through and through! It has some foul language from Napoleon, so it's probably considered PG-13 now days. Overall, don't take it as historically accurate in ANY sense! It's a comedy, not a history lesson! Sit back and enjoy!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

I've only seen him in a couple of TV shows, for one episode at a time. I still love him in these movies, though.In closing - gotta love Miss of Arc and ""Bob"" Genghis Khan.

Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan. These two guys are about to flunk history and not graduate from high school, so a real cool dude called Rufus (Carlin)shows up and informs them that the future depends on them to get an A+ on their final exam. It's bursting with awesome time traveling and excellent music. In my opinion this is the best movie of 1989.

For it has been shaped by Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Theodore Logan (Reeves) and they are about to be split up in 1988 due to them failing history. They will not stay together to create The Wyld Stallions and reshape humanity through music. So Rufus (George Carlin) is sent back in time to help the boys out so that they can pass history. It is all based upon a final presentation that they need to ace. Rufus gives them a phone booth that allows them to travel through time to collect important people in history to bring to this presentation.

The chemistry and dialogue between Bill and Ted is the highlight and almost every line is a hit (""Remember when I asked her to the prom?, SHUT UP, TED!""). Most of the effects hold up pretty well and had that 80s shine to it. Even though I knew what was going to happen, the film still kept me on edge and I consider that an acheivement.Some of pacing and humor involving the historical figures haven't held up as well as I had hoped, but the crowd in my cinema elevated my experience (Some guy was shouting out lines and I couldn't help laughing everytime). This film more than anything else just absolutely nails it's concept and is very tight from front to back (more than I can say for a lot of modern blockbusters).This film more than a lot of others holds a sentimental place in my heart.

125,puttputtk,gets more annoying with time,6,16 June 2010,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)5 word summaryFriends travel time for historyTo give the good news first, the film is a fun adventure comedy, unfortunately it is also an annoying adventure comedy as well. When I was younger I remember enjoying this movie and so I watched it again recently and didn't realize how bad it was. With the obvious time travel paradoxes aside, since they come with any time travel movie, the film has just too many problems. Bad acting, that are shared with bad writing to make the acting seem even worse, lame directing and lame attempt to sneak in a history lesson, that I'm guessing is missed by most viewers.It is at times funny, I wont deny that, however the main characters are overwhelmingly annoying that its hard to care about the funniness. One example is how Bill and Ted always speak together, saying the same thing. Here and there would be okay but they really over did it. The film is watchable, you just really have to be in the mood, or have enjoyed it since the 80s. 6/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

No jury would convict me, as long as we kept Gen Xers off the panel.Now I'm sure I would have found this mindless heap of treacle screamingly funny too when I was twelve years old, but I had the misfortune to see it for the first time at age 46 as part of a nostalgia haul my wife brought home from the library. Not a great movie? If it were even *passable*, but it's grainy, often not quite in focus, the dialog pauses between the principals sound so patently like they're reciting painfully memorized lines, the alleged ""cool"" Rufus has about two minutes total screen time, and you'd have to be drunk or stoned to swallow the premise.If you can ignore all of that ... the movie still reeks.Now there were a few amusing lines, the sequence of the historical figures in the shopping mall was genuinely humorous, and the ""oral presentation"" had legit energy, but that's what keeps this flick from getting a rock bottom rating.

This movie is everything a good comedy should be.There were just so many great lines in this movie, I'm laughing as I recall them.  For example, when they meet Socrates in ancient Greece, Ted says ""Philosophize with him dude.""  At which Bill illustrates the rock lyrics ""All we are is dust in the wind, dude."" and illustrates by picking up and blowing away a bit of sand.  From this, Socrates comes up with one of his famous philosophical lines.  The casting was so perfect.  All the historical figures made good caricatures of the real ones as we picture them to have been.  I especially liked Napoleon -- ""the short dead dude from our History class.""  Joan of Arc, ""Miss of Arc"" as the boys refer to her in their presentation, in her few scenes conveys her youth and her fight.  Even as Bill and Ted rescue her from a jail cell, she is praying and says, ""Merci!""  I must admit that Keanu Reeves has never impressed me in any of his subsequent roles, but he made the perfect harebrained teenager.  Maybe he should stick with comedy.  And of course George Carlin, so deadpan in the face of any event.Unless you are a deathly serious person, I recommend this movie for people of all ages.

130,schmimic,Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter star in this classic eighties movie. Whoa!,9,23 April 2005,"Starring: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin Ahhh, what a classic slice of the eighties. Really, cheesy eighties movies don't get any better than this in my opinion. And cheesy this one is. Amazingly so.So, basically, here's the story. Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) are a couple of guys who have the combined intelligence of a jar of peanut butter. They aspire to start a band called Wyld Styllyns despite the fact that they don't even possess the knowledge of how to play their guitars. They talk like a couple of surfers from the late eighties, using intelligent words like ""heinous,"" ""bodacious,"" ""excellent,"" ""bogus,"" and so on. It can get a little bit annoying, but it's not like people didn't use to talk like that (scary, isn't it?).The tagline of the movie is ""History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't even spell."" That hits the nail pretty much right on the head. Theoretically, in the future, the music that Bill and Ted make will bring about a time of galactic peace. It unites the planets and so on and so forth, blah blah blah. But the problem is, the band will never be started if they fail their history class. Because if they fail history, they fail high school, and Ted's dad will send him off to military school in Alaska.Obviously this can't happen, so a man from the future, Rufus (Carlin), is sent back in time to aid Bill and Ted with their final history project. If they get an A+ on that project, then they will pass the class, they pass high school, and the band will be started.So how are they going to pass this history assignment? Simple. Use a time traveling phone booth that Rufus brought with him, kidnap a ton of historical figures and put them all in a big presentation.So the airhead dudes travel through time and kidnap Billy the Kid, Socrates (pronounced so-crates), Sigmund Freud, Joan of Arc, Genghis Kahn, Abraham Lincoln, and Ludwig Von Beethoven (pronounced bee-thuv-en).It really is a weak plot, but it's so imaginative and original and ludicrous that it makes the movie worth watching. Plus the high energy horrible acting of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make it truly hilarious. It's a great flick.The funny thing is, I think the only thing that's changed about Keanu from then to now is that he has shorter hair now. Man still can't act.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (give it a watch)",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

The assignment is pick a historical figure and present what they'd think of San Dimus, CA in 1989. Enter Rufus (George Carlin) from the future who comes back to make sure they pass. Apparently Bill and Ted's music in the future starts world peace and he is there to make sure they stay together.George Carlin gives them his phone booth to go back and time tp pick up various historical figures like: Attila the Hun, Billy the Kid, Joan of Ark, Sigmund Freud, Socrates and Abe Lincoln.

The movie delivers just enough as the main characters rocket back and forth through history while solidly maintaining their surfer-dude personalities. Of course the movie is silly, but it's silly in an endearing way. The characters are extremely likable - sweet, even. The plot - in which Keanue Reeves and Alex Winter kidnap famous historical figures in order to help them create a totally awesome school report - is pleasantly goofy and laced with a number of clever time-travel loops and turns.

Practically everything during that decade was the best including clothes,music,films,life and Miami Vice which has to be the ultimate and defining show that showed us what the 80's actually was. This excellent film from 1989 which stars a young Keanu Reeves. This film is a non-stop entertaining adventure comedy. Bill and Ted are two of the best duos from the 80's along with Crockett & Tubbs. Everything about this film is excellent: the story,the humor,the characters,the special effects and definitely the soundtrack. I've recently purchased this film on DVD whilst I was in England and it was worth the buy and it was a bargain. This is film that can't forgotten. It's such a feel good movie and cheers you up if you feel quite lonely or sad. My favorite songs used in the film are ""Breakaway"" by Big Pig which was used for the opening credits and ""In Time"" by Robbi Robb which was used in two scenes: the scene when they're in the future and the final scene of the film just before the end credits. Rating for this excellent film: 10/10. A film that shows us what comedies where like back then in the 80's. A film that can't be missed out and has to be seen.

(no pun intended.)  13 years later, phrases made famous in this film are still being used today.  The title is often quoted substituting current names.  NO WAY, be excellent to each other, all we are is dust in the wind, and party on dudes, are some of the catchy sayings from that film.   Bill and Ted must time travel to the past and learn about history so they can pass their final exam.  In the process, they bring back the actual characters from the past to present day California.  Characters such as Socrates, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln are suddenly walking around shopping malls and bowling alleys.  What makes this funny is that Bill and Ted are a couple of goof balls when it comes to school.   Ted, (Keanu Reeves), cannot even pronounce the names of these characters correctly. The film is extremely funny and both Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are actually believable doing their goof ball routine.  I only wish the film could have devoted a little more time to the historical characters wandering around in present day California.  The film portrays that laid back suburban airhead stereotype pretty well when the historical characters introduce themselves to the locals.  At one point, Bill's mom, when introduced to the likes of Socrates and Abraham Lincoln, says `nice to meet you;' as if they were just other ordinary people.   The bottom line, if you like history, you will love this movie.

Putting off watching it for over a month, I finally found the time to sit down and press play. Strangely (and almost instantly), I was totally hooked on something I imagined I'd never like...Bill and Ted are two dudes in 1988. Hoping to form their own band one day, they spend endless hours practising in their garage even though they have no idea how to even play the guitar! Also, they're both flunking History and unless they can get an A+ in their next history report, Ted's dad is sending him off to military school! They've got to figure something out, and fast! Along comes Rufus, an ""awesome dude"" from the future who has been sent to make sure they pass their report with flying colours... using a time machine! So, Bill and Ted set off on one heck of an adventure through time, picking up a variety of characters from the different ages of the universe, including Billy the Kid, Joan of Arc and Beethoven himself!

Sure, the plot's a little crazy and thin, but it's a fun movie aimed at doing one thing: To Entertain.There's no use in taking this movie too seriously or you won't enjoy it at all.

143,gpknopp,George Carlin Smirks,7,15 September 2016,"I just watched this movie with my 7-year old daughter and she liked it. The only weird part was with the step-mom. But she didn't get it, so that was just me. It's a good-hearted goofy comedy with some inventive bits, and has some memorable lines. And lots of people seem to like young Keanu. So there you go. If you haven't seen it, watch it. This is one of the most ridiculous movies out there of it's kind. The humor is pretty over-the-top campy, and recognizes California suburban life having been made fun of for quite a while already, so nothing really new there. This movie makes the 80s look quaint, in spite of the garish fashions. But what's more, this movie is probably one of the more accurate science fiction movies out there, with some reliable insights into time travel. And, when they go get Joan d'Arc or Socrates, or Genghis Khan, these characters don't speak English. I mean why would they? I mean, how many high production value science fiction movies have screwed issue this up? If you don't see the humor in that, you are too stiff for this movie. And I was serious too, far higher production value science fiction movies have been less substantial when it comes to the ideas department. And I really enjoyed George Carlin's performance, who seems to be having fun in this ridiculous movie, as he smirks his lines, if that's possible. It's got pretty good pacing so I didn't get too bored, and the Napoleon at the water park bit is kind of classic. I guess the phone booth time machine is a nod to Doctor Who. Last comment, the image of them all stuck in the phone booth sideways, with Socrates screaming in the background, has stuck with me now since 1989. Good fun.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
144,si4abetterworld,Bill & Ted are Taoist sages travelling through time?,9,6 February 2010,"A fun, feel-good romp through modern Californian life and world history, with Keanu Reeves.I love how, unlike in most U.S. films, the heroes resolve problems in generally non-violent ways. Thus, I think it is quite a healthy film for children and teenagers to see.By the way, some may call the heroes in this film ""unintelligent"", but I disagree. I mean, they may not have much education, but they do manage to overcome much adversity and solve serious problems (in generally non-violent means), which shows intelligence. They also are quite good-natured - which I would say is infinitely more important and praiseworthy than book-knowledge.Perhaps the word ""wisdom"" is appropriate here. Like Taoist sages, Bill and Ted may not appear wise to those who think along conventional lines and don't go deeply into matters - but their good-naturedness and the way they succeed show them to be wise.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

146,CatastropheCatCat,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is an excellent movie!,10,15 April 2018,"I must say that I enjoyed this show very much. I never got bored during 1 and half hour, and this is very rare for me not to get bored even for one second during a movie. This is not because I like Ted & Bill or anything in the show, this is because the movie keeps itself alive and brings something new at every scene. I also must say that I like Bill & Ted, and Keanu Reeves played really well that I did not even recognize that he was Keanu Reeves. The scenerio also makes a lot of sense and its storyline is very coherent. One more thing I love about this movie is that it gives two great messages: Be excellent to each other and party on! The movie is very enlightened in this manner. It made me laugh without sexist, racist or mean jokes. The movie itself is very funny, fresh and cheering! Go watch it and have fun.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
147,isbabo,Excellent,10,13 March 2005,"Okay, The acting is pretty sub par (although Keanu Reeves gives far and away his best performance, and the performance he has repeated in Speed, the Matrix etc.) However, if you like 80's films, you'll love this film. It is a teen flick, but unlike the teen films today, this one doesn't have to resort to poop jokes (Like American Pie) to be funny. In fact some of the jokes are borderline intelligent (like when Bill is talking to Sigmund Freud and say's ""no thanks, I just have a minor edible complex). It's funny, it's cheezy and if you have any sense of humour and appreciation for the 1980's you'll love it. Especially when Henry VIII orders them put in the Iron Maiden. ""Iron Maiden....

148,davidgkimberley,A most bodacious film!,8,27 December 2011,"I find that IMDb's scores out of 10 are usually reasonably sensible and accurate, however, for Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure I couldn't understand why it was so low! The film starts with Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) on the verge of failure in their history class and flunking out of school. Ted will be forced to go to military school if they do fail and the only thing that can save them is the deliverance of a most bodacious history project the following day. In the midst of their hurried studying a strange, cool looking dude called Rufus gives them a time machine, in the shape of a 1960s phonebox, and tells them to use it to travel back in time and gather various historical figures in order to complete their project for the next day. What ensues is a film of pure wonder and joy. Various historical characters such as Socrates (or so-crates), Joan of Arc and Genghis Kahn are picked up along the way and throughout the film Reeves and Winter are superb in their enthusiastic portrayal of the very teenage, very boneheaded Bill and Ted. A lot of people seem to damn this film for not being funny but I found it hilarious. There aren't any cheap or childish jokes, in fact quite of a lot of it is extremely well written and very witty.Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, the writers of the film, have said that the characters of Bill and Ted came from an idiolised version of their friendship, Chris and Ed = Bill and Ted. Given this you shouldn't go into the film expecting cinematic brilliance but rather a lot of fun, some good laughs and both a mocking and realisation of teenage dreams. Don't expect to have your heart strings pulled,your rage barrier smashed or you're life changed; just let yourself be taken on a most excellent, most bodacious and most unprecedented adventure and have fun!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
149,jim4551,Delightfully Dumb,10,2 May 2012,"When I first got the idea to see this movie was when I caught the end of it on Comedy Central. Which gave me doubts about the quality of the show. But, It turned out to be much better than excepted. I enjoy the over-the- top dumbness that this movie had to offer. One example is how Bill and Ted talk. They talk just like regular slackers. I also enjoy how they have Joan Of Arc be the leader of a exercise group. Another thing is the friendship that they share is perfectly done and the jokes were hilarious. It was funny that George Carlin,a man known for being a cussing comedian, stayed very quiet. And anyways overall the movie was ""Excellent"" and it even got me hooked on the animated series that you can find on hulu.com Well, Be excellent to each other and party on Dudes.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

It was a big disappointment for us until my mom tracked down another used VHS copy. Anyway it is still a part of my collection and Bill and Ted always make me smile and laugh.

151,gah015,"Everything's bigger yet smaller, it's all these computers...San Dimas high school football RULES!!!",7,7 March 2010,"Here they are, in their 1988 World Tour! So-Crates Johnson, Bob Genghis Khan, Dave Beeth-oven, Maxine of Arc, Herman the Kid, Dennis Fro-eud, and...Abraham Lincoln.Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is lighthearted good fun from the late 80s that despite the fashions and music, hasn't seemed to date itself too much to younger generations that weren't even alive in the 80s. A decade before Keanu Reeves stared in The Matrix, and before he was the FBI agent assigned to bank robbery in the early 90s flick Point Break, he did this film and this is the role I always associate him with, no matter how many more movies he does. The stars of the film are two seemingly brainless but well intentioned high school slackers, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (the aforementioned Keanu Reeves) that dream of making it big with their garage band ""Wyld Stallions"". One day, they will open for Iron Maiden and perhaps even get Eddie Van Halen on guitars, perhaps one day. But they are in danger of being split up for good if they don't pass their history report. They study but just seem too moronic to hold much information in their heads.Help arrives from the 27th century from a guy named Rufus, a man who comes down in a telephone booth (Dr. Who reference?) and greats the two friends in front of a Circle K, providing yet another great quote, ""strange things are afoot at the Circle K"". Rufus explains that the two must absolutely pass their history report and he gives the guys their own time traveling phone booth where they travel the ages and pick up various people of historical importance. Pay no attention to the accuracy of how these historical figures are represented, this film is not to be taken seriously and anyone who nitpicks how Abraham Lincoln or Ghenghis Khan was shown needs not be so wound up. Get a hobby. The fact that they went to the detail of having Socrates and Napolean not understand English was more then enough historical accuracy for me. The guys eventually meet themselves both at the start of the film and then later as the journey progresses. The fun really begins when they dump all the people they picked up in a late 80s shopping mall. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that the guys do pass their report, it has to be seen exactly how they do this for it likely is the most original history report ever conceived. This is not a great film but it is fun. And yes I know my title quote was not spoken by either Bill or Ted, but rather by the jock giving his presentation to the class. I loved his speech because it seemed so authentic and real to what a guy like him would say if he were trapped for words during an oral report. Plus it was great to see the rest of Bill and Ted's school, and makes you realize how much more likable our heroes are. 7/10.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

Something that I have always loved about this movie was its simplicity yet imaginative story, even if for most, the story might be dumb I can guarantee you that you will end up having a good time.

However this is hard to believe because we saw them in a previous scene talking to their future selves. The film starts to come up with some real insight near the end when they have gathered all of the historical figures for their presentation.

158,jbeartist,Possibly the greatest film ever made... please read,10,15 August 2015,"For many years I have held that Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is possibly the greatest film ever made. A massive claim I'll grant you, but I have sound reasons for making it. Isn't it fair to say that a great work of art should teach us something about the human condition? Is it not also the case that great film should entertain and enlighten? In these times in which we live, when religion is used to vindicate horrific inhuman acts or finds itself being left by the wayside as logic and science march forward with greater and greater strides, it's a comfort to see that a simple tenet can revive one's faith in the human spirit. With Bill and Ted there is no race issue, no religious overtone, no profit from moralisation. There is a love of life, wonder for the wondrous, simplicity in all things. Yes the story is ridiculously far-fetched (chewed gum would never hold the aerial of a time machine together like that) but it is engaging, lovable, silly and FUN. The performances are superb throughout. The cast, from the amazing Deacon to the incredible Missy, are loving every minute of it. George Carlin is great as Rufus (he knows what he's talking about) and demonstrates acting akin to Olivier's Hamlet. It's stunning. It has everything... history, truth, corn dogs, gnarly old goat dudes and babes. Then there's Alex and Keanu... what more needs to be said? The two 'great ones' on which this film and the alignment of the planets rests. I have been calling everyone a dude since 1989! The story, the idea, the joyous silliness, the observation... and the undeniable truth that there is no greater rule to follow than to ""be excellent to each other... and party on dudes!"" Seriously, there is nothing else. I mean that. I'd rather follow that credo than any other set of rules that might exist. I'm sure George Carlin would have agreed. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour and check out the greatest film of all time, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.So crates... watch your robes dude.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

In my opinion, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure encapsulates all of the wonderful light-heartedness that we all should have had in high school.

A film about two boys who fail school that get a time machine sounds pretty unique, but when you watch it, you get to see how fun it is. The script is well done, the action scenes are put together well, and the music is well done! One of my favorite parts in the film were the different scenes that go on at once. After Bill and Ted left Austria, accidentally taking Napoleon Bonaparte with them, Ted asks his younger brother to watch him. So we see Bill & Ted going back into time capturing historical figures, while Napoleon is exploring the world of San Dimas in the 1980's.

Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are cast perfectly as Bill and Ted, two high school seniors nearing graduation who discover that they are ""in danger of flunking most heinously"" when their history teacher informs them that Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife and Caesar is not the salad dressing dude.  They then meet a most non-heinous dude named Rufus, who drops from a phone booth into the parking lot of the Circle-K convenience store.  Strange things are most certainly afoot at the Circle-K when Rufus informs them that the entire fate of the world depends on them getting an A on their final history report.  Then from the phone booth step two very familiar people.  Bill and Ted meet future thems who inform them of the most excellent adventures they are in for.  Most Excellent!!  George Carlin as Rufus leads an excellent supporting cast in this most atypical movie.  I would most certainly recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh or just wants to see a most non-heinous movie.  If you haven't seen it, RENT IT NOW!!!  ""Be Excellent to Each Other.

When you include a phone booth time machine and some of history's greatest people you've got one of the most original movies I have ever seen. Besides being original, this movie was actually very funny! Most movies today have to use vulgar humor and people insulting eachother non-stop (ie. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) because that is what they must think people want. Personally I would take watching Genghis Kahn destroying a sporting goods store over any of that crap in a second. Besides Genghis Kahn this movie has other greats such as Socrates (So crates), Joan of Arc, Abraham Lincoln, and many more! The reason this movie is so good is because they actually thought about the humor and figured out something that anyone who knows anything about history could appreciate.

They are aided by Rufus, who supplies them with their time-travelling phone box, (reference to Doctor Who anyone?), and watches over them to make sure they don't screw it up. It is almost impossible not to enjoy this movie. Bill and Ted are simple guys whose only main concern is when Megadeth's next album is coming out, who are suddenly pushed into a position of great importance.

The movie is filled to the brim with memorable quotes and scenes, such as Genghis Khan running amok at the mall and Bill and Ted's implausible (yet totally logical!) escape from jail.

I've always loved the idea of creating supernatural comedies with characters who don't deserve or belong in the supernatural realm. This movie exemplifies that perfectly. Two underachieving slackers are given a time machine with the purpose of passing a history report? That's comedy gold. And then add the fact that they don't have very unique speech patterns that makes them truly memorable. Are they dated? Sure...but people love nostalgia and by definition nostalgia is dated.I also think this movie launched Keanu Reeves career, but it unfortunately launched his career as a bad actor, which he so clearly is not. Perhaps he got type-casted for a while, but this is one of his stand out performances...I'm not saying that to make fun of him, I'm saying it as someone who truly loves these characters. And of course Alex Morgan is fantastic in his role as well. And so is George Carlin.In summary, this film is perhaps rated lower than it should be because too many people think film should be art and a movie about time travelling high schoolers who talk like stoners sounds like a ridiculous premise. And it is, but it works on every level.9/10",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

181,KSUFootball900,Excellent,10,14 December 2005,"This movie was the most triumphant cinematic achievements of the late 80's. Everyone who rated this low is completely heinous and have a bogus sense of humor. OK so it wasn't ingenious, but it was one of the funniest movies ever. They took an extremely widespread ""dude"" personality that had the crap beat out of it in the 80's, and made a comedy that, while using this attitude, was very smart and extremely funny. This movie was also enhanced by the blatant historical stereotypes that were so completely bogus that you had to laugh. I laugh at this triumphant show every time that I watch it.

(no, not excellent) GREAT!",10,10 October 2000,"Back when I saw this movie I had an awakening: this movie has virtually no (then) known actors and had the best theme I think I had ever seen in a comedy.  Forget the other ""valley guy"" movies.  This is what you need to see and it's really not about the ""valley guy"" lifestyle.  This is a flat-out knee slapper for persons with a sick sense of humor.  Not toilet sick, just plain mischievious sick.  Anyhow, the plot is wildly original and the film makers pull it off without a hitch.  My only complaint?  It's not coming to DVD anytime soon.

They were keen to watch a movie before going to bed, but I didn't have anything else appropriate for them to watch (at least that they hadn't already seen) so I suggested we watch this. To be honest, they weren't all that keen initially, but once the movie got going, they really got into it. Best thing about this movie, apart from being totally awesome and ridiculously funny, is that it has a really positive message: ""Be excellent to everybody"" and ""Part on, Dudes!"" But honestly, my kids really enjoyed the movie, and I had the chance to relive my own enjoyment of Bill and Ted through their eyes. Tomorrow night: Bogus Journey time!

185,djdiabolikal,This movie had huge societital influence.,9,29 November 2007,"Any younger person who did't grow up in the late 80's early 90's probably does't realize how this movie effected society as a whole. Whether you loved this movie, hated it, or never even saw it when it came out, there is no denying what it did, especially to advertising. There wasn't a commercial geared toward teens from 1989 till probably 1995 that didn't have a couple or morons talking like Bill & Ted. I can't think of another movie that had such an effect as Bill & Ted's did. Another example of how it became part of social thought, is how many movies or TV shows have you seen spoof the whole ""San Demus High School Football rules!"" quote have you seen, there are easily dozens. This movie rightfully gets a lot of praise for the fact that it had a moral, and actually taught kids some things about history, my hope is that history looks at this movie as it was; a movie that was goofy on purpose, showed great friendship between two people, taught us a little about history, and change the landscape of pop culture for almost 10 years (something I don't think many movies have done, especially any teen comedies).",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

I just watched it again and noticed I was smiling through the whole movie and ended up dancing in front of my kids during the credits! It is so imaginative, and the ensemble acting whenever all of the historical figures are together is hilarious. Top notch comedy filmmaking. And the presentation at the end is just marvelous.

This movie was before my generation and I had heard how it was a classic and I must see it. Now that I have I don't see how anyone who doesn't have an emotional connection with it from when it was released thinks this is in anyway a smart, funny movie. While obviously for these movies you need to suspend reality to enjoy it, this is just downright ridiculous and the storyline is almost non existent other than an excuse to pick some famous historical figures and merge them in the modern world. The collection appears to be random and the majority of their portrayals are just stereotypes. In particular the use of Napoleon was absurd and the lack of amazement at the new world was in the back of my mind the whole time. I love ridiculous movies but this one just felt like a stoner comedy with hardly any jokes and just lazy humor. I was incredibly disappointed in this movie. As I said, if this came out when I was a teenager then I may have connected to it and found it charming. However as someone who is watching for the first time, it hasn't aged well and I would be surprised if many others felt the same way.

196,alexdemichele,"A movie that sneaked into my ""top 10""",10,12 May 2016,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a cult movie, receiving relatively low scores on this site, among others; however, its impact on film history is rather substantial, ushering in a new genre of ""Dude Comedy"" and inspiring films such as ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""Wayne's World.""The movie features amateur actors, Alex Winter (as Bill S. Preston, Esquire) and Keanu Reeves (as Ted ""Theodore"" Logan). The acting of our lead characters may not be phenomenal, but the focus is on their journey. Following through several points in history, Bill and Ted collect historical figures such as Socrates, Billy the Kid, and Abraham Lincoln, all in order to get an ""A"" on their history project and prevent Ted from being sent away to military school. This of course leads to a wonderful finale in which each of the carefully picked figures presents something about their time period in history, and saves the day for our heroes.All the while, this film is of course riddled with late 1980's fashion, music, and surfer slang. The most prominent in this film, though, would have to be the slang. Bill and Ted go back and forth throughout the movie saying lovable and memorable phrases such as ""most excellent!"" ""bodacious!"" and ""be excellent to each other, dudes.""This film is one of the greats not only because of its influence on other films and creating two new stars in Alex Winter (now a director) and Keanu Reeves, but Bill and Ted is a family-friendly comedy anyone of any age can enjoy. Simply amazing!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
197,ristermogers,"A Fun, Cartoony and Radical Ride!",7,31 March 2019,Bill and Ted is a movie that lives entirely within its own world. The laws of time travel don't matter and are shrugged off. Somehow all the historical figures understand modern English. But despite all of this the movies madcap humor and big heart shine through. The chemistry between Reeves and Winter feels like a real friendship. The comedy is pretty great and the score is actually pretty sweet. I would very much recommend it! Decent 7 out of 10.,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

I waited a couple of years, saw it again, and then I took a liking to it.  I bought it for myself recently after I rented it again, because I decided that this movie was so trippy and out there, I just had to have it.  Keanu Reeves as Ted ""Theodore"" Logan and Alex Winter as Bill S. Preston, Esquire play the perfect teenage duo.  They have good intentions, but they don't know how to use them right.  So they get a little bit of guidance from their futuristic friend.  I give this movie a 10/10 for Bill and Ted's lines alone.  It's funny, has morals (to a point..), and it gives someone laughter when they are feeling down.  I can watch this movie until the tape melts..

The funniest scenes are when they are in the mall and getting into all sorts of trouble.The music is also ideal in epitomising this 80's style.

So, Rufus, some dude from the future, has been sent back 700 years (to 1988) to aid them in passing their history report, through the use of a time machine.If you like 80's rock bands, this is a film for you, as plenty are mentioned (with a rather excellent jam from Joe Satriani at the end of the film), with Iron Maiden and Van Halen to name a few I give it ****/*****^_^",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

Much like with Sharkboy and Lavagirl, commenting to my co-viewers on how bad the current scene was became itself tedious and old, forcing me to instead ride along with the ""plot"" and humor several bars lower than the lowest common denominator.

First of all they did not film any parts at the actual San Dimas Circle K. Secondly, the Circle K in San Dimas is and always has been on the corner of Walnut and Bonita...not Arrow Highway. Interestingly enough, the San Dimas Circle K did look very similar to the one in the movie before it was remodeled and many of my friends believed it was the one from the movie, but I could tell by the layout of the parking lot and nearby streets it was not.I grew up in San Dimas and was about 11 years old when this movie came out. I lived just behind that Circle K on Balboa Ct. I used to ride my bike there nearly every day and night with my best friend. My older sisters were attending San Dimas high when this movie was being filmed and their principal told them that she refused to allow filming there and that is why they went to Arizona to film.We were all sad that they used our city name, but didn't film anything there. The funny thing is they really did base the places on San Dimas...we have Raging Waters, they called it Waterloo.

Not only is the acting so bad the storyline is so appalling. Most films like this i try to go along with the corny and silly nature of them but i couldn't squeeze an ounce of fun out of this film. The script sounds like it was written either by a stoner or someone on the verge of becoming a vegetable and Keanu Reeves previously mentioned awful acting was excruciating and was probably on par with an enthusiastic actor in a school production. The only good part of the film that i got a laugh out of was Napoleon, who is played very well with the good comic timing and genuine humor that was missing for most of this film.btw i was forced to watch this in a high school history lesson so i am genuinely sorry if i am shitting on one of your favorite childhood movies",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure

They have a chance to change their future (george Carlin - I adore him) And the whole film is accompanied by travel and fun, as well as good music.",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
228,irockudnt94,bodacious dude!,8,28 May 2006,"this movie is totally bodacious dude! this movie is funny, wacky, and altogether a great movie! full of laughs from start to end. this movie is a head of it's time. this shows that the ultimate garage band is more than you would expect. I recommend it for older audiences because of mild language and some adult humor that children might not get. bill and Ted give you a great look at world history while studying for exams. they save the universe and have a good time. this movie features characters like napoleon, Joan of arc, Attila the Hun, billy the kid and more! buy it on DVD, VHS or rent it and go along for the ride yourself, you won't regret it!",Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
