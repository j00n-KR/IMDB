0,Leofwine_draca,Shamefully bad,3,20 February 2018,"TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES is a shamefully bad Hollywood comic book blockbuster produced by Michael Bay, who really should know better. I'm a fan of the 1980s TV series but this is nothing like that show and instead an example of the usual soulless, mindless, unoriginal trash currently filling cinemas. Gone has the look, warmth, and humour of the turtles themselves, to be replaced by motion captured CGI hulks who make incessant and deeply unfunny one-liner jokes whenever they're on screen. Watching their supposed 'camaraderie' is an embarrassment and don't get me started on the voice acting. Megan Fox shows up to remind you why she's never had a 'proper' Hollywood career while others like William Fichtner should really know better. As with all films like this, things start off slow but by the end it's turned into one giant, aimless, generic-feeling CGI action set-piece spectacular that just goes on and on and on.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
1,SnoopyStyle,not horrible but not actually good either,6,20 January 2015,"An evil criminal group called the Foot Clan led by Shredder is stealing a load of chemicals from the docks. Intrepid cub reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is trying to do some real news for once. She stumbles onto the crime which gets foiled by a mysterious vigilante. She has no proof and nobody at her local TV station believes her. Shredder tries to flush out the vigilante by taking hostages. April is once again on the scene. This time, she discovers the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. She figures out that Eric Sacks (William Fichtner) and her father had injected a mutagen into her childhood pet turtles. Splinter the rat also from the lab is their master. TV station manager fires her for her crazy ranting. Her cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) tries to help.Megan Fox is a pretty stiff actress. She has improved slightly over the years but I wouldn't proclaim her to be actually good. I find her face to be too immobile. Will Arnett has a couple of jokes. The comedy is a small step above the bad jokes in Transformers. The turtles are fine although they need some scenes to introduce their relationships and individuality. They should have a couple of scenes where they stop, eat pizza and joke around. Those are great to inject humor and build chemistry. I really like the elevator. The movie needs to sit them down and let them have some fun. In the end, this movie is overloaded with action which gets to be a bit mind numbing.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
2,Horst_In_Translation,Felt very uncreative to me,4,24 September 2016,"Hands down, even many decades after their creation, everybody still knows and somewhat appreciates the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". That's why many, especially the fans I guess, must have been curious when they heard that the franchise is going to be rebooted in live action with a 2014 release. And this first film must have been successful enough as a sequel was greenlighted not much later. But in terms of quality, it is really far from enough unfortunately. The fact that I did not like the looks of the Turtles that much is purely subjective I guess, but the story just felt so generic, predictable and there is absolutely nothing individual to it I must say. And is this really a Turtles film? I must say I felt that it was really more ""April O'Neil: The Movie"". The reason for that may have been that they got Megan Fox to play the character and she is still quite a huge star, so probably demanded lots of screen time and a plot that revolves around her in order to say yes to this franchise. But apart from the fact that Fox is not a very talented actress, the story about her character also isn't effective at all. The plot about her dead father and with Fichtner's character responsible for the death feels so predictable and desperate to evoke emotions that it's almost cringeworthy. I think Fichtner is a fairly solid villain actor, even if he occasionally feels like a poor man's Christopher Walken, but he is still one of the better things about the film, even if he has very little to work with here. It is all about putting Fox in the spotlight, never about a good story.Now about the Turtles: I think that neither they, nor Splinter and especially not Shredder fulfilled the great potential they had in terms of filmmaking perspective. Of course, it is quite a difficult challenge to construct a film about a life-sized rat and four life-sized turtles (especially with the joking around) as you have to give it the comedic approach at times. But here it did not ring true for the most part. The balance between comedy and moments in which the film takes itself so seriously went pretty wrong most of the time. It is very shocking to see so many writers busy with the script here and the result is such a very weak outcome. About Will Arnett (""Arrested Development""), who is basically included for the human comic relief, the film intensified my opinion about him as an actor. His comedy can work in the right context and setting and some of his jokes work too, but most of the time you can feel the writers' desperate attempt at going for some cheap laughter. But what distracted me the most about him is the make-up and how they tried so hard to make him look 10 years younger than he actually is, so that we can accept him as a love interest for Fox' character. It's just another from a long list of oddities (in a negative sense) when it comes to this film. I saw the sequel received slightly better rating and reviews, but after seeing this one, I must say I have very little interest to check out movie number two. The Turtles are a great challenge from a cinematic perspective, no doubt about it, and the people who made this movie here weren't up to it. I give these 100 minutes a thumbs-down. The title characters deserve much better. Not recommended.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
3,Prismark10,Hero Turtles,5,27 July 2016,"Micheal Bay produced the TMNT franchise with updated CGI and a more Transformers like action sequences with a heavy dose of cheesiness.Reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) discovers the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were her childhood pets that had been injected with a mutagent by a corporation run by her late father and his partner Eric Sacks (William Fichtner.) Her cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) tries to help her out while everyone thinks she is crazy about her rantings of vigilante turtles. Meanwhile a criminal gang led by Shredder plan to unleash a virus throughout the city.The film is entertaining for kids and is undemanding fun. There are explosions, dramatic and over the top action sequences, plenty of quips, a comedy sidekick in Will Arnett. The film avoids the flabbiness that marred the Transformer sequels and like a McDonalds cheeseburger, it fills you up in the short term and would soon be quickly forgotten. Still nothing wrong with a bit of mindless diet of junk every now and then.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
4,nogodnomasters,Be one with the blade,10,17 January 2018,"This is a film I had put off watching for two reasons. The first was that I didn't grow up this this series. While I was familiar with it, I wasn't a fan. The second reason was because I couldn't stand the last film and feared I was going to watch a sequel being lost from the beginning. I discovered my fears were unfounded as this story starts from the beginning with an updated mildly hip-hop version of the series.Meagan Fox stars as April O'Neill, the froth reporter who has ties to the group. She is aided by her ""nerd"" camera man (Will Arnett) who wants to have ties to her, The Turtles are up against the Shredder, an evil Samurai robot who leads the Foot Clan intent on taking over NYC.This is a fun predictable action popcorn film. It is not on the Avenger level of films (what is?) but one the kids can enjoy without thinking too much.Guide: Cartoon style violence. ""Sh**, Damn, hell""",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
5,kosmasp,Enjoyable guilty pleasure,7,12 April 2015,"That is if you don't get your childhood dreams crushed of course. And I say crushed, because if you say this ""killed"" your childhood ... well I think it would be a poor choice of words. Though I get the sentiment and the anger if one doesn't like someone tempering with their memories (especially the good one). But still this is just a movie and even if you liked the TMNT as a kid, be aware that this will not be your childhood ""heroes"" coming alive again.Megan Fox plays a reporter/character, that seems very close to her own celebrity personality. Must have been fun for her to play the whole ""no one takes me seriously in the job that I'm doing""-act. It also shows, that she's not afraid to make fun of that herself. The self-awareness is extremely high. On the other hand you have Will Arnett, a gifted comedian who seems to have the best job ever ... at least in this movie. The effects are pretty good too, which can make this a guilty pleasure, if you let it ...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
6,classicsoncall,"""Please keep your arms and legs inside the shell at all times.""",6,21 February 2017,"I never became a Ninja Turtle fan when they made their debut in the mid-Eighties as comic book heroes from Mirage Studios. Like any fad that catches on, they spawned a whole raft of toys, books, costumes, cartoons and movies. I've never seen any of the films until now, and basically as a treat for my eight year old granddaughter. She got the biggest kick out of this flick, but most of my enjoyment came from watching her eat it all up. For me, this wasn't much more than an animated cartoon set to live action, with as much over the top serio-comic action as could be packed into an hour and a half run time. One tip for the film makers - how about introducing your principal characters instead of making us try to figure out who's who. I know Raphael wore the red and Donatello the blue, but Michelangelo and Leonardo were a toss-up for the orange and purple. One interesting concept though as it relates to fine dining - I sure would like to try one of those ninety nine cheese pizzas. Cowabunga!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
7,jboothmillard,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,4,17 June 2020,"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles (UK title) was one of my favourite cartoons when I was a kid, I'd seen the not particularly good 1990 live-action men-in-suit version, and the terrible 2007 computer-animated movie, this was the third big screen attempt to bring us the heroes in a half shell, directed by Razzie nominated Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Battle Los Angeles, Wrath of the Titans). Basically, in New York City, April O'Neil (Razzie winning Megan Fox) is a reporter for Channel 6 Eyewitness News, investigating the crimes of a group of criminals called the Foot Clan. She tracks to them to a dock at night, where they are raiding cargo containers. They are stopped by an unseen vigilante; April only finds a symbol left behind. April's supervisor Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg) and her co-workers are oblivious to her story. April covers a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, there she expresses gratitude to the company's CEO Eric Sacks (William Fichtner), who was her late father's lab partner. The Foot Clan's leader Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) is frustrated by the vigilante, and orders his men to draw them out, taking hostages at a subway station. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. The Clan are taken out and the hostages are freed by four mysterious figures. April follows them to a rooftop and is shocked to see that the vigilantes are mutated anthropomorphic turtles. After fainting, she regains consciousness and they suggest she does not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears the names Raphael and Leonardo. April returns to her apartment and remembers ""Project Renaissance"", her father's science experiment, which involved four turtles and rat called Splinter. April realises that the turtles: Leonardo (Pete Ploszek, voiced by Johnny Knoxville), Donatello (Jeremy Howard), Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and Raphael (Alan Ritchson) are the mutated vigilantes. But she is unable to convince Bernadette and she is fired. Her co-worker Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) drives her to meet Sacks at his estate to tell him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought to be lost following the fire that killed her father. The Turtles' leader, mutated rat Splinter (Danny Woodburn, voiced by Tony Shalhoub), tells them to bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, and finding a book on Ninjutsu, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, fighting skills. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks turned on her father and killed him. Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, Splinter is defeated, Raphael is incapacitated, and the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, the Turtles' blood is drained to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks plans to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group escape the compound and pursue Sacks. On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus and Sacks prepares the mutagen blood to create a healing serum. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles battle Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the support beams of the tower collapse. The turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, while April confronts Shredder. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it, while Shredder falls to the ground and is captured by the police. The Turtles, believing they will die, confess a few secrets, and Raphael admits his love for his brothers, but they all land harmlessly onto the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they help Splinter to recover. Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified ""Turtle Van"", which accidentally blows up Vern's new car. Before leaving, Mikey tries to serenade April with the song ""Happy Together"" by the band The Turtles, which annoys his brothers but amuses April. Also starring Abby Elliott as Taylor, K. Todd Freeman as Dr. Baxter Stockman and, Paul Fitzgerald as Dr. O'Neil. Fox is okay as the plucky reporter, Arnett is alright, Fichtner is reasonable as the villain, and the actors playing the Turtles are fine. I will admit I can see why it got negative reviews, it is a little bloated and overworked, but a little pop culture stuff, cartoon-style humour and fast-paced chase and fight sequences are well done, especially with the splendid special effects, a reasonable part-animated fantasy action. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
8,paul_haakonsen,"Technically, they are still mutated turtles...",6,20 November 2016,"I wasn't particularly thrilled about this movie when it was initially released, especially since I didn't really see any greater need for why this franchise needed to be rebooted again.However, it turned out that this 2014 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was a rather enjoyable movie after all. And that was even with Megan Fox on the cast list, so that is some accomplishment in itself.Personally, it took me some time to get accustomed to the new appearance of Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Donatello. The turtles in this 2014 movie had taken on a somewhat very radical appearance compared to what we had seen in the previous older movies and in the animated series. But it will grow on you - as I guess mutations are in a habit of doing.And while this is, yet, another Hollywood reboot, then the movie actually turned out to be entertaining enough and adequate. I must admit that I am not really keen on reboots and remakes, it just oozes of a lack of creativity.The story in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is one that takes the turtle heroes from the sewers and up to the surface world, introducing the turtles to the world for the first time (well, not really, but just play along with this reboot, eh?).The cast was alright, although I can't claim to be much of a fan of Megan Fox, and it is obvious that she is in this movie for one reason only, and you know it. It was, however, nice to see Will Arnett here.""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" had some impressive CGI effects, which really carried the movie a long way. A movie such as this would naturally require superb special effects, and the special effects team had it covered nicely.There is a lot of action in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", which also adds flavor to the movie. And it is all spiced up with the traditional witty comments and dialogue that we know from the older movies and animated series.So strap yourself in and prepare for an action-packed ride. Whether you ride it out on your seat or on a shell is entirely up to you.""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" scores a rating of six stars out of ten from me.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
9,tavm,This version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was okay at best,6,14 August 2014,"As someone who's heard of these characters but until now hadn't seen any of their adventures in their entirety, I kept an open mind about what I was about to see with my movie theatre-working friend. Verdict: I liked the action but found most of the humor pretty lame though I was a amused a little by the ending scenes. My friend liked it throughout-he clapped many times during the action scenes. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was wasted in her bossy role but then anyone who portrayed her would probably not have done any better. Megan Fox wasn't too bad playing reporter April O'Neil and Will Arnett was okay as her reluctant sidekick. And since this was just a little over 90 minutes, this wasn't a bad time-waster...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
10,LeonLouisRicci,Bouncy Family Friendly Fun,7,5 March 2015,"A Whole Bunch of a Good Time is This Reboot. A Family Friendly Action Movie that Retains Most of the Characters Charm and has Mainstream Appeal. The Original Comic by Eastman and Laird was a Dark, Independent, Comic-Book Spoof in Black and White.But Since that Indie-Comic Book Hit the Turtles have Gone Through a Lot. A Tamer Comic Book Series, Three Initial Movies (the first one is quite good) and an Animated Series that Lasted Ten Years Containing 190 Episodes.

11,utgard14,Turtle Droppings,2,22 November 2014,"What a stinker! These Turtles are big gross slimy steroid freaks. They may crack wise and talk about pizza to appeal to fans but they're lifeless and empty shells of previous representations of the characters. Abby Elliott is wasted in a bit part as Megan Fox's roommate. She would have been a better choice for April O'Neil than the Botoxed and colorless Fox. The script isn't great but some of the material could have worked better had they cast an actress with the slightest bit of talent. But no, instead we get this vapid woman who should have faded into obscurity years ago. What the hell was Will Arnett doing in this? Oh and did anyone doubt when you first see William Fichtner that he would turn out to be a bad guy? If your answer is yes, congratulations on seeing your first movie ever. Wish it was a better one. The changes made to the backstory are unnecessary and add nothing good. Poorly acted, shallow, dumb, downbeat -- it's a crappy excuse for what should be, first and foremost, escapist entertainment. The late '80s / early '90s Turtles cartoon and movies were hardly high art but at least they had an enthusiasm about them that was fun to watch. Skip this tired garbage. It's an hour and a half I'll never get back.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
12,zardoz-13,Top-Notch Turtles Tale,10,17 August 2014,"Believe it or not, I saw the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie when it appeared in theaters back in 1990, and I enjoyed it for the harmless guilty pleasure that it provided. The exploits of a quartet of anthropomorphic chelonian crime-fighters was as entertaining as its eponymous characters were bizarre. Bandanna-clad vigilantes armed with an arsenal of feudal Japanese weaponry; these nimble turtles talked, walked, and displayed a predilection for pizza. Creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird never imagined their mutated box turtles with names derived from Renaissance painters would become a comic book sensation and would endure for 26 years from 1984 to 2010. Eastman and Laird drew inspiration for their mutant heroes on half-shells from the works of Frank Miller and Jack Kirby. Specifically, they set out to skewer not only Marvel Comics' ""The New Mutants"" and ""Daredevil,"" but also the Canadian comic ""Cerebus the Aardvark"" as well as Frank Miller's DC Comics creation ""Ronin."" The Ninja Turtles have since mutated into a social phenomenon, with three animated series and a short-lived live-action series introducing a fifth turtle, a female called ""Venus de Milo"" skilled in the supernatural arts of the shinobi. Four ""TMNT"" films followed from 1990 to 2007. The first three movies were live-action and the fourth film ""TMNT"" (2007) was animated opus. Almost 25 years after the original ""Turtles"" movie came out; Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon has rebooted ""The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" with ""Transformers"" director Michael Bay serving as producer and ""Wrath of the Titans"" director Jonathan Liebesman at the helm. No matter what you've heard about this latest adaptation, the new ""Ninja Turtles"" movie sticks pretty much to the basics. Casey Jones, the human vigilante with a hockey stick who served as a romantic interest for news reporter April O'Neil has been jettisoned by ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" scenarists Josh Appelbaum & André Nemec, and ""Divergent"" scripter Evan Daugherty. Happily, while the characters have undergone some significant changes, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" emerges as a derivative but exhilarating roller-coaster of a thrill ride that should satisfy most of the vintage fans. You don't need to be an adolescent to enjoy this slam-bang, over-the-top actioneer with first-rate computer generated imagery and hilarious shenanigans to spare.Unlike the 1990 version, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" reboot revises the characters. Channel 6 news reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer's Body"") is more than a television journalist covering an unsolved crime wave sweeping New York City. April was also the daughter of one of the scientists toiling on Project Renaissance. April's father and his partner Eric Sacks (William Fichtner of ""The Lone Ranger"") were conducting experiments on a rodent and four turtles to devise a new mutagen strain mutagen for its medicinal properties. Unfortunately, O'Neil's father perished in a mysterious fire in their laboratory while Sacks managed to survive. Neither April's deceased father nor Eric Sacks knew about April's role in rescuing Splinter and the turtles from the conflagration. She turned them loose in the sewer. Years later April is struggling with a story about the Foot Clan, an underworld organization run by a notorious Asian criminal genius called Shredder. Unlike the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie, Shredder doesn't employ adolescents as thieves to execute his evil designs. Instead, he has a gang of heavily armed adult ninjas with automatic weapons. After Shredder learns about that Ninja Turtles survived the fire, he orders his second-in-command, Karai (Minae Noji of ""The Last Run""), to take hostages. Shredder hopes that the vigilante turtles will try to rescue the hostages and fall into their trap. Naturally, the Turtles show up to save the hostages held prisoner in a subway station. Shredder is angry when the Turtles thwart his plan and leave his men tied up like turkeys for the police to arrest. Meantime, April follows the Turtles and tries to snap some photos, but they thwart her efforts and erase the pictures on her cell phone. Eventually, the Turtles take her to their lair when Master Splinter reveals that she alone rescued them from the fire. When April takes her outlandish story to her boss, Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg of ""Ghosts of Mississippi""), she is fired on the spot. Basically, April finds herself back at square one with nobody to help her than her father's old partner.Director Jonathan Liebesman never lets up the momentum in this runaway action thriller. The new Ninja Turtles are even more differentiated than their predecessors. They stand six feet tall and resemble the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. They still crave pizza, but they have been updated and their abilities ramped up far and away beyond what they could achieve before this reboot. For example, Donatello has been turned into a nerdy computer hacker who can crack any computer. Furthermore, the Turtles' leader Splinter has a longer tale which he deploys as if it were a bullwhip. Shredder resembles a samurai version of Darth Vader from ""Star Wars."" He has special devices attached to his wrists that enable him to sling dozens of deadly knives. The knives behave like boomerangs so he can retrieve them if they miss their targets. Truly, Shredder here emerges as a stronger, more contentious villain who puts the lives of our heroes in jeopardy until the last minute. Interestingly enough, unlike most fantasy thrillers that create massive destruction but almost no collateral damage, you see innocent bystanders suffer from the falling debris. Liebesman lenses the action so his cameras are constantly whirling around the various characters. The most gripping scene occurs when our heroes are in an 18-wheeler that plunges down the snow-swept mountain. This scene alone makes the classic chase in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" look like a tricycle ride. People who suffer from motion sickness may find this scene a little too much to handle. You don't have to be an adolescent to enjoy ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" but it certainly wouldn't hurt!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
13,view_and_review,2014 Turtles Train with Schwarzenegger,7,16 September 2015,"I didn't hear much about this movie after its release; good or bad, which led me to believe that the movie tanked. I went in having no expectations, which is always a safe way to watch a movie--then there can be no disappointments. This movie did not disappoint at all, I actually enjoyed it.Everyone is familiar with the TMNT's, their master Splinter, and their nemesis Shredder. This movie had two stories to it: 1.) the creation of the TMNT's and 2.) Shredder's outrageous plan for subjugating New York. It's been a while since I watched the cartoon and I wasn't into it enough to remember how the TMNT's came about--so the movie may be sticking to the script with that or it may not. In any case, they found a way to tie the TMNT's to April O'Neil (Megan Fox). As for the second story, it was nothing cutting edge or unique, it was just a method to bring about a showdown between the Turtles and Shredder.I was most impressed by the CGI. It's amazing how CGI just gets better and better--and it was about time too. I mean, it was about time they revamped the TMNT's and made them CGI instead of the costumed actors they were in 1990. Making them CGI gave the director and production staff more liberty with the action and the fight scenes. It was quite nice.Furthermore, the CGI allowed the creators to transform the TMNT's from soft, not-fully-matured mutated turtles to hulking, musclebound, extremely intimidating mutated turtles. They definitely looked more akin to the Incredible Hulk than Crush of Finding Nemo. It was a good look.But even with the new muscular frames they still had their immature teenage ways--which was cool. In that respect they stayed true to their cartoon roots. In fact, their personalities--as overgrown, pop culture loving, pizza consuming teens--added to the flare of the movie and made it that much better. Their fluid movements and expressions were perfectly matched by the voices. The entire package portrayed carefree bravado and in such a way that both kids and adults can enjoy.The newest version of TMNT is definitely darker and a bit more grown-up than the predecessor. Much like Batman and Superman have evolved into more complex characters to match their more complex environment, so to have the TMNT. 2014 TMNT were a blast, in spite of Megan Fox (unless of course you think she was an invaluable part of the movie) and worth every penny. Well, um.... it was free, but it was worth it!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
14,neil-476,Quite good in an undemanding way,7,20 October 2014,"A group of wicked martial arts crooks called The Foot is running riot in New York: mysterious vigilantes go up against them. Reporter April O'Neil is on the case! A second big screen reboot for the Turtles sees a lot of money poured into the visuals, and to good effect – the Turtles have never looked better. The story is OK, with some interesting plot elements, the script is (for what it is) not bad, with the Turtles' loving, squabbling relationships nicely drawn, William Fichtner is always enjoyable, Will Arnett is good fun, Megan Fox fills a hole on the screen adequately, Whoopi Goldberg looks as if she has been inflated with a bicycle pump. and there is bags of action (some of which I found difficult to follow).

15,anaconda-40658,Megan Fox in the April Suit.,5,25 August 2015,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) Dir: Jonathan Liebesman / Cast: Megan Fox, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Whoopi Goldberg, Minae Noji: Average update of the popular comic characters about the slowest reptile on the planet joined with upbeat skills. The back story regarding how the four turtles and a rat named Splinter mutate is rushed in order to push action scenes. Megan Fox plays reporter April O'Neil who owned these pets when she was young. Her father was murdered and during the lab blaze she sets her pets free. When the dreaded Foot Clan attempt a city takeover, headed by their leader Shredder, the four ninja turtles who go by the names Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Donatello jump into action kicking ass but caught on camera by April. Splinter is not impressed but eventually they touch face with April when Shredder and the Foot Clan attack and wreck havoc on their sewer. Fans of the comic will no doubt enjoy the humour and action scenes that electrify plus the turtles look terrific. The screenplay is a dud with compliments only going to the climax where the four turtles perform creative teamwork in order to defeat Shredder. Director Jonathan Liebesman previously made Wrath of the Titans. Surprisingly Megan Fox is the one effective casting as April who is out to prove herself. Will Arnett as her co-worker is a romantic prop. William Fichtner has ""guilty"" written all over him from the start. Whoopi Goldberg as April's boss is underused. Minae Noji plays a sneering Foot Clan joke. Dedicated fans may enjoy this visual treat while others may order out for pizza and forget this altogether. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
16,FlashCallahan,Shellshock.......,5,27 August 2014,"Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip in New York City on everything from the police to the politicians. The future is grim until four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arrive on the scene. The Turtles work with reporter April O'Neil and her cameraman to save the city and unravel Shredder's diabolical plan, which he's obviously taken from watching re-runs of the animated eighties series.....Bay as a director in the last eight years has, in my humble opinion, sold out, and his Transformers movies are the product of Hollywoods sphincter. And Pain And Gain was just like the title, if you took away the 'And Gain'.But as a producer, he sometimes excels beyond imagination. The last Purge movie was a step up from the original, and his horror remakes do have some redeeming features.This reboot/sequel (the title does have a subliminal five in the title), lies somewhere in the middle of this mix.For starters, its short, and the action doesn't take long to get going, because after all, we just want to see Turtles fight, but then we go back to familiar territory, cameras lingering on Megan Fox, bad narrative, and a third act that is nothing more than explosions, loud noises, and repeat until the end.The first thing you notice when the titular characters are revealed, is how much they look like The Hulk. The Turtles you remember from the cartoon are gone, here they are like The Rock painted green,with extra wisecracks, and of course, the token fun Turtle, Michaelangelo, has some pretty offensive ethnic traits to him.The film is split into three parts, April seeking and discovering the shady vigilantes, theirs, and the villains back-story, and of course, the final showdown.There is a subplot involving April that has been stolen from The Amazing Spider-Man, but some of the action sequences are pretty spectacular.Even though The Turtles look wrong, they are wonderful to look at, and so much effort has gone into their creation. Once you stop them waiting for them to turn back to Bruce Banner, they are quite endearing, and the chase down the snowy mountain is the highlight of the movie.Fox as you would expect, is better to look at than to listen to, but then she has got brilliant support from Arnett, and Fichtner, who add a lot of class to the movie.But all in all, it's another chance gone begging, and for one, I fear its a new beginning for a dull franchise.And toys and merchandise of course.Stick with the cartoon, or the one with Vanilla Ice in......",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

""Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles"", while rigorously adhering to the origin story formula, is a noisy, over- produced mess. The turtles are the ugliest damn things ever, the vocal performances are all off, and at 95 minutes it still feels long.

20,KineticSeoul,Could have been better as more of an origin story with team build up dynamic,6,8 September 2016,"Personally I think this would have been a better movie if it took more of the origin story approach. Where most of the build up can go down, sure it can be generic. But with some clever execution and some witty banter, mixed in with will power and emotions. Kind of like the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" movie except with the Turtles and the clashing of each others personality. And despite there differences they become a team and is able to persevere. And add in the Shredder doing more bad ass stuff and his main minions backing him up and each having there own skill sets that each Turtles face off against. Kind of like ""Ninja Scroll"" or ""Afro Samurai"" and this would have been a killer movie. This could have been a Ninja Turtles movie that could have stood out when it came out. Unfortunately it takes the standard fight the bad guy from doing bad things approach. With the boring subplot revolving April O'Neil played by Megan Fox. After she talked trash about Michael Bay by calling him Hitler, she must have gave him one heck of an apology. The whole April subplot could have worked if it blended well with the Turtles origin story. But she is equivalent to Shia LaBeouf in the ""Transformers"" movies with her just acting surprised all the time, freaking out and yelling when the Turtles are in danger. Overall, I thought when it comes to the Turtles action sequences and CGI, it's actually very well done. And it is actually quite entertaining to sit through.

This time, they must face Shredder and his evil Foot Clan in New York City to defeat their power over the city's authorities.While the action was pretty intense and fun and the acting was OK, there is really nothing new in plot to the movie that we haven't seen in previous TMNT films. The main difference is the heavy use of CGI and modern-day technology references.I personally prefer the original 1990 TMNT motion picture, which was cheesy at times, but had character, humor, realistic-looking costumes and a more fast-paced and engaging story-line.Grade C+",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
22,Hellmant,"Really faithful to the 80s cartoon, that's it's problem.",6,12 August 2014,"'TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES': Three Stars (Out of Five) A reboot to the 90's film series (based on the popular comic book, cartoon and toy line from the 1980s) about four teenage humanlike mutated turtles, trained in ninjutsu, who defend New York City from an evil clan of ninja warriors. Megan Fox stars (in the new film) as a reporter who aids them in their battle. It costars Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Tohoru Masamune, Whoopi Goldberg and the voices of Johnny Knoxville and Tony Shalhoub. It was directed by Jonathan Liebesman (who's directed other recent sci-fi and horror flicks like 'WRATH OF THE TITANS', 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' and 'BATTLE LOS ANGELES') and written by Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty (adapted from the comic book by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman). Michael Bay served as a producer on the film and it shows. I have to say I was kind of disappointed in this reboot; being a big fan of the comic book, cartoon, toys and original 90s movie.The story, at first, focuses on April O'Neil (Fox); a reporter, for Channel 6 news, in New York City. April is popular for doing fluff pieces, with her cameraman Vern (Arnett), but she desperately wants to cover something with more substance. She begins investigating a criminal organization, called the Foot Clan, in hopes of getting a hit story. One night April comes across four mutated teenage turtles, that are fighting the Foot Clan, and gets some good pictures. The ninja turtles meet April and take her footage from her but they soon learn, from their mentor Splinter (voiced by Shalhoub), that she's in danger and needs their protection.The movie is really faithful to the 80s cartoon; more so than any recent film adaptation, of an 80s cartoon, that I can think of. That's it's problem though; it would have been better if it was more faithful to Eastman and Laird's comic book. I liked the cartoon, when I was a kid, but I don't think I could watch it now; with much enjoyment. That's what this movie kind of felt like to me; trying to go back and watch the cartoon again. It's not horrible; Id say it's about equal to the original 90s movie (and better than it's two sequels). Fox wouldn't be one of my first choices to play April O'Neal but she's not bad in the film either. Liebesman tries a little too hard to make the action scenes like a Michael Bay movie, and they do get pretty dull and uninvolving, but the turtles are fun. As cheesy as the four ninja turtles are they are true to the popular cartoon show and fun to watch. Hopefully the sequel will do cooler things with them.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/cqKPD4ZNLxM",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

24,Robert_duder,My turn to chime in...many of you won't like it but hear me out!,8,22 August 2014,"First and foremost, I am a late 80's, early 90's kid. I lived and breathed Ninja Turtles whether it was 1987 cartoon series, the action figures, the original live action film...I was a HUGE fan. So when I heard Michael Bay and one of his minions were re-booting the series I was sceptical. I was as sceptical as any of you. Then I saw the first trailer and I thought...well, it actually looks promising. However, I think I am far more open minded as a huge film buff. I understand a few key factors when rebooting a franchise. The appearance of the heroes have to look different. A little more modern, something different and something out there. It has to be different enough to stand on its own from the original concept and films or why bother remaking it? I know I am not going to be popular the instant I say this and I don't care. I loved it. It was insanely fun and bravo to them for not only capturing the heart and soul of the original idea but bringing it into the modern day, using the CGI mostly properly (I hate CGI) and best of all keeping it clean and fun so that children of a new generation can fall in love with the Heroes in a Half-shell. Do you hear that haters and petty internet trolls? Many of you haven't even seen the film because you're doing some stupid boycott that no one cares about. This is for KIDS!! A new generation of kids and minus some violence it is kid friendly!! If you can see that for what it is AND best of all become a kid yourself for two hours, you will enjoy every minute of it.My biggest concern was Megan Fox as April O'Neil. Lord knows the girl struggles to be impressive on screen. She is very nice to look at but she acting ability is limited. Well there are a few things that help her out here. April O'Neil as a character in the original cartoon series was a little bit cheesy so she suits it well. In fact, Fox is actually really good as April. She makes a better April than Amy Adams made a Lois Lane!! She's determined, tough, and fun to watch in the role. In fact, at this point I would be disappointed if she didn't come back!! Will Arnett joins the cast as Vernon Fenwick and he's pretty great too. They don't overuse him and his comedy is well placed. William Fichtner (whom I love from Prison Break and other films) is perfectly cast as the villainous Sacks. He actually makes more of an impression as the villain than Shredder but more on that in a moment. There are some issues with the film for certain. Tohoru Masamune seems to do a terrific and incredibly ominous job early in the film establishing himself as the Turtles' infamous nemesis Shredder. Unfortunately, that is where it falls apart. Shredder is painfully underused and despite good fight scenes opposite him, there is zero character development and he is left to being hardly a minion of Sacks or so it feels. The turtles are all cast nearly perfectly. Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Pete Ploszek and Johnny Knoxville all fit their respective counterparts nearly perfectly. Fisher is almost overused as Michelangelo but that always was the case with him because he is the ""fun"" one. They did nothing to change the Turtles' personality that fans of the original have come to know and love and that is a good thing!! Donatello is perhaps a little underused but we certainly get the drift that he is the brain of the group. The other big mis-cast in my book is Tony Shalhoub as Splinter. Unfortunately, he did not fit his role at all and I didn't particularly care for him as a character and that's too bad because a big portion of the heart of the film is spent around Splinter.So there are some minor tweaks needed for the script and some of the casting wasn't perfect but they had HUGE feet to fill. There is no way they could even impress the majority because right off the bat everyone was up in arms. I challenge each and every one of you to go sit in the theatre, close your eyes and channel your inner 9-12 year old. Remember what it was like to sit in the theatre and see the first Ninja Turtles movie and then open up your eyes and watch this one. You will have a blast. I would love if they didn't saturate it with CGI but this is simply modern day blockbusters and the 3D was pointless but it always is!! Splinter and Shredder were not developed properly but despite those minor things this was a fantastic start to a new franchise and I hope they can keep it going!! The problem is that chances are they will get super excited and jam the second one with too much crap just like they did to Transformers 2. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is full of nods to the old material, lots of action, the characters we all know and love and its a very fun time at the movies. Watch this with proper expectations and don't be so darn closed minded because you're missing out!! 8.5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A brasher, more technologically advanced update for a new generation of Turtle fans",4,23 November 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe amphibian fighting heroes have their origins updated to modern times, as the city of New York is terrorized by the Foot Clan for a new generation, and it's only hope are the lean, green, fighting foursome, mentored by their rat master Splinter. Intrepid reporter April O'Neill (Megan Fox) is on to their hideout, and it's not long before she finds herself caught up in their chaotic, crime fighting world, as the guys prepare to stop the evil Shredder, and a traitorous character from April's world, unleashing their most diabolical plan yet.I'm at enough of a transitional point in my life as it is at the minute, without having it rubbed in my face how some iconic heroes from my childhood have now been adapted again for the big screen by some Hollywood movie executives, not out of any truly genuine or heartfelt reason, simply trying to find a cheap, easy way to make something that will appeal to kids by regurgitating a long dormant franchise. It's a little bit of a turning point in your life when you see a new generation of young people being drawn to something that was such a big part of your own youth. It's disconcerting to see something that was so frivolous and novelty back then being given the obligatory dark, moody treatment this time round, though only in filming style, with the easy, self effacing humour from the first time round still present.It has at least stayed true to the source material as regards the characters, with Leonardo the leader, Donatello the intelligent one, Raphael, the mean moody one and Michaelangelo, the one who messes around a lot, even if certain elements have been played around with for more modern, technologically advanced times, with April SkyPe-ing her boss, and as for an automatic weapon toting Foot Clan, that will take some getting used to. Shredder is also a more elusive, ineffective villain here, even if he does spout an impressive fully steeled armour plated chest at the end. Fox looks sexy in her April O'Neill get up, but lacks the acting skills to be anything beyond that.It's loud, brash, noisy and chaotic, with some admittedly impressive stunts and action sequences included, but there's no real heart or substance to any of it, typical Michael Bay/Johnathan Liebesman fare, that chops and changes the original Turtles back story to terminally ill effect, and leaves something that makes a lot of noise and mess, but very little sense or heart, much like the big, noisy kid it is. **",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
26,bowmanblue,Actually better than I expected,6,28 February 2015,"Okay, so I didn't love the remake of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but I was reasonably surprised. I'm one of the original group of Turtle fans who enjoyed the cartoon in the eighties and the live action (fun!) film in 1990. Therefore, when I heard that Michael Bay had his fingers in the remake, my hopes weren't high (look what he did to the Transformers franchise!).Yes, Bay's fingerprints are visible here and there during the film, but, luckily, his input is relatively fleeting. I guess I have to keep comparing the film to Transformers – both have been sold on having giant computer-generated characters as central to the story. And, whereas Optimus Prime and co seem to blur into one, making action scenes almost impossible to watch, on the whole I was happy with the CGI turtles. The fight scenes looked pretty realistic and there was only one (overly long) snowy chase scene in the final act which kind of looked a little too CGI for my liking.However, as with Transformers, the film tries to balance the story between the titular heroes and the human characters. It's not until roughly the half hour mark do we really get to meet our four shelled green stars. Many people already hate Megan Fox, so I was pretty surprised that she even got the part as the turtles' friend April O'Neil. I never hated her to begin with, but I'd describe her performance as 'functional.' The turtles themselves are fun to watch, but I was a little surprised at how miserable their (giant rat) mentor 'Splinter' seemed to be. In the cartoon he was much more loving and paternal towards the turtles. Here, he just seemed to have a go at them half the time (okay, he warms up, but still I thought he was overly harsh).You may or may not know (I did!) that William Fichtner was originally cast as the turtles' nemesis 'Shredder.' The fans went mental (yeah, I didn't agree with the casting choice either) and a second actor was brought in as the 'main' villain and some parts of the film reshot to reflect this. I guess because I knew this I was on the lookout for the bits that were blatantly 'added in' post production and I found them pretty easy to spot.Ultimately, I can see this film being loved by the kids (mainly boys!) of today. It's just about passable as a homage to our childhood memories and, although it's not a classic, Transformers it is not.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
27,ThomasDrufke,"Not Gonna Lie, I Didn't Hate It",5,23 December 2014,"Take my review with a grain of salt because this was my first introduction into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I haven't seen any of the previous films or read any of the comics. With that being said I did come in with very low expectations considering Michael Bay's name is attached. Sure he didn't direct it, but you can still see his hands all over this film. But I have to say there is some enjoyment to be found in this reboot.The turtles are fun to watch even with the overwhelming amount of CGI. I think the best scenes involve all of them just bickering or poking fun at the current dilemma. It was a much more laid back film than the typical superhero blockbuster. Not to say there's anything wrong with the darker approach that the genre has gone into, but I also like to enjoy myself while watching a film and not have to always be on the edge of my seat. It was also funny to hear the turtles reference pop culture and even some other comic book characters.There are a lot of problems with this film though. I think the acting is borderline horrendous. But I didn't think Megan Fox was as bad as she usually is. Was there really any need to have a few second shot of Megan Fox behind? I thought we were past that point Michael Bay? But good god is Will Arnett's character is just pointless. The writing is also very weak, particularly with the villains. Shredder is supposedly a great villain but nowhere in this film was that shown. I also wasn't a huge fan of Splinter and where his character goes. So in all the film has it's fun moments but it becomes a CGI fest with very weak characters and bad dialogue. It's not a good film by any means but it got me interested enough for a sequel.+Turtles interactions +Has it's fun moments -CGI fest -Bad writing-Will Arnett 5.6/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Meanwhile, newshound April O'Neil (Megan Fox) and her cameraman (Will Arnett) are keen on exposing the vigilantes.But doing so uncovers a forgotten link between her, her father's secret mutagen, and her new subterranean friends.Marred by poor character designs, terrible vocal talent and unwarranted deviations from the mythos, this live-action/computer animated version of the underground comic fails to connect with new or even established fans.Incidentally, when a disgraced ninja-turtle commits seppuku, it means turtle soups for dinner.

32,ironhorse_iv,"I'm shell shocked, how semi-alright, this movie is. Still, it's still kinda meh. At less, they weren't made into aliens!",6,12 August 2014,"Cowabunga for that! I went into the movie with low expectations, knowing all the negative rumors, coming in during production. I knew, it wasn't going to be the greatest movies, I'll see this summer, but if anything, the movie was semi-alright. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman, the movie is based on comic book by Kevin Eastman, before their expansion into their popular late 1980's, early 1990s cartoon series. It was followed by, three live-action movies in the 1990s. In the 2000s, the series search new audiences with another animation film in 2007, follow by two reboot animation TV shows in 2003 and 2012. This new film was fun, action packed, and had really funny moments. If you can get past Megan Fox's ""acting"", the awkward looking CGI motion capture and the change of the turtles' origins, it's actually a really semi OK movie. Too bad, its delivery is a bit off. First off, the action. I do understand that they're ninjas and most of the action will be in the shadows, and jumpy. Still, the action is all over the place and unrealistic. Lots of shaky camera, and bright lights that makes it a blur. You can't really see a thing, because the camera moves around, way too quick. I hate all the boring action clichés such as the slow-mo jumps. Remind me of the original 1990 TMNT movie action sequence with the whole robbery and subway action sequence if done worst. At less, it didn't had that kidsy type violent. It look like people got mess up for a PG-13 film. The best action in the film is toward the middle, in the mountainside sequence. That is the scene to watch in 3D, but for the most part, it's not worth it. I have to say, the building fight is a bit too cartoony, and looks too familiar to the ending of 2012's Amazing Spiderman. Call me, old school, but I love the Jim Henson's Creature Shop puppet suit over the CGI. The CGI turtles do look a bit ugly, at less, you can tell them, more apart besides the color scheme. At less, they show that Donatello (Jeremy Howard) was indeed smart. I like that, he has a lot of gadgets. Michelangelo (Noel Fischer) do stand out and his humor was alright. Johnny Knoxville as the voice of Leonardo is awkward, but he doesn't look or act like a leader in this film. Raphael (Alan Ritchson) looks like a creepy Battle-toad than a turtle. The worst had to be Splinter (Voiced by Tony Shalhoub), the voice doesn't match up, his appearance is god-awful ugly looking, and his backstory from the comic books, nearly delete. No mention of Hamato Yoshi. Instead, the movie gives a lame excuse, on how they learn Ninjutsu. Splinter found a book about it, one day and decide to teach it. They really butch his character. Another disappointment is Shredder (Tohoru Masamune). Shredder's weaponry was impressive and true to his style. Shredder looked like a generic robot than man. Still, he's that one- one-dimensional surreal super-villain that could easier get confused for the Silver Samurai from 2013's The Wolverine movie. Sadly, I felt the Turtles play supporting characters in their own role as April O'Neil (Megan Fox) and the awful, Vernon (Will Arnett) took most of the screen time. Whoopi Goldberg as Bernadette Thompson and K. Todd Freeman as Dr. Baxter Stockmen were just throw away characters. I wish, comic characters like Casey Jones were in this film. It sucks that he wasn't. I still hoping to see Bebop and Rocksteady from the cartoon series. I'm still waiting for a Krang and the Technodrome to appear, as well. I didn't mind the add-ins to the origin story, including April O'Neil, but there was no gravitas to the story. I did like the graphic novel opening as homage to the original comics. Still, the movie was so clichés. This film isn't directed by Michael Bay, but his fingerprints are all over this. Michael Bay is only a producer. Actually he's not even the only producer. He shares producer credits with 5 other people, but because Michael Bay's name is attached to it, you can see his influences in the final film from quick cuts action to too many close ups with obnoxious Dutch angles. The close ups are intended to, convey that our hero, while in the midst of a noisy battle scene, is having a moment of panic, of real human emotions. But the way he incorporated them only shows a jarring edit to something outside the action. The movie pacing is just bad. Its action sequence to action sequence without much depth and the ending ends with no value. The movie was supposed to be about brotherhood, friendship, and responsibility, but it's not there for the most part. The only bounding scene, I can recall is the semi funny elevator scene. The music is alright for the most part. Still, it can't beat the original theme song from both the 1990s movies and 1980's TV show. The song by Juicy J. & Wiz Khalifa 'Shell Shocked' is pretty damn stupid. Made me wish to listen to the Partners in Kryme-T.U.R.T.L.E. Power. That song was so gangsta. It's at less, better than Vanilla Ice's Ninja rap. Overall: There have been so many incarnations of the Turtles over the years, but this movie is not as bad as it could've been. The movie will probably spark a sequel, so if you're a true TMNT fan, you should give this film at less, a chance. It didn't destroy the cartoon with its mediocre.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The cartoon show from the 80's and 90's is better. I'm sick of these idiots carrying on. My childhood is dead. So you did not like this movie. Get over it. Michael Bay has made some bad movies. So has JJ Abrams. So has Steven Spielberg. People need to stop underrating him. He is a good film maker. When I was kid I was the biggest Teenage mutant ninja turtle fan in my town. And real enjoyed this movie. This is the best Teenage mutant ninja turtles movie. To bad people have such hate on for Michael Bay and refuse to like any of his movie. Armageddon is crap.

It retains enough of the back-story originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird to justify calling itself a Turtles movie, but ultimately panders to a teenage audience too young to know any better.Young New York reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is becoming frustrated at her stations insistence that she cover tedious news stories while a terrorist organisation named the Foot Clan instigate a crime wave throughout the city. During a couple of close encounters with the Clan, in which she happens to be at the right place at the right time, April spies a quartet of huge vigilantes who save the day before disappearing into the night. One night, she follows the trail and discovers that the vigilantes are four 6-foot anthropomorphic ninja turtles named Leonardo (Pete Ploszek with Johnny Knoxville's voice), Raphael (Alan Ritchson), Donatello (Jeremy Howard) and Michelangelo (Noel Fisher).William Fichtner plays a corrupt CEO named Eric Stacks, whose big plan is to infect the city with a virus only he and his company have the vaccine for. It's a wonder why Stacks wasn't just written as the big bad rather than having him report to Shredder (Tohoru Masamune), a huge Japanese warrior with an impressive set of kitchen knives. Yet since Marvel established the potential for universe building and the money to be made from it, an increasingly common blockbuster trait is sacrificing a stand-alone story for the sake of establishing a franchise. With Ninja Turtles, we get a half-baked plot that simply teases how exciting things could get, without really delivering in the movie we are actually watching. Only a shell-surf down a snowy mountain that leaves the law of physics in its wake really excites.The film isn't quite as awful as I'm perhaps making it out to be, but it's let down by being so shockingly mediocre. The main positives are the turtles themselves. While being underused (Leonardo barely gets a look in), they are stunningly rendered. Far more grotesque creations than those of the cartoon, they are almost completely life-like, all bulging muscles and tatty clothes. Unlike the indistinguishable hunks of metal of Transformers, you can also actually tell them apart (although their character development doesn't reach beyond 'leader', 'hard-ass', 'tech-genius' and 'loose- cannon'). In between the CGI fist-fights is when the film really suffers. Bay's influence can be felt throughout, no more than the cutesy fast-talk bickering between April and her horny partner Vernon (Will Arnett) who share zero chemistry and are lumbered with some cringe-worth one-liners. Despite all of this, the world- building obviously worked, with the sequel due to arrive later this year.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
36,Floated2,Decent for its premise,6,6 October 2015,"Given that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have gone through several incarnations since their comic-book conception, it was inevitable that screenwriters Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec, and Evan Daugherty would have taken some liberties with the established lore. Yet unlike previous Platinum Dunes atrocities, the screen writing team here manage to keep the spirit of the characters intact, even if the details seem slightly off. In addition to giving each of the turtles distinctive personalities, Appelbaum, Nemec, and Daugherty have fashioned a script that moves along at a satisfying pace. There's the occasional lapse in logic, but those are the moments when it pays to remember that you're watching a movie about giant crime-fighting, pizza-munching turtles with juvenile personalities.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
37,leonblackwood,Nuff action and some funny turtles moments! 6/10,6,22 February 2015,"Review: My expectations for this film wasn't that high, after reading so many bad reviews, but I honestly didn't think that it as that bad. Megan Fox was acting exactly the same as she did in Transformers, which wasn't surprising, but I was surprised with the different personalities of the Turtles, which worked extremely well. The storyline was your typical baddie wanting to take over the world type of concept, but in this case the baddie needed the turtles blood. The director did give the movie some depth by adding the whole creation of the turtles to the mix, but there was a bit too much going on from the beginning to the end. There's plenty of muddled up actions scenes, like in some of the earlier Transformers movies, and you don't really get a chance to know anything about the individual characters. The CGI looked very believable and the mannerisms and expressions of the turtles were great. The action scenes also looked impressive but I personally think that the director over done it in some of the scenes, like when there falling in the snow. Anyway, I quite enjoyed this film, especially the part when there beat boxing in the lift, so it gets the thumbs up from me. Enjoyable, in a popcorn movie type of way!Round-Up: Some of the most hated movies are the ones that grossed a lot of money at the box office, like the Da Vinci Code, so I never know if to honestly believe the critics half the time. I know that a majority of the money that this movie grossed is based on hype and a big distribution campaign, but I don't think that it was as bad as people was saying it was. It seems like people are getting a bit fed up with the witty scripts in the movies in this genre, so it must be hard for the directors to get the mixture totally right. You honestly can't have a serious film about talking turtles who fight like ninjas, so I don't know what the critics expected. Maybe the wit just wasn't that funny in there opinion! I heard the same complaints about the new Transformers, which I quite liked, so there's definitely is a cry for some good scripts on Hollywood at the moment. Maybe that will cut down on all of the reboots! Anyway, I didn't really like Megan Fox in this movie, because she seemed totally useless and her constant pouting didn't help, but the turtles were fun and the rat and Shredder had some great fighting scenes.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $482millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their movies action/comedy movies about ninja turtles fighting against evil to save the world from destruction. 6/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
38,TheMovieDiorama,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is definitely not ""turtle-y"" awesome.",4,2 February 2019,"Whilst not directed by Michael Bay, his hand in the production team is clearly noticeable right from the first diagonal shot plagued with lens flares and...oh, would you look at that! Explosions! Now, I'm not the biggest fan of the source material, so was hoping for fresh adaptation with some genuine wit and memorability. Alas, it's just another loud disposable blockbuster that is infected with poor editing and minimal characterisation. New York is under threat by a clan that will soon destroy the city and its inhabitants. But four mutant turtles team up with a news reporter to stop the antagonising Shredder. Michelangelo, bam! Raphael, woosh! Donatello, kapow! And Leonardo, DiCaprio! Four hideously designed ""ninja mutant turtle teenagers"" that surprisingly have minimal character development and come across as annoying irritants (even more so than Megan Fox!). Speaking of, it's another case of good looks overwhelming acting ability because April O'Neil was absolutely useless at her job, constantly screamed at everything and was more of a lead character in comparison to the eponymous turtles. Splinter shows up for a wonderful ten minute scene of exposition, and then bites the dust whilst generating no emotional investment. Villain also makes the classic move of unveiling his plans to the heroes so that they can stop him. Eyes certainly rolled at that point. Some of the action scenes, such as the downhill mountain chase, were well edited and exciting. However the close combat sequences in the sewers were murky, poorly edited and nearly impossible to watch. The dialogue tried too hard at being funny, and ultimately failed. Although some of the conversations between the turtles did feel natural and gave them a sense a unity and family. Oh, and Whoopi Goldberg has a few lines! Why? No idea. Look, it's not a terrible film, but it's obvious that the target demographic is for younger audiences (despite its certification). Obnoxiously loud with only one or two scenes of pure entertainment.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
39,matthewssilverhammer,Stupid Fun,6,19 August 2014,"In the latest TMNT, where story and drama falter, action and humor shine. We're given a ridiculous world with ridiculous characters doing ridiculous thingsand the movie knows and owns this. It's calling out the over-serious superhero movie by recognizing its own silly place. So if you are sick of the dark-side of comic book films (ahemMan of Steel) and love the corn of the 90s Ninja Turtles, you shouldn't be disappointed. TMNT focuses on April (Fox), an over-zealous and endearingly looney reporter who encounters Leo, Raph, Donnie, and Mikey as they fight off the growing Foot Clan. She tries to spread this news, but of course what would a movie be without the trope ""nobody believes me""? This all leads to origin stories that are a pretty intense departure from the original back story, and are problematically coincidental. However, there are plenty of great hand-to-hand combat scenes and wonderfully cheesy pun-filled humor we've come to expect from the adolescent amphibians. Everyone (especially critics) needs to calm down...Of course TMNT is stupid (did you read the title?!), but it's mindlessly fun. Fine, so the message is hackneyed. Okay, so the camera work and effects are bad. Yeah, the villain motivations are incredibly weak. And sure, the turtles look weird. However, the characters, humor and the action, the things that matter for the turtles-in-a-half-shell, are spot on, hearkening back to the original trilogy and skating it into modern techniques. So while TMNT isn't especially fresh or sustainable, it'll do; even frozen pizza can sometimes get the job done.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This reboot is getting bashed, but despite it's flaws, I can't bring myself to bash it. I really loved the fight scenes, they where not kid friendly, more like Jason Bourne style. The action is pretty intense, like in the style of Michael Bay who produced it. And they got the personalities of the turtles just right.But the look of turtles is a bit too overdone. And Splinter looks too scary. Megan Fox is very out of place in the movie, cause I believe she was miscast, and it shows in her performance, not that it was all her fault, most of it would half to go the script. And what is Whoopi Goldberg doing in this, she was just useless, like Laurence Fishburne in Man of Steel(2013). This Turtles movie is just a turn your brain off to action.

There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
43,kevin_robbins,This film had a lot of potential based on the special effects but comes up short in overall entertainment,6,18 August 2021,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows April O'Neil, a television reporter in New York City. New York is currently under terrorist attack by a group known as the Foot Clan. All hopes seems lost until a group of unlikely heroes appear from the sewers...the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This movie is directed by Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls) and starts Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body), Will Arnett (BoJack Horseman), Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Whoopi Goldberg (The Color Purple) and Alan Ritchson (The Hunger Games). The storyline was straightforward and executed in a very ""made for kids"" fashion. The special effects and CGI were out of this world good. We adored the action scenes from beginning to end. The turtles were very well done; however, Shredder and Splinter didn't really work for me. Megan Fox was blah in this as the main character. The script was also just okay. This film had a lot of potential based on the special effects but comes up short in overall entertainment. I would recommend seeing it as a family once but would only score it a 5.5/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
44,stevendbeard,A Good Reboot,7,10 August 2014,"I saw ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", starring Megan Fox-Jonah Hex, Hope & Faith_t.v.; Will Arnett-The Millers_t.v., Jonah Hex; Whoopi Goldberg- Glee_t.v., Madea Gore to Jail and William Fichtner-The Lone Ranger_2013, Drive Angry.It seems like they are rebooting a lot of older franchises nowadays so here is the latest. At least they did a good job on this one. It sticks pretty close to the source material, which was the comic books by Peter Laird & Kevin Eastman-and yes, I still have some of those books laying around the house. Megan plays the gung-ho reporter April O'Neil, that uncovers the secret story of the vigilante crime fighting turtles named after famous Renaissance painters; Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael & Donatello. Will plays her cameraman. The rat named Splinter, who is the turtles' sensei/master, also shows up and their complete mutant origins are revealed. The evil Shredder and his foot clan are, of course, the villains and they are terrorizing New York. William plays a henchman of Shredder and Whoopi plays Megan's boss at the newspaper. The only one that does not show up is Casey Jones, but I'm sure that they will make room for him in the sequel. Yes, one of the turtles makes the prolific one word battle cry, 'Cowabunga' and there are some funny scenes involving pizza. Near the end of the movie, there is even a famous song called 'Happy Together' heard, which has a special humorous meaning, if you know who recorded the original version. This is the first time a Turtle movie has been rated PG-13 and the first one to be released in 3D. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
45,alindsay-al,an average film that will not please turtles fans,5,7 January 2015,"I was looking forward to this film as a turtles fan but I must say it did disappoint me and I never want to see it again. The premise sees a group of large turtles trained by a rat to be ninjas in the sewer to stop the evil shredder from destroying new York. The best part of the film is easily the turtles they are all funny and interesting with completely different characters to them and their chemistry carries the film. Michelangelo was my favourite because of his really funny dialogue that always made me laugh. The supporting cast though sucks with Megan Fox playing April o Neil and she does as good Job as you would expect because she is not really a good actress. She is not the worst in this film though, that goes to will Arnett who is just ridiculously annoying and has so much stupid dialogue it is unreal. For all the rumours William Richter was not shredder and his character actually had a little promise but that falls away and his character becomes ridiculous. Shredder is a big villain and that's why it is hard to see him being such a boring character with absolutely no personality to him at all. The story is ridiculous with all the clichés being used and some things that were completely unnecessary and this film's ending reminds me of another film that you will know when you see it. The script for the turtles is great and all the dialogue works for different emotions and you will care about the turtles. But all the humans have awful dialogue and it really drags the film down and the film really focuses on the humans way too much. The style is great with all the action being smooth and easy to watch and enjoy. Also the turtles and shredder really looked good for this adapted film. Overall this film is average and will come as a disappointment to many fans.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
46,estebangonzalez10,Do the turtles have more than one character trait?,4,9 August 2014,"""Do not say a word about this to anyone. If you do, we will find you.""A much more fitting title for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would be April O'Neil considering she is the main character in this film and is on screen for almost its entire running time. Megan Fox was believable as this reporter who was looking for an important story so I didn't have a problem with her performance. My main issue with this film is how poorly developed the characters were. Its as if they forgot to give these characters personalities and only centered on the action. There were some OK action scenes, but I never felt engaged with the characters which rendered those sequences kind of pointless because I was never interested with what was going on. As a kid I grew up watching the cartoons and the movies in the early 90's so I thought I would be invested in these characters and that the nostalgia factor would play a key role in my enjoyment of this film, but I was wrong because I felt completely disengaged with the turtles. I don't think I would've even remembered the names of the turtles if I hadn't already been familiar with the characters. Sure, I know that Leonardo is the leader of the four, Donatello is the brains, Raphael the rebel, and Michelangelo the dude, but other than those basic characteristics we don't get anything else from these characters while they are running around and fighting off Shredder and the foot clan. After having seen Guardians of the Galaxy last week and being invested in those characters, I was really disappointed with how little they tried to give these turtles some personality. And don't even get me started with the rat, Splinter, which looked completely fake and was perhaps the weakest thing about this entire film. I know it's hard to pull off a film like this with a talking rat and four talking turtles, but Guardians of the Galaxy proved it could be done with a talking raccoon and tree. This film has nothing going for it, not even the comedy nor the wisecracking attempts at humor from Michelangelo. The characters seemed like they were taken from the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise, it was really bad. Considering Michael Bay was the producer of this film a lot of comparisons can be made to the Transformers franchise where you have big action scenes and very little character development, but in my opinion this was even worse. Director, Jonathan Liebesman, who still hasn't made a film I actually enjoyed, gives us a pointless action film which follows pretty much the same standard formula of basic action movies. You have one of the scientist betraying the other (formula we've seen in the Spiderman films) and not being able to finish the experiment without the other, then you have the vigilantes trying to save the city, and finally the climactic scene in a skyscraper while a time clock is running down to zero as the evil villain is trying to wipe out an entire city. It doesn't get more formulaic than that, so it wouldn't surprise me that in a few days memory of this film would be entirely wiped out because there isn't one original or note worthy moment during its 100 minute run time. It has no life to it whatsoever and I expect fans of the franchise to be disappointed while newcomers will be in disbelief as to why this was made in the first place. I hope some day these Turtles actually get a chance of getting a decent reboot because I grew up watching the cartoons and playing the awesome video games.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
47,Fluke_Skywalker,Turtle Powers its way past serious flaws,6,14 August 2014,"From the start, the Michael Bay produced 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' has been viewed with a great deal of angst and suspicion by long-time fans. From casting to design, this new reboot just didn't seem to be getting anything ""right"". Having just watched it, I can say that these fears are not unfounded. The cast--including the voice cast--is weak, the new Turtle designs are beyond awful and the script is thin, uninspired and full of holes. How then does this movie still manage to be moderately entertaining? I don't know, maybe it gets by on the good will and nostalgia I brought with me into the theater. One thing I do know is that the audience I saw it with was %70-80 boys under the age of 12 and they absolutely loved it. In the end, that's likely more important than pleasing a bunch of griping Gen-X man-children like me.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

49,r96sk,Bored me,5,8 January 2021,"Flat, generic, CGI-filled. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' bored me, unfortunately.I have a slight memory of seeing bits of TMNT when I was younger but never intentionally watched it, though have always been interested in viewing a film with them in. So in that sense, this disappointed. It just has nothing about it, no character or charm whatsoever. No reason to care for any of the onscreen bunch. Very plain.None of the cast stick out, particularly the voices. Megan Fox is probably the best this has to offer, though I didn't mind William Fichtner either... Whoopi Goldberg shows up in an alright minor role too, I guess?I found little to zero of the action scenes entertaining, not helped by some questionable editing and music. Another issue I did also notice is the humour, which falls flat at almost every opportunity - especially with the grating Michelangelo (Noel Fisher).I'll check out the sequel, because I always going to, but I ain't expecting much! This 2014 film isn't worth seeing.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
50,MissSimonetta,"Well, it's not as bad as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3...",3,8 August 2014,"I did not expect much from the new TMNT film. It was going to be big and dumb, and I was ready to be entertained. Even with these low standards, this movie proved to be a disappointment.The one shining grace this film possessed were the characterizations of the turtles and Splinter. Their family dynamic and individual personalities were wonderfully realized, and their dialogue was the best in the whole movie.This strength is canceled out by everything else in the film. Megan Fox is atrocious as April O'Neil. Her face is blank and open-mouthed throughout the whole movie. But I don't know whether to blame this on the actress or the screenwriter, since the script barely gives April a semblance of personality. About the most depth we see from her is a stock back story involving a dead father. Will Arnett is little more than your typical snarky sidekick as April's cameraman/love interest Vernon, who manages to be even more one-dimensional than he was in the 1980s cartoon series.The film's breakneck pacing may be its greatest flaw. It's all about getting to the next fight or chase scene, with the story and characters playing second fiddle. There's no time to breathe or get to know the characters at all, probably because the screenwriters make the assumption that if you're in the theater, you must already be a TMNT fan who knows the characters intimately, so they figure they don't need to spend time fleshing anyone out. YOU are expected to bring pre-existing emotional connections, instead of having the story do this on its own. There is an attempt to shoehorn in some heart and a message about brotherhood at the last possible second, but by then, it's too late. This lack of emotional connection makes the film, for all its big action set pieces, as boring as can be.I never figured I would hold up the 1990 TMNT film as anything more than a nostalgic favorite, nor did I expect to be comparing it to this new film, but seeing as this movie takes so many plot points from the earlier one, I cannot help it. TMNT 1990 is not great cinema, but as entertainment, it does its job. TMNT 1990 is not one fight scene after another; there are genuine character moments, moments where the film slows down and allows you to get to know your heroes. Moments like the turtles and April bonding at her apartment or Splinter's telepathic communication with his disheartened sons are pretty basic character moments which make the action scenes all the more involving, because you actually feel invested in what is at stake for these people you have grown to love.That the movie is also joyless is a big part of its undoing. TMNT 2014 works best when it is goofy and not taking itself too seriously. The dark moments are just bland and feel derivative of what you've seen in every other big, dark blockbuster that's come out in the past five years. Heck, even the action scenes aren't that good. They're shaky, over-choreographed and barely comprehensible. How am I supposed to ooh and aah if I can't tell what's going on?If you are a TMNT fan like me, then you will want to see it no matter what anyone says. Just don't expect much going in.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

52,3xHCCH,Dark Yet Juvenile Reboot,5,13 August 2014,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are characters that were first seen in comic books way back in 1984. Since capturing the fancy of the audience, this franchise spun off to have its own cartoon series, toys, video games, and of course, films. The first TMNT live-action film was shown in 1990, followed by two sequels. In 2007, a CGI-animated film simply entitled ""TMNT"" was shown. This current TMNT film is a live action-CGI combination, and is a reboot of the franchise, produced by Michael Bay and directed by Jonathan Liebesman.In this reboot, we start at the very beginning again, before the world knew about the turtles. April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is a TV journalist who desperately wants to be taken seriously at work. When she incidentally witnessed shadowy figures fighting against some criminals, she reports them to her boss, who of course does not believe her. She will later discover that these unseen vigilantes are actually four young overgrown turtles with ninja fighting skills. From there, we will again be told the origins of our four heroes in a half-shell who are named after Renaissance painters. There will be certain big changes in the story of how the turtles came to be from how we used to know it. Their Sensei rat Splinter learned his awesome martial arts skills from a book. It also showed how April first knew the Splinter and the turtles as a little girl in her scientist dad's laboratory. When main villain Shredder (this time in an all-metallic suit armed with boomeranging blades) finds out where the turtles' lair was, he and his henchmen attack it and abducts three of them captive in order to suck out their blood to extract the secret super formula that runs in them. Of course, the bad guys leave one turtle, as well as April and her driver/admirer Vernon (Will Arnett), to save the day. You know how this story will end, so that should not a spoiler, is it?When Michael Bay's name is attached to a film, we expect wild action and big explosions,a nd we won't be disappointed here. The ""cowabunga"" action sequences still ruled! Even Splinter had a grand fight scene with Shredder. This reboot is for the young kids of today so it is acceptable and understandable that everything felt so juvenile. The sense of humor in these action scenes is also juvenile, most of the visual jokes would be best appreciated by young kids. Most adults could muster a smile at least.Megan Fox seems to be Michael Bay's muse, as she also appeared in Bay's other franchise, Transformers. She is no doubt beautiful, but unfortunately her acting sadly remains to be very amateurish. David Arnett is not really any help if his function here is to be the comic relief. His character was actually extraneous with corny lines.However, the best part of film remains to be the Turtles themselves. They are as we know them: Leonardo the serious leader. Raphael the hotheaded one. Michaelangelo the whimsical one. Donatello the smart one. They were made to look a little darker, heftier and angrier, like most classical superheros are expected to look these days. No more bright cheerful colors allowed, it seems. Nevertheless, these Turtles are still fun and funny for the younger set, and fondly amusing for the parents. That silly elevator scene is proof of this appeal. These cool Turtles will endure despite the uneven quality of this film reboot. 5/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
53,Amari-Sali,"The turtles are back and while they remain comical as ever, they take being ninjas more seriously and are a bit more violent than past iterations.",8,15 August 2014,"Growing up in the 90s meant amongst the many cartoons you watched, there was also the live action shows like Power Rangers and watching the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on repeat. Fast forward 2 decades after the last live action movie and the boys return, in CGI form, and they lose some of their goofiness and sort of inherit a post-Christopher Nolan's Batman world. One which has them look a bit more frightening than corny; fight scenes which not only may make you flinch a bit, but show people possibly getting hurt; but still keeping the spirit of the original through showing that, in the end, the turtles are just a bunch of teenagers trying to make their father proud.Characters & StoryA young reporter named April O'Neill (Megan Fox) is trying to transition from doing fluff pieces to serious journalism. Something that she thinks she can do if she breaks a story on this rising gang called the Foot Clan. But between a lack of faith from her cameraman Vernon (Will Arnett), and her boss Bernadette (Whoopi Goldberg) not taking her seriously when she claims to have witnessed not just the Foot Clan stealing from cargo containers, and vigilantes fighting them, she is nearly laughed out of her job.Unbeknownst to her though, at first, below in the sewers lays a rat named Splinter (Tony Shalhoub) who has spent his life raising 4 turtles as his own, and training himself, and them, to be ninjas. One being the tech ninja Donatello (Jeremy Howard); the silly, and very comical, Michelangelo (Noel Fisher); The would be leader of the group Raphael (Alan Ritchson); and his 2nd in command Leonardo (Johnny Knoxville). Together, these brothers have to work together as Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) tries to rise back in prominence and take over New York. But with Raphael talking about going solo, partly due to his bickering with Leonardo, will the brothers stay one cohesive unit long enough to protect and save the city?PraiseOne of the good things about living in a post-Christopher Nolan Batman world is that it makes it so it feels like all your childhood favorites are growing up with you. For with Nickelodeon being the type of company which somehow balances making children's entertainment, and yet not forgetting about teen and adult viewers, it makes this film quite entertaining. For example, unlike in the original trilogy I got an emotional response from this. For there is really a strong focus on family bonds and how the turtles rely on each other, and Splinter, and the dynamic makes some of their dire challenges something which can get you teary eyed.Then when it to the action, this film blew me away a bit. For unlike Guardians of the Galaxy, the fighting didn't look WWE style where everything was planned and choreographed to the T. Be it because of the use of CGI or perhaps better stunt men/ motion-capture performers? I don't know. Either way, the scenes, especially when Shredder was fighting, really brought the idea that these turtles aren't some god- like force which undoubtedly were going to defeat Shredder. For moments I was actually able to forget I know the ultimate result as Shredder really took it to the team.Leaving one last thing to praise: the jokes. Now, I only laughed 12 times but I was pretty much smiling throughout because between Michelangelo and Will Arnett to a point, this film is very comical. Most of the laughs though come from Michelangelo trying to woo April, as well as the general way people act around April because she is attractive. Reminding me, despite Megan Fox perhaps not being known as the most talented actresses out there, she does make for a decent protagonist and even feels more developed than most woman get to be in action movies. She won't make you tear up or anything like that, but she does show she is worth her salary in my opinion.CriticismLeading us to talk about the minor issues, for me, when it comes to the movie. Such as Splinter, for some reason, he seems to be the only one who speaks Japanese out of his whole crew, which I thought was strange. Then comes the issue of Shredder's lack of ambition which reminded me of of Dr. Evil, from Austin Powers. You see, Shredder's goal in the film is to take over New York with this toxin, and considering how the toxin was to be airborne and Shredder had the antidote, his ambition of taking over New York City just seemed so minuscule to me.Overall: Worth SeeingAdmittedly, nostalgia is what tips this from being TV Viewing and being labelled Worth Seeing. For while the criticism is mostly just nit- picking, the turtles definitely do feel inspired by the times, and while the inspiration does well for the movie, I do feel like it sort of makes it so it loses its ability to be for kids in the process. Though with kids nowadays being different from when I was growing up, maybe this does fit for my current age range, and this up and coming generation. Either way, with good laughs, superb action, and a nice heartfelt story about the importance of family, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles returns to the big screen and definitely feels like it warrants a sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
54,masonsaul,Really good action movie,7,25 July 2020,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a really good action movie that's fun, funny and enjoyable. Johnny Knoxville, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson and Noel Fisher are all great as the Turtles but could have used more screen time and Shredder is forgettable. Megan Fox, Will Arnett and William Fichtner are all good. The CG is impressive. Jonathan Liebsmann's direction is really good, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Brian Tyler is also really good.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
55,Seraphion,Long action sequences packed on a normal runtime movie,7,10 August 2014,"In New York City, a TV reporter April O'Neill, discouraged by her cameraman Vernon, instead chases a lead at the docks, where she sees glimpses of vigilantes, the Turtles, fighting back Foot Clan thugs. Her station dismisses her to lacking evidence. The movie then explains about Eric Sacks and Shredder. One night April gets taken as hostage when the Foot Clan fishes out those ""vigilantes"". The Turtles, watching the CCTV, cleaned the thugs in a flash. Hearing their loud voices, April chased the Turtles and take a photo of them. The Turtles demand her camera but she fainted in disbelief. As she wakes up, April pries more about The Turtles. They leave her after warning on secrecy. April remembers the Turtles' origin, pet turtles experimented by Eric Sacks and his father. After going to Sacks for info, April is brought by the Turtles to Splinter, who fills in the missing details. He also told her Sacks is Shredder's apprentice. At that moment Shredder and the Foot Clan raid the sewers. Splinter gets beaten bad and Leo, Donnie, and Mikey are captured. Sacks explain the plan to release a toxin that's curable only with the mutagen in the Turtles' blood. Raph and April calls Vernon and they go to rescue the three. They storm into Sacks' mansion. While Raph handles Shredder, April free the three by dosing them adrenaline. They then race back to NYC. They fight Shredder on top of Sacks Tower while April and Vernon go to Sacks' lab. The Turtles gang up on Shredder, playing their inside game, knocking him over the rooftop. Sacks pin April and Vernon but they manage to subdue him. Shredder still survives and the three buys time as Donnie defuse the poison bomb. When the poison failed, Shredder cuts the tower's beams so the Turtles take place holding them. April comes with the mutagen and Shredder cuts the tower and snatches the mutagen from her. Hanging on the tower, Shredder launches a blade that makes April let go of her grip. The Turtles then form a human chain err, a turtle chain.. err, a ninja chain err ah I bet you know what I mean and catch April. Leo launches one of his katana that hit Shredder. They then swing themselves and, with her at the spearhead, April kicks Shredder so he lost his grip and fell on the ground, creating a deep crater. But the movie shows as the mutagen container breaks, Shredder slips into the sewers leaving his armor behind.The story is a nice reboot of all those previous TMNT works. I do't agree with some voices saying that the focus is less on the Turtles. For me it's quite nice for a number of reasons. First, they're ninjas, they suppose to be secretive and stealthy, so it's fine if we don't get to see them at the very early in the movie. Second, It's a reboot of TMNT. A reboot should work the birth and introduction of the hero in a different way than any previous works, so retaining the mystery early on is quite nice for me to differentiate from other TMNT works. Yet I do agree with the opinions saying that this movie paces itself too fast. As a franchise reboot, with all the risks of flunking, It seemed that the developers put some much material within just a short duration of 90 minutes, compared to Transformer movies that now touch 120 minutes runtime.The comical references to various pop culture products are very funny. It's a nice way to reposition the Turtles on the franchise map, after being absent so long from the cinema screens. The jokes are also hilariously funny and enjoyable. It becomes more enjoyable because they're placed on timings that you won't be anticipating. The one worth mentioning for me is the 'MC Mike in da house' goof.Well, for Megan Fox, all is back to smiles and handshakes with producer Michael Bay after the 'incident' on Transformers. It's nice to see her acting here, although what I remember is that April O'Neill has a curtain-like hair on the forehead, which Fox lacks. It's surely a long while since I last saw Whoopi Goldberg, it's too bad that she doesn't have any more significant role.Standard of a Michael Bay movie, the visual effects are nice. But I think the details on the Turtles are a bit over. Their noses look kind of scary, especially when compared to the animation version.My say for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) is a solid 7 out of 10. It's entertaining indeed, although it's a predictable cliché. A recommendation is a so-so decision from me, though.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
56,rgkarim,Turtle Action Power!,8,8 August 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a series that holds a special place in my heart, as well as the hearts of many people. Ever since the heroes and the half shells entered our homes decades ago, fans have enjoyed outrageous jokes, comical fights, and colorful creatures to face up against our noble four. So when Michael Bay announced his plans to produce a new film to modernize the Turtles, mixed reviews poured in about what was in store. The evening has dawned, and once again I've gone back to the hallowed halls of the movie theater to bring you a review. Was Bay's latest project another prolonged mess, or did we get a turtle adventure worth seeing? Read on to find out. I'm going to come out and say it, if you go in here comparing the movie to the turtles series we grew up with, then you will hate this movie. Of course this movie is not going to break the nostalgic love many hold this series with. Instead, one should go in looking for a new spin on the series, and trying to admire the adventure set forth. TMNT has brought something back to the series that was lacking for some time action. Under Jonathan Liebesman's direction, this installment grabs the audience by the back, or shells in some cases, and takes you for a fast paced ride. From the get go we get awesome CGI battles, where extras are flung against walls by computer created turtles, whose design was not as terrible as many make it out to be. The animation is smooth, as the four turtles smoothly perform their martial arts, wielding their weapons to defeat the very lame foot soldiers. Most of the movie is adrenaline infused, seldom stopping to explain the point of fighting as they move from one battle to another. Fast paced moviegoers like me will be bobbing in their seats with excitement, wondering what stunt the turtles will pull off next. Yet for so much action in such a short time period the story is sacrificed. In this reboot the story has taken some interesting twists. The classic tale of the turtles origins is turned into one that brings April O' Neil (Megan Fox) more into the story. Again, die-hard purists might be screaming in outrage at the blasphemy, yet the story is not half bad despite how simple it is. Even the change in characters is not as grandiose as we expected. Vernon (Will Arnett) the egotistical cameraman has become a love struck puppy that is out to get a date with April. While not looking the part, Fox brings April's stubbornness to life, though she is not quite the damsel in distress as back in the cartoon days. Fox does not do a bad job with acting, nothing that is award winning, but not as awful as we thought. Splinter even takes a bit of a change, a lot more aggressive than the sensei we know, with one of the best fight scenes of the movie. Yet the wise rat isn't as key a player as you might have expected from the trailers. As for the Turtles, their diversity and characteristics continue to withstand the tests of time, though with a little more edge to each of them. In both design and attitude, the turtles bounce a lot of the classic humor off of one another, and mix it into the flow of the movie without much disturbing to the action. Michelangelo doesn't get to pull out as many punches as the rest of the gang, but brings his surfer bum humor into the fray to make it fun. Donatello 's geeky side comes out in full force, most of his participation technologically oriented to go with the inventor side. Raphael gets the most time of the turtles and brings more of the aggressive muscle; while Leo stays the same honorable leader he always is though again doesn't get much time on the big screen. The team works great together though, and the voice acting for each of them is well suited for the design of the turtles. The writing for the movie is very much like the show, filled with cheesy jokes and simplistic laughs though a lot less puns. Regardless, the results are it is funny and silly, though perhaps a bit too different for those looking to relive the glory days. The new turtles movie is not the disaster that it had the potential to be. Having Bay as the producer instead of the director was a better decision for this reviewer, because it put the explosions to a minimum and the action I expected to the max. Stable camera-work and animation keeps you in line with the action, allowing you to actually keep track of what is going on. While there is indeed a major divergence in the classic story and humor, it is still a fun adventure. Again I love action movies, but I think many will find this movie a fun flick to watch. Would I bring kids? It is true that there is a PG-13 rating due to the violence and terrorism themes, but I think most will be able to handle it, just exercise some caution. Was it worth a trip to the movie? For action lovers and non-purist TMNT fans, I think it is worth a trip. As for the casual fans, I think this one can wait for home, because it doesn't have all of the aspects that most audiences seem to enjoy. Overall my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie overall: 6.5-7.0",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It Respects the Turtle properties but is still underdeveloped,5,10 August 2014,"Some particular characters just have trouble coming back to movies. It happens even to the most popular of characters. After Batman & Robin (1997), it took almost a whole decade before the caped crusader returned in Batman Begins (2005). Clark Kent was another; after Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), it wasn't until Superman Returns (2006) that fans saw the man of steel of again. A big chunk of the reason why these characters went into hibernation was due to poor box office numbers and critical responses at the time. The same can be said for the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. After Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993), nobody saw another live-action theatrical release until now. What a wait, and after all this time, has the time paid off? In some ways yes, but in other ways no.When Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) failed to bring in any acclaim, it was time to head back to the beginning. Time travel was no longer an option. The introduction starts off somewhat similar to that of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), with a city terrorized by a mysterious gang known as the Foot Clan and April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is going to be the reporter to reveal the truth. Or at least so she wants to be, and this is where things get different. O'Neil is no longer a top news anchor, she's low of the low, struggling to make it to the top. The weird thing is, it's hard to feel much for any particular character. She has been molded into somewhat of a pushover. Ouch. Accompanying her is coworker Vernon (Will Arnett) who has a thing for April (gee what a surprise - but isn't he kind of old?) and together they make a discovery they never thought was possible.Enter the turtles Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo and Michelangelo. Four very large muscular reptiles that have quite a new look. For one thing, their personalities and design are more exaggerated than before which helps viewers identify them easier (even though the masks were enough). Noticeably, they look like what could've been the next generation turtles that were going to be used for the dropped TMNT sequel to number III. Thankfully, their back stories for the most part are not tampered with. They also all still have their respective personalities and mannerisms. The voices behind the CGI characters are commendable. They do fit the turtles nicely. Still, it would've been better to use as many practical effects instead of relying entirely on CGI. Those Jim Henson costumes were groundbreaking. Aside from this though, not many other characters have much to care about. First off, where is Casey Jones? Second, the villains in this film are averagely written. The Foot Clan itself has been changed drastically - they no longer are trained ninjas. They now carry pistols and machine guns. This cuts down on the hand-to-hand combat drastically and that's bad because this is a ninja theme based movie right? The infamous Shredder has now traded in background for looks. Yes, no doubt his suit is deadly,...perhaps too deadly. The writers were so focused on how much armor overload they could put on him instead of making a decent villain. Instead, his motivation to harm the turtles has no personal connection thus making him feel like a henchman. William Fichtner also has a particular role to play yet vanishes at the end with no closure of what his fate was.The plot is another unclear element. It isn't bloated with subplots but it doesn't come across as a plot that makes much sense. The comedy is a hit and miss as well. The comedic moments work the most when the turtles are in action. Other times like including fart gags and contemporary TV references feels a bit randomly thrown in. There was one scene that frustrated me. When Rapheal begins to emote to his brothers passionately about how he feels, this emotional moment ends on a gag. It undermines the whole scene! Back to action, several scenes do entertain but are not very tense. The best scene was the snow mountain chase, which looked like fun. Helping to make this ""superhero"" film as good as it could be was Brian Tyler's score. Uncommonly, Tyler does have a main theme for the franchise but doesn't reiterate it enough through the film to make it stick as the protagonists' head tune - and Tyler is better than this. Iron Man 3 (2013) and The Expendables (2010)? This should've been a walk in the park. Does it entertain yes,...but is it good as it could've been for a reboot, no.The turtles and the shredder receive astounding image upgrades and do have some energetic action sequences but only the turtles themselves have any shred of humanity. The human characters, plot, comical elements and music aren't developed enough to be truly special.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
58,Matt_Layden,Wait a minute...why don't I hate this movie?,6,4 January 2015,"The amount of hate people had towards the idea of this film before it even came out was staggering. Throw myself in that mix. All the things they were saying about the film; aliens, mo-cap, bay...everything seemed to be going against this film. Even after watching it, I can name dozens of problems I had with the film. So why don't I hate it? I had the same reaction to this film as I did with G.I. Joe - It's not the same as the original, but for some strange reason...I had fun watching it. Some of the biggest pratfalls with the film come with the origin story. Sure, you can change it up a bit, but to completely alter it baffles me. Gone is the backstory between Shredder and Splinter, which means there is no emotional resonance here. It's a shame they took this away because it feels so empty in this entry. Add on top of that the inane way they learn how to fight. Splinter teaches himself from a book they find in the sewer? Laughable.The film doesn't wait to get going, which is particularly good because the film lacks good story or characters to carry any slower dialogue heavy scenes. I don't really have a problem with this. I guess what I'm saying is, if you go in expecting to hate this film, you may come out surprised. Maybe even liking it? The action sequences are Transformers-esque, which is what one would expect from a picture produced by Michael Bay. Overloaded CGI fest spectacles. The difference is here you actually know what is going on. I'll take ninja fighting turtles over mangled robots clashing into each other any day of the week. At the very least, this feels a bit different, even if it seems familiar. The turtles fit their ""roles"" fine enough. Leonardo is still the confident leader, Donatello the brains, Michelangelo the goofball and Ralph the hothead. They all still love pizza, disobey their master, yet respect him highly. Splinter himself still spits out wisdom, kicks ass when he needs to and cares for the turtles as his own children. His fight sequence with shredder is one of the highlights of the film, I just wish it had that emotional backstory that it needed. Fox and Arnett have little chemistry together, he was hired for his comedy skills, her for her looks. Neither for the acting ability. Fichtner isn't fooling anyone with his good guy performance and Whoopi Goldberg of all people shows up as O'Neill's boss. Always there to disbelieve in ninja turtles. The bottom line here is that the film is light hearted family fun. The kids will probably love it, I didn't hate it, surprisingly. It won't hurt anybody to admit that you might like these Ninja Turtles.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
59,yoggwork,This one is really ordinary.,5,20 February 2019,"The image of the mouse teacher is too bad. Feeling that fox's image was completely destroyed, I couldn't bear to look straight at it. I don't know if there will be a sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
60,WeAreLive,Some what amusing to watch,7,21 December 2017,"Honestly, I was never really a fan of the turtle until they introduced the 3D demographics in 2012. But this movie was pretty decent and had few funny moments. Like when the turtles get stuck in a hole and Micky farts. 
The CGI in this movie is good the acting is decent but the story could have been improved.
The origin of the turtles is weird unless if it is the real origin because in this film April had the turtles as her pets and her dad gets killed. 
Overall not a bad movie but needs improving.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
61,brando647,There's Definitely Room for Improvement but I Didn't Hate It,6,28 July 2015,"TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was one of the most hated movies of 2014 before it ever hit theaters. There were rumors of changes to the Turtles' origins, complaints over the new character designs, and outrage over the casting of Megan Fox. I skipped it during it's theater run but knew I would check it out eventually because I've been a major fan of the franchise since I was a kid watching the cartoon and collecting the action figures. So what was the end result? I didn't hate it. I hesitate to call it good, but it wasn't the complete mess I was expecting after reading all of the critical hate and fan rage. It was about what I expected from a Ninja Turtles movie produced by Michael Bay in our current state of big bombastic summer blockbusters. This isn't a continuation of any existing TMNT series; it starts with Channel 6 News reporter April O'Neil (Fox) and her introduction to the Turtles during her unofficial investigation into the criminal activities of the Foot Clan around New York. We're given the usual introduction to the team and a modified origin tale (laboratory experiments instead of ooze spilling into the sewer) before the action kicks in as we're reintroduced to the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his shady business partner. The two of them plan on filtering the mutagenic chemicals from the Turtles' blood and detonating a biological weapon on the city population with aims to sell the antidote (brewed from the mutagenic ooze) back to them.I've seen multiple iterations of the ""heroes on a half shell"" so a new interpretation wasn't going to bother me. I was never disappointed in the muscular redesigns for the titular characters and, especially after an extra viewing, think it's mostly pretty cool. Each character has their own distinct visual style that extends further than the color of their bandanas. Their personalities are intact, if a little exaggerated, but this is a movie (supposedly) aimed at children so some goofiness is to be expected. Michelangelo in particular is a little too corny for my tastes but it rarely bothered me. I will say the biggest mistake, in my opinion, was casting Johnny Knoxville and Tony Shalhoub as voices. The voices just don't feel like they fit the characters and it's made worse because they're so recognizable (especially Knoxville). While I was cool with the new Turtle designs, I didn't care for the new Splinter. He just looksweird. It's got nothing on the original. One last ""fanboy"" complaint: I thought the Shredder's armor was way too complicated. Again, it would've been better to keep it simple like the original films. Now he's practically wearing a mech-suit with blade launchers and a magnetic gizmo to bring the projectiles back to his gauntlet. And he's somehow got super strength now, as he's knocking these enormous mutant turtles aside with relative ease in the final battle. I want Shredder to be a threat from his martial arts expertise, not gadgets and steroid abuse.But these are mostly aesthetic complaints. The movie is still enjoyable enough. I still love the Turtles and this movie captures them pretty well. The CG is pretty seamless and the Turtles seem to have a real physical presence, and there are some pretty cool action scenes to show them off. For the first time since the original 1990 film, the Turtles are taking full advantage of their weapons (no sausage nunchaku here). And, you know, despite all the panic over Megan Fox's casting as April, she was pretty good. There's a big difference between her performance here versus in the Transformers films: she actually seems to be trying as April. I've seen her chat about the Ninja Turtles in promotional materials and she actually seems to be a legit fan of the franchise; it's not hard for me to believe she actually wanted to do an awesome job here. So for the record, I'm cool with Fox's April O'Neil. William Fichtner has a sizeable role as a wealthy scientist who once worked with April's father. He's not given enough to do and I wish he'd had a juicier role than ""evil businessman"". I also wish the Foot Clan had been more ninjas and less militaristic mercenaries. I don't want the Foot Clan wielding automatic weapons; I want them going toe-to-toe against the Turtles in actual martial arts combat. And, note to the filmmakers, it ruins some of the suspense and danger when you literally have one of your characters admit that the Turtles are bulletproof (as long as they're hit on the shell).Are these the Ninja Turtles I grew up with? Yes and no. I thought the characters were faithful enough and the big budgets and improved CG can make for some really cool movies in the future if they're handled right. Now that we've got the obligatory introduction to the characters out of the way, future movies can spend more time creating exciting stories and less time reminding us of the Turtles' origin and individual roles (yes, we know Michelangelo is a party dude and Donatello does machines moving on). The villains' scheme in this movie is generic summer fodder (we literally just saw the Lizard try a similar move in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN) and we get absolutely no motivation for the Shredder's actions other thangetting rich, I guess. So far I'm totally fine with this new franchise, so bring on Rocksteady and Bebop or Dimension X. I'll probably even see the next film in theaters.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
62,bkrauser-81-311064,Deflating a Franchise Before it Even Starts...Again,3,21 October 2014,"I wish I was a fly on the wall the day Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was conceptualized. Better yet I wish I was there when it was pitched as a comic-book and cartoon franchise. Despite being completely absurd, the franchise as a whole has some serious legs chugging along through multiple re-imaginings and mediums. Yet this reincarnation of the boyhood staple, helmed by Jon Leibesman and produced by king of panem et circenses Michael Bay is just listless, characterless and crude. Bay's trick with Transformers (2007-Present) has been baiting its audience for years in the hopes that with each inferior sequel maybe one day they'll be one that brings it back to the heights of the first. But with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles there's no such bait.April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is a tough and resourceful news reportno scratch that, she's just a news reporter who stumbles onto a plot by the infamous crime syndicate the Footmen. Before she can get the scoop on their plan, a clandestine group of assassins appear out the night and foil the Footmen's plot, whatever that initially was. Now April is on the hunt for the mystery men in the night with the help of her trustyno tenacioussmarmythat's the word, smarmy cameraman Vernon (Will Arnett).I suppose there's not much point in the mystery; the assassins are in fact the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There's Donatello the smart one (you can tell because he wears glasses), Rafael the hot head (you can tell cause he's always angry), Michelangelo the funny one (you can tell cause he cracks wise), and Leonardo the leader (you can tell because he's all leader-like). Not only that but the turtles and their master Splinter have a very special and unlikely connection to April, a connection that may lead to their ruination.Not that any of this matters since the turtles, their history, their preoccupation with the Footmen, their shadowy leader Shredder and Shredder's plan to create destruction and mayhem are all prerequisites that are seemly tossed in like yesterday's late homework. No this movie isn't about character development and plotting; it's about explosions, car chases, fistfights and lots, and lots of shaky-cam. Through Megan Fox's at times questionable choices, we as the audience tour through set piece after set piece with everything moving too fast to be recognizable. It's like being drunk at a carnival rushing through the rides five minutes before closing time; its jarring, its dizzying and nothing sticks other than half-ingested popcorn to the ground.Jonathan Liebesman wishes he had Michael Bay's visual flair which might have actually been the perfect for TMNT (I seriously mean that without any sense of sarcasm). Alas instead of Bay's telephoto lens pans, his optical zooms and his grand-scale explosions, we're faced with Liebesman's shaky-cam which fit in Battle: Los Angeles (2011) but not here, no not here. Seriously is this guy the Herrod of tripods? Does he walk around studios and decapitates them all until one there finally appears a special tripod and absolves him from the sin of deflating a movie franchise?I guess this movie was popular enough in the Cineplexes to warrant a sequel which in spite of this mess, I'm rooting for. But unless the creators can give there actors and amphibians more than one broadly rendered trait, beef up the story to meet the action and actually show said action in an entertaining way I'm afraid we're going to have TMNT 2: Secret of the Ooff!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
63,quincytheodore,"This is not froth in coffee, it's that white stuff that accumulates at corners of your mouth when you're really thirsty",3,18 August 2014,"There's a certain level of absurdity in movies that I'm willing to overlook. Some may have convenience timing or occurrence, but TMNT has gone beyond any hope of logical salvation, it discarded any plausibility or decent common sense in that matter, and opted for samurai robot and explosion. I knew it was going to do that, but apparently my expectation was still too high. One of the characters embodies Michael Bay's philosophy, saying that knowing what people like is good, like froth in coffee. Well, this movie doesn't even resemble that, it's that white stuff that accumulates at corners of your mouth when you're really thirsty.Acting isn't much, there's Megan Fox who looks nice and everything, but she just looks completely in distress, it differs little whether the cause is ninja, samurai robot, or transforming robot. There may be a misconception that Fox' up close agape look is a selling point, or may be not. Will Arnett tries to bring some comedy, his character often wanders how he caught up in this mess, same could probably be said about the actor. The main problem is how the turtles look exceptionally superficial. Using CG is expected, although the end result appears too mutated for viewing pleasure. At times, they resemble bulked up Jar-Jar Binks, definitely not pretty. While the movie tries to personify them differently, they are just too unconvincing to build any kind of emotional attachment and end up rather shallow.Plot is a mess, it literally requires one to not question anything and merely marvel at the explosion. Even if the original story is a children cartoon, there has to be some coherency. TMNT doesn't want anything to do with any of that, with each passing minute the movie struts into the realm of impossibility even by dumb standard. Screenplay is poorly written, content is thin, near non-existent even. About half way most audience will stop their attempt to follow the plot, because it's exercise in futility and if one cares about story after about forty minutes, that's more work than the production put in the movie.I suppose in term of effects it fares slightly better. These scenes are the highlights, and at this point, one won't be surprised if the turtles developed wings and fly. Fights and some action scenes are decent, but it may have borrowed too much from Transformers, just change the robot in flying debris with mutated turtles in flying debris. Cinematography is very Michael Bay, tilted scene, rotating close up, damsel in distress, empty dramatization all around. I guess it works for mindless fun, but it's now more mindless than fun.The movie belongs in the sewer where it should just stay there, but considering turtle's life span, how it sells like hot pizza and Michael Bay's persistence, I fear for a sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

65,Terryfan,Shell Shocked,7,8 February 2016,"Now I am a long time fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and when I heard about this Reboot I was pretty much mix on it because while it could have introduce a new generation of fans to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles it also made the long time fans like me feel a mix of awe and let down.But I will give credit where Credit is due first off the motion capture for the Turtles is pretty impressive but personally I still prefer the costumes they had in the 1990 films but for here they did what they could but they could have done more with Splinter's design because it was just a shock to see what they didBut the Shredder's design I will say is very very impressive makes him looks like a villain should and as they say these days he look like a BossBut onto the film itself the animated intro to the film really show off a promising start with giving some of the back story to the heroes in a half shell But some of the jokes in this film really were like out of wax and one comedy scene pretty much left me in disgust because I grew up with the Turtles and I can tell you that scene wasn't even funny they should have been ashamed of themselves for adding that But the fight scenes in this movie are actually good even in the film's climax it was pretty tense through out The score in the film isn't bad as well just the credit song lead much to be desired I wish they could have played ""Turtle Power"" but we got a song that is so bad that I wouldn't let Shredder listen to it that's pretty bad there is some decent acting in this film plus a moment of emotionalWhile the story is interesting enough the film itself just makes me feel mix but it has it movements if you're curious give it a watchI give Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles an 7 out of 10 Cowabunga",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
66,Screen_Blitz,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles return for plenty of action, but only half the fun",5,2 August 2015,"It's been almost decade since we last saw the weapon-wielding turtles sweeping up the bad guys off the streets of New York. And with Nickelodeon Studios along with Transformers veteran Michael Bay serving as the production team, it is only expected that a reboot of the popular Turtles franchise would draw the attention of fans everywhere. Director Jonathan Liebesman serves as the working behind this reboot where he provides a tense, light-hearted action pack extravagant portrayal of our titular heroes filled with plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor and bombastic action, but perhaps not enough wit to assist the film in rising above a surface level. Set in New York City, the film sees muscle-wielding Rafael (voiced by Alan Ritchson), the wise-cracking Michelangelo (voiced by Noel Fischer), the techno-geek Donatello (voiced by Jeremy Howard), and the stealth master Leonardo (voiced by Johnny Knoxville) return as weapon- sweeping, pizza-loving turtles, who reside in the sewers under New York City with Master Splinter (voiced by Tony Shalhoub), a giant talking rat. When the city becomes terrorizes by the evil Shredder and his goons known as the Foot clan, the four turtles must band together with the help of a hot-shot news reporter April (played by Megan Fox) and his reluctant cameraman Vern (played by Will Arnette) to take him down. When people learned of Michael Bay serving as the producer, many were raising a red flag particularly for film-goers who have grown bored of his ""mindless"" explosions and misogynistic humor. While this signature off-the-walls mayhem demonstrated in the 'Transformers' franchise is left mostly deserted here, the influence of his bombastic filmmaking style certainly bleeds through. This is best demonstrated during the action sequences provide some fair amount of excitement and adrenaline, but nothing to blow the robot-on-robot action set pieces from 'Transformers' out of the water. The sequences provide a wide plethora of special effects and CGI explosions that are surprisingly intriguing to look at, but again nothing special. The turtles are brought to the screen an exhilarating CGI for the first time unlike the previous films which saw actors in costumes which look rather dated by today's standards. The performances however, is where the film greatly falters. Teaming up with Michael Bay once again is Megan Fox who like her character in the 'Transformers' franchise, provides almost nothing beyond sexy eye candy for teenage males. Her performance does nothing to make her stand out from the cast, most of which is dominated by the quartet who provide the voices of the turtles. The turtles in particular are mostly likable but the dialogue and humor these character spit out often borders on the line between cheesy and somewhat obnoxious. That is not to say there is anything wrong with character shooting overly cartoony one-liners especially for a kid-friendly fare, along as long as it's at least funny.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a marginally entertaining reboot of the popular TMNT franchise that while provides a fair dosage fun, lack the substance provided from it's ongoing source material. In the end, it serves as an extravagant thrill ride that many kids and teens (and at least some adults) will at least have a good time with, that is if they can get past its mediocre aspects.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
67,Troy_Campbell,Stupid and fun in equal measure.,6,14 September 2014,"Nowhere near as bad as the widespread panning it has received since its early August release in the States would suggest, this Michael Bay produced remake is equal measures stupid and fun. Lets get the major negatives out of the way first: the tone is muddled (it's unnecessarily dark in places), the Turtles are voiced by adults (and is overly gruff for Leo and Raph), the humour is hit and miss at best, and there are plot holes big enough to drive multiple Turtle-wagons through. Now for the good news. The action set pieces are crazily choreographed and full of energy, if a tad over-edited, and director Jonathan Liebesman unleashes his stylistic flair with aplomb. Whether you like the modernized, pumped-up look of the awesome foursome is a matter of personal taste (I'll give them a pass, just), however the special effects are fairly solid and they thankfully hold up in the frenetic fight scenes. Megan Fox does her best – which, lets face it, isn't even as good as Meryl Streep's worse – as tough journo April O'Neil, Will Arnett provides a few laughs as quirky sidekick Vernon Fenick and William Fichtner is always watchable when in wicked villain mode. Oh, and Shredder looks completely badass too. It's hard to recommend without some caveats, such as, lower your expectations way, way down, switch your brain off before viewing, and take an 8 year old whose own enthusiasm can rub off on you.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
68,pyrocitor,Froth,3,1 September 2015,"2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a movie that desperately wants you to like it. It name-drops all the things that it (or, should I say, its think-tank) thinks the cool kids are into, like Star Wars, Harry Potter, and superheroes (""oooh, he's doing the Batman voice!""), like a jeering 30-year old at a high school kegger. It also earnestly bleats how down it is with the fans, who previously boycotted it in contempt. Not only are we gifted with a placating, slick, anime-style opening montage (namedrop the '80s comics for full nerd-cred), but behold: ""Aliens?"" scoffs Megan Fox's April O'Neill. ""No, that's stupid."" It's a film that even tries to play off its inherently silly premise as slick and irreverently self-referential, saddling Will Arnett with a 'the-wink-is-for-subtlety' monologue championing the virtues of 'froth' – ""you know, light, sweet - sometimes people just want candy!"" Have you not fully succumbed to the Turtle Power yet, skeptics? The reality is, the 1990s Henson-garbed Ninja Turtles films were hardly masterpieces in their own right, but they knew exactly how to pitch their inherent absurdity with a pizza box full of enthusiasm and campy gusto. But there are no combat cold-cuts in their hulking 2014 counterpart, who doesn't really know who to pander to: a patented 'dark gritty reboot' (how novel! how original!) for the spillover adult fans, or a spunky adventure romp to lure in new generations of turtle-tots. As consequence, we have shadowy brawls at 'the docks' juxtaposed with fart and cat video jokes, a disjuncture almost as hilariously mockable as it is uncomfortable. Turtles Begin this ain't. Indeed, the most thrilling aspect of 2014's TMNT is, for a film with the name Michael Bay attached, how unimaginably safe it is. Director Jonathan Liebesman should be banished to the Hashi for under-performing so lazily on every possible front, sidestepping the cheery camp of the earlier Turtles for dour, paint-by-numbers Hollywood dross, with the occasional distasteful one-liner, usually objectifying April O'Neill, thrown in as comic relief. The wafer-thin plot is plagiarized from The Amazing Spider-Man, itself a masterpiece of the underwhelming, so brazenly (work from scientist parent, tragically deceased during protagonist's childhood, used towards genetic mutation, big, green reptilian creatures, and the dissemination of toxic gas throughout the city) that an upcoming subpoena from Sony would seem inevitable if any audiences were invested enough in the film to object. But hey – who needs plot when we've got action, right? Well, that might be the case, were the interludes in question propagated by more than a perpetual blur of indiscernible constant motion and flagrantly unconvincing CGI, like looking through a kaleidoscope going down a water slide. Laws of physics are not broken so much as shattered, burnt at the stake, and the ashes scattered through the sewers, rendering no consequence whatsoever to the mayhem, as composer Brian Tyler gloomily cycles through his Thor: The Dark World B-sides in a lacklustre attempt to jazz up the superhero vibes. Meanwhile, it's a constant toss-up as to which paltry CGI concoction is the most repugnant to look at: the embarrassingly grotesque turtles, the 'Wolverine-on-steroids' Shredder, whose behemoth armour is rendered ridiculous as he bounces about like a bunny in zero-gravity, or (my vote) the sickening Master Splinter, who resembles a plasticine figure decomposing under hot lights. Shudder. While there is the occasional whiff of excitement for those vulnerable to the iconicity of flipping turtles brandishing ninja weapons (the turtles improvising through a car chase turned fight down an avalanche is a mild highlight), it's a pretty dire realization that the CGI-bloated smackdowns are largely as engaging as the exposition sequences bridging them. And these include Megan Fox demonstrating her journalism prowess by googling ""Vigilante news in New York."" Hey - at least she knows better than to use Bing If anything, the unlikeliest complaint is the lack of down time with the turtles themselves. For those willing to look past the excruciating CGI and the largely garbage one-liners, there are glimpses of undeniable charm in just watching the famously one-dimensional hard-shelled heroes bounce off one another. One brief moment, interrupting a fight scene to have the turtles strike up an impromptu beatboxing session in an elevator is oddly joyful in its dementedness, and a welcome window into the kind of silliness that would have made for a far stronger turtles film (I would listen to their hip hop Christmas album). Does that excuse the inclusion of a CGI baby turtle dancing to Gwen Stefani, however? No. No it does not. Instead, too much time is devoted to the film's requisite human beings, wherein the rest of the cast fall well in step with the clear mess ensconcing them. The (un)believably awful Megan Fox evidently filmed the majority of her April O'Neill scenes while napping, although her brief spurts of feigned emotion are so ludicrously flat it's difficult to distinguish. Will Arnett coughs up the occasional chuckle as her beleaguered cameraman, though it's just as funny watching his facial expression grow steadily more sheepish as the film progresses (his interior monologue at each line reading: ""Oh, COME ON!""). William Fitchner, strangely overacting less than in his The Dark Knight cameo, halfheartedly tries for silky but ends up with snoozy, while watching Whoopi Goldberg shamble though the part of O'Neill's editor as if reading her lines from cue cards is a sad distortion of the '90s in itself. The sad truth about froth, which no one opted to tell Will Arnett: froth is best known not as candy, but as tasteless, disposable filler, vaguely nauseating if consumed in too large a gulp, and usually vigorously stirred away as quickly as possible to get to the real beverage underneath. In short: a perfectly fitting verdict for 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Cowabungled. -3/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
69,Pumpkin_Man,Ninja Turtles For the New Generation!!!,8,10 August 2014,"I'm not really what you'd call a TMNT fan. Of course I've seen all the movies and I still have my SNES Turtles in Time game, but I've never watched the 80's cartoons, or read the comics. I understand they slightly changed the mythology, but I really enjoyed this movie, probably better than I was expecting. They tried to make it funny and hip by adding pop culture references and having Michelangelo be in love with April O'Neil. Shredder's suit has been extremely updated by adding knives and swords that retract back after he throws them. Other than Will Arnett's character and Whoopi Goldberg's character mocking the idea, the movie takes itself pretty seriously with the idea of ninja turtles fighting and protecting New York from Shredder and the Foot Clan. It has great action, has a lightly dark tone, but makes up for it with comic relief and one-liners by the turtles. If you grew up with the cartoon series or love the concept, you'll love TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES!!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
70,RNMorton,Okay for the genre,8,23 August 2014,"Whatever it is that this genre is. I'll give you the good points and the bad points: Good: 1) Excellent basic plot. The main story for this movie made sense, connected the characters up very well, was somewhat derivative but with enough unique twists to be ""believable"" and interesting. That separates this from 90% of the non-Marvel entries in this genre. 2) Megan Fox is looking great and her sidekick does well enough in the shallow sidekick role. Didn't like Goldberg in the editor spot but Fichtner is a valid if fungible villain. 3) The running time was right on - not overlong as too many movies are now, long enough to do what it had to do. No filler. Bad: 1) The biggest flaw was grossly overdone CGI, enough that I said to myself this smells like Michael Bay (""dude, can we take our brewskies?""), sure enough there he was as an executive producer in the closing credits. In a cartoon type movie of this magnitude this was not as fatal as in other features. 2) Distinguishing the characters(turtles). I had a little trouble making out the different personalities, even to the end. Again, not entirely fatal. My 9 year old mildly enjoyed this, he doesn't always make it to the end of these things.

73,brchthethird,"Generic and ordinary, but still a fun time",6,15 January 2015,"People like to give Michael Bay a lot of flak for making over-produced, juvenile films that pander to the lowest common denominator, but for what it's worth people go and see them. Even though he only produced this remake, his fingerprints are clearly visible on the finished product (which is what this is: a product). When I was a kid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of my favorite cartoons to watch on Saturday morning and I even watched one of the original live-action movies, too. However, as an adult now, the concept seems pretty silly, to be honest. Giant, mutated turtles that know karate and fight crime? It's pretty far out there, but it's something that kids can enjoy and this movie works on that level. Still, the violence might be a little intense for the target demographic and a lot of the humor will probably fly right over their heads. But for me? TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was a slickly produced but generic action movie with little to recommend outside of the turtles. The plot was really basic and involves April O'Neil and Raphael going to save the other three turtles and stop Shredder from unleashing a toxin from one of the tallest towers in the city. If that sounds similar to THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, that's because it is. What worked for me was the humor and banter between the four turtles, who managed to have distinct personalities, as opposed to the Transformers. The animation on them was also pretty good. Shredder, on the other hand, was too over-the-top for me. He was definitely reminiscent of what Bay did with the Transformers, and looked like a mecha ninja suit with gigantic Swiss army knives on both arms. The human characters, sadly, were not well-done either. Megan Fox is laughable as April O'Neil and receives top billing, but she wasn't as bad as she was in Transformers. Will Arnett as Vern Fenwick was...why was he in this movie other than make passes at April O'Neil? Even William Fichtner wasn't given much to do as Eric Sacks, a scientist/businessman who worked with April O'Neil's father. However, one useful story innovation was creating a personal connection between April and the turtles (and Splinter). Overall, TMNT makes for a decent time-passer but is in no way a great film. It should satisfy the younger crowd it's aimed at, but I can't say whether or not fans of previous incarnations will enjoy it the same way. I pity the person who paid full price to see this in theaters, but it's not too bad for a rental.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

75,PartialMovieViewer,The Fail is Beyond Epic,1,31 December 2014,"As with most redoes, the original is so much better.

This move effectively discards all aforementioned attributes and glues its storyline to over-the-top CGI (typical), oh-so-very-special effects and poor lighting. Oh, and the powers-to-be smacked this chelonian trio with the un-funny stick so hard, I suggest discarding any plans for sequels. I did watch this movie and felt overwhelmed by the hum-drum boredom spewing from the screen. At first I thought all would be saved when April O'Neil entered. At least in the original, that's what happened when Judith Hoag's strong personality came on scene. Hoag's April successfully bridged the gap between real-world and sewer world, and further strengthened the brotherly bond of the turtles. I'm sorry, but Megan Fox just seemed wrong for the part. She is a very pretty woman, but she was not the right fit. I must be fare and say that it is not all her fault. These personalities of these turtles seemed much more superficial than the ones in the earlier movie(s), and that might have made her job more difficult.

77,RforFilm,What we Find in a Half Shell is an Empty story,3,10 August 2014,"Cowabunga dude! Now were getting into something that is very close to my heart, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was a proud member of kids that were obsessed with the pizza craving ninjas that fought crime against the evil Shredder. The dark comics and the light-hearted cartoon from the eighties is where most people were introduced to these characters, but it was the toys that swayed me over. I must have had dozens of turtle toys, creating my own scenarios that could have fit right on to the TV show. I think that my parents and a lot of older people have been baffled by the popularity of the heroes in a half shell.I think that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will always be to millennials what Scooby Doo is for the baby boomers; a story that has a great set up that has allowed not just one long series, but countless new versions. I don't keep up with the current turtles cartoon, but it's in the third series on Nickelodeon. It's still a big thing for kids and I can tell that their gonna make their parents take them to the new movie. With a darker tone, does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles finally get the live action scenario right?There have been live action turtle movies before (most that I find as guilty pleasures), but when Michael Bay was announced as a producer, the fan community reacted with outrage. He promised that he would remain true to the origins, and to be honest, he kept his word. April O'Neil (played by Megan Fox) is a reporter for Channel 6 in New York where she works with her cameraman Vernon (played by Will Arnett) to find out whose leading the Foot terrorist organization (yep, not ninjas). During a foot attack, O'Neil witnesses four vigilantes defeating them. She follows them to a rooftop where she discovers that the heroes are all human sized turtles; the noble leader Leonardo, the inventor Donatello, the cynical brute Raphael, and the surf lingo pizza obsessed Michelangelo. They take Miss O'Neal to the sewers where she meets their master, a talking rat named Splinter. The cause of their existence has to do with a mutagen that the animals got caught up in. O'Neil does more research to find out that she may have been part of the turtles history in a lab where her father worked. She also finds Eric Sacks (played by William Fichtner) who may be leading the Foot as the evil Shredder.While this is not the pop culture rape that most fans thought they were going to get, not much is here to make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles stand out. The best thing about the movie that was the hardest to get right are the turtles. Their personalities actually match the characters and are taken full advantage of. Listening to them spew their classic lingo was fun, but watching them was something else. Like a lot of fans, I hate the new design. The turtles are just so ugly and scary, that Freddy Kruger could give out ice cream compared to thesemutants.Not helping here is Megan Fox as April O'Neil. She had the right adrenaline junkie attitude, but her personality and motive is zero. I can't blame Fox here, as any actress would have given a similar performance. Blame that on a screenplay that requires people to already know the turtles before coming to see the movie. The rest of the story has the turtles stopping Shredder from destroying New York city, but that just the biggest problem. This is a major Mad Libs story that could have easily replace the turtles with Spider-Man or the X-Men and it would have not made a difference. Why couldn't the story really embrace the idea of ninja teachings and apply it to the turtles lives and their fights? That would have been a way more interesting set up.I'll give this three Shredder helmets out of ten. While this movie disappointed me, I'm not as angry as I was with Transformers: Age of Extinction as this is a short movie. I think that the movie's box office earnings is going to go down big come week two after all the excited kids have come to see this movie. We will eventually get a great live action turtles movie; it's just not going to be this one.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Upon a second watch in anticipation of the sequel, I could find some positive parts in this film but it is still pretty terrible. There is nothing wrong with the special effects and for the most part, the turtles aren't that bad, it's mostly everything around them from the plot to the acting to the shoddy camera work.Megan Fox plays the intrepid reporter April O'Neil and starts to ruin the movie from the beginning. When the film tries to incorporate and slapdash origin story, it feels contrived and ridiculous. Fox pouts and theorizes with her awful acting. I wish they had chosen a legitimate actress to help this silly film along and not Michael Bay's attempt at eye-candy.Will Arnett and William Fichtner look a lot alike and even have the same name so it is easy to mistake them. Arnett serves as the comedic relief, which is a bit of overkill since the turtles also attempt humor. Fichtner plays the villain Eric Sacks who conspires with the arch-villain Shredder played by CGI and Tohoru Masamune. The new Shredder will take some getting used to but his magnetic claws can be kind of cool.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
79,bryank-04844,This 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' reboot is a brainless two hour sub par action piece with no depth or character development.,2,15 August 2015,"So yes, this is a complete reboot with a new origin story of how the turtles became ninjas and over 6 feet tall, which receives the minimum amount of attention here, and is told through flashbacks and narration. It didn't get the attention it deserved, and being a two hour film, I fell it was a missed opportunity. But alas, Nickelodeon wanted only to blow things up and get to the next action scene as soon as possible. The story starts out with news reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) and her trusty camera guy Vernon (Will Arnett) trying to get a story on the evil Foot Clan, who wear masks like they do in 'The Dark Knight', who are terrorizing New York.The funny thing is, the Foot Clan are supposed to be a group of well trained ninjas, but here there is no fighting with fists. They instead fight with guns and bombs. Soon enough, April sees a few strange creatures take out some of the Foot Clan and she tries to get a few images of the vigilantes, but fails to get a good shot of them, and is thus fired by Whoopi Goldberg of all people for sounding crazy when she tells her story. Soon enough though, she comes in director contact with the turtles who bring her down into the sewer to meet Master Splinter (voiced by Tony Shaloub), who tells her and us at the same time her connection to him and the turtles. Meanwhile, there is a bad man named Shredder, who is in charge of the Foot Clan and is hell-bent on destroying New York City, and it is up to the turtles to put a stop to him and save the people of the big city with out being noticed.It seemed like Nickelodeon and Libesman didn't know what to do with the Turtles, so they tried a couple of things. They decided to make a realistic 'TMNT' movie, but when it came to the big bad Shredder, they went full crazy and made Shredder a giant robot who has the ability to make any weapon from his hands, throw these weapons anywhere, and have them come back to him via a strong magnet. It's laughable, because it doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. On top of that rubbish, the idiotic writers of the script decided to make Shredder a bad guy with no motive other than being just a bad guy who wants to kill people for no reason. He has the help of someone close to April, but again, it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, and it seems like they were trying to be clever, which they weren't.The comedy of the original films and cartoon series were great with some laugh out loud moments throughout. But here, the comedy is forced, unfunny, and very awkward. It's as if some 70 year old man tried to tell us what he thought the kids found funny today, and failed miserably all over the place. There is one exception where the Turtles are in an elevator waiting to fight their arch nemesis at the top of a tall building, and to pass the time in the elevator, the turtles break out into a beat box rap.It's a perfect moment as we see the turtles finally being teenagers and fun, but then suddenly turn into bad-asses in a split second. It's the best part of the movie and doesn't last more than 20 seconds. I just wish there was more of that type of delivery and entertainment in the movie. But there isn't. And bless Megan Fox's heart, she does give it her all, but man, she's just not a good actress at all. At no point do you think she cares about any character but her own, and her yelling some of the character's names throughout is just downright awful. And Will Arnett, as we all know is a comedic genius, but here, his chemistry with Fox is non-existent and it's as if Libesman didn't know what to do with him.His jokes run seriously flat and is very awkward to watch. And it's not Arnett's fault, it's just that he was not given much to work with. The voice acting on the turtles was fairly good, however having Johnny Knoxville voice Leonardo (the centered leader of the group), was a bit weird, because all I could think when I heard him talk was 'Jackass'.There were a few things that I did like. Although I think Michael Bay and Jonathan Libesman don't have a talented bone in their body, and I dislike their entire body of work, the image and visual effects look quite impressive. This is by far the best looking picture Libesman has done. And they did a good job in giving each Turtle a specific personality, true to their origins, but it is never explained how they got that way, or how Rafael has a thick New York accent when the others don't. It was also very cool to see Master Splinter have an epic fight scene, but they made Splinter look like hideous hairless rat who was unable to grow hair.This 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' reboot is a brainless two hour sub par action piece with no depth or character development. And it's upsetting, because it could have been a movie that had all of that and could have been another $95 million weekend at the box office, but it won't be. Instead of seeing this piece of garbage, I suggest you find the original film from 1990 and watch that instead, or go see 'Guardians of the Galaxy' again. And for some reason, Libesman decided to pay tribute to the 1990 film a few times throughout the reboot, but there was no mention of Vanilla Ice or the Ninja Rap, and that is a travesty.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Arrives at full speed and never slows down; but it doesn't ware the audience out nearly as quickly as other movies Michael Bay has been responsible for. By far the darkest TURTLE movie (first to receive a PG-13 rating). Pays much homage to predecessors (i.e. April's yellow jacket from the cartoon series or a slice of pizza landing on the top of Splinter's head like in the 1990 film, just to name a few). Nice to see the live-action debuts of Karai (Noji) and Vernon Fenwick (Arnett); let's hope to finally see Bebop and Rocksteady in the sequel(s), as well as the return of Casey Jones. If you hated this movie, at least be grateful they didn't go with Michael Bay's ""original"" idea of having the turtles be aliens. All-in-all, it's the dialogue that really brings this outing down; but ultimately, the experimentation works pretty well. Creator Kevin Eastman makes another cameo, this time as a doctor.*** (out of four)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
82,Darkside-Reviewer,Generic and unfunny,4,26 March 2021,"I only recently got around to watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014). I put off watching this movie for so long mainly because of the bad reviews the movie received and because of how bad the CGI looked in the movies original trailer. Michael Bay who produced the live action Transformer movies wasn't satisfied ruining just one beloved cartoon series he just had to ruin another.This live action interpretation of the popular cartoon characters Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael is not just the worst live action turtles movie but is also one of the worst entries in the franchise altogether. This may sound like bit of an exaggeration but when you think back to the 80s and 90s interpretations no matter how cheesy or silly they were in terms of humour or costume quality, there was always something entertaining and memorable about watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In this ""new"" interpretation however there is nothing that really stands out other than the awful CGI.The turtles personalities have been watered down to their most basic character traits. Leonardo is the serious no nonsense leader, Donatello is the smart nerdy one who builds things and uses computers, Michelangelo is the loud and hyperactive one and Raphael is the moody rebel who clashes with Leonardo. That's the new turtles in a poorly written halfshell. The turtles do admittedly act a bit more like modern day teenagers but that's also the problem they act like modern day teenagers after drinking a six pack of red bull. The movies idea of humour is written more for modern day children than it is adults or actually teenagers only a young child would find this movie funny or entertaining.As you might have guessed all the turtles are animated by CGI. The turtles admittedly do look at lot more like actual turtles but sadly that leaves them looking like hideous green abominations that would have given my actual nightmares as a child. The worst looking character in the entire movie is master Splinter who looks a bit too much like a human sized rat. Splinters character looks genuinely terrifying like a five foot rat with wet fur that leaves him looking like plague rat.There isn't much fighting or action in the first half of the movie with most of first half focusing on April O Neil's character followed by an unnecessary turtles origin story. When the movie eventually gets round to scenes of the turtles fighting most of it just CGI with live backgrounds. The final fight scene between Shredder and the turtles is again just CGI and is less fighting and more the turtles getting knocked down by a single punch. The foot clan never fight hand to hand they instead use guns, bombs and shock wire launchers which makes them more like actual terrorists than a gang.Megan Fox plays reporter April O Neil and while her acting is definitely a step up from her performance in Transformers her character is written the exact same way as her character in Transformers. Megan Fox's purpose in this movie is just to wear a yellow jacket and basically be eye candy for teenage boys. There are several scene's throughout the movie that focus on Megan Fox's body for example one scene has her character jump up and down on a trampoline for no real reason. Another has her leaning out of a car window while another character stares at her behind in a close up shot. Michelangelos character has a crush on April which leads to several creepy scenes of April being hit on by a six foot CGI turtle who's character is meant to be a adolescent teenager.The main villain of the movie is of course the Shredder who's face is shown very early in the movie as just an average looking guy with some scars. After that the Shredders character only appears in the movie wearing a robotic samarai suit which is entirely CGI making the scene showing his face pointless. The original Shredder never showed his face which made the character both mysterious and intimidating. Shredders character was always instantly identifiable by his mask and deep voice in this movie Shredder is just a guy in a robotic samarai suit with a robotic personality to match.The only actor in this awful excuse for a movie that gives a genuinely good performance is William Fichtner who plays Shredders accomplice/adopted son. Fichtners character was originally supposed to play a much bigger part in the film but for some reason the script was rewritten to put more emphasis on Shredders character being the main villain.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) adds nothing of worth to the Turtles franchise which really didn't need another live action movie since we already have the 1990 original which perfectly captures the nostalgic Turtles craze of the 80s and 90s. If your an old school Turtles fan I recommend avoiding this movie if you can help it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
83,griffolyon12,Not as Bad as I Feared,7,9 August 2014,"The heroes in a half shell finally return to the bigscreen, and while Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is probably the weakest of all the TMNT movies made thus far, there is a great deal to enjoy about director Jonathan Liebesman's movie.This Turtles movie is basically another retelling of their origin story, with a greater focus than ever before on the human characters, like news reporter April O'Neill, rather than the titular turtles themselves. Megan Fox is fine as April, though her acting chops aren't quite sharp enough to always sell the CGI turtles that she is supposed to be acting with. While I personally would have liked to see the Ninja Turtles themselves actually get more to do in the plot, their personalities were spot on, save for the too mean Splinter. I just wish less of the focus had been on the not so interesting human characters (sorry, but that's how it's always been with this franchise). Even with the villains, Shredder has less to do than the white guy villain played by William Fichtner, who is the real mastermind of the evil plot. With that all said, I kind of liked the revisionist angle that this movie took on the traditional Ninja Turtles origin story, having April's past being intrinsically linked with that of the turtles. Add on to that the heightened comic book style that this movie oozes (no pun intended) and you have the ingredients for a movie that will delight the targeted audience.If you have a kid, in particular a young boy, they'll love this movie. While there is a little more innuendo and cussing in this movie than there was in any previous Ninja Turtles movie, most of it is subtle enough to where it will go over most kids' heads. I mean, when you hear reviews from the kids leaving the audience in front of you, like, ""Best Movie Ever!!!"" You know that the movie works for who it's intended for. As an adult fan of the series, I know I am not the target audience, so that's why I'm a lot more forgiving of a lot of the shortcomings of this particular movie, because while it isn't the TMNT's finest hour, there is a lot of fun to be had here.This is the kind of movie that if you check your mind at the door, anyone will probably have a good time with it. The action sequences are top notch and imaginative, with the car chase down a snowy mountain being one of the most silly, yet fun sequences of action I've seen in a while. Plus, while so many complained about the giant size of the new Ninja Turtles and their super strength, they do look really cool when on screen beating up the bad guys. I for one would not mind a sequel to this particular movie to see if, with the origin story out of the way, the filmmakers can root their feet more firmly into this world and give it another go, because this is the first Ninja Turtles movie series where I could imagine seeing some of the weirder TMNT villains popping up. If you ask me, bring on the Kraang and explain the secret of the alien ooze that created the Turtles, similar to the current Nickelodeon TV show.I give Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a 7 out of 10!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
84,billygoat1071,Hinting The Real Joy,5,18 August 2014,"No matter how the name Michael Bay is attached to a fantasy adaptation, people will complain anything about the project. But as a producer, does it affect much to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Surprisingly yes. As the same as the public response about the Transformers franchise, people turned out to be ranting at the wrong stuff. At the post-viewing, maybe we can accept the heavy reliance to cartoony CGI, or the large amount of explosions, or the really poor plot. The real sin of these movies is its lack of interest to its main heroes and instead focuses on the human characters. Which is a shame, because it somewhat gets it right with the turtles, their stories are more interesting than the one we ended up seeing. The film does have some rewarding moments, but it just keeps hindering us to the less interesting parts which makes it disappointing.It is clear that if follows the same screen writing rules of the last Bay franchise. Instead of being about the Ninja Turtles, it rather centers on April O'Neil. Instead of fearing the Foot Clan, the threat would rather focus in some evil corporal manager. Any larger-than-life characters from the source material have only left out as the secondary need of the journey: the turtles are now plot devices and the Shredder is, for some reason, a henchman. I bet the fact that Casey Jones wears a mask is the reason why we can't have him in this film. For the story of April, it might only work as a subplot. There isn't enough theme or intrigue to accomplish unlike the one from its actual heroes. There is some talk about Raphael mistreating his brothers, which is a theme that was already done better in the past TMNT movies, and Master Splinter's backstory as the turtles' father, which is only presented for expository need. They don't get the development they deserve, which makes the drama in the end feels so forced and less than effective.April's arc would have been tolerable if it gives her more moments to actually connect with the turtles, but the only information it could provide is that they're her childhood pets, she's only using those beloved characters to her job, teasing us the much interesting world beneath the sewers. The palpable respect we may give to this film is the humor. It may not be fantastic and all, but it's not bad either, at least it defines one of its personalities. The action is obviously large and destructive, well at least we get to see more ninja action. The acting is predictable: Megan Fox's humanless expressions make her April O'Neil difficult to root for. The voice and motion-capture actors worked better for having a sense of fun in their enthusiasm.The single greatest scene of the film is when the turtles are making a tune out of an elevator sound. That is one of the reasons why we love these characters anyway. Newcomers will still convince the fans to give up nostalgia and move on to the changes, but that doesn't mean it has to diminish it as a generic/bland action blockbuster. The film just won at the box office, so definitely there will be a sequel. The only advice we could wholeheartedly give is to have more love to the heroes. We did saw that occasionally, but we hope to have more of their sewer life with their pop cultural obsession and mass consumption of pizza, plus have interesting villains, some real and not forced familial themes, and at least a solid plot since these Ninja Turtles movies hardly ever had one. The fights were the only parts that weren't tamed from them, because apparently that is what the filmmakers are mostly interested at. It just isn't enough, and as a fan, they should have focused on rebuilding its already richer world than this.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
85,DareDevilKid,Terrific Fun - A Jolly Good Time at the Movies,8,2 November 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.7/5 stars24 years after the first Ninja Turtles' movie, the return of the reptilian heroes in their half-shells are surprisingly enjoyable. It's a solid, fun and, light-hearted family action flick that captures the oddly enduring appeal of the half-shell heroes.Though all its glory comes from the effects work from behind a computer, the Michael Bay-esque Ninja Turtles are still a lot of fun. With exciting action sequences and great turtle banter, fans of the franchise should be able to enjoy the film, as long as they go in with an open mind. Plot-holes and some deviations from the source material aside, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is an insanely enjoyable and off the wall good-time at the movies. A terrific re- boot to a classic animated TV series that I and many others grew up with.Producer, Michael Bay and Director, Jonathan Liebesman have delivered an explosive, hilarious and tremendously exciting guilty pleasure that you can watch again and again. This movie packs a real wallop.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
86,RevRonster,"It has it's goods, it has its bads but I still had fun watching it!",6,14 August 2014,"Okay, the anger and the belief that Michael Bay is systemically taking apart our childhood memories by being involved in the big screen adaptations of famous 80s cartoons has died down until he decides he's going to attach himself to the next G.I. Joe film and the adaptations of Thundercats, He-Man and My Pet Monster. Now that it is over (for now), I put my personal feelings about Michael Bay aside and watched ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" You know what? I really enjoyed it.Granted, the film isn't perfect. It has its fair share of problems. First off, I felt the story moved way too fast and it did so at the expense of character development and drama. Additionally, even though the Robot Shredder looks cool, he was just too busy and too over-the-top to take seriously. He also felt like he was the last resort thrown in before the first resort was ever used—I'm trying to say it would have been nice to see a non-robotized Shredder take on the Turtles before he decides to use a robo-suit. I also wasn't too thrilled with design of Splinter—he looked like a soulless monster rather than a wise ninja master. Finally, I really wish Karai was a little more feathered out and it was very strange to see the Foot Clan as a militia group armed with guns rather than ninja thugs armed with swords and the likes. Finally, some minor elements of the new origin felt too contrived but were manageable and Will Arnett—despite being a guy I really enjoy—didn't bring much to the film.Despite the bad, I liked the exciting action the film had, Megan Fox was unusually bearable as April O'Neil, and I felt the film really nailed the characteristics of all the Turtles. Another thing I felt really worked was the designs of the Turtles. Gone are the days of the old puppets from the first films and while they still hold up and are works of engineering and movie-making genius they just don't look real. I honestly think this is the most realistic look the Turtles could have. I know people hated the fact they had nostrils and had clothing elements incorporated into their look and were gigantic (the Turtles are normally depict as small and in this they are massive—like, ""I don't know how they get through the sewer holes"" massive) but, in the end, I think that this made them look how real life Ninja Turtles would lookonce science gets off their butts and finally makes them. And while their looks may have been a tad obnoxious with all the do-dads and bells and whistles attached to them, each one was given costume elements that fit their personalities. Overall, I liked the new design the Turtles sported.It's clear we'll never get a Turtles tale that comes close to the dark and grittiness of the comic books and we'll have to settle for the marriage of the light of the old cartoon with a smidge of the comic darks that was started with the first live action film from 1990 but there's nothing wrong with this formula. For me, it works and I enjoy it. It still worked for me with this film and I felt it was a fun and entertaining reboot to the franchise and another reason that proves that almost 30 years later, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are still a relevant part of pop culture.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
87,destroyerwod,Not as worst as i tough yet... not as good as 90s,6,22 December 2014,"I will be honest i tough this was gonna be crap. Yet somewhat i appreciated the humour of the turtles and like there persona. But the rest... the plot was garbage... Why make the turtle giant? The Foot seem like zero threat as even there firearms do nothing. Robot Shredder has the persona of a broom... this just lead to awful CGI fighting that does not even look real. The character is never showed development...His daughter is in the movie, i know very few of the recent cartoons but i played the couple games about them and even tough she is in she do nothing to make her presence be worth at all.April is not so bad considered its Megan Fox... but the back story given is somewhat disappointing, i wish they would keep it like in the past.The story felt sooooo rushed... i wish we would had time to bond with the turtles...In any case, i had some chuckles, i liked the way the turtles spoke and such... so yeah it wasn't a bad time, thus why the 6, but it got too much the feeling of a Micheal ""cgi"" Bay sadly...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
88,The_Light_Triton,"Cowabunga, Shredder get back here and taste cold turtle steel!",8,17 August 2014,"A lot of people give Michael Bay a lot of flack for practically everything he does. Actually, that's an understatement. People hate the guy. He's produced films with budgets in the 9-digit range, and usually those films are based upon a person's childhood superhero or cartoon, but whenever Bay makes a movie, he changes so many details, the people who see his films are disgusted. However, to say his films suck entirely would be a lie, as most of the stuff he's produced is very entertaining, and full of action fuelled by CGI and 3d effects. And sometimes the stuff he makes doesn't stray too far from it's source material. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is like that.In this one, April O'Neil is after her big scoop for the Channel 6 News. While investigating why a bunch of new yorkers are rushing out of the subway, she comes upon a foot clan attack, and ends up being rescued by 4 mysterious vigilantes. After being rescued, she pursues them, and discovers that her rescuers, are none other than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.OK, I have 2 major negatives, giving this movie it's 8/10, and they're both in the casting department.First, April O'Neil. The movie should've been called ""The TMNT & April O'Neil"" because a majority of the time, the camera was pointed at her. For the first 20 minutes, i was dying to see a turtle instead of her. I know Megan Fox has her admirers, but I really don't care much for her, and the role of April O'Neil should've gone to someone else...perhaps someone with red hair, maybe.Second, Donatello & Leonardo. all 4 turtles were superb throughout the movie, But the casting for them was off. For Leonardo, Johnny Knoxville as the voice? No, not him. I love Knoxville when he's trying to kill himself in the name of comedy, but as Leonardo, Hell no. I would've preferred Cam Clarke (The Original Leonardo) or even Michael Sinterklaas (The 4kids Voice Actor) over Knoxville. Also, Donatello. I would've loved to hear Rob Paulsen Provide the voice for him over the unknown who did, because Paulsen is the greatest voice actor of all time, Hands down.So whoever did casting for this movie, they're the ones who really, really suck.Now, the Positives.Michaelangelo is by far the best character, the one you will look forward to hearing and seeing in every scene. Just like the cartoons, Mikey is a joker, and almost every line he puts out will make you laugh.Second, the action. it's everywhere and you will get your fill of it. Michael bay loves CGI and 3d and it's everywhere. The action slows down to take advantage of the 3D effects (Which might be Cliché for some) but it's definitely enjoyable.Finally, to really appreciate the best part of this movie, you have to think back a few years when it was announced. The internet was extremely angry that Michael Bay wanted to make the Turtles Aliens instead of mutants. So the internet voiced their displeasure. And Mr. Bay listened. Guess what? The turtles are not aliens, they are mutants. Even April makes a reference to her friend asking if the turtles are aliens, to which she replies ""No, that's stupid."" So to sum it up, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a fun, full-length feature that everyone in the family can enjoy. There's almost no swearing, And the sexual innuendos are kept to a minimum. For a movie about our heroes in a half-shell, it's worth a view.8/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
89,Al_The_Strange,TMNT 2014 Review,6,18 August 2014,"There's hardly a kid born from the 80s who has never heard of this totally bodacious group of walking, talking, pizza-eating, street-fighting reptiles. It has always been a goofy saga, but it was also hip, action-packed, and colorful. Can the same be said about the latest adaptation?On the surface level, 2014's TMNT at least looks the part. It's a fairly breezy film that never takes itself seriously, packing on generous heapings of goofy comedy, stylish action scenes, and loads of special effects. The first half of the film takes its time to follow April O'Neil around, who inevitably uncovers the secret of the turtles' existence, and the outlandish Foot Clan plot to take over New York City. The last half of the film is pretty much all-out fighting and action, which includes a fight in the sewers, a lengthy chase scene down the slopes of a mountain, and a final showdown on top of a skyscraper. Thus, I found the last half of the film the most engaging.It's still not without its problems though. Despite the light-hearted tone and all the jokes, very little of it made me laugh outright. The humor is quite low-brow and doofy. Action scenes will be a hit and a miss; fight scenes in the film's first half are horribly shot and edited (on purpose nonetheless). Later scenes are still hectic, but are at least watchable and fairly fun. Scenes in between try their best to keep things rolling fast and without becoming droll, but without any major emotional investment, these scenes tend to drag a bit.Beyond the surface-level comedy and action, there's not much else to this film. The plot is pretty much a mash-up of typical TMNT fare and 2007's Transformers (also an adaptation of an 80s cartoon where human characters discover some weird life form and gets caught in the middle of a war nobody knew existed; both starring Megan Fox nonetheless). What plot the movie has is riddled with plot holes, and scenes that are simply way too unbelievable (maybe not a valid complaint for TMNT, but with the way the film tries to look believable, the film shoots its own creditability in the foot). The turtle characters are fun to watch, usually, and Splinter is one cool rat. They aren't terribly deep characters, but they are colorful, and there is just enough background to them to keep them from being total caricatures. Other characters aren't as good: April O'Neil is almost annoying as she obsesses over the turtles and shouts her findings at everybody she runs across. Her sidekick is a dork. Shredder is extremely flat, lifeless, and lacking in presence, serving little more than an excuse to have a boss fight at the end of the movie. The film draws some connections between all the characters to give their interactions more backing, but it only strains the creditability of the plot even further.The film's photography looks good sometimes and terrible at other times. Editing is choppy. Acting is pretty lackluster from the whole crowd; Megan Fox is far from endearing despite her looks, the voice acting can be a hit or a miss, and other actors don't really take their roles seriously, for better or for worse. Writing is pretty daft. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Locales are pretty small-scale most of the time. Special effects vary from good to bad. Music is okay (I got to admit that I found the end credits song catchy).This incarnation of the Turtles definitely has its flaws, but it tries to be a fun picture, and it is at least partway successful. Not everybody will be quite as easily charmed as I am, so I'm compelled to recommend approaching this movie with caution.3/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Marginal)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
90,ArchonCinemaReviews,TMNT is generic and weak but the turtles are heroes in a half-shell!,5,2 December 2014,"2014's remake of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles does not destroy childhood memories nearly as much as you think it will but does not live up to its potential either.Jonathan Liebesman brings back to life audience's childhood nostalgia for the pizza eating sewer dwelling superheros with ninja skills and a turtle shell. The screenplay by Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec, and Evan Daugherty re-imagines and adapts the teenage mutant ninja turtles (TMNT) for the Hollywood blockbuster treatment. April O'Neill is an aspiring news reporter and journalist hungry for her first big break. She discovers that enormous vigilante ninja turtles are defending the city from the evil Foot Clan led by villain Shredder. She along with Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight to protect and save New York City from the gang's evil plan.Michael Bay is only listed as one of the ten producers associated with the film. That said, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a decidedly Bay-esque vibe with the token though unnecessary sweeping aerial shots, overly saturated images, weak female characters and overall casting, and a generic storyline with uncohesively inserted action scenes.One thing the writers do actually get right are the ninja turtles. Their personalities and teen brother dynamic and banter are spot on and entertaining. The movie itself only grazes the surface of their essence and while Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles does a good job this is definitely a missed opportunity. The decision to have actors physically portray the turtles who were then CGI-ed into the superheros was brilliant and helped to convey the individual differences in their personalities.For some ungodly reason Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the film does not focus on the titular characters but instead on April, weakly formed and poorly acted by Megan Fox. A young 20-something reporter fresh out of college desperate for a break would be scrappy, youthfully reckless and naively idealistic. The character would be smart, ingenious, and not concerned with appearances except when it's a necessary evil to reach her ultimate career aspiration. Megan Fox captures and emotes none of the minutiae of this modernized character and is completely stone faced, minus the token pouting, throughout the entirety of the film.Overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is terribly cast and the performances are weak, cheesy and superficial to match the blandly unoriginal plot. If there is to be a sequel, I pray they focus on the turtles entirely and resign villain Shredder, love interest April O'Neill, sensei Splinter, cameraman Vernon, and TV boss Bernadette to super-supporting roles.For more FULL reviews of RECENT releases, check out our website.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

92,p-jonsson,"Meh, this remake did not really improve on the original",5,10 March 2015,"I have to say that this was a rather ""meh"" experience. It certainly was not an improvement over the original. Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it? The new story is sloppy and it is rather clear that whoever wrote it got only two directives: Make sure that Megan Fox gets a lot of focus and if you do not know what to write then cram in some special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie! It is obvious that Megan Fox's ego have had a lot of influence on the movie. To the extent that you might wonder if this movie is about the turtles or about Megan Fox. She might be the wet dream of some less discerning teenagers but her acting skills leaves somewhat to be desired. Okay, okay she was actually not too bad in this movie but then it was not to difficult to shine in this movie either.There are a few moments when it looks like it is going to turn interesting. For instance when the shredder is first introduced and punishes some of his underlings but rather quickly he is reduced to just another ""special effect"" when they slap this robotic shredder suit onto him. Come on, he is supposed to be a skilled martial arts combatant, not some freak in a robotic suit.Splinter was just sad. Some lab rat that picked up martial arts from a book he found in the sewers! What the f? That ruined a lot of the movie.The turtles themselves, being already pushed back somewhat into the background by Megan Fox desire to be in front of the cameras most of the time, are bland to say the least. They are immature, even for a movie like this, and the jokes are simply unintelligent and mostly not very funny.I was about to write that, if you like special effects and do not care for much of the rest, then you will probably like this movie but when I think back even the special effects where often only mildly interesting. They were perhaps not really bad but not very impressive either. The truck ride down a snowy slope was just silly and some of the scenes where actually rather underwhelming for instance.On the whole, to me, this was a mildly entertaining movie that could have been much better if someone with basic intelligence had been asked to write the script in the first place. There are actually five (!) people credited with writing this movie and maybe that is the problem. Too many cooks!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
93,johnnymacbest,"Entertaining on it's own merits, but underwelming.",6,28 January 2020,"When the first Ninja Turtles movie came out in 1990, it was an ABSOLUTE BLAST to watch, simply because it was a faithful adaptation of the comic books with character development and stunning visuals to boot; no thanks in part to Jim Henson's workshop of wonders.I've skipped out on this movie when it was first released, but having just watched it now, I could say with all honesty that I was entertained for the most part, but said enjoyment was marred by the underdeveloped characters; just like it was in the first Transformers movie directed by Michael Bay and even though he only produced this film, his influence clearly is felt throughout this film; especially in the script, which is filled with tired, cliched dialogue and plot twists you can see coming a mile away. The end result is a widely derivative and phoned in experience.Aside from that, I enjoyed the fight scenes, which are a plenty, though strangely and surprisingly enough, aren't as numerous and overblown like the Transformers films, but they do their job admirably.But the biggest problem with the film is lack of character development. It's a shame that Megan Fox gets more screentime than the turtles; barely does Kirai and Shredder get any development and as a whole, the film feels disjointed and unbalanced. The original film had a nice balance between character development and action, something this film sorely lacks. Nobody expects Oscar-winning material in a Ninja Turtles movie, but at the very least, flesh out the characters more other than let one of them hog the spotlight for a significant amount of time.So in conclusion, I suppose the film was entertaining on it's own merits, but ultimately, it was underwhelming.Sad really, because I was really looking forward to a return to form from the titular reptilian heroes.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
94,James_De_Bello,4.5/10,4,26 September 2014,"4.5/10 Being the movie such a dull, forgettable and unremarkable piece of entertainment, there's only one reason it manages to score a very weak four and a half for me and that is the expectations I went in with. I was anticipating this to be the second Transormers sh*t-fest of the year, I thought I was going to come out physically shaken just as I did for Age of Extinciton. But, I surprised myslef when I thought in the theater: ""Hey you know I'm not having that bad of a time, yes there is a despicable amount of things that are plainly wrong with it, but wow this is actually doing something to keep my interest on the screen rather than on checking the ending time."" The fact that I actually had some kind of fun in the cinema is, as I said before, probably due more to expectations rather than merits of the movie itself, I was somewhat surprised a couple of times that some of the scenes in it actually had some substance and weren't an absolute mess, yet I can actually point out to some positive aspects the movie actually possessed. The core mythology is built actually quite engagingly, I have zero familiarity with the TMNT, but the way in which the movie laid out its world and its characters was very essential yet absorbing so even if what was built around it was a near-total mess, I found myself buying easily into its background. Other than that there are definitely some action scenes that have to be pointed out, indeed there are negatives on this side, but that sequence in the mountains was truly entertaining and really solidly thought out and put together. Unfortunately that is as much as I congratulate the movie for.On the negative side instead there is a never ending list. The script is a total failure. On the story side you could start counting all the clichés it uses, but I'm sure you would loose count in thirty minutes. Worst than that is the fact that all the clichés are used shamelessly and there is no effort put into trying to cover them or give them a different spin. Shameless is also the way in which the movie borrows whole plot devices from other recent films or it makes them totally up coming out from nothing, totally throwing a middle thing at the audience. Regarding the dialogue side: it is so bad and cheap it comes off as embarrassing 90% of the times. Moreover the actors delivering it aren't doing anything to try not to come off as bad and this makes all of it even worse. I have talked before about some good action in the film, yet there is even more action that is way too frenetic and overloaded with just too much CGI for me to bear.""TMNT"" is in no way a good film, nor does it come off as recommendable for some good fun, yet in manages to save itself from being a total failure or an experience you would dread to reapeat.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

There were some casual remarks of Turtles and some word of mouth stories (seriously a micro-disappearing-action bit against the Foot clan doesn't cut it, you director!) Almost yawned so big that I nearly died till I saw the turtles pop up out of the blue and this time with a proper screen-time for a change. Michaelangelo‬ is the most adorable one, his wits make you crack. CGI is good but not Rise of the Planet of the apes good! ‎Sensei‬ is less gross for a change and boy he can fight! But one of the most badass elements in the flick is ‪The Shredder‬ whose face we don't see in the entire movie (whaaaaaaaat?) But he makes those teenage turtles his bi***. What was disappointing to watch was ‪Fichtner's limited role, such a waste of his talent, also a clichéd tale, poor screenplay and too much of that other guy failing yet trying to tap that Megan ass, and a blunt and painful manifestation of the turtle's fiascoes. The humor becomes good right after the interval and keeps you rooted.

A feel good film.,6,26 October 2014,"I looked forward to this film as I used to enjoy the children's TV cartoon, and the film stood up well to the show and they'd clearly paid homage to the series as well as ""real world"" references and homages to other superheroes, which was a nice tough. I enjoyed the film and thought Meagan Fox and Will Arnett were perfectly cast and engaging, and Arnett was funnily crushing on Fox (who was gorgeous, of course). The Turtles were realised very well, believable, strong and cleverly designed and full of individual character, humour and expressions.The familiar quotes and phrases were woven into the film, and the story whilst not wildly original - see Spiderman, I think? - was gripping enough and genuinely fun and kept me laughing and smiling throughout. Splinter, the rat, was fabulously serene and authoritative but played a good foil to the silliness and playfulness of the turtles. It's hard to remember that the turtles are meant to be teenagers - you hope that they're nineteen - as they're *big* and kinda cute, is that wrong? - and enough emotion and Japanese Ninja philosophy etc and back story to give a bit of depth. I really liked their styling, and individuality and nods to everything in the TV show. There were lots of laugh out loud moments and TMNT was a really feel good film.

She had some facial work done and it was bad. Michael Bay cannot seem to go five minutes without trying to convince the audience Megan Fox is hot.Did I mention their was a fart scene? Each Turtle had a stereotypical black personality that clearly shows Mr. Bay has no black friends outside Will Smith.Michael Bay only saw the fight scenes of the original turtles as he kept trying to mimic the Shredder vs turtles fight scene from turtles(1990) in particular Shredder vs. Leo.An Splinter, oh my splinter, was handled poorly.

100,kermitkid,Saturday morning fun,8,30 March 2020,"See, Michael Bay? You CAN make a movie based on something from the '80's without ruining it. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this movie very much. Megan Fox actually does something in this movie other than sitting around and looking pretty. Will Arnett really steals the show as her sidekick and has some hilarious one-liners. Although the motion capture in this movie is incredibly creepy, once you get used to it, the movie really sucks you in. I feel like Michael Bay actually learned from his mistakes with ""Transformers"" and decided to research the source material instead of changing it completely. Although, you can tell he's not going to let people forget the ""Transformers"" movies because Shredder looks exactly like Megatron, no exaggeration. it's as if Michael Bay decided to subtly do a TMNT/Transformers crossover but left that part to himself. Although the Turtles' origins have been changed slightly (in this movie, they're April's pets who are experimented on by her father in a lab instead of mutated by goop in a sewer) it still works and didn't really bother me that much. Despite the PG-13 rating, it's quite family friendly. I'm pretty sure the only reason for the rating was because it's live action. If it had been completely animated it could have easily gotten a solid PG. Here's something I thought I'd never say about a Micheal Bay film; make a sequel. We could see Bebop and Rocksteady, Casey Jones, and Krang in the sequel. This was a great origin story film, but doesn't really have much else to offer die-hard fans.

101,Rendanlovell,Micheal Bay defiantly had a hand here....,4,4 November 2014,"When you think of Micheal Bay what do you think? Action and cool FX with everything else forgotten. TMNT is produced by Bay and it is practically no different. The turtles look pretty cool receiving more of a modern update to their image which I didn't mind. They're more of body builders then Ninjas but oh well. The VFX when a real character is on screen looks amazing but when only CGI characters are on screen it starts to break down. Looking more like a high end video game then a live action movie. So when the action comes around most the time it doesn't feel real. Although this problem gets better near the end its still pretty obvious. But like I said when a real person is on screen it looks great. Shredder is a fan favorite villain. I do think he is done justice although maybe not as firm as a villain as in the old movies and shows. He looks really cool and his suit is sweet. But just like any Bay film the villain is flat. Not to mention that films these can't seem to have just a villain. They have to have someone behind the film usually a billionaire that wants more money. While the villains were dumb the turtles and humans were almost that way as well. No depth was put into any characters other then tying everyone together in ridiculous ways. The only thing that saved them was some funny gags. The turtles were consistently cracking jokes and almost all were funny. All though this is no reason to care for them it is a reason to LIKE them. Megan fox is typical and Will arnett is scripted so poorly he actually is wasted. Which is hard with to do with him. Which brings me to my last point. The scripting is so void of intellect the film ends up being a chore to sit through. Besides some inspired action sequences near the end its incredibly boring. All in all TMNT is a typical Micheal Bay film (even if its not officially his) Great VFX and action combined with some humor keep TMNT a float. But thanks to poor scripting, bad characters, and just being all over dull its only barely afloat.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Megan Fox plays the reporter April o Neil who wants he reporting job to have more of a purpose than just chasing endless stories for show. She gets a chance when she encounters the famous turtles, Leonardo. Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo named after the famous Italian artists. It turns out that April has a past connect with the turtles from her childhood. The turtles also have to deal with the evil Eric Sachs played William fitchner and defeat the plan to unleash a virus.

The explosions do work, the turtles look all right, and their fight scenes are properly choreographed. There's more to making a movie. The acting is not that bad, it's the story that loses credibility, within the borders of its own set of rules, and that's hard to do when we speak about a movie about mutated turtles saving the world with their incredible ninja skills. What I mean is that more than once I found myself watching the movie and thinking that the only reason some of the characters did what they're actually doing on screen is because they read the script them selves and knew they will come to no harm. To give specific examples will mean to add spoilers - look for these elsewhere. One more problem is the balance of humor and sappiness. Too many times during the movie a character's lines are so sappy that the only possible way to continue is a self awareness pause, as if saying ""wow, that came out so sappy"". Well guess what, it doesn't work more than twice a movie, if you can't really counter the sappiness, cut it away from the script. Basically my advice is go back to the very first Turtles' movie and see how they got their balance right, maybe you'll learn something there.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

106,squirrel_burst,"Poorly written, even for something called ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""",4,22 October 2014,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is not a good movie. If you're under the age of 12, you'll think it's amazing, and it isn't unbearable to watch, but it's not a good movie. Reporter April O'Neill (Megan Fox) witnesses a group of mysterious assailants fighting back against the gang that is terrorizing New York. It turns out that there is someone out there willing to fight back against the Foot Clan: the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Michelangeo (Noel Fisher), Raphael (Alan Ritchson), Leonardo (Johnny Knoxville) and Donatello (Jeremy Howard) grew up in the sewers of New York and were raised by a mutant rat (Tony Shalhoub voices Splinter) into a team of warriors that might be our only hope against the Shredder's evil plan.I know what you're going to say. ""Aww come on... Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; what did you expect?"" I Only expected two things: action and humor. There's some action, so that's a point for it, but the film is so consistently unfunny that it really hurts to watch. The film tries to take itself lightly but it never works. It's funny at most three times during the whole running time. Every other attempt at a joke is either groan-inducing or so weird that it made me uncomfortable. I get that Megan Fox is hot and that's why she was cast in the film. I happen to find her very attractive as well, but when Will Arnett is hitting on her and Michaelangelo is doing the same... it just kind of makes you feel dirty and uncomfortable. It certainly didn't make me laugh. The humor is the least of this film's worries though. It is plagued with huge coincidences, plot hole sand an overall poorly written and predictable story.As we see the film play out, we learn that April and the Turtles might as well have been destined to meet each other because not only did her father create them, but she named them, taught them to like pizza, and gave them their sewer home. What are the odds then, that in the city of New York, one of the biggest cities in the world, she is the person that first catches a glimpse of them? She's not following some lead about how people have spotted strange monsters fighting crime or anything like that, the stars just aligned and she happened to be at the right place, at the right time to see the Turtles on their first outing above ground. It gets even worse from there because she just happens to talk to a key person that is integral to the Shredder's plot just a few days later. Those are just two examples of many. If you're able to dismiss that problem with the story, I dare you to try and swallow the villains' motivation, which makes absolutely no sense. It's not a plot to take over the world, or a way to acquire superhuman abilities, or even a magical artifact or even revenge...it's an elaborate, Machiavellian scheme for a rich guy, who makes his money perfectly legally to make even more money, by killing thousands of innocent people. Why? Because the Turtles need an easy-to-identity bad guy to beat up. It's astoundingly lazily written, to the point where the bad guys must have read the script to this movie and decided to store some seemingly useless equipment just so it could come up during the climax of the film. That's where we start getting into the plot holes, and they are numerous. Can someone, for example, explain to me what kind of nonsensical prison wall is indestructible from the outside, but can be destroyed from the inside with relative ease, as long as the turtles have enough free room to throw a punch? I know there are going to be some people out there that are nostalgic for this movie and will not care what kind of criticism it gets, but come on, you deserve better than this I will give the movie some praise. The Turtles themselves look terrific. The effects that bring them to life are excellent and I was relieved to see that they are easy to distinguish from each other. Even if you can't see what color masks they are wearing when these creatures moving around I had no trouble and seeing them moving around, they looked really cool. It gets even better during the action sequences. At the beginning of the movie the camera work isn't great so you might have a hard time seeing what's going on, but there are two really great fight scenes, that will get your blood pumping. You've seen one in the trailer and the other is at the end of the film. If you're seeing the movie in 3D, it also uses the technology very well. There are plenty of scenes where projectiles or rubble come flying at you and I genuinely jumped out of my seat at least once. As I mentioned earlier, most of the comedy does not work, but there are a few moments that are funny, like a reference to the Ninja Turtles' video ""We Wish you a Turtle Christmas"" and an impromptu rap song that was very well executed.On a more personal note, I really didn't think that Splinter looked good at all, just odd, disturbing and overall unconvincing. He did have one good fight scene, but he pales in comparison to the secondary characters (because April is the main character of this film, not the Turtles). I think that's my biggest gripe with the movie and the reason why even dedicated fans should be wary of checking this film out. Even for a movie called ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" this is badly written, and there aren't even that many moments with the Turtles in it in the grand scheme of things. We're bound to see a sequel, but I'm not really looking forward to it. (3-D Theatrical version on the big screen, September 3, 2014)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

109,ghost_dog86,That pizza though!,6,13 August 2014,"You know that thing that happens when you thought something was amazing as a child, but then you grow up and realize that what you once thought was amazing, was pretty unspectacular? Come on kids of the 90's (late 80's) let's be honest, the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon wasn't as life-changing as those who spent money on vintage t-shirts just to watch this movie (you know who you are) may have fooled themselves into thinking. (Send all hate mail to robinson_me@yahoo.com). In saying that, despite the Michael Bay-ishness of it all, this reboot isn't that bad. Well, not as bad as most critics are making it out to be.Synopsis: When evil Shredder attacksthe city, the only ones who can stop him are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a pesky reporter played by Megan Fox. You know the story. And if you don't, then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. There is also an underlying origins story that (if I'm not mistaken) rewrites TMNT history just a tad.Though the ending is one you can see coming from a mile away and the plot is nothing more than a half an hour television show squeezed into a 101 minute feature film, the action sequences are pretty entertaining (even though for many of them, I had no idea where one character was in correlation with the next) Megan Fox's performance is sufficient (when she is asked to bounce on a trampoline, she bounces on a trampoline) and above all, writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty never seemed to take a movie whose main characters are mutant teenage turtle ninjas, very seriously; injecting a fair amount of comedic one-liners throughout, as well as a few necessary tangential moments of Michelangelo (everyone's favorite turtle) acting all ""rad"" (the good ""radical"", not the bad ""radical""). It's only during the moments when director Jonathan Liebesman (the director of ""Battle Los Angeles"". Need I say more?) introduces elements of heavy drama or forced sentimentality, that ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" verges on unwatchable. And indirectly, this aspect may be more Michael Bay's fault (as this film's producer) than Liebesman's, since every visual reeks of Bay's pan-clanking style of direction. First of all, the Shredder character looks like something out of a ""Transformers"" movie. Secondly, the use of needlessly dynamic camera angles and relentless swooping camera movements as characters perform mundane tasks such as: making a phone call or riding a bicycle, looks about as pointless as it sounds. And lastly, is it possible for ""car flipping"" to be the theme of a movie? Because ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" contains maximum car ""flippage"", in the most redundant way possible.The inherently corny premise is hard to criticize since, again, we're talking about a movie where the protagonists happen to be turtles, ninjas and eat pizza. (Side note: The pizza in this movie looks just as good as it did in the old cartoon; no joke!). And I'm not going to lie, I was entertained for slightly more than a majority of this movie. Still, on a technical level there are a plethora of flaws which are impossible to ignore.Final Thought: While ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" isn't the greatest movie, if you are a TMNT fan going in, which I suspect at least 99% of those reading this are, chances are you won't be overwhelmingly disappointed. But I was never really a fan of the original concept, so what the hell do I know?",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
110,mistoppi,I knew it was going to be awful and it was,2,17 December 2016,"When I started watching this movie, I knew it was going to be bad. I expected nothing else, I knew I was going to hate it. But sometimes you got to watch bad movies. They make you more grateful for the good movies. Also there is always that one actor who makes you willing to watch everything they have been in. You know how these things are! Also I hate typing the whole name of the movies, so I'll try to avoid doing that.Right before I started watching this movie my friend Lauri mentioned he had seen it. He told me the whole movie had the vibe that it's mostly meant for 10-year-old American boys, which is like painstakingly clear from the beginning. The jokes are super crude and everyone is kind of gross on very many levels. That alone makes this film quite cringe-worthy. It's obvious this movie was made mostly because superhero movies were and still are so in. TMNT is like those superhero movies: it's at least somewhat entertaining even at it's worst. It's like a bad superhero movie: It's bad, but you can just play it in the background while thinking about something else. The action sequences are not great however. They are definitely way too long. They are supposed to be visually nice, but they really aren't, at least not without 3D, and with 3D they would probably be even messier. Watching the turtles also makes it very clear that there's no reason for you to make a live action version of TMNT. The CGI is horrifying and all the CGI-characters look so bad. Who looked at these and thought yeah, that's a good idea, let's make a movie?The turtles caused me some other confusion as well. I've only seen one episode of TMNT when I was like six years old. It is incredibly hard trying to tell the difference between the four turtles. Like sure, their masks are different colours but apart from the weird one and the nerd one, how was I able to tell the difference between the other two? Their personalities seemed the exact same to me.I complained about this movie more on Twitter, and I think I can summarise those tweets: The dialogue is awfully dumb, and of course really crude. Characters keep making stupid decisions. There's something good in this movie, it comes mostly from the characters April and Vernon and the way April wanted to find out what was going on, but I just didn't want the turtles there and also I felt like the martial arts were a bit bastardised - but I'm not 100% sure about that. I knew this movie was going to be bad and it was exactly that. So I'm not disappointed, I watched a stupid movie but I was able to admire absolutely mesmerising Megan Fox and super hot Will Arnett, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I didn't think it was possible to ruin a franchise more thoroughly and absolutely than they did. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The concept of the movie was a complete and total failure. From the introduction sequence of the film to the look and origin of the turtles and Splinter to the overall storyline to how April O'Neil's character would be integrated to the absence of other key characters (Casey Jones anyone?) to how the conflict would be established to the decision to show Shredder's face and eliminate part of the mystery behind his character... it was all bad. I would assume that after they had the preliminary blueprint for the film, they would begin the writing process. Oh man, the writing was terrible! The dialogue felt forced and disingenuous and the script made it just about impossible for any cast to save the film. The characters are not developed at all and the plot is developed even less. How about the casting decisions? Megan Fox? Really? What about Megan Fox screams April O'Neil? Nothing, that's what. Why not go for Emma Stone, Amy Adams, Isla Fisher, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone, Karen Gillan, or Rachel Nichols to play everyone's favorite redheaded reporter? Any of them could've provided the appropriate overall look for the character and they all would have their own unique spin on the feel. Whether it be sense of humor, acting style, sensuality, etc. What they all have in common is that they all would've been a better choice than Megan Fox. Oh, and did I mention Emma Stone? Because why bother going after the one actress every single TMNT fan wanted to see in the movie when you can land a brunette with too much plastic surgery and not enough acting chops. Yeah, that makes sense. The casting decisions for the turtles was nearly as bad. Outside of Alan Ritchson (Raphael), none of the other turtles even remotely sounded like their characters and the casting of Johnny Knoxville as Leonardo may have been the worst decision of them all. So now we have a mediocre script and cast, maybe the cinematography and special effects will be good, right? Ha! That's funny. No, instead we got a combination of some of the worst shaky cam, cgi, and overall cinematography I've ever seen.

Ever since their first appearance in 1984 as an intended parody of superheroes, everyone's favorite reptilian quartet has left their mark in the hearts of audiences through their various incarnations, from the gritty comic books to the famous 80s cartoon. The popularity of the Ninja Turtles reached new heights with the live action trilogy as well as two animated films (including ""Turtles Forever""). Along comes Michael Bay, who, despite making lots of money, has had a great deal of controversy with the way he approached another 80s phenomenon, the Transformers. People went nuts when it was announced that he was targeting TMNT as his next project and baffling decisions such as trying to making the heroes aliens and an American actor, William Fichtner, to play as Shredder and fans voting against such moves. Did all of Bay's work and the fan outrage work out for this new movie? Uh, not really, but let's first go into further detail.April O'Neil, in her quest to be taken more seriously as a journalist, stumbles upon vigilante attacks on the notorious Foot Clan, led by the ruthless Shredder. She soon discovers that the vigilantes are far from human. They are Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, large humanoid turtles trained in the art of ninjutsu by a fellow mutant, a rat named Splinter. Just as April discovers their connection to her, Shredder, with the help of billionaire Eric Sacks, takes notice of the Turtles and plans on exploiting the mutagen in their bodies for a nefarious purpose. To stop this diabolical plan from happening, the TMNT must work together as a team if they hope to succeed in their mission with April backing them up every step of the way.Now, in all honesty, I do like all of Bay's Transformers movies, though I completely understand everyone's dislike towards them. Too many explosions, insane product placements, overly-objectified females, dumb sexual humor, etc. Surprisingly, not only is Bay just the producer and not director, but most of his usual antics have been toned down significantly. This time it feels that more effort was put into making a good film. It doesn't succeed all the way, but it's an improvement.Thankfully, the Turtles are all portrayed accurately with some interesting updates. Leo is still the noble leader, Mickey is still a goofball, Donnie is still the smart guy, and Raph is still the angry brute with a heart. Their designs are one of the more controversial parts of the film. On the downside, they are way too big and powerful, with Raphael in particular looking too hulk-ish. Plus, while Leo's and Donnie's faces look fine, Raph's and Mickey's look too human, making the latter two appear very ugly. Beyond that, the designs are great. They have different articles of clothing and markings, which not only make it easier to tell them apart but are also fitting to the heroes like Donnie wearing a harness that has all kinds of fancy gadgets and Mickey having a bead necklace and graffiti art on his shell. Also, the CGI and motion-capture are done very well, even if I prefer more practical effects like in the older films.The other characters are fine by my account. Megan Fox isn't that bad as April, interestingly trying to be taken more seriously as an actress alongside her character trying to be a serious reporter. Her acting here isn't that good, but at least she's putting more effort here and she isn't as sexualized as she was in Transformers. William Fichtner is one of the more enjoyable actors to watch, his character Eric Sacks (yes, I know what that sounds like) having a good deal of charm and charisma while still maintaining the air of a slimy bad guy. It was clear he was meant to be Shredder but despite the change in role, William does what he can and delivers the goods. Shredder himself is also decent. He's menacing enough, even if he doesn't have much personality and his armor design overblown, but I guess the latter case works since the TMNT are also overblown. Finally, Splinter is still a great character. His design is good and he can kick some serious @$$ in a fight, but he also has the very warm presence a father figure should have.The other aspects of the film are a mixed bag. The action scenes are great, with the choreography well-executed and the effects helping to reach new heights, allowing the Turtles to perform some neat new tricks. The humor is hit-or-miss, with some jokes making me chuckle and others making me facepalm. There's once scene involving an elevator which is the best part of the movie, perfectly capturing the spirit of TMNT. The music is also good, the main theme having a nice heroic tone and the ending song is pretty catchy. The story is nothing that special. Granted, it has some nice ideas like how the mutagen plays out but there's also lots of aspects that don't make much sense, like the bizarre coincidences, the villains' plan, and how the hell a character does this one thing. It's just something that could have been done better.Overall, despite having noticeable flaws, this movie is a serviceable entry in the franchise. I prefer the 1990 film, but this new movie is still entertaining and I look forward to seeing a sequel. It's just good to know that the Ninja Turtles are still going strong and are likely to stay that way for a long time. I'd say this movie is at least worth a watch.

114,Spideyfan-963-246215,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6,6 September 2016,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(2014) Starring:Megan Fox,Alan Ritchson,William Fichtner, ,Johnny Knoxville,Jeremy Howard,Noel Fisher and Tony Shalhoub Directed By:Jonathan Liebesman Review This is not a film that isn't very original in story but it is one big giant cheese pizza of fun. There are a few plot holes and idiotic moments in this film which is to be expected if it is produced by the evil company known as platinum dunes and the evil Michael Bay. The plot while not original revolves around April O neil trying to get some exclusives on the crimes of the foot clan until one night she see's a mysterious figure, another night get's captured by the foot and discovers the turtles. After tell Sacks of Sacks industries he alerts the Shredder to capture the turtles so that may take their blood for their evil scheme. If you love the ninja turtles and grew up with them you will enjoy this movie. It captures each of the turtles personality traits from the show in a very respectable manner. The action scenes are the most fun as they fight,recite a certain line in the end and pump with Adrenalin and humor.If you happen to spot a certain character who thought was played by William Fichtner, Baxter Stockman is in the movie somewhere I didn't find him though. The bad well for starters the CGI turtles and splinter still look like crap. There are a few plot holes involving April taking a picture of the turtles with her spare camera she shows it to Sacks but not her boss who she tries to explain it too earlier. It can even be a little dull in the beginning and it is paced terribly. But in the end this new ninja turtles reboot is a fun time,but not for the average person wanting fun action & great storytelling,it remains true to the spirit for ninja turtles and has some fun stuff but isn't all that impressive. But I enjoyed it none the less and you will too if your ninja turtle fan I give this movie three pizzas out of five.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
115,MJB784,The best Turtles movie!,7,21 May 2018,"I was very surprised that I actually enjoyed the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. I walked in with low expectations and found it well written and with cool action scenes and laughs. It finally told us back story of where the Turtles came from, how the ooze was invented and what Shredder and April O'Neil had to do with this. This is the first time I can actually say I enjoyed a Ninja Turtles movie!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
116,helmutty,Far from the overwhelming negative critics' reviews,8,9 August 2014,"Producer Michael Bay reboots the franchise with Jonathan Liebesman on the helm. As far as gritty reboots go, this is actually far from dark. It has plenty of light moments although things are kept in a realistic fashion (such as the humanistic turtles' designs). It is a movie that all ages can enjoy; it does not have the sexual tone in a Michael Bay's movie. Jonathan, known for his Wrath of the Titans and Battle: Los Angeles, know his action beats well enough and keeps things fast paced.The story: Megan Fox plays April O'Neil, a reporter, who stumbles upon an attempt robbery by mysterious Foot Clan. She becomes obsessed in finding the mysterious vigilantes who have stopped the robbery. The plot is straight forward but Jonathan keeps the pace fast enough to last through 1 hour and 41 minutes. Mind you, the turtles are not properly revealed until the 20 minutes mark into the movie. Once the turtles are revealed, the movie becomes a CGI fest. Each of the turtle has a distinctive look and characteristics that is easy to tell on screen. Fortunately, Jonathan knows how to direct action decently although at times, the CGI is a little overwhelming. The last 40 minutes is packed with action; a exciting raid in the underground lair, an exhilarating break-out escape and an explosive CGI-laden climax. The action seems to be influenced by Michael Bay; slo-mo and lens flare. The villain, Shredder, is a little bland and solely exists to show off his wide range of blades. His background story is not properly laid out but he does a decent job during the action scenes, showing his menace against the heroes. Acting wise is alright. Megan Fox plays her role better in this than in the Transformers movies. The rest are not memorable. CGI looks good, the CGI of the turtles and Shredder are decent. Music by Brian Tyler is decent but not very memorable.Overall: It delivers what general audience wants; fast paced story with decent CGI action. Looking at the incredibly negative reviews by the critics, I have to admit that this is nothing more than a mindless action movie with little soul but it is far from the worst movie this year. As usual, the movie ends off by hinting that more things are on the way.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
117,achyutaghosh,Transformer-izing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5,5 September 2014,"Transformer-izing is the newest word in the dictionary. It means picking up characters and throwing them in an inane script that has these typical elements- overbearing vfx characters, explosions, mass destruction, urban agitation, ridiculous banter, obnoxious product placements, explosions again and of course, standard issue bimbettes.And like that, he has done it again. Michael Bay has succeeded in destroying yet another childhood memory- the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Just imagine mask wearing ninja turtles trained by a rat fighting bad guys and often devouring pizza at the same time- this traditional superhero mocking concept was crazy and outrageous fun, and never to be taken seriously. In comes Bay with the aim of tuning this franchise on modern day superhero lines so as to appeal to today's audience, and he in the process does one hell of a job screwing it all up, Transforming ( pun intended) an outlandish story into a oh so serious and boring action film.""You are extraordinary, my sons. Unlike anything the world has ever seen. Bowed in greatness, destined to protect the people of New York City""- SplinterThere is nothing wrong with the plot- it is pretty much the standard TMNT origins tale. New York is descending into chaos, due to the rise of the criminal Foot Clan, led by a ninja master called Shredder, and abetted by a billionaire scientist who wants more billions, Eric Sacks (William Fichtner). April O'Neil (Megan Fox) is the pretty reporter who is never taken seriously. Looking for her first big break, she stumbles upon a secret gang who are, well, giving quite a few feet back to the Foot clan. They are mutants. They are turtles. They are ninjas. They are teenagers too. And their sensei is a mutant rat. Past events that highlight April as the savior of the turtles come to light, the villains attack and visual effects take over.Speaking of which, while the action sequences are decent, it is the design of the characters that are awful. Gone is their lovable-ness. Instead these turtles, and especially Splinter are monstrosities- ugly, bulked up, and with single personalities ( Raphael is angry, Leonardo is responsible, Donatello the nerd and Michaelangelo the party kid) who exist only to fight in the plot. Shredder's flying knives are cool, but he himself has hardly anything to do, other than fighting the TMNT. Michaelangelo having the hots for April is downright creepy, and wait till you see Splinter. I actually felt happy when Shredder gave him a working over. Director Jonathan Liebesman has made enough glossy CGI heavy soul-less flicks in the past (The Battle of Los Angeles, Wrath of the Titans), and this one is no different. Utterly devoid of charm, and seriously unfunny, it has got to be some film when Megan Fox is the best thing about it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
118,abouhelier-r,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,4,18 October 2014,"When a kingpin threatens New York City, a news reporter find a quad of mutants which makes an alliance to unravel Shredder's plan as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I've been hoping for a new live action Ninja Turtles movie since I've seen 1993 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie when I was younger. This new movie is directed by Michael Bay... Oh no sorry Jonathan Liebesman. If you grew up in the 90's you've heard of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles before, you probably play one of the game, watched the films or saw the cartoons; a slice of nostalgia from my childhood. If I'm honest I'd tell you that I didn't want to go see this movie at first, but I did it anyway and as I was expecting: it's not really that good. They turned TMNT into a Michael Bay movie! Children are going to love it! this film look like a Bay movie so bad that I wouldn't have been surprised to see Optimus Prime rolling around and fighting. Plus, this movie's storytelling is very bad and it relies too much on the fact that you watched Ninja Turtles before like Raphael's monologue in which he explains how he's a dick sometimes. Moreover, the iconic villain: Shredder is a total fail, he doesn't have a shrink of personality. Megan Fox is functional, at least more functional I thought she will be. Finally, the turtles were the only thing that quite works for me. They did embody the Ninja Turtles pretty well with their singular personalities. A lot of skills is put in the turtle's ninja moves, regards to this it's vivid and super fluid; but as per usual it's this way because they are entirely digitally created shots. Whenever there's not an action scene that does not involve 100% digital effects: it's BAD. The ending is the exact same ending as The Amazing Spider Man 2 , if you've seen that film... I'm not going to spoil. Overall, children will have fun watching TMNT but if you require a good villain, good characterisation and good supporting characters: it's not this movie. OR if you enjoyed The Transformers films you'll probably like this movie which include a shred of clever film making and a whole bunch of special effects throwing to your face.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
119,LanceBrave,My Expectations Were Very Low,5,30 November 2014,"When it was announced that Michael Bay was producing a new film version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the internet's reaction was not positive. However, Bay himself was not directing this newest incarnation. Instead, he was merely producing it. The chosen director, Jonathan Liesbesman, had directed ""Battle: Los Angeles"" and ""Wrath of the Titans,"" which did little to raise fans' spirits. By the time Megan Fox had been cast as April O'Neil, it seemed like Bay was actively trolling TMNT enthusiasts. Going into 2014's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" my expectations were very low.April O'Neil is a fluff reporter for Channel 6 and desperate to break into serious journalism. Her break comes when she spots four vigilantes fighting the Foot Clan, a terrorist organization that has New York City gripped with fear. As the title gives away, these vigilantes aren't humans but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Working with the teens, O'Neil uncovers a conspiracy involving scientist Eric Sacks, the Foot Clan, and her late father.The internet was outraged when a script, where the title characters were aliens, leaked. The final film ejected that idea. However, it still makes some questionable alterations. A pet peeve I have with modern blockbusters is the insistence that the heroes and villains have intertwining origins. This ""TMNT"" leans on this hard. April isn't just a lucky reporter. Instead, her father's experiments were responsible for creating Splinter and the Turtles. That's a major change but it's not what bothers me. Instead of learning ninjitsu from Hamato Yoshi, Splinter learns martial arts from a pamphlet he finds. This is a major betrayal of the source material. There's little focus on the Art of Invisibility. Of all the adjectives in the title, ""Ninja"" is the one least invested in.The film maintains the villain of Shredder. Despite early reports, Sacks never dons the armor. Oroku Saki is still the Shredder. The two villains are working together to further their evil schemes. This is why Shredder is outfitted with hi-tech armor. However, the Foot aren't ninjas anymore but generic bad guys. By removing Hamato Yoshi from the story, there is no preexisting rivalry between Splinter and Shredder. There's no reason for Shredder to hate the Turtles. The heroes stumble upon their most important adversary.Michael Bay didn't direct ""Ninja Turtles"" but his fingerprints are all over it. Jonathan Liesbesman maintains his boss' trademarks. The film has the same gritty but polished look. Sea-sick green lighting crops up. Sweeping crane shots are indulged in excessively. During several scenes, the camera jerks spasmodically. Liesbesman throws in Bay's most obnoxious habits. There are spinning loop-da-loop shots, lingering close-ups on cars, and in-your-face product placement. You'd think ""Ninja Turtles"" was a Michael Bay joint if it wasn't for two things: The military has no role and it isn't three hours long.This ""Ninja Turtles"" has the most in common with the 1987 cartoon. April works for Channel 6. Her boss, played by Whoopi Goldberg, is Bernadette Thompson. Her co-worker is Vernon. However, the movie even messes that up. In the cartoon, Vernon was a foil to April, constantly undermining her. Here, Vernon is a middle-age guy who has the hots for April. This raises the question of why the movie bothered.Despite featuring the rest of the Channel 6 team, the film leaves out April's best friend, Irma. The film even had the opportunity to include her, since April has a disbelieving room mate. Aside from Shredder, Sacks is the secondary antagonist. Sacks was invented for the film. Traditionally, the mad scientist in the Turtles-verse is Baxter Stockman. Why invent a new character when an established one could have filled the role? According to IMDb, Stockman is in the movie. I didn't spot him. Fichtner is decent and even brings some villainous glee to his lines. However, the character is ultimately forgettable.Which brings me to the Turtles. Much has been written about the newest designs, about how they're ugly. Their heads are small. Their bodies are hulking. However, perhaps mutated turtles should be ugly. What pushes them into the Uncanny Valley is the human-like nostrils and lips. Yet the designs grew on me. I like the decision to personalize each Turtle. Leonardo sports samurai armor. Raphael keeps sunglasses on his head. Donatello sports high-tech goggles, an electronic backpack, and rigs his bo with hydraulics. He's also turned into a nerd stereotype, with his duct-tape mended glasses and snorting laughter. Michaelangelo is still a party dude but draws from modern hip-hop culture. Splinter makes it out the best, looking exactly like what he is: A giant rat.What little of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" that works has to do with how the Turtles act. The film, more or less, nails the teens' personalities. Leonardo is the stoic leader. Donatello's technical know-how gets the gang out of scraps. Raph has to grabble with his anger and butts heads with his brothers. Yet the four are family. A moment near the end has him confessing how much they mean to him. Getting the most bad press is Michaelangelo. Mikey has an obvious crush on April and the film takes it too far. However, his role as the funny one is fulfilled with several amusing lines. While ascending an elevator, Mikey starts to mindlessly beatbox. Instead of shouting him down, Raphael joins in, followed by the others. It's a hilarious moment that roots the theatrical action in some sort of humanity.There's still a lot of April O'Neil. Megan Fox's acting skills have graduated from stiff to forgettable. Liesbesman comes close to engineering memorable action scenes. The sound design is deafening. The musical score shamelessly patterns itself after Hans Zimmer's work. For every element I like, there's something else I can complain about.Does it work? It is not terrible. It is also not good. The film is not a monstrosity, just a mediocre studio product. It is also not the worst Ninja Turtles film.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
120,The_Phantom_Projectionist,"""There is no more froth and foam for me""",5,7 March 2016,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are a strong enough franchise to not only survive a bad incarnation, but to imbue an otherwise stinky one with a level of charm and entertainment. Their latest movie – directed by Jonathan Liebesman and produced under a storm of fan protest by professional polarizer Michael Bay – exemplifies these points by being a middle-of-the-road action movie with a few moments of inspiration. While much better than what I had expected, it's ultimately a $125 million video game lacking emotional and dramatic clout.The story: Four ninjutsu-practicing mutants are New York City's last line of defense against the criminal Foot Clan's murderous scheme to bring both the metropolis and the world under their control.In attempting to pander to both nostalgia nuts and the PG-13 crowd, the movie struggles to find its balance. Personalities and storytelling are blunted in regard of the latter, meshing awkwardly with the post-modern humor and ""epic"" touches (e.g. choir music during the fight scenes) aimed at older audiences. I enjoyed the script's take on some characters, like the adorably nerdy Donatello (Jeremy Howard), and I appreciated the relationship between the TMNTs and their poppa Splinter (voiced by, of all people, Tony Shalhoub), but I was turned off by the spectacularly unfunny Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and horrified by what a socially-subnormal weirdo the movie passes off as April O'Neil (Megan Fox). There's a handful of legitimately humorous moments to balance out the parts where you're just laughing at the weird ideas the film presents with a straight face, and when weighed together, these amount to a dramatically staid story. No surprises, not much in the way of emotion, and not even anything in the way of pulpy charm.The action content is a combination of martial arts fight scenes and larger environmental pieces. The latter aspect is a trademark of Michael Bay, whose crew has a knack for creating computer-driven adrenaline scenes that are very fluid but too bombastic to be taken seriously – look no further than the so-cool-it's-silly chase down the snowy mountain. The fight scenes are a nuanced set, but I have to admit that there are some ones that I really liked. The best on screen performer isn't one of the Turtles but Splinter, whose choreography in his fight against the Foot soldiers feels like a combination of something out of REVENGE OF THE SITH and the work of Donnie Yen. The strength of the choreography never diminishes completely, but the pacing of the subsequent fights makes them feel less like karate encounters and more like a video game, with a ton of slow motion and other directorial gaga in place by the time we reach the showdown with the Shredder (who is played by Tohoru Masamune before becoming a CGI character).Also, I have to say it: the Turtles are butt-ugly. Though I know of die-hards who have given approval to these abominations, I think they look like someone took their pre-production sculptures and melted their faces right before they were converted to 3D form. But I got used to the design, much like I got used to the other faults, and was surprised to come away from the movie focusing more on its strengths than its weaknesses. Though there's no shortage to how much better its characters and story could have been handled, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES makes an impression with its visuals and ability to get one's blood pumping. The team behind this has laid groundwork for itself, and while I won't get my hopes up too high, it would be great if they could build on it in with the upcoming sequel and fill in the organic gaps in this one's armor.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
121,lucasnochez,Film Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,14 August 2014,"Nostalgia will face-off against a once obscure set of oddball rebels this week in theatres when the Michael Bay produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles takes on the current box-office champ Guardians of the Galaxy. Star-Lord may have conquered ticket sales and theatre seats with his unknown team of misfits, but now he is head-to-head with a very recognizable and profitable brand of heroes that have found success with merchandising, previous cinematic endeavours, television shows and brand placement for years. However, don't be quick to count Marvel out, especially when it's film is a much more concentrated picture dedicated to story, visual effects, character development and star-making performances–all the things lacking in this newest adaptation of the Turtles. For many people born into Generation-X, the Ninja Turtles have a special place in our hearts and memories growing up as kids. Dressing up like the turtles in our youth (or even in adulthood), always arguing which turtle was the best and declaring our favourites, the Ninja Turtles are considered a prominent part of many of our childhood's cartoon memories. Like anything else, however, quantity may not always precede quality, even if the memories may well be better than the present. While the newest film adaptation of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's beloved comic book characters get a contemporary vision, the Turtles get a good taste of twenty-first century overkill; between the unnecessary 3D format, a heavy-handed visual effects cluster that at times shreds the screen rather than gracefully transcends images, and its fair share of negative controversy over the last few years, the Ninja Turtles sure need some tough skin to come out on top in order for them to be declared a clear success story.Between ramblings that the title of the film was going to be named only ""Ninja Turtles"", to an origin story that finds itself lost in the depths of space (as do the main characters), to a returning Megan Fox, whose tarnished relationship with producer Michael Bay brought an onslaught of questions after ejecting her from his career-changing Transformers series, the newest Turtles may have been, at times, pressured to hide in their shells. Yet, with the direction of go-to Hollywood pushover Jonathan Liebesman and powerhouse producer Bay, even after criticism of the first trailer showed that the Turtles may have needed a nose job, the film entertains despite its poor constructive history. And even though our favourite four Turtles are named after artists of the Renaissance, the story could easily be one from that era as well.I won't lie, I was the first one in line to buy tickets to the new TMNT, but didn't have high expectations, especially since the film was more of a punch-line than it was ever considered a serious summer contender. Despite all this, the film still brought its fair share of ""woahs"", ""ahhs"", and most importantly, laughs.Light on any real narrative, the film provides a nicely put together origin story that ties the creation of our favourite band of green-superheroes with original characters in the comics, as well as new characters made directly for the screen. Taking cues from many superhero films before it, the band of brothers must join together to take down Master Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) before he consumes New York City.Other than Bay, one of the biggest problems with the film is that it never really establishes the identity of any of the actors playing the good guys, nor does it give them any spotlight. The body actors and voice actors of many of the main characters, including the Turtles, are never given their due justice. Leonardo (played by Pete Ploszek but voiced by Jackass alum Johnny Knoxville), Michelangelo (played and voiced by Noel Fisher), Raphael (Alan Ritchson), and Donatello (Jeremy Howard), along with their noble Sensei Splinter (played by Danny Woodburn but voiced by Tony Shalhoub) seem to be mixed in a blended spectacle of martial arts effects faced only by not so funny man Will Arnett and the once iconic Megan Fox. Like any job, tasks need to be done, goals accomplished and work done properly, and Fox can rest assured that she never progresses the characters of April O'Neil, but at least she defied and got in the good books of one of the most explosive producers working. Plus, she isn't bad to look at on screen, which will make fan-boys really happy as throughout the film, she is explicitly the butt end of all the gorgeous women jokes of the film.At times foamy and most of the time frothy, the Turtles are given a personality change for a new generation. If you know anything about the personalities of the Turtles from the past, you can always count on Bay to offer the most stereotypical versions of cherished childhood characters. Donatello, the brains of the four, is seen sporting gigantic glasses and a nerdy backpack throughout the film. Leonardo, the leader of the pack, is never short of speeches and guilt. Raphael is the certified bad-ass of the clan, a true independent brute who defies his brothers and master and is the only turtle to face Shredder ""Turtle-a-Mano"". Michelangelo may very well be the best written character of the film given his perfect comedic relief as well as timely moments of comedic gold mixed with a dash of immediate action (keep a watchful eye out for the ingeniously comical elevator scene).",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Anywho, the film adaptation follows April O'Neal, a journalist who discovers the turtles and a plan to use a chemical weapon on New York that they must stop.-I expected the film produced by Michael Bay to be horrible, and it actually wasn't. It was not really that good, but was super fun and entertaining.-I'll start with saying I don't know a ton about TMNT canon, but it was not true to the original. I didn't see it as much of a negative, but die-hard fans will. However, the turtles, and Splinter, were on-point hilarious! -The pace was good and got straight to the point, however unbelievable and over-the-top the film was. The tone was very fun, but also didn't take a real care towards the story.-The acting. So I didn't hate Megan Fox. I'll be honest. The guys who played the turtles and Splinter were great. William Fitchner was not too bad. His character wasn't good, but he wasn't bad. Whoever played Vern was not good and his character was not good. Also Shredder was pretty stupid. Like super-mech Shredder. I really felt like he was supposed to be an Iron Man villain.-The effects were not Apes good, but they were good.-The music was not great, but very fun and epic. It reminds me of soundtracks I like, which is a plus.-One of the things I loved about it was the turtles. They were funny and hilarious, but also serious and enjoyable action heroes. Like random beat-boxing in the elevator. Yeah.-I think it's PG, but if it isn't, it could be.-So TMNT is not good, but very entertaining because of the turtles themselves.

123,caseynicholson,A Great Update to this 80's Franchise,8,21 June 2016,"I really like this movie, and I didn't understand why it got such poor reviews both at the time of its release and likewise from many fans in the years since.This film is produced by, but not directed by, Michael Bay, of the ""Transformers"" movie series. Bay has earned himself the reputation of not being the best director in Hollywood, and I think many fans critique this film based off of preconceived association bias. Personally, however, I find this movie to be quite a bit better than the ""Transformers"" movies, or at least the sequels.That said, let's be honest here: we're talking about a movie based off of a comic book and cartoon show that is literally titled, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". There's only so much one can do with this--this was never a movie that was going to win an Academy Award, or even be in the same league of film as a Nicholson/Keaton ""Batman"" or a Robert Downey, Jr. ""Iron Man"". This is a movie taken from source material that cannot help but to be hokey and geared for kids (original version of the Turtles not withstanding).That being the case, I find this film to be fun and refreshing in its approach. It's light-hearted, faithful to its source material, and introduces its characters in a fun way that makes for a neat movie experience overall. Yes, the film is a little heavy on CGI effects and a bit over the top in regard to action scenes--but what more would you expect from a TMNT movie? I think anyone who grew up on the TMNT cartoons in the late 80's and early 90's should love this film. Thus my 8/10 stars.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
124,metalrage666,Teenage Mutant CGI Turtles.,1,28 September 2014,"All I can say is thank God I was given a free ticket to see this garbage as I can't understand why anyone would want to spend money to sit through this. This whole movie was just drivel from beginning to end and I can guarantee that there is are better ways to waste 100 minutes of your life. I won't even bother with trying to put into words the overall story, if there even is one, but I can't help but wonder why this was even necessary. The turtles came to fame in the late eighties/early nineties and given the success of the cartoon, it spawned 3 live action movies, yet by the late nineties the turtle fad faded and despite there being a cartoon series in the mid 2000's and another movie, this whole exercise of doing this reboot, or re-tool or re-imagining etc. now in 2014 seems pointless, even if there is a newish cartoon series doing the rounds.The movie of course has the obligatory origins of the turtles and splinter but again, was that even necessary? The action is fast paced and frenetic and despite the overly well choreographed fight sequences and the action taking place, the whole movie was just plain boring. Maybe I've seen just too much of this before or maybe the whole issue of Michael Bay sucking the life out of everything that we grew up with is wearing thin. First Transformers and now this. What's next? Michael Bay and the Muppets or Fraggle Rock? The dialogue is unfunny and lame, the action sequences were tedious and predictable, you don't care for any of the characters, the fight scenes were ho-hum, and the ending was as clichéd as any I've seen. The scene where they are all falling, and then skiing and then sliding down the mountain and avoiding getting killed, hurt, crushed and everything else that would normally happen, is enough to give anyone an epileptic seizure right there and then. And no doubt we can look forward to sequels of this, as of course Michael Bay will want to cash in on the success of anything until there's nothing left but a pile of shrivelled excrement.In the immortal words of Bart Simpson, ""I didn't think it was physically possible, but this movie both sucks and blows"".

Might as well let someone new have a shot instead of paying these idiots for doing average or below work.Back to the movie, the writing is horrendous. The only thing that is makes this better than the last movie is the action and graphics are better but that is just because it is more modern. There is nothing to like here. Characters are forgettable to unlikable. Jokes were not funny. Hip hop culture references are embarrassing... reminded me of the horrible transformers movie with those dancing autobots... wow that was bad. Slow motion action scenes are cheesy and overdone.Absolutely no good points to make about this movie.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

132,stermix501,avoid critics and enjoy,10,28 November 2014,"I luckily avoid reading opinions before seeing a movie. This movie was a perfect entertainment for the less than 1h50 that it lasts. Although I had enjoyed watching TNMT anime when I was adolescent, I've never been a hardcore fan and it is true that I cannot spot any of the traits that other purists criticized about. What I certainly know is that it was a nice combination of Transformers/Batman/Martial-art material based on a plot that seemed solid and justified. Megan-April was more Megan than April, but she is the right actress for that sort of character. She is not the true red-hair girl I would prefer to see, but she is not less successful than fake blonde J.Alba in Fantastic4, or fake-redhead Scarlett J. in the Avengers. She has the right age and overall stature for the role and she is always fun to watch.The turtles were very versatile and realistic in all ways and I liked that each one got an emphasized ability (or weakness!), differentiating from the anime where all looked quite the same.The action sequences were mind-blowing, synchronized at the ultimate speed the human eye can perceive them. Unlike transformers and other movies where the action and fight are so messy, shaken and difficult to follow that you wished to just skip forward to the outcome, in this case it is absorbing, spectacular and humorous. Which is what all TNMT productions are really about.The music, production design, voices and sound are exactly as they should be to throw you into the screen.It might not be a 10, but in front of all those purists destroying franchises, 10 is the least I could give to hope for at least 2 sequels. And I don't mind who ever purist out there may just avoid it.Don't miss it!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
133,gerry_barnaby,knock knock your about to get shell shocked awesome film,10,11 October 2014,"KNOCK KNOCK YOUR ABOUT TO GET SHELL SHOCKED !!!!!! First of all i will say everyone is entitled to there own opinion's, but i say sod the hater's of this film that hated iver because they say it ruin there childhood or because of Michael bay which didn't even direct this film, he endorsed. If you couldn't find this film at least entertaining then there is seriously something wrong with you because this was seriously entertaining & a well made film. This has to be a first for me Megan Fox actual suited this role a April 'o' Neil, this is the first time iv seen her in a role that actual works for her make her look better on screen, i think this is because they haven't tried to make her in to these stereo type bimbo town stuck up type girls, this tone down role playing a reporter really works for her. The way i see it is the original turtle film's was great in the 90's, but sadly ruined with the third film, but still is a great film for its generation, this this is meant for this generation of kids growing up which was brilliant done in my mine, yes i know they use C.G.I but it was brilliantly done. The cinematography is stunning special the fight scenes, now you just could get that amazing martial arts with actors in the suit, Tohoru Masamune playing Shredder was bad ass, the suit alone made that character more intense & frightening as a fighter dam he was almost to much of a match for the turtles alone which gave this film a better edge for the character, because having an enemy to easy to beat ruins the menacing look of the bad guy so this works well for the character. With the story concept it dose pay homage to the original turtles film, but is a slightly different way of story telling with Stop motion capture & animation which is brilliant done to show them training & growing up to become the hero they are with some funny moments & some of the best C.G.I effect I've seen. The turtles them selves looked bad ass, special with the C.G.I there look is perfect to potray turtle with ninja training, Leonardo played by Pete Ploszek but voiced by Johnny done an awesome job voicing this character, made him more bad ass with the voice, Raphael played by Alan Ritchson smallvillle gave Raphael this attitude of the tough guy in the group which along with th c.g.i just brought out his character better as it gave him a look of a serious bad ass fighter which i love the mimic of the batman voice which was funny in this film. Noel Fisher as Michelangelo was awesome i love this way he gave this character this surfer dude joker character with some hilarious moments, Jeremy Howard done brilliant acting job with Donatello's character, i like the way they gave him the tech look which he was in the original tech whiz, few funny moments as well, Danny Woodburn playing Splinter done a great job voice by Tony Shalhoub done a brilliant job with the voice acting, what is really good with this film is we get to actual see master splinter fight which was one of several fight scene in this film that awesome special the fight scene with Shredder, what an awesome fight scene. Will Arnett playing Vernon Fenwick did a great acting although i feel they tried to stereo type him as the Seeley reporter that like April, but he did come off funny at time's.This whole film is well put together with a great storyline, you really can not fault this film, as it is very entertaining film, with brilliant characters & great acting, this is a worthy remake of Turtle in my opinion. special the sound track knock knock your about to get shell shocked by Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa, Ty Dolla $ign ft.

With the news that teenage mutant ninja turtles was going to rebooted fans were happy as finally the film that failed to deliver in the 90s is going to get another chance, and as soon as the film starts there is a sense of anticipation and excitement but sorry to say that fades away quickly. Megan fox is no april 'o' neil she does try but cant pull it off, the good news is there's a good storyline to the film but before you can blink your deep into the plot its as tho they rushed to squeeze it into 98 minutes of footage. Most reboots have no age relavence but this one would only appeal to anyone under the age of 12 which is a shame, as yes there will be die hard fans who will go watch this but if they are honest, they wont enjoy it as much as they want to. yes there is plenty of action and a good dose of humour at just the right time as well as the odd memorable scene (not gonna spoil it and tell you but you WILL know when you see it) the saving grace is the way the franchise ended it could possibly be open to a sequel which lets hope is much better than this first one.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I was surprised. The turtles in this movie look creepier than the original, but once you get over their looks, they are actually likable. I am glad the fight choreography is much better than the original movie, though Shredder looks more like a Decepticon than a ninja. The pacing in the movie is great, and the homage to the cartoon was brilliant. I think Megan Fox as April O'Neil was perfect. She actually looks the part, and wears a yellow coat like in the cartoon. William Fitchner was good as a villain though I enjoyed him more in the Dark Knight. Splinter was quite disappointing because he looked more like a British cartoon character with large mustaches, than an oriental character. But I guess that is because I was so used to Splinter in the original movies and cartoon series. Despite this weakness, the movie captures the charm and tone of the Turtle series and I look forward to the sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
136,vistheindian,Negative expectations helped a bit,6,23 August 2014,"Quickie Review:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT), the title is pretty self- explanatory on what this movie is about. Nevertheless here's the gist, a group of teenage turtles who are mutated and have ninja skills must fight their biggest foe Shredder, and save New York City. To a non-fan of the cartoons and comics, this sounds like a ridiculous plot, and it is. There are also human characters that were completely unfunny and throwaway. However, what keeps this movie from being a complete failure are the turtles themselves. There is a lot that is wrong with this movie, but turtles give some shred of integrity to the movie.Full Review:Full disclosure here, I am aware of TMNT but I am not a loyal fan. I think even the people who have no interest in watching TMNT are fully aware of all the online negative reaction both pre- and post-release. I follow many bloggers and youtubers, who's opinions I deeply respect that have said they didn't like it or in extreme cases found it to be horrendous. The movie released late here so I was aware of the general consensus beforehand. For that reason I was fully prepared to expect at best 4/10 or even less. But I must admit, I didn't find TMNT to be a great movie but much better than I had anticipated.Let me touch upon what I did like, the turtles. Say what you will about their designs, but I find it hard to find any fault in their personalities. When there are CGI characters involved it is easy to jumble them together and make them generic. Thankfully that is not the case. Each of the turtles have great distinct personalities. So when you see them interact, they bicker and banter like any siblings do. On top of that they are all genuinely funny, especially Michelangelo (the yellow eye band). He had many funny lines but one in particular near the end had me bursting with laughter. The actions sequences were also generally well done. Yes there is the occasional shaky-cam action but it is balanced with scenes that are smooth long shots that are detailed and well-choreographed.Now let's talk about what is wrong with the movie. My biggest annoyance were the human characters. Megan Fox as April O'Neil to no surprise was just there to stare at everything that was going on because when she opens her mouth to speak, she is just as monotone as it gets. Give the sound guy in this movie a raise for taking out all cricket chirping sounds that must have happened after every line from Will Arnett. His character was supposed to be the comic relief Notice how I said ""supposed,"" because every ""joke"" he had was just followed up with an awkward silence in the cinema. Then there is the overly convoluted and coincidental plot, where for some reason every character is connected somehow. If you give the evil plan by the villain any thought it will just implode to its core. That brings me to the villain himself, Shredder. The filmmakers needs to understand that just making the villain look scary is not enough. A fruit fly hovering over a banana has more understandable motivation than Shredder did the entire movie. For all I know his motivation was to make Edward Scissorhands jealous. He was just a giant faceless robot with glorified Swiss army knives for arms.I went on bit of a rant there, but I think the majority would agree with the negative points I have made. I think all the negativity I heard previous to watching the movie helped me to expect the bad characters, the thin plot, and the forgettable villain. And so like I said I was prepared for that and was ready to accept it. All I wanted was some good turtle moments and cool looking action, which TMNT did deliver. That may explain why I'm rating this movie not high, but higher than the general consensus. I completely understand the negative reactions, and if you look at my little rant I agree with it all. Still I think if you go with managed expectations, you will leave (at the very least) not completely hating the movie. Look at the bright side, it's not directed by M. Night Shyamalan.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

138,CowherPowerForever,"So, you're... Ninja Mutant Turtle Teenagers?",2,6 August 2014,"After years of trying to bring this franchise back to the big screen, Michael Bay and his company, Platinum Dunes was able to do it. Sadly, the effort was just as sad most of the recent Michael Bay films. Without Bay behind the camera on this project, we are left with an even worse story(if that is possible), and just awful action. This is my review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.The film was written by Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec, and Evan Daugherty. Appkebaum and Nemec recently worked on the smash hit from 2011, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. While Daugherty is more popularly known for witting the recent film, Divergent. With the talent level behind this film, I'm surprised at how downright awful the story was written. It is true that a director can change things around but, on this movie I know of nothing like that happening, so the blame goes to this writing crew. The story is very quick, and rushes downright absurd backstories, only to force us sub-par action scenes for most of the movie. So, basically this is your average Michael Bay film, only this time Bay is only the Producer. Having let the movie sit in for a bit, I honestly see no good in this story at all. As I said it is rushed very quickly, to push the Bay style of a film. Not sure who to blame for sure, these writers are better than this, and the effort on this film was very poor.The film was directed by Jonathan Liebesman. Liebesman recently directed Wrath of the Titans(not an awful film at all in my opinion). His effort in this film was very poor. The action scenes seemed very forced, and look like garbage. The CGI was some of the worst I've seen in a big blockbuster like this. The acting from Meagan Fox, is as you would expect, garbage. This is nothing new and should be expected by now. Even the great William Fichtner(Eric Sacks) feels wasted in this film. That is a shame since Fichtner is one of the best actors today. Voice over work wasn't bad but, having Johnny Knoxville voice Leonardo was an awful casting decision. He literally adds an element of awful that I didn't seem coming. From the first time we hear him, you just want to punch the screen. It doesn't get any better. So, Liebesman gets a big fat failing grade for this film.Brian Tyler composed the score for this film, and also scored the film, Into the Storm, which will be released on the same day as this film oddly enough. Just as his effort was underwhelming in that film, I also thought it was mostly underwhelming in this film. There are a few action scenes where his talent is used nicely but, overall it is nothing special.Overall, this film is simply awful, and a giant waste of time. Sure the die-hard fans will rush out to see this movie but, a nickles worth of free advice, it will ruin your hopes. Children will likely want to see this movie as well but, be warned parents, there is a good bit of heavy action. For the rest who were on the fence to being with, if you really want to see this film, just wait until it is on home video. This is a rental at best, and even then it is a waste of perfectly good money.I went to a RealD 3D showing and will have some comments on that as well. The 3D scenes are pretty bad. Nothing that keeps you from paying attention during the film though. It adds very little depth and even less in items of popping out at the screen. So, if you truly do go out and see this film, then bypassing the 3D is the best option. Save that extra money.2/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
139,moviemattb,Better than I expected,6,14 August 2014,"When I first read some news; look at some of the photos that were taken on set; and watching trailer on this movie, I thought the movie was going to be terrible and maybe the worst experience that I am going to have in a movie theater. After seeing the movie from beginning to end, I did not found myself to be angry about the movie as I thought I was; the movie itself turned out better than I expected. However, it is by no means a great movie or the best comic book movie that I've seen. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is to me the best comic book movie that I've seen this year. As you read this review, there could be some spoilers but not too much. So here it is: I was impressed that they keep the Turtle's personalities just right as what they are suppose to be. They did make Leonardo as the leader along with Raphael being the tough turtle, Donatello being a scientist, and Michelangelo as the comic relief. Megan Fox was actually really good as April O'Neil and don't think she would turned out that bad because I do like her in the first two ""Transformers"" movies. Will Arnett was alright, but nothing much to his character. Same thing goes to William Fichtner and I don't think I buy him that much as the villain. I think they should have made the Shredder as the main villain, but instead, that made him a secondary villain which is why Fichtner gets most of the screen time than the Shredder. There are some characterization for the movie, but I felt that they need more development if they would punch some things up with the script. The action in this movie was actually pretty good, and I can see what was going on as I am watching it. The music by Brian Tyler was fine, but it kind of reminds me of Tyler's other score ""Dragonball Evolution."" I will say that I kind of like this one better than ""Dragonball Evolution,"" and a better movie from Nickelodeon than what they have done with ""The Last Airbender."" The special effects in this movie are quite well done, but I am not that crazy on what they have done with the design of the Turtles because I like on how they originally were in the original 1990 movie that the design of the Turtles were done by Jim Henson. Aside of the origin story being told again, the rest of the story isn't well told because again the script needs work. The humor in this movie can be at times funny like the elevator scene, but some others didn't like the fart joke. Jonathan Liebesman does an alright job on directing the movie, and I do say he did better than his other movie ""Battle Los Angeles."" There are some things that Michael Bay would do like showing Megan Fox's butt sticking out as she has her jeans on, and a Victoria's Secret billboard sign. I would have imagine if Raphael would just look at the billboard sign that feature Rosie Huntington-Whiteley from ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and just knock it down that Raphael doesn't like her and cannot act. That to me would have been funny. Tell you the truth, I wasn't a big fan of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the third ""Transformers"" movie, but I don't hate her; it is just that I am not very fond of her acting if I should do a review of the movie, which I will do in another time. The movie is not directed by Michael Bay, because everyone thinks he directed this movie, but he didn't and I know Michael Bay has nothing much to do with Jonathan Liebesman as he is ""the"" director of the movie. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was actually not a bad reboot, but I still don't think its really that good. I thought it was okay, and I wouldn't mind watching it as a time waster. Overall, I say give a chance, and I do think it is worth a rental. If you are not of this new take of the movie, then you probably wouldn't like it but if there are any fans that grew up with ""TMNT,"" and curious of this new take then you probably would enjoy it, and have a fun time. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The same focusing on human characters and their unnecessary involvement in fights meant for turtles/transformers is really annoying.Many might be quite aware about the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'. It is the about 4 mutated turtles who were raised and trained to become ninjas in sewers of New York by a ninja-master mutated rat named Splinter. Also they are teenagers which makes Megan Fox's character April O'Neil call them 'Ninja Mutant Turtle Teenagers' (which is the only line of hers I liked in the whole movie). April is a journalist and crosses roads with our turtles when trying to dig info about a crime organization called 'Footclan'. Our turtles need to keep their identity secret while fighting crime as Splinter believes they are not yet ready to face the leader of footclan the 'Shredder'. The rest is nothing but turtles vs footclan-shredder action with a predictable ending.Up until the first-half the movie wasn't that bad. We see the life of turtles in sewers and get to know each one of them well enough. They are quite fun to watch but it is all ruined by not so good acting of Megan Fox. She ruined it the same way as in Transformers. The second half goes full-on action as expected. We have trucks rolling down ice-covered hill, building destroyed, where few times it is even difficult to clearly see what actually is happening as it is overloaded with CGI. CGI on turtles was fine but everything else wasn't quite good. Also another thing is the villain 'Shredder' is so one-dimensional, all he was like - 'I want power, I kill turtles'.. boooring. Surely without any doubt Shredder is the worst bad guy I have seen this year. Also many things are highly illogical which might get ignored having your eyes filled with CGI effects and action. With all these terrible things, there were a few positives which made me not leave it in middle. Brian Tyler's music was cool, I really liked the main theme. Also all 4 turtles are characterized well and some of the ninja action was quite good. Also it doesn't drag much with length of only 101 minutes unlike this years transformers movie which went from bad to horrible because of its length. Thus this one beats the transformers movie by a small margin for me.Overall though its an awful film, if you are interested only in some mind-numbing turtle action then and only then I would say to give it a try. RATING: [1.5/5]",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
141,mwcrunner,A movie that not everyone hated.,8,3 April 2016,This is a pretty good Ninja Turtle movie considering it's different from the old ones of the 90's. This was also the first Michael Bay film that Megan Fox has been in since she quit being in the Transformers movies since Revenge of the Fallen. In this movie you get to see the turtles that are taller then April O Neal played by Megan Fox and they are huge. There's also some humor in this and the Shredder has strong thick armor. He was tough for the turtles like in the old ones but he was beaten in the end as well. This has pretty good action and a good plot so it is fair to give this movie 8 out of 10. I also know that this year there's gonna be a sequel to this so hopefully it will be as good as this or maybe even better.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
142,byson5186,Awesome Movie,10,22 December 2014,"We all know how in recent years, a lot of the biggest movies that come out are live action versions of things we remember as a kid, like comic books or TV shows/cartoons. A lot of these movies are being remade with some of the action and special effects we are used to nowadays. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is definitely one of them. Now, of course since that's the movie let's talk about the franchise. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a comic strip. It was a TV show from 1987-1996. I'm old enough to remember watching that version of the TV show on TV as a kid. I watched that show around the time the first three movies came out. I remember having Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures along with a toy Technodrome. I stopped watching that TV show around the time Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came on TV. Those earlier episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that a lot of us remember when we were kids have long since not aired on TV. There were also a couple of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games I remember playing as a kid, like the 1989 Arcade version along with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In Time for Super Nintendo. I played the 1989 Arcade Version as recently as 2006. My friend had the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for Gamecube I think, and it had the original game. It was also at that time where the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a newer series from 2003-2009. Now, I think kids today are familiar with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I think there is a newer version of that show since 2012 which I haven't seen. We also remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies from the early '90s, where a lot of the action in those earlier movies is slapstick humor along with the turtles being played by people in costumes rather than CGI effects we are used to nowadays. They would later make a 2007 computer animated version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which I only saw once and didn't like it. So, this 2014 version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was the totally ideal remake in my opinion. I will mention what makes this movie great. First off, Michael Bay worked on this film as he worked on the Transformers movies. I did not watch the TV show Transformers as a kid, and I felt like those Transformers movies were hard to understand. Megan Fox who played Mikaela Banes in Transformers plays April O'Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I feel like Megan Fox is the ideal April O'Neil, she seems less stuck up than when she played Mikaela, and is a totally hot April O'Neil. The other Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies leaves out the characters I remember from the cartoon that worked alongside April O'Neil at Channel 6. This movie includes Vernon, and it also includes a character their boss we remember on the TV show, Mr. Thompson. Although his character from the TV show was changed into a female played by Whoopi Goldberg. It's always nice to see her in movies. From the news cast we remember on the TV show, they just leave out Irma. What else makes this movie ideal, I feel like most of these live action movies for a franchise that are coming out are a little over 2 hours in length, while this movie barely goes over an hour and a half before we get to the credits. I feel like the ideal movie length time is an hour and a half and most movies over 2 hours long have lots of slow scenes your iPhone could tell you to go pee if you have that app, and would not be able to keep a lot of younger kids attention. I also feel like a lot of these other live action movies like Avengers and Transformers have hard plots to understand, while the plot in this movie is a little easier to understand. I feel like it's pretty entertaining the whole way through and does a great job of putting the Turtles we know into action with their joking personalities, their passion for pizza, and their martial arts fighting style. If you're up for a great action movie, then this is one of them as it kept my attention and I'm sure it will keep your attention too. This movie deserves a 10/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
143,winstonsmith_84,"Lacking Originality, Wit, and Soul",4,16 November 2014,"This movie really felt empty. And yet it had lots of potential. With special effects being so amazing these days, you would think that a film like TMNT could finally be made effectively. Oh well, we were wrong... Because apparently they forgot what makes Ninja Turtles great: fun. Oh yeah, and an interesting story with interesting characters.This film was presented to us as if we already knew the TMNT storyline. It's a lazily done remake, although the sound and special effects were incredible. The sole reason I am giving this a 4/10 is due to the extremely good work done on bringing the turtles to life. However, as good as the special effects are, they cannot revive a dead script to life.With so much incredible TMNT canon & material to draw from, it's exceptionally surprising that this film couldn't seem to present us with an amazing story. The introduction to the story was bad and seemed as if it was thrown in rather than thought out. The main villain (Shredder) seemed like an afterthought. Splinter didn't resonate with me like he did in the original comics, movies, and cartoon series. The turtles themselves were OK, but lacked something simply due to the story. I didn't mind Megan Fox (who played April O'Neil) but her character was a bit blahsee... to her credit she didn't have much to work with, so we cannot fault her on bad acting. Same with Will Arnett. He's the right guy for the role, and a great actor, but he's given so little to work with. I don't even know what Whoopi Goldberg was doing in this film.There was so much potential here, from the actors to the ability to create amazing effects. I just wonder why they didn't select a good script/story? Why did this get overlooked so badly? Sadly, the film from the 90s overshadows this one still as the best TMNT screen adaptation. While the 90s movie certainly is far from perfection, it at least has a certain amount of charm and watchability. The story is at least coherent and interesting to a degree. This one is not.Yeah, I found this movie incredibly boring and lacking a certain charm I had been expecting. The film takes itself way too seriously on one hand and much of the conflict seems fabricated. I'll admit that the film tries a little at being funny in certain places, but often the humor falls flat and forced.4/10 stars (for the special effects)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
144,drawlife,Surprisingly not horrid.,6,11 August 2014,"Color me shocked, I went into this movie with super low expectations, but there are some good things to say about this film.The best thing about this movie was the Turtles. What the film does so well is showcasing each turtle's personality, Leonardo is a calm, level-headed leader, Raphael is the tough guy and a loner, Donatello is the smart, geeky one, and Michelangelo is the wise-cracking joker. All four turtles display excellent chemistry among each either you can't help but giggle and watch them with joy. Give credit to the actors who portray them through motion capture and who also provide their voices, with the exception of Leonardo, who was motion-captured by Pete Ploszek, and voiced by Johnny Knoxville, who to my surprise did a good job voicing the character. Splinter, voiced by Tony Shalhoub, motion-captured by Danny Woodburn was also utilized, he didn't have much screen time, but he was used effectively. Another surprise to add was Megan Fox, a little bland and dry here and there, but she wasn't too terrible. Her character April O'Neil was street smart and actually used journalist tactics to uncover the truth, something I commend the film for. Will Arnett who plays April's cameraman Vernon, provides decent humor as well. What makes this film a bit of a drag are the villains. Shredder looked very cool, props to the filmmakers on updating his look with awesome armor, but however he was flat and two- dimensional. Shredder's arc and the Foot-Clan became very predictable, and offers nothing new to the story, but the same old same old formulaic routine that's been done before. The same can be said about William Fichtner as Eric Sacks, very flat and un-engaging. They were hardly interesting and provided the film's dull moments. But with that being said, this movie has decent moments and is just brainless fun. It does it's job of keeping you entertained. The visuals are neat and the turtles looked great. Michelangelo in particular kind of steals the show with his wit and humor. I have to say, I knew about some of the TMNT lore, but I was never a fan of them, I even watched the original 90's TMNT film and hated it as a child, but I was quite entertained with this one and I tip my hat off to producer Michael Bay and director Jonathan Liebesman. During the hype train they were very criticized about the production of this film, but they pulled it off and made an entertaining film, that kids will surely get a kick out of, and even possibly some adults. The turtles are back and they've gotten a complete modern make-over for the better, and I'm quite intrigued to see where the sequel will go. 6/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
145,tvdefrancesco,I don't Understand the hate. Awesome Movie!,8,27 August 2014,"As a long time Ninja Turtle fan I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It really was great. The Turtles are hilarious especially Mikey and the upgrade to Shredder was unbelievable. He was ferocious! That suit of Armor was bad A$$. The magnetic knives that he was able to reuse was a really cool concept, only a psychotic genius like Michael Bay could think of. Meghan Fox did a really good job too, as did Will Arnett although I did think some of his jokes were complete misses. All of Mikey's jokes were spot on. As a big Shameless fan it's cool to see how diverse of an actor that kid really is. William Fichter was evil and awesome as always, even if you think he's going to be good you know he really won't be. The guy always plays a snake. The CGI, especially the scene down the mountain was so cool. Mixed in with slow mo's it is sure to excite. I do agree the foot soldiers could have been more involved and cooler looking, but we still have more Turtles to go. I'm sure they'll be more prominent in the next one. I hope we'll get to hear ""THEY'RE BABIES!"" sometime in the next film. Awesome start to the rebooted franchise. I overheard people leaving the theater last night saying it's the best movie they've seen all year....And to be honest it's right up there.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
146,LinkGoku,"Simple fun, what did you expect?",8,21 November 2014,"4 6-foot tall mutant turtles defend New York from crime, but an old foe will threaten their very existence.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was made by Nickelodeon and it feels like it. Lots of humor aimed at the kids. But still some good jokes for the adults too.This movie is just proof that people will literally bash anything with Michael Bay's name on it. He was just a producer, this wasn't his vision. He wanted them to be aliens. No this is Jonathan Liebesman's movie.The action is awesome, Splinter in particular was cool. I remember when I was young and I loved to watch Tim Burton's Batman movies and pretend I was Batman. This feels like it could do today what Batman did for me back then.No this isn't like the crappy Marvel movies that claim to be new and different but actually deliver the same crap over and over.This is simple, it isn't trying to be anything mind-blowing.Like most movies this does differentiate from its origins. So be warned if you don't like change then you won't like this. But honestly to everyone else just stop with the hate already. This was fun.I recommend you give it a shot.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
147,YJLcool,"Not a great film, but still fun and entertaining because of the turtles",6,10 August 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a modern reboot of the 30-year-old popular franchise of the same name. This film is directed by Jonathan Liebesman and produced by Michael Bay. For those who are not familiar with the franchise, it's basically a story about four mutated turtles who grow up in the sewers, raised and trained by a mutated rat who knows the art of Ninjutsu to fight against the evil Foot Clan led by Ninja Master Oroku Saki, also known as The Shredder.There are some new changes to the origins and designs of the turtles in the film which might upset a lot of fans of the franchise. Surprisingly, I'm probably one of the few who are fine with most of changes. Come on, the original storyline is quite ridiculous: Splinter was originally the Ninja Master Hamato Yoshi's rat and he was smart enough to learn his fighting moves to become a master without the mutagen (although the best storyline would be the current depiction of Splinter in the 2012 ongoing TV series, who is actually Hamato Yoshi himself). The four Turtles were accidentally exposed to the mutagen after a traffic accident with their young owner as a bystander...So I'm okay with the changes to the origins.Moreover, I find the new designs of the turtles to be quite realistic, modern, very distinctive looking and look cool. The CGI renders of the turtles were look great on screen. However, my biggest gripe is the depiction of their size and strength in the film. Sure, they act like teenagers, but they don't look like teenagers. Their larger physique show that they're much too powerful compared with their previous live- action or animation counterparts. These turtles can crush vehicles easily, deliver punches and kicks strong enough to send you flying.The best thing about the film is that it did a great job in portraying the turtles on screen, retaining the distinctive personalities of the turtles we've known for years: Leonardo - the eldest, most disciplined tactical leader of the turtles who fights with two katanas, Donatello - the nerdy and geeky turtle with a bo staff, he's the brains of the group, Raphael - the hot-tempered, strong, aggressive and tough turtle who uses a pair of sai, Michelangelo - the wisecracking, easygoing, goofy but lovable turtle who uses a pair of nunchaku, who's essentially the provider of comic relief among the turtles. Among the turtles, Raphael and Michelangelo are the ones that stand out in this film. The family dynamic between the turtles and splinter was good as well. The film shows the camaraderie of the turtles and how they interact with each other throughout the film...the usual brotherly in- fighting between Raphael and Leonardo, with Raphael often challenges Leonardo's leadership, the mutual love and respect for Splinter or the brotherly banter between Michelangelo and the turtles. Despite the fighting and arguments, they're still brothers and love each other very much.There's a few good character moments especially Mikey's crush on April, Raph's touching confession near the end of the film, the amusing turtles elevator scene, Mikey losing himself when Splinter tempting him with pizza, Mikey and Raph Victoria Secret ad. The film also delivers some great action scenes, notably the awesome Splinter VS Shredder fight, the spectacular, fast-paced, exciting snowy mountain action sequence and the climactic Turtles VS Shredder battle.There's a lot more fun when the Turtles finally appear on screen. It's such a shame that the film gave too much screen time to April and her cameraman, Vernon. (It's a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, so give them more screen time!) The human characters in the film are dull and forgettable and they're just sort of there to serve the plot. Not to mention, the film's storyline has some noticeable flaws. It has numerous plot logic issues (especially the villain's main plan), bad dialogues and some unnecessary human scenes. Occasionally, it feels like there's some gaps between scenes, plot contrivances throughout the film. Some of the character lines are poorly written as well.Furthermore, the film lacks a memorable and compelling villain for the story, just like many of this year's blockbusters. There's a lack of character development for Shredder and Karai. Shredder is a strong villain for the turtles mostly because of the giant mechanical suit, but there's not much depth in him. His character motivations were unclear. I'm also not quite particularly happy with the portrayal of Foot Clan as a local crime syndicate...who are no longer highly trained ninja/assassins, but soldiers with guns.Overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles isn't great, but it's still a fun and entertaining sci-fi action comedy film, mainly because of the turtles, but don't expect a great story with meaningful catchy dialogues. In my opinion, it's still a far better film compared with the previous TMNT trilogy. There have been many versions of TMNT throughout the years, but the ongoing 2012 TV series is still the best one so far.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
148,theemuhammede,Out of the shell funny action,8,22 April 2016,"This remake of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was pretty awesome. There was a lot of humor throughout the movie. Michelangelo was incredibly funny with his idiotic ways. Even though he is super intelligent, Donatello also had his humorous moments.The story was good, but not the best. It could have been better if it did not spend as much time with the back story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There was also not that much of Master Shredder. There should have been more of him throughout the story. The fight scenes with Master Shredder were cool, but they were too plain. It did not give that intense vibe that good fighting scenes usually give.The special effects for this were out of this world. But it was strange to see how big the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were made to be. It was a bit much.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
149,SpoodermanDerp,A Movie Aimed for the New Generation,6,17 August 2014,"Now before I begin this review let me clear the fact that this MOVIE is aiming for the new younger audience. This movie is not focusing on aiming for the fans of the past generation. So lets look at it this way.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is directed by Jonathan Liebsman and Produced by Michael Bay. It stars Megan Fox as April O'Neil, and 4 turtles who don't look that good with the CGI. With this kind of set up, its already predictable that this would be a disaster.As I watched this movie in a theater packed with a tremendous amount of children. I guess I could say, this movie was entertaining for me. The stars of the movie are, hands down the Turtles especially Mikey. They stole the movie in every scene they were in, and I would watch a 1 hour movie with just all of them goofing around and making jokes. However, in fact the movie often negates the fact that the turtles are the main subject in this movie, it circles it's story mostly around April O'Neil. As for her character, I found her annoying at many times. And because Michael Bay has something to do with this movie, Megan Fox had to do scenes for the ""benefit' of Bay as usual. Going back to the turtles, I think that they had nailed them and captured everything that we loved about them, the movie is worth watching because of them. The Villains are one of the weak points of this film. Shredder is a very dull, boring and predictable villain. He is only there for what I believe is fan service. Other than that, his motives are unclear and the reason he is in this movie is for the battle scenes.As for the story, it is filled with unbelievable amounts of cliché. Because of this, I had no choice but to be irritated at times or sometimes these scenes gave no effect to me whatsoever even if the main intention of the scene was entirely different. The evil plot of the villain, was downright cringe worthy, plot holes were circling from there and there. . Clichés and plot holes aside, the story is what I would imagine for children and all of us were to look it that way, then I guess I could say the plot was alright I guess. The action sequences were just OK, there were some that were interesting and some that was incredibly DIFFICULT to watch. I know Michael Bay didn't direct this, but My God. Every Michael Bay action-cliché is in this movie. The Slow Motion, Explosions, Attractive Women and the incredibly shaky camera. I almost felt dizzy watching some of the action sequences. At the end of the day, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great movie to watch if you want bonding times with your kids or if you're totally high or craving for some pizza. In my opinion, it won't ruin your childhood, in fact it might even remind and bring back old memories of your childhood, with the many references being made in this movie. The kids will love this movie and I recommend everyone to bring pizza while watching it. A dull and boring villain, a mediocre plot filled with a massive amount of clichés and Michael Bay style action sequences. without the Turtles, this movie would be pure trash.Verdict: 6.5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
150,moviescoundrel,Turtle Power,6,14 August 2014,"Like I said, I was not expecting this to be brilliant and it was not. Some of the CGI characters other than the turtles (Shredder and Splinter) at times looked very bad and PowerRangerish when in action. Lame. Also, Megan Fox was completely awful, and Arnett made the film a bit more bearable but also was nothing special. The bright spot here was the take on the Ninja Turtles. It was spot on. The look, the attitude, the chemistry between the brothers, the dialogue, the action, and the wit. The film is a bit slow in the beginning, but the last 40 minutes or so is pretty entertaining with enough decent action and effects. If you don't take it too seriously, and just want to have a good time, or you're a fan, give it some time and shouldn't disappoint horribly.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
151,pcrprimer,"Turtles share great chemistry and action, but not much in terms of plot",8,13 August 2014,"Considering that Bay is the producer and Megan Fox is one of the lead actresses, the expectations were pretty low and primarily appealed to my sense of nostalgia. I was pleasantly surprised with the action scenes, and the chemistry between the turtles. Each of the characters all had a unique personality, and Splinter was also a pleasant surprise. The movie started out slowly, but picked up after the subway attack. It also understood that too long of a runtime would be a detriment, and therefore runs a good length. If you think too much about the plot, it's not hard to find plot holes. Also, Megan Fox is a very weak April but its partly due to her off-screen persona dominating all of her roles.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
152,Tyson14,Clearly the worst version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ever created,3,30 October 2014,"'ve been an avid supporter of the film since the second trailer was released. I was openly judgemental on my opinion on the initial leaked pictures but then after seeing them in motion a couple times, I was starting to get a little more into the concepts. Sure, I still think all the goofy accessories are a bit much like Raphael's sunglasses (which I still don't know how they fit on his head) and Michelangelo's necklace but there were moments in all the various marketing materials that had me beyond excited to finally see this in the theatre. All I really wanted out of this film was the same feeling that I get when I think of TMNT in my mind. Great stories, them being actual ""ninjas"" and incredible fights with Shredder. I was hoping that we were going to get some of that at least, even in small doses. I've been the TMNT guy beating my chest for this movie hopefully to get a chance as the underdog against the massively successful GOTG and for the Turtles to reign supreme once again. I won an advanced screening last night and I took my younger brother of 4 years to go see it with me who grew up with me loving the TMNT just as much. We're both avid obsessed fans of the Mirage series and the first 1990 movie but we knew we were going into something that was it's own creation while drawing the tone and vibe of mainly the cartoon. Either way, we just wanted to see this damn thing.Which leads me to my verdict about the film. Guys, it's not a very good movie.I originally wanted to do pro and con list but I felt I might as well just give some of my thoughts after seeing the film. The plot is horribly thin and never feels confident in the story it's trying to tell. I read a review that said that this movie is often embarrassed by it's material at times and I'd almost agree with that. It's one thing to change an origin story and add/leave out certain things because you feel it benefits the new story you're trying to tell but in the case of this movie, it doesn't add anything to it.You can tell that this is the kind of movie that needed a director with a creative vision. Everything feels like a giant compromise to just put something out because the studio was expecting a brand new Ninja Turtle film but all of the backlash from what they were originally WANTING to do caused them to go back and add things that they didn't fully understand why people are fans of those aspects. Aside from being let down from that, my brother and I's two favourite Ninja Turtles are Raph (me) and Mikey (him) and they were probably the worst written of the Turtles. I'll never understand the desire to continue to write Michelangelo as an idiot and obnoxious. I get it he's the goofier one, but Mikey borders on a bumbling moron half the film and it was extremely on the nose. I always gave 2007 TMNT s*** for it's use of horrible fight scenes and while some moments in this new one are nice, I still feel like I'm just watching a video game cut scene with Shredder and the Turtles.I guess if I have to give this film credit is that it's cinematography at times is very nice and the opening sequence as well as Shredder's first appearance gave me straight goosebumps but this film misses the mark on so many things. I didn't want to dislike this really, but it is what it is. I'll still love the TMNT of course and nothing will take them away from me (hyping for this movie has brought back my TMNT comic love again)....but I almost hope this franchise doesn't continue and we get an eventual re- imagining somewhere down the line. I guess I'm just not as excited to see more stories told in this TMNT universe.And for the record, I still stand by the fact that the original 1990 film still holds up and is probably one of the best comic book adaptations ever produced. Those who think the franchise was entirely silly probably didn't read any of the Mirage comic books and doesn't understand the true source material. Sure, the cartoons were goofy but that was the KID's cartoon. If you don't like TMNT, that's one thing....but to just assume the franchise as a whole should be overlooked as goofy is assuming you can think the same thing for something like Guardians of the Galaxy. There just needs to be someone with a passion for the source material that can make it work like the original 1990 movie did",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
153,aldri-feb,"Not as bad as what critics say, at least this reboot of four legendary turtles deliver a fun ride",5,9 August 2014,"Far from the word ""perfect"" but not that horrible either, this reboot of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle' is actually beyond my expectation and it quite works to at least entertain. I personally wasn't expecting much before seeing these because of some negative reviews from most critics but I must admit I enjoy myself during seeing it. What probably goes wrong with the film is some illogical issues and some minor mistakes like how could Splinter easily learn fighting skills. But of course the real problem was addressed to April O'Neil itself as main protagonist who seems uninteresting to follow and sometimes felt dull, also the chosen of Megan Fox to play the character has aggravated this condition. Her acting doesn't fit with the role that makes every time she appears just forgettable.Thankfully, that whole flaws and messes could be covered by four adorable ninja turtles. The way it gives attention to turtles' character is well-organized, it shows each character has their own personality and leaves them same portion to shine. Though 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' won't be memorable compared with some blockbuster films this year and the ending isn't special either, it's still just wildly fun to watch Raphael, Leonardo, Donatello and Michaelangelo in action also assisted with stunning visual effects for the turtles, some smart jokes and quite cool action sequences makes all the mistakes seem forgiven.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
154,maxastree,Giant Poop Coloured Creatures Emerge From Sewer for Youth Culture Pizza Spend Up,2,29 September 2014,"I would like to say, that, firstly the CGI artists for this film did a great job at animating the creatures with flawless photorealistic 3D rendering programs, but that also the creatures look like giant poop shaded lumps of excrement, that fight, charge, and leap dramatically about when faced with an army of militarized ninjas in this oddly scripted movie, featuring unnecessarily sexist character repartee and no clear motivations for the antagonists, save some convenient plot device in the last act to lead the action toward a standard cliffhanger resolution.The film frequently avoids character development also, for instance, Splinter's on screen moment is actually a product placement sequence for Pizza Hut, and the turtles and April O'Neil's workmates repeatedly ""cajole"" (see: sexually harass) her. Unfortunately, Megan Fox is not that likable on screen, which suggests that producer Michael Bay is satisfied to repeatedly hire an actress simply because she looks good in the promo shots.I won't spoil the plot, but the Turtles do get in some big-ass action sequences, with kicking, leaping and multiple explosions. Often, I was left wondering how and where plot elements were introduced to the film, as if concept artists had created visual ideas but the director and writers didn't bother to explain them fully, or unusual backstory elements were included, but the director and producer didn't realize that they resulted in annoyingly improbable situations etc . . . Ultimately, you get a lot of high end CGI of the big poopy looking grey-green-brown 'mutants' in wet darkness, or falling from great height and telling April that she looks 'hot', which may have a psychologically adverse effects on young female viewers. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is directed by Hollywood brat and Transformers licensee Michael Bay, and directed by that guy that did the b-movie Wrath of the Titans. I would suggest only seeing this movie if you have a high irritation threshold, romanticize late 80's trash ninja flicks like ""American Ninja 2: the Confrontation"" or like the idea of big grey-brown poopy sewer mutants advertising Pizza Hut.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
155,sunraider,Enough to get me to check out the original,6,16 August 2014,"Although I was a teen in the '80s, I somehow missed the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles craze. Maybe it was because I was a girl but, for whatever reason, I had little knowledge of this franchise. Having seen this film I can see why the Turtles were popular back in their hey day. The turtles are the only thing good about this film. They're adorable and it's fun to watch their camaraderie, brotherly infighting, and goofy antics. But there's not enough of them on screen. The movie's main character is April O'Neil, the reporter, and not the turtles. As others have said, there wasn't enough downtime in this movie where we get to enjoy the brothers being silly teenagers.Out of curiosity I picked up the 1990 movie at a local B&N afterwards; it was in the bargain section for $4.99. Have to admit that I enjoyed that movie more because the turtles were the main characters and acted more like real teenagers instead of massive hulking indestructible superheroes. In the current film, the sheer size and strength of the turtles made them seem more like adults. I kept waiting for the Megan Fox character to say something motherly or sisterly like ""Gosh, you're just kids!"" and be protective of them. But, considering that they had superhero size and strength that wouldn't really have made much sense. It's a shame this new movie didn't build upon the best elements of original, which would be the enduring filial bond between the turtles, their relationship with their father-figure, Splinter, and the introduction of a human sister/mother figure, April, who could watch over them in a different way.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
156,slicedbread117,Missing the basics of a great TMNT movie,5,13 August 2014,"Like many other people, the original 1990 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie has a very special place in my childhood. Even if the movie wasn't all that great, it was fantastic for what it was trying to be. Now we're in 2014, where our beloved turtles have been given a whole new lick of paint with a straight-up reboot and have the daunting task of winning the long time TMNT faithful over. Needless to say that for the most part, I am one fan that was not entirely won over.First and foremost, the Turtles. What is the fundamental premise of the TMNT? They're wise-cracking, pizza-eating, energetic teenagers that just so happen to be mutated ninja turtles that fight crime. The Turtles are goofballs, but in 2014, it's a little bit of a different story. There's still the humor, the jokes and comedy, but now the turtles are massive 6-foot-tall, muscle-bound turtle-men who have a very gritty feel to them, and when they're not in action, look way too real and off-putting. If they weren't green and didn't have shells, the Turtles would literally just be your average hulking action heroes. This franchise is about giant turtles who do martial arts. It's a goofy concept. Giving the Turtles a gritty makeover seems to miss the appeal of the characters in a fundamental way. However, despite the poor design choice of the Turtles, they really are a joy to watch. It might be a lot more serious than you'd expect from TMNT, but the Turtles are still wildly entertaining and more action-fueled than ever with the help of solid effects and choreography that bring the Turtle action to life. If you can withstand the eyesore that the Turtles' design brings, then there is still a lot of old school TMNT magic to revisit.For the movie's main plot, you have what is essentially the most painfully basic, generic action story that a film can get. The movie is so predictable, it's almost laughable. What is also very disappointing is that the Turtles are no longer fighting crime, even though that's what is essentially believed, but a basic supervillain. Yes, the ultimate TMNT villain Shredder is in the film, but not only does he not get the screen time or proper development he deserves, he's basically cast aside as a secondary villain to the ""I'm rich but have to get richer"" villain that is Eric Sacks. It's disappointing to not be able to see the Turtles fight their way through dozens of foot soldiers like the old days, with all of the witty remarks during combat intact. There are still funny lines sputtered during combat, but the action scenes are so limited that there's simply not enough of it. Not helping is the horrendous casting of Megan Fox as April O'Neil. In 1990, April O'Neil was the hot shot news reporter that made the amazing discovery of the Turtles and she developed an amazing bond with them. She was important to the story no doubt, but wasn't essential in the Turtle's story. Fast forward to 2014, and now April is nothing but the center of attention for everything in the movie, even essential back story information about the Turtles. Megan Fox amazingly gets much more screen time than the Turtles, and every time she comes on screen I cringe until our shelled heroes return. Not every action movie has to have an epic story line or to feel gritty and real. TMNT is supposed to be all about the opposite, but the unfortunate presence of producer Michael Bay is clearly felt in the direction of the film. From the camera shots, to the serious tone of the action to the slow motion parts, this movie has too much of a focus on seriousness, when it should be taking itself very lightly. Like I stated earlier, despite the off-putting design and feel of the Turtles, they still are a lot of fun to watch and are the lifeblood of the film. What is missing, however, is the strong character development of the Turtles. There isn't enough down time in the movie to really get to know them. Some of the best moments of the 1990 film were in the form of the Turtles hanging out, making jokes, eating pizza and training together. That chemistry was not felt as strongly in the new TMNT and the movie just assumes that you all ready know who and what each Turtle is all about. But all you really find out is that one is a jokester, one's a tech geek, one's the leader and one has anger issues. More down time and better character development would've given the Turtles the extra boost to make them the incredibly entertaining bunch they're meant to be.Being such a huge TMNT fan, I wanted to have higher expectations for this reboot. But with Megan Fox and Michael Bay attached, the poor look and design of the Turtles, along with the general off-setting feel of the film, I had to come in with lower expectations. There are some wonderful action sequences and the Turtles bring enough pop to the movie to make them likable and fun, but sadly, my low expectations were met in this failed attempt the reboot a childhood classic.5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
157,Badmoviessuck,Micheal bay must stop whatever he is doing,3,4 November 2018,"This movie is really bad and let me tell you why.COMEDY
The humor is really cheap and lame and doesn't have any thought brought into it.
Ik this movie is for teenage boys but that isn't an excuse to the cheap and lazy humor.
EXAMPLE: When Vernon talked to April about being a serious reporter instead of making that joke short and simple they drag it out longer than it needs and that makes you pay more attention to it and see how bad that joke is.
EXAMPLE 2: Mickey farting isn't funny, fart jokes aren't funny for adults or teens it's just lazily written humor.DIALOGUE
The dialogue is cliche and boring especially when shredder speaks cause he says tons of cliche villain stuff like ""The Insert evil group here will rise again"", ""Your men are weak"", ""It's no surprise your mission failed"", ""No one will stop us in our quest
to reclaim victory"" or ""We will own this city"" those are a lot of cliche lines right there.
And also a small thing how can Shredder say that the Foot clan will rise again when they are never even defeated. They are big news out there and Shredder is acting like the foot clan are dead.
And the movie has also a problem explaining what we have already seen
EXAMPLE: They show how April wants to be a serious reporter but later Vernon says that April wants to be a serious reporter.
We already knew that but the people making this film think we are stupid so they explain everything we already know.
There are more examples of moments where they explain stuff we already know.CGI
The CGI isn't good.
The turtles look weird and unnatural and there are moments in the movie that you can clearly see are CGI.
It's often that the Action scenes are 100% CGI and if they are not then it's a lot of shaky cam.CHARACTERS
All the characters are one dimensional.
April the bland character who doesn't show any emotion at all.
They SAY in the movie that she has a deep connection to the turtles but she doesn't act like she has a deep connection to the turtles and Splinter, she barely speaks to them at all but the reason they SAY that she has a deep connection to the turtles and Splinter is because of plot convenience.
The turtles are also one dimensional.
Donatello the super smart nerdy boy, Leonardo the serious leader, Mickey the annoying comic relief who has a crush on April, Raphael is the only one in the team who has a little bit more depth but its not a lot of depth he has he is just the guy who acts tuff so he can hide his emotions.
They all act how they should act in TMNT but the problem is that they lack depth.
Splinter is the one dimensional wise sensei and they completely ignore the relationship he had with shredder which is wrong.ACTION
The action scene is a CGI mess if not then its a lot of shaky cam.
There are moments when the turtle fight that i'm like ""Oh that's pretty cool"" but those moments happened three times only.
When action scenes come the resolution to those action scenes are stupid.
EXAMPLE: When 3 of the turtles where captured, April Vernon and Raph broke into Eric Sacks house Eric sacks left Shredder to take care of everything Raph fought Shredder while April and Vernon stood there for awhile Shredder only fought Raph and didn't have any foot clan soldiers to back him up, April pressed random buttons and somehow managed to put Adrenaline so that the turtles could be strong again. and then Shredder left after Recking Raph.
I have another example which i will address later.VILLAINS
Shredder is the worst villain i have ever seen, he barely talks through out the movie and when he does it's cliche dialogue.
Shredder is a really important villain and just making him this small not really that important villain is wrong and stupid.
Eric Sacks is a bad villain but not as bad as Shredder.
All he wants to do is become rich the plan might sound smart but it's really not that smart and his motivation is weak and in the end of the Final battle he is just not that important anymore.FINAL ACT
This is the other example i'm gonna address
The final act was pretty bad.
instead of finding a clever way of defeating Shredder they hurt him by playing buk buk and then later April kicks shredder in the face. That just makes Shredder weak.
And also when the tower falls apart they try to have stakes by saying that If the spire falls and the toxin makes ground impact, it'll contaminate a 10-block radius.
And their chance of succeeding is 0.00000000003% so that means that it's almost impossible for them to succeed.
The reason they did that is so that there could be stakes but you don't need to do it like that it just sounds stupid and it's obvious that they will succeed.
They could just say there is a 40% chance that they will succeed or less.
And when the tower hits the ground they forgot all about the 10 lock radius stuff but remember plot convenience.VERDICT
Is a CGI mess with a bunch of one dimensional characters and a poorly written story with poorly written characters.
Don't watch this movie",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
158,H_Spengler,"Saw for free, still feel ripped off.",1,13 September 2014,"Seriously, Michael Bay & Co. should pay me for sitting through this ridiculous pile of tripe.Grew up with the comics and cartoon show, loved the 1990 movie. Every sense I possess was repeatedly violated with this poor excuse of a greedy cash grab and pizza hut endorsement.I knew not to expect, well, anything really that has Michael Bay's name attached to it, but somehow still managed to be surprised at the sheer badness.The turtles themselves look strange, and act strange. Michaleangelo is like some weird semi-gangsta who is downright creepy in a continuing reference obsession with April O'Neil. Raphael is aloof, but exists little beyond that. That's as far as they went trying to define either one of them. Leonardo, the brave leader, was completely robbed of his personality, characteristics, leadership and anything that would define him, and has always in the past. He is instead a dissolved Bouillon cube in a large pot of water....bland, bland, bland. His voice (Johnny Knoxville) is miscast, and would've been better befitting either Mikey or Raph...that is if they'd bothered to give them any personality.The biggest violations however, lay with Donatello and Splinter, as it seems they thought that hyper-charging the characters would somehow make them interesting, endearing or watchable. ""Donatello does machines"" translates into exploiting him as a constant, textbook, super nerd. And he does absolutely nothing beyond that. Also, he looks like a Ghostbuster. Say hi to Dr. Donatello Stantz. Instead of making Splinter the wise, insightful, deep, sensei he always has been, he's instead to a cardboard cutout that does a lot of ""action stuff"". Don't get me wrong, the Splinter of the cartoon and comics could certainly hold his own, but violence was always the last resort, and had a rationale. (reminds me of what they did to Yoda in the Star Wars prequels.) And he learns Ninjitsu from a book in the sewer, gone is any mysticism or any pivotal, emotional, or vital connection to important characters in the story.Shredder is lame. There's no other way to put it. He is also a hyper charged extension ""more blades piled on the suit will make him better!"" He is unrecognizable beyond the pile of CGI blades, has no depth, no real motivation, and feels needlessly shoe horned into the ""story"" Especially since they terminated any connection with Splinter, or the long important history between them. (by the way, welcome to ""plot convenience playhouse"" when you find out that the turtles and Splinter were pets of April's when she was a girl. How convenient. The biggest human violation is no doubt Megan Fox, who continues to show she's a vapid, terrible actress, incapable of emotion, facial expressions, or the ability to close her mouth. She's absolutely terrible and is no April O'Neil. Michael Bay continues to have an obsession with Megan Fox like you would not believe. She also has no class, instead of choosing to take criticism constructively and look to improving herself and growing into a mature, capable lady, she instead publicly insults any who bashes this movie; (rightfully so) by saying ""f**k you"". Real mature Megan, and a great example for your children.The best actor of the bunch, William Fichtner. I'm still trying to figure out what purpose he served and why he's in this movie to begin with, I keep looking, but...folks, I got nothing' (why is Will Arnett even here?)There's also some defiance of physics as a mountain the size of Everest is apparently located not too far outside NYC, complete with a truck that slides down the side of it for ten straight minutes, with fast paced, confusing, unimpressive special effects. The turtles are ridiculously bullet-proof (which leads me to why are the foot soldiers carrying machine guns? Or any guns for that matter?) The answer I came up with: lazy. Why bother to have some Ninjitsu students, or experts, or extras, in your Ninja movie, when it's easier to have a stunt guy fire a gun. (That or the entire budget went to lame special effects.) Lots of low energy, thick glass shattering, metal side of van punching through escapes that make no sense at all. A yawn inducing, passionless, ""tower rolling down the buildings of NYC"" anti-climatic moments. Lame, just lame.The solution: a marathon of the late 80's cartoon followed by a viewing of the 1990 movie..just to prove that Michael Bay hadn't killed my soul completely. 1/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
159,phoenixyk1,Not as bad I expected...,6,31 August 2014,"Whenever you attempt to do a TMNT movie, it bound to be a little bit Kitsch - That's the nature of the comics after all...Gone are the cartoony looking turtles of the original in favor of something, frankly - More horrific looking...However, they do still work in a way - Each has a very individual personality and that's kinda cool... If there is a downside, It seems to have been inspired by ""Hip Hop/R&B"" Culture too much and could come across as a little bit racist. Its obviously unintentional as they are simply trying to emulate the comics and that stylized writing they had - But you can try TOO HARD!Effects wise, its not bad... Its kind of fun to see the turtles draped in ""iconography"" that sets them apart - Donatello with Tech Gear, Michael Angelo is most defiantly an R&B Wannabe...I could not take to a Brunette April O' Neil... But maybe that's the purist in me... And Shredder (Or rather what you cannot see of him when he first appears) looks good UNTIL he gets into his Armour... When he has become a Super-Suited Robocop Ninja thing!!!! I can suspend disbelief but there is NO WAY that Armour would allow him to perform ANY Martial Art!!! It would bee like doing Tai Chi in Full Jousting Plate!!!In fact, It looks a lot like the concept art for the Silver Samurai in ""The Wolverine"" - I just feel shredder has lost something this time around.Sadly, there are issues with continuity and plot holes galore (Why does Shredder kill Splinter when he TOO has Mutagen in his blood???)- But there are also notable little ""nods"" to the 90's and the original source material to keep fans happy. There is even a little nod to BEN 10 Believe it or not (""Just another day in the life of MAN OF ACTION"" is Quoted by one of the characters - Man of Action Created BEN 10 and suggests that TMNT is one of the things that inspired him in many interviews!)The plot is one of ""I Wanna be Stupidly Rich"" from one of the main baddies - Which is DULL!!!!And despite hints that Shredder is scarred for some reason, you NEVER get to see that or have it explained WHY?The film is overall a good action romp, but it could have had so much more potential. If you were a fan of the Turtles BEFORE this film, You will be disappointed - If not you will enjoy it!Overall, It has moments of excellence, but this is far outweighed by another effects driven 3D movie with no real substance.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
160,j-madej,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is very obviously catered towards the generation of the late 70's and 80's who are now adults and have kids of their own.",6,10 August 2014,"For it's 30th anniversary Paramount Pictures in association with Nickelodeon Movies and director/producer Michael Bay delivered a new 21st century update to an old comic book and kids cartoon ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". Whenever Michael Bay's name is mentioned, most people specially in Hollywood expect the worst. He is the king of commercial look in Hollywood cinema with constant dolly moves and extremely low angles often making the actors look powerful but also artificially cool and trendy. That's what Bay is best at and of course he is a master of the CGI that often is used just as an effect to visually distract the audience from often non existent plot and character development. Lets face it he will never be Stanley Kubrick or Krzysztof Kieslowski and not that he would ever want to be an intellectually driven filmmaker. It is just not his thing. In the nutshell, darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians. The future is grim until four unlikely outcast brothers rise from the sewers and discover their destiny as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Turtles must work with fearless reporter April (Megan Fox) and her wise-cracking cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) to save the city and unravel Shredder's diabolical plan. The performances are highly stylized making everything bigger and more obvious in the acting choices. Duo Megan Fox and Will Arnett lack the tension and comedic wit that you would expect from their characters. The turtles and other CGI creatures are technically well made but lack the believability of other characters done better like this months other big blockbuster characters of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". I always like William Fichtner for his subtle way of delivering lines and ability to show the inner dialog through his eyes. He does not disappoint here as a scientist Eric Sacks. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is very obviously catered towards the generation of the late 70's and 80's who are now adults and have kids of their own. Based on the nostalgia of their childhood there is a strong feeling and perhaps correct one, that this film is a pure money maker that as an objective has to act on the need to revisit a memories of old that motivates the spontaneous decision to go and see this film with your whole family in 3D. However being PG-13 is this film suitable for little kids, perhaps not quite.There are scenes here that are pretty much made artificially and you can see that they look like a video game or cartoon. Though ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" benefits from the usage of 3D technology. I find this fact to be one of the only redeeming qualities about this picture which often gets lost in the chaos of it's visual diarrhea. Not enough time is spend on the development of the characters and their relationships for us to truly care about their faith.But it is not all bad here. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" has some redeeming qualities as long as you lower your expectation thanks to director Jonathan Liebesman who did a good job in developing the main points of the plot. There is no point of over analyzing this film. You will not come out of the cinema thinking about it, but you might enjoy it for what it is. A two hours long mindless entertainment that bring you back to your childhood. Judge for yourself if that is worth for you the ticked admission price. To put it simply, it's entertainment without depth, which for more intellectual viewer might be a waist of time, but for one who want to introduce his childhood heroes to his kids it might be a nice trip back the memory lane.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I told him it was better than Transformers.However, there's a caveat. I had trashed the Transformers just as easily as the Autobots had trashed the Decepticons.As usual, with Bay films, there is an avalanche of violence and quick editing that will make your eyes blurry-eyed.Once the action starts, it just accelerates and leaves you breathless and wanting to get out of the theatre.As for me, I don't know if I was just tired, but I had to fight hard to keep my eyes open, even during the film's chaotic and mind-numbing finale.Another huge problem that audiences will have this film is the fact that they won't connect with the Turtles.Sure, each one has a distinct voice, slightly distinct personality and comes with a coloured mask, but there's nothing about them that will make you feel for them.Even the plot is risible. How many times does New York have to come under attack by malevolent people who are hell-bent on perpetrating their malfeasance?Also, how many times does an up-and-coming TV reporter have to be the one who cracks the case?",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
162,badfeelinganger,"25 years after the first Ninja Turtles' , This movie is meant for fans of the turtles empire",8,18 October 2014,"It's a solid, fun and light-hearted family action flick that captures the oddly enduring appeal of the half-shell heroes. Perhaps what's most appreciative and immediately noticeable in this reboot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is that there is very little toilet humour. Liebesman doesn't treat his film the way Michael Bay treats his Transformers films at all. As a matter of fact, nothing about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (thankfully) resembles a Michael Bay film, so let's just stop talking about him.Instead, let's talk about how there is a good piece of entertainment residing in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles just awaiting to break out of its shell.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is meant for fans of the turtles empire: the original comic books, the myriad animated series, the video games, and even the other films. But a film this stupid fun is sure to make believers out of others as well.Positive rating only because this was made for the now adult kids who loved this growing up and for their children and not for me. They aren't going to care that I hated it. When the movie finally does decide to deliver the turtles we came to see it does it well. I just wish they remembered who the movie was named after sooner.There's enough turtle power to please kids and fans of the original series.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This film comes up short in all departments.First, much of it takes place in the dark (although it's not the sewers, so why so dark?) You miss a lot of the Ninja action. It takes a looooong time for the story to get going, and I imagine young kids have a hard time following the EXTREMELY coincidental plot turns.April goes through all sorts of danger and drama, yet ends up with perfectly coiffed hair and lipstick intact, with nary a scratch or bruise.But mostly I missed the camp. The foursome could have been just about any superhero--and I agree with other posters--why give them such super strength, etc. They're Ninjas! And teenagers!! And TURTLES!!

165,brailsford,"I really tried to like this, but it was like a slap in the face.",1,4 December 2014,"OK when I heard it was a Bay movie initially my view was jaded... I'll admit I waited til now when I was finally ready to give it a chance... seriously I went in willing to give it a chance to wow me. I was wowed... just not in a good way. Right off the bat the music was so over hyped up like it was a big budget blockbuster action film... cliché it was so over the top I couldn't even get into the movie. The music in the original added so much tension and atmosphere to the movie, where as the music it just constantly reminded you you were watching an action movie that felt a need to remind you of its big budget. Then there's was Megan fox, I don't know if she was acting poorly because of her issues with bay, her dislike for the movie, her acting reminded me of Anna Farris in Scary Movie, so maybe she was under the impression this movie was a spoof. I'd say its understandable after seeing the costumes... Splinter looked like a semi skinned warthog.... The turtles looked like a result of a fusion of Mike Tyson and ET and Kermit the frog, the shredder was inexplicably bald. There was a new character added called Sacks he was the bad guy pretending to be a good guy cliché oozing so much hammy overacting that I'm amazed he didn't corrupt the film's negative... what bothers me is that he had more screen time then Karai, heck Whoopi Goldberg as Berne had more screen time than Karai and quite frankly less interesting then I ever imagined Whoopi Goldberg could be. Shredder barely had enough dialogue either, and the most memorable stuff was the ""Tonight I dine on turtle soup"" line thats probably older then some of the writers working on the script. Sadly the most likable character in the entire movie I kid you not Vernon, I kind of wonder if Bay was a closet Vernon fan as he was surprisingly heroic and tough in the film. The film also had some stuff that was just so unnecessary as well as weird... Remember that scene with the turtles in the elevator from some commercials also a popular gif? It didn't feel any more in place in the actual film, There was also a scene of the turtles as children dancing to holla back girl.... you can't unsee that... Also I'm not saying this film is the only one guilty of it, but Raph has the most interesting experiences, in the first one he almost was killed, in the second one he was kidnapped , the 4th one he became a vigilante, this one he looks like he is killed then he is killed and comes back to save everyone. Another unneeded how is this possible, April finds a working pay phone... never mind the fact that I think it seriously would be easier to find giant talking ninja turtles in new york... but April clearly had an iPhone at one point (granted it was wiped, but I don't remember it being destroyed) Also there was Donnies hacking which bordered on ridiculous.... especially given later on when they he was trying to defuse a contaminant sprayer and was miffed by CLI. Then there was Aprils connection with the turtles... this bothered me the most about the movie, for in this universe they had started out as Aprils pets and were being tested with experimental drugs by her father and the bad guy for something called project renaissance (and you thought Venus was a dumb addition didn't you?). Aside from being bald, the shredders suit looked like something out the rejected marvel villains costumes lot as now his gauntlets now all worked like magnetic boomerangs and were roughly the size of machetes.Anyway if I have to put this abomination in a range of how bad it was, its somewhere between turtles 3 and next mutation.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
166,gdeangel,Why do movies like this seem to think CGI -> no soul?,2,29 December 2014,"Watched this movie back-to-back with the 1990's original today. Could not help feeling betrayed, the way I feel betrayed when I watch the Transformers movies, or those other ""super hero"" movies that seem to go from good to bad (remember Batman & Robin? Spiderman 3? Superman IV?) What this movie did to deserve 2 (as opposed to 1) stars: realistic, beautifully rendered turtle ninja's with a distinct ""hard core"" visual feel appropriate to the 21-st century of xBox One and PS4.What this movie did to deserve no more than 2 stars: a story centered on long boring ""wow"" effects driven battle sequences that actually put me to sleep. A plot that skips ahead with lurches that rival Transformers - Dark of the Moon. Complete absence of ""turtle identity""... don't even think they said ""Kawabonga"". In the 90's movie, they were producing an homage to a cultural icon TV cartoon. April had her trademark yellow raincoat, the turtles reveled mightily in their pizza moments, and they were cast as a bunch of joke heroes who were unbeatable: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hero's in a Half-Shell. Ridiculous but fun to watch not because you worried about whether shredder would gas the world with red Anthrax, but because these misfits had so much fun kicking shredder's but all over the place. Like watching Howard the Duck shred on guitar. And in this last aspect, the 1990's film departed a bit from the light-hearted feel of the cartoon to take on a dramatic ""big screen"" edge, but supplanted the main themes with comic and romantic elements with the Casey Jones character. Generally acceptable.This 2014 movie appears to have been conceived around the high-stakes action drama concept from the start. There is very little fun. The turtles get their buts kicked all over the place. The foot clan, instead of being a bumbling gang of martial-arts also rans, turned into those generic AR toting bad guys you blast away in name-your-video-game without a second thought.What you do get is a lot of eye-candy for the I-Max / 3-D HD screen. At bottom, it's the ""immersive"" tent-ride at the county fair where they used to project a first person roller coaster ride onto a curved sheet and everyone said ""wow"" and left feeling a little dizzy, only now it's been run through a battery of GPU's to bear hardly any adherence to actual laws of physics. In the middle of any one of these battles, they could have cropped out those beautifully rendered turtles and put in four transformers - that's how fungible the action and dialog are.Sad. Could you imagine in the 80s equating Transformers with TNMT? Please Hollywood, pay more attention to who you put in charge of these projects.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

She is surprisingly bearable and this movie did not have a lot of her, if you dislike her. There is only 3 scenes in which she showed off her body. I am more interested in the turtles part. At first you think they are quite ugly, but later they look cute. Leonardo is the polite leader, Raphael the angsty rebel, and clown Michelangelo who has a crush on April, and lastly genius Donatello. The story might be a tad clichéd, but it is fast-paced and fun. You feel the real emotions and love that the turtles feel for their daddy Splinter, as well as April and her father. Some parts which can be improved is make the turtles stronger because they go inconsistently from super weak to invincible. Also no explanations were given as to what was Foot Clan and how did Shredder get so powerful, so it was confusing for people who did not read the comics.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
169,Netscape_Navigator,Megan Fox must've taken an ONLINE ACTING CLASS.,5,2 November 2014,"I went into this thinking it would probably be a little bit better than what the reviews suggest. Just based on the nostalgia factor alone, I thought this movie would at least be a 7 out of 10 for me. Unfortunately this movie is extremely dull, boring, and has bad acting. Megan Fox is terrible. It's like she took an online acting class that taught her how to say lines convincingly, but since it's only an online class, one very essential part of the lesson was missed: FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. She can speak (I guess), but she can't emote with her face.Let's stop for a second, I'm going to quote a line from my review of the first Transformers movie from 2007, so you can see a theme here:""...that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look.""I guess she took a couple more online acting classes, since she upgraded her facial expressions for this movie. This time, instead of looking like she's wondering if her co-worker had the day off, when she encounters unbelievable things in this movie that for anyone else would've been HORRIFIC, she looks like someone who's troubled at not having any vacation days left for the year, and so is pondering if they should just call off next Monday and hopefully not get in trouble.The first time she meets the turtles, she doesn't look appropriately shocked. When she goes on that rooftop, she essentially sees a monster. That's what they are. For all intents and purposes, these turtles would appear to you as monsters. So she meets these talking green monsters, who are no shorter than 6'3'' , but she just has the SAME stupid expression of *mild concern*. She also didn't scream. At all. I don't care who you are, if you're a woman, meeting four very tall green MONSTERS with dangerous WEAPONS, you're going to scream. But not Megan Fox, she just has the face of someone who's sorry that a very distant cousin she never met passed away.**Splinter looked weird in this movie. His eyes were a bit TOO rodent-like and realistic, those perfect black orbs that were his eyes. Very unsettling.**I don't like the minimal amount of martial arts done in this movie. Most of the fight scenes consisted of the turtles brute forcing their way through their opponents. Off the top of my head, the only impressive shot was when Mikey did some jumping attack with his nunchucks and took out two people before he tripped or something. Everything else was just punches, and throwing bad guys against walls.**When April is first ""kidnapped"" by the turtles, and had the mask put on her head, why wasn't she afraid?? Shouldn't she show a BIT of concern? Sure, she doesn't really see these monsters as necessarily a threat, but even then, you just had a mask put over your head by monsters, you should at the very least ask ""WHERE ARE WE GOING?"" All of Megan Fox's interactions with the turtles are just so SUBDUED, as if she's too cool to play it as a fidgety, scared person. As if she's too cool to open her eyes really wide to show fear, and move her body in jumpy ways to look like someone who's in disbelief at meeting a talking green MONSTER. When Leo put his arm around her, she didn't even care that much. **I didn't like how in typical cartoon like fashion, all of April's co-workers mocked and ridiculed her story when she tried to explain herself. When does that EVER happen? Your close buddy might rib you, but when does an entire office laugh AT you, and not with you?? Play that out in your mind as you in your own workplace, and you'll see how ridiculous this movie trope is.**When April called Whoopi Goldberg over to show her the ""evidence,"" why didn't she show her the cellphone picture of the turtles??? Why START OFF the explanation with a pin up picture of a real turtle on the wall and point to it and say that's the vigilante? OF COURSE Whoopi Goldberg is not going to believe you!!!! She already laughed your story off the first time, what makes you think you seem any MORE credible now??**I hated how the ending pretty much gave April a very important role in the bad guy's defeat. I would've rather seen the turtles be able to accomplish this on their own.Ugh, I can't see this franchise getting any better. To this day, the only good live action turtles movie was the original, I gave that a 10 out of 10, because that actually had a purposeful narrative and non-offensive acting.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
170,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles Review,5,7 August 2014,"My Thoughts: I am going to come out and admit it I am a TMNT fan have been since the early 90s. I did not start out with the Eastman/Laird comics like some. My first brush with the Turtles was the cartoon and then later I found the original comics and read them. I am going to do my best to give you an unbiased opinion first and then later on give you the fan boy experience.The one thing I came to realize last night after watching the new TMNT movie is that people have different views on the Turtles and depending on when or how you were introduced to them the origin story has changed from its original concept. If you want to learn more about the history of the Turtles go ahead and click here.I will admit it I went into this movie thinking I was going to come out just hating it, but that was not the case I had an enjoyable time. Was there things wrong with the movie? Yes. But did that really detract from me watching the movie? No. It did at times pull me back and go no that isn't how it was suppose to go or why did they change that.One of the things that did not work for me was Tony Shalhoub voicing Master Splinter. It did not gel right with me and just seemed off. But I do give props to Danny Woodburn who did the mo-cap for Splinter and have to say some of my favorite fight scenes involve Splinter.Shredder is in this movie and it is not who we are lead to believe in the trailers and I have to say he is a badass, but what I didn't like is the modernization of the Shredder armor. It is just over the top and CGIed that it just looks ridiculous to me every time I saw it on screen. They do show the original armor before it gets all techno out and I really wish they had kept it in.Megan Fox as April O'Neil what can I say about her. One I do not think she is a good actress and I do not think she measures up to or can fit April O'Neil's reporting shoes. I also think the writers didn't really know what to do with this character. At times we would see a female heroin that was holding her own with the Turtles and Shredder. Then we would cut to the next scene and she would turn into the damsel in distress needing to be saved.What I really enjoyed was the Turtles I think they nailed their characteristics. Was their origin story tweaked? Yes it was. But if you go back and look at the 90s cartoon, the 90s movie, or even the present day comics or cartoons the origin story has been tweaked from what we were given in the original comics by Eastman and Laird. Does it ruin the Turtles for you? No. They also paid homage to some of the history or icon scenes that we have scene in previous Turtles shows or books.And we have to really think about who this movie is for. Yes they made some changes for the die hard Turtle fans but will that be enough to make them happy? I don't think so. But this movie is meant for kids and teenagers and they are going to enjoy the hell out of this movie. My Recommendation: I would gladly see this movie over any Transformers movie. Many parents will not be disappointed taking their kids to see this movie. Is it a great movie? No. Is it a horrible rip your eyes out I can't believe they did that to my beloved Turtles? No.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
171,CrisMovieCorner,Consider me shell shocked! COWABUNGA!!!,8,26 October 2014,"Finally got to watch it, over two months after release in the US, us UK fans finally got to feast our eyes on the reboot that 99% were worried about or didn't want I for one was split right down the middle.The film opens up with April O'Neil (Fox) a news reporter who is struggling to make a name for herself in the news world, that is until one day she witnesses a vigilante take down gang members of a the local crime syndicate known as ""The Foot Clan"". Finding it nearly impossible to get anybody to believe her story (with good reason), her constant work on this project and digging deep gets her face-to-face with the members of the titular TMNT Leonardo (Knoxville & Ploszek), Raphael (Ritchson), Michelangelo (Fisher) and Donatello (Howard).Due to her constant digging April fins herself reconnecting with the old scientist friend and partner of her dead father Sacks (Fichtner) who seems to have some very sinister reasons in wanting to find the Turtles for himself. He wants the Turtles back so he can extract the mutagen from them which made them mutate into the Mutant Ninja Turtles we all know and love today in order to set in motion his less than legitimate plans he has with sinister Shredder.Overall, the film for me personally was absolutely incredible, I have been a fan for over two decades and inside was insanely excited for the film if a bit apprehensive due to Bay's record of ""if it exists I will blow the crap out of it"". With Bay serving as producer some of his overly used tropes still stand but they work in the film due it being a pure action flick.One of the huge complaints I seem to see going around is that ""they changed to much"", but come on, you can't get in a mood over the fact that they didn't use the story that we were already given in the original animated series. However, for me changing it up didn't really matter that much, while it was different if fitted in nicely wit a newly revived film franchise made this world they are creating if you will a whole lot better. They even added a new twist that includes April having a more important role in the Turtles becoming the Turtles, which for me was a great addition to the back story, made them so much more of a ""family"" with April in a way serving as their parent along with Splinter.They also changed how Splinter now learnt his martial art ways from book he found in the sewer, the book dons the authors name Hamato Yoshi's in the original origin Splinter is an incarnation of Hamato Yoshi. However, in this reboot Yoshi is completely written out the story allowing I guess Splinter to be his own character. They still did keep Yoshi's name in the story to pay homage to the beautiful origin of the franchise I have loved since I was a toddler.The film is full on Action ride, while the story is less than you get in the 2 hour plus runtime Dramas, you still get everything you need from the story. The characters are absolutely brilliant, as always Mikey steals so many scenes with his perfectly timed idiotic remarks, nonsensical gibberish and unrequited love for pizza specifically an unheard of 99 cheese pizza! After watching the film I am SUPER pumped for the sequel however many there will be, especially excited for the inclusion of Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang and Casey Jones. Can you believe these guys are coming to this world? My mind is blown! I can HIGHLY recommend you check this out, the film is full of Action, laughs, Turtles kicking butt, martial artistic scenes and my childhood being revived! If I did have to pick a complaint or two I would have to say that Shredder looked like he was ripped from a Transformers film and Megan Fox being so blatantly untalented and only cast for her looks was a let down. Other than that I will be buying this film on day of release and watching for many years to come.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
172,twh-00286,"Not too bad, but casting...",6,6 January 2021,"Didn't think it was as bad as many say.
It is TMNT, so it is a bit oversized and a bit overdone, but it's what one expects.
The Turtles are bigger and look like juggernauts, but why not?
The only issue is with the casting. Of course William Fitcher is a bad guy, usually is, though his performance is impressive as usual.
Regarding April O'Niel though, what was that about?
I am unsure if part of Fox's contract was the constant adoration and compliments, but it seemed unneeded. As for her character portrayal, seemed rather lackluster and forced. Would have been nicer to have a newer actress who was as ""hungry"" as April O'Niel was shown to be. Plus this wasn't the Transformers part 5 or whatever...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
173,koen_smit,Michael Bay did it again: he produced another useless screen filler that was a waste of my time.,4,6 September 2014,"Why? It's meant to be funny, but it's not. The turtles I remember were. I think I laughed 3 times. Main actress Megan Fox has the charisma and acting ability of a wooden board. Choices she makes are unclear, if the directer wanted her to feel something, he probably said to her: now I zoom into your face and you breathe in with your eyes slightly wider (as much as she can with all the fixing she has had done). The only thing important is action and effects and those are so wildly done that half of the time you cannot follow what is actually happening. I get bored with the camera delays and the sideways movements. They are in the middle of the snowy mountains and within minutes they are back in the center of Manhatten. Seriously. The movie is not finished, extremely predictable, many plot questions are unanswered and characters just disappear without hearing something about their fate or at least given a heads up for a sequel (I'm sure they are going to let him do another one *sigh*). It's just a load of bull, such a waste of money - not as bad as the Transformer movies, but equally boring and dumb. Such a pity Whoopi Goldberg and William Fichtner got themselves attached to this movie – I love them, luckily they did manage to keep their acting ability at an acceptable level and therefor my rating is not lower. I gave him one last chance, but now I am sure: I will not watch a Michael Bay movie ever again.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
174,dunnypop,Truly awful,3,29 December 2014,It took me 3 tries to get through the film... First off I grew up watching the TMNT when I was a kid... yes I'm old and not too jaded. I enjoyed Michael Bay's Transformers 1 & 3... 4 is awful. I loved the first TMNT live action movie and the recent CGI animated film... but this film is bad...The script tries to give this film a 'modern' spin but it fails in having any logic in the film. 1. Why is the villain doing what they are doing? There's really no motive (no spoilers but you'll ask this when money is a motive but it really shouldn't be). 2. How do you learn ninjitsu through a book? 3. Why are there sexual innuendo's with the turtles and April? This is for kids? This is for adults? 4. Why is it snowing a couple of hours north away from New York City? Climate change isn't that bad. 5. How are turtles bulletproof? 6. The turtles lacked any character depth or traits. You need to go into the film knowing who the turtles are. 7. Where is the martial arts?Overall the film started off exciting and then it was pointless and then there were some interesting action sequences... but there was a lack of any martial arts. Avoid.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
175,NotAnotherMovieCritic,Decent But Not Great,6,26 October 2014,"The original movies, although corny, were amazing films, probably due to the fact I was a kid and I pretty much enjoyed a lot of bad films, but the original holds a high place in my favorite childhood films.What the original had, this one lacked. The new version tried to be the old films, but instead didn't quite give the performance it so desperately needed. This film would have been better if it hadn't been for the bad casting. Megan Fox is a horrible April O'Neil, in fact I could have cared more for her if it had been cast right. Even the turtles were kind of bland.The story line is what kept this film interesting. I liked a lot of the new story line, some of it was a little too Hollywood-ish, like the connection between April and the Turtles.All in all it wasn't the best film but it also wasn't the worst. Give it a try, it's a 50/50 thing and you might find yourself where I stand.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
176,videodrome1234,Eh...,3,23 August 2014,"Paramount seems to think that every game and comic book adaptation works well for them. So when TMNT's rights came to them they went ahead and started productions on a feature film. For this they used the present day's golden egg laying goose Michael Bay. Bay didn't direct the film, he had his hands full with somehow making a billion dollars on the new Transformers for Paramount but he did agree to becoming the producer. Everything still was prepared for the turtles to get a Michael Bay makeover. In my opinion this is not the biggest info that needs to be known about this film. It is more important to ask whether this film needs to be made at all, but this could be asked about Transformers too. But there at least there was a major difference. When the first part was made already the trailer had everyone convinced that visual fx wise we hadn't seen anything like it before. Then came G.I. Joe that was almost built on the same foundation but the results weren't as positive. It didn't flop but it was even questionable whether the sequel would ever be made. It did, but why?... Same with TMNT. I think no matter how hard the trailer tried to convince us that this would be cool and we would all be interested it kind of didn't work. Not to mention that the people who back in the day, no matter how lame it was or its mistakes, still remember the first trilogy and maybe even think back on it nostalgically with love, don't need a remake. Plus those who liked the original did so because they thought it was funny and we all wanted to be a Turtle on Halloween. Will it be like that now? Somehow I doubt it. There's not much new in the story, just maybe a few characters: Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians. The future is grim until four unlikely outcast brothers rise from the sewers and discover their destiny as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Turtles must work with fearless reporter April O'Neil and her cameraman Vern Fenwick to save the city and unravel Shredder's diabolical plan. I have to start with the fact that the original trilogy is kind of lame, with its rubber turtle costumes, but it was still much more believable than this CGI band of ninjas. The problem is that the whole thing sort of seems strange. Yes the film visually pleasing but the turtles are so not life like. It's a little like a cartoon on nitro. Of course I do know that in 2014 they can't exactly dress up people in rubber costumes, but they CGI to me just doesn't work. The action and the visual fx do, but the question does arise if this should be the most important aspect of a TNMT film, of course Michael Bay would think so. I don't. For me the cast and the script should be forefront in a turtle movie, because in the original that was what grabbed us, not the visuals. Unfortunately the script isn't the best, it does have a few jokes that the turtles crack, but the rest is pretty cliché. The actors are okay but there were even a couple that where totally the wrong choice, but mostly they are all annoying. MB made TMNT into Transformers and it didn't suit them. 4/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
177,thedukeofmovietown,Put on an orange headband and celebrate your birthday early,8,14 September 2014,"I just saw TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES! I haven't read one other review about the movie yet, but I'm willing to bet someone out there is saying, ""they're raping my childhood!"" but what they fail to take into account is that TMNT has a history that stretches 30 years! During that time, there have been many many iterations of the turtles, from the hardcore original comics, to the campy 1987 animated turtles, to the current TV show on Nickelodeon. There are literally over a dozen different versions of everyone's favorite heroes on the half shell and each one has a slightly different mood and tone that ranges from 5 year old friendly to hyper violent. In fact, 2009's Turtles Forever has a good time joking about just that. What about the new movie? Well, this movie essentially takes 30 years of Ninja Turtles, picks and chooses it's favorite parts and tries to combine them into one movie and I have to say, they do a pretty damn good job of it. The CGI is first rate & the action is crisp and at times jaw dropping. The characters are well developed and loyal to the source material with Leo leading, Raph being the badass, Donnie getting his geek on and Mikey... just being Mikey. The story is passable despite being a little cookie cutter and one or two eye rollingly embarrassingly bad piece of exposition which had no part in the movie, but believe it or not I'll forgive it because the rest of the movie is just plain fun. The more you've experienced Ninja Turtles in the past, the more you'll enjoy this movie. There are jokes coming at you left and right and dozens of cameos of all shapes and sizes from people to props. Overall, it's just plain fun to watch!

But the TMNT were always one of those cartoons that I looked forward to as a child. I liked the atmosphere of superheroes that weren't actually superheroes but turtles with names of Renaissance artists (something I didn't knew then, of course). It was exotic and appealed to my imagination. The inner child in me convinced me to watch this real-live action film and remake. You never know, right? This was even worse than I expected. Maybe it's because Nickelodeon Movies and Platinum Dunes were the main producers, but it's not only that. The writing was awful, the action choreography way too conventional and the special effects not that impressive. I wonder if I would've enjoyed this as a child in the way that I enjoyed 3 Ninjas, 3 Ninjas Kick Back and 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up. That question will remain unanswered and it isn't even that relevant.

WHY CHANGE THE ORIGIN and take us to a test lab where illegal tests were made on these turtles?Also, the apparently Master Splinter did not learn the art of ninjitsu from Yoshi, rather he picked up a dirty book while sweeping his little sewer compartment and mastered it.The Turtles look absurd, stupid, kind of like lumbering apes with green skin and small heads. They were all dumb in their own rights. Donatello being the worst with goofy scientist spectacles and Michelangelo's jokes did not hit a funny bone. We hardly saw the wisdom of Leo, and Raphael was just a total moron.Speaking of morons, April (Megan Fox) was the worst offender in this movie, she was barely engaged and looked like she cared about no one but finishing off her stint and asking for her pay cheque to be mailed.Stay away from this bottom-shelf trash, and PLEASE go back and watch the cartoons, even the original movie with Vanilla Ice was 1,0000000000000 times better",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
180,agblum,Mixed Bag - A Half Shell.,7,8 August 2014,"As a child of the 80's, I was looking forward to the return of the Teenage Mutant Turtles to the Big Screen. The Final Result for me is a mixed bag. Short synopsis of the plot line: April O'Neill, portrayed by Megan Fox is a Reporter for Channel 6 in New York, regulated to covering Fluff Stories. She is attempting to get a lowdown on a recent crime wave, by the Foot Clan. Through her investigation, she meets up with The Turtles and, and their Ninja Master Rat Splinter. It is revealed early on that there is past link between April, The Turtles & Splinter – a changed part of the story that I like. Turtle Michelangelo, voiced by Noel Fisher, keeps you laughing with his wisecracks, and Megan Fox does an adequate job playing April. The other voice talents do fine as well, and I think look of the Turtles is fine, internet criticism and all. Having said all that – The overall story and some of the Dialogue needed to be fleshed out. Some fun, but I can't rank it over the original 1990 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", or the 2007 Animated TMNT.

181,tmf084,Not really worth the time ..,2,16 August 2014,"When I heard about the reboot I was thrilled even though Michael Bay was supposed to be involved in it and Liebesman was supposed to be the director. In order to avoid a complete disappointment, I kept my expectations low and tried to keep an open mind since I thought they'll go for a fresh take on it and make it a bit more mature than the original 90s movie. Also Daugherty was part of the writing team and Divergent as well as Snow Whitey had a pretty good screenplay. But with the credits rolling I became annoyed with myself because I allowed them to trick me into watching yet another mindless Bay flick. Don't get me wrong - I don't expect Oscar-worthy portrayals or a fleshed out story or a character study but at least something entertaining that let's me feel nostalgic. Instead they gave me nausea, not only because of the fast moving flickering Bay-esque action scenes but also because they butchered pretty much everything from the source material. The only thing they got right was the turtles and their various character traits even though I would have liked to see more interaction between them it was good and reminded me about the reasons I liked the TMNT as a kid / teenager. I would have also accepted the origin story changes if they made any sense at all to setup the movie's storyline. But instead it's utterly un-creative, derivative and they somehow managed to make Shredder look like a fool who is boring as an antagonist - use Will Arnett as a misplaced comic relief who is barely funny - make Megan Fox a strong lead, who carries most of the movie and make the 90s movies (including part 2 and 3) look like master pieces. Bottom line: would be 0/10 but I gave it 2/10 because of the turtles. And I feel bad for the folks who have to put this piece of garbage on their resume while they had no say in the creative process. For Bay, Liebesman and the others who can be made responsible for it - I hope this was the last time you fooled me into watching one of your movies.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

It is a TMNT turtles film created and assosiated with Nickelodeon. I actually liked the actors and the writing wasn't the worst i have seen. The special effects was over the top; thanks to Michael Bay. People didnt like Megan Fox as April O'Neal mainly because she didn't have red hair, but i can over look a small characteristic like that. The concept of the Shredders armor was incredible and the storyline sort of followed the Comic books.

183,LeDentalPlaque,Somewhat of a Great Remake,7,24 December 2014,"I've watched all of the TMNT films growing up, and obviously, this one is by far the most advanced in terms of CGI and action content. The origin story is more scientific in this one, and there's a lot of action, but the acting is mediocre. The character development is minimal, and some of the content is unbelievable, like Shredder's armour (How could someone walk in that? Much less fight like a ninja?). So, there are definitely irregularities and unexplained phenomena that occur throughout the film.I won't ever bother comparing the content to past films because each TMNT made is tailored for the new generation. In this one, there were some things that I didn't like about how they portrayed the Turtles (like the constant rapping and trying to be ""cool"") and how they learnt their ninja skills, but overall, there was still a lot of action and good CGI, so I can't complain.Going in, you are prepared for a TMNT movie, so you can't really expect much except for some well-animated turtles and great action scenes. And this film did deliver on those aspects. As a result, I gave it a 7/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
184,MacTheMovieguy,There's still a lot to like here,7,8 August 2014,"I'm a huge Ninja Turtle fan. Or at least, I was, when I was 6-10 years old. Somewhere starting around 8 or 9 the Turtles had to fight for attention with X-Men and GIJoe's, but those three franchises were my life when I was a kid. I'm part of the generation that actually played with action figures, and played outside. Not everyone had video game systems at home, and even when we played videogames, it was more a ""rainy day"" thing.So, I was there on opening day for the newest Ninja Turtle reinvention, and I have to say it barely disappoints. I have some issues with it, but for the most part, it's not a bad movie.First, Megan Fox. I wrote a month or so ago defending Fox in the Transformers franchise, because I thought she worked there. She doesn't work here. Her vacant stare, and cutesy approach to everything just doesn't work for April. April is not a damsel in distress, and at times, you feel that Fox is. Even though her character is written with a can-do attitude, Fox is never believable as someone who can hold her own. The rest of the human cast is fine.Second, and this is a TAD bit spoilery, but the writing got so lazy at one point that when April was tasked with finding ""adrenaline"", the computer she first ran to had a large button that said ""adrenaline"" on it. Come on now. Even kids will think that's stupid.Third, Shredder is silly. They've super-charged and upgraded him so he's almost a Transformer. Now he's a sensai that wears a large metallic costume with blades coming out of his hands that would make Wolverine jealous. Oh, and he can shoot blades, and bring them back, because magnetism. I almost laughed when new Shredder was using a keyboard, because his fingers were obviously too large to do so of course, so are Donatello's.And while this doesn't factor into my grading, why is Leonardo the only person who was played by one actor, and voiced by another? What was the point of even casting the first guy? Did Johnny Knoxville refuse to do motion capture? Does the other guy have an annoying voice? Also, same with Danny Woodburn playing Splinter, but Tony Shaloub voicing him. Was that necessary? I think Woodburn would have made a cool Splinter, personally.The effects are good, but what really makes the story great is that it hasn't lost the heart of the turtles. Michaelangelo, particularly, is perfect. I love new Mikey. Raphael was written well. Donatello is a bit nerdier than usual, but it works. Leonardo is probably the most underdeveloped of the four, but that's pretty typical.The plot isn't bad, and I'm glad they abandoned the alien backstory for the turtles. The opening segment, which plays out like a comic book, was absolutely stunning. I'd love to see a whole movie done like that. Also, the mountain/snow chase near the end is one of the best action sequences in a film this year. Michael Bay doesn't disappoint when it comes to action, even if you feel like it's a little too much at times.It's far from being a perfect film, but it's just good enough to get me excited in the possibility of a sequel. Maybe they'll even get rid of April and bring back Casey Jones? Or they'll go bold and be the first feature to introduce Krang? Either way, if you're an adult who used to love Ninja Turtles, or you're a kid who is a fan of them today, this reboot doesn't entirely disappoint. Just a little bit, but there's still a lot to like here.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
185,jediforce10,Congratulations Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. You are no longer the worst TMNT movie ever.,2,8 August 2014,"Before I begin this, I want to say I'm not exactly the biggest TMNT fan out there. Having said that though, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is so bad that it'll probably make any fan, whether they be casual(like me) or a die hard fan. When trailers of the film first came out, I thought it looked like the new Transformers movie. But when I finished seeing it, and noticing Michael Bay was behind it, I had a bad feeling about it.Even though Bay is only producing and Jonathan Liebesman is the director, who was behind Battle: Los Angeles, this film still feels like a Michael Bay film. From the over the top explosions, really loud sound effects that'll probably make you deaf, and, of course, Megan (I can't act) Fox.The story is mostly recycled from the first TMNT film from way back in 1990. The Foot Clan is terrorizing New York City and crime is at an all time high there. Apparently, though, they want to ally themselves with some corporate guy, spread a toxin, and sell the cure to the government for money. After that, we are pretty much treated to the typical Michael Bay stuff you'd see.The fight scenes are very similar to that of Bay's four Transfomers movies. They're long, very bloated, and everything is pretty much exploding like every item is combustible. I was somehow expecting Optimus Prime to somehow show up. Though, part of me wants to say this was action stuff Bay had not time in to fit in Transformers 4 and decided to use it here.The acting is a mixed bag. The actors voicing the turtles are decent enough and are rather believable. They also do a decent job keeping the turtles to their same personality, sometimes. However, Megan Fox is NOT cut out to be April O'Neil. She just has this constant dull surprise expression, or is staring at the camera, not sure how to react. Not to mention she's not tough or confident like in the TV shows. She's more of a coward than anything. Tohoru Masamune is a very mediocre Shredder. I don't feel intimidated by him at all. The original Shredder in the first two TMNT films was much better than Masamune here.Perhaps the actors could've done better if the script wasn't so bad. The dialogue is bland as sawdust and it looks like some of the actors seem embarrassed by what they have to say sometimes.Not to mention they get the origins of the TMNT and Splinter wrong. Instead of Splinter being Hamato Yoshi's pet, or Hamato Yoshi himself, he turns out to belong to April when she was younger, along with the four turtles. The turtles themselves were actually supposed to be found by Splinter, but instead they all end up in the sewer together. So forget following continuity or respecting the source material.The jokes provided by the turtles are not funny either. Instead of clever gags or witty jokes from our heroes, we're treated to fart jokes and other raunchy material.Speaking of which, the Turtles look ugly. I know they're supposed to be mutants and going for some realism here since it's live action, but this is ridiculous. I couldn't be intimidated with how goofy they look, even if one held a gun to my head. The animation for them is also stiff as a wooden board and, I swear, lip syncing looked off.Perhaps the worst part of this movie is that it doesn't have any of the joy or fun of TMNT. It's extremely dark and joyless. While there were dark elements in the shows it had, it was lighthearted most of the time. Here, the film is dark and probably dark for the sake of being so. There's no joy, no fun, no laughs to be found. It's rather depressing instead.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fails as a reboot to the franchise and triumphs as a means of insulting the hardcore fans who love the TMNT since the first TV show. If its story isn't taking its sweet time to get going, its throwing bad jokes at you. Not to mention bad acting, bloated action scenes, horrible CGI turtles, and pretty much straying far too much from the TV shows everyone grew to love. And the stuff that does have to do with the shows feels like a slap in the face.Sadly, I've heard that a sequel is in the works already. What's worse is that they're bringing in Casey Jones and Beebop and Rocksteady. Stick to the TV shows and the three movies I say and spare yourself the agony of this film and its possible sequels.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
186,tiffanyyongwt,basically a version of the Spiderman + Captain America 2 plot using Transformer's classic babe.,7,30 November 2014,"Just like Disney's Mickey Mouse, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are part of our childhood memories. Although I was never a fan of the turtles, I recalled my brother having this gigantic Ninja Turtle cake for his 5th birthday celebration at our childcare centre. The cake was perhaps the most vivid recollections of the turtle heroes, as my brother had to make do with the cake as the shop did not have our favourite Mighty Morphin Power Rangers back then.To me, this is basically a version of the Spiderman + Captain America 2 plot using Transformer's classic babe. April O'Neil thinks her father's lab partner Eric Sacks is the good guy and tells him everything about the TMNT (like how Peter Parker told Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard about the discovery). So Sacks wanted the turtles' blood for the mutagen which is the antidote to the deadly virus they were planning to release (Harry wanted Spiderman's blood for his illness), and had Shredder to release the toxin and fight the turtles (if you remember how the Winter Soldier fought Captain America on the Helicarriers).When I watched this movie, I didn't expect much when the online review was only 13%. I had to give credit to the film for the few funny moments (one of them is already on Youtube ie. the elevator beatboxing scene) and the cheesy one-liner jokes delivered by the ""young-at- heart-but-not-in-looks"" turtles especially Michelangelo's (voiced by Noel Fisher) amusing teenage crush on April. While Megan Fox looks perfectly sexy (in Transformers too) in the film, there were loopholes in the story line which made her look silly. For a lady to run towards the scene where people are held hostage is plain silly for a reporter-wannabe, and I can't think of a reason good enough for her to risk her life to climb up buildings to take photos of the ""vigilante mutant turtles"" with sound on. Erm, reporter?April's cameraman-and-boyfriend-wannabe Vernon Fenwick (Will Arnett) did not have much scenes, but his acting skills was by far, the best (since the turtles and rats are CGI).This might be a great family or teenage film, but adults might not be...Read on: http://goo.gl/6t5sA7",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
187,blandiefam,Great Job and enjoyable,7,7 January 2015,This movie is great to watch for anyone who lived in the 1990's and remembered the fame of the turtles. My 27 year old son sat and watched with me. He was told the movie was not that good but agreed that this was a great and enjoyable movie. The action was regular Bay-type chaos and broken buildings. The characters made me feel as if I was back in the old days but they were also modernized by the action. I loved the elevator scene as well. Megan Fox and Will Arnett seemed too old to play the characters and hopefully they will be replaced for the sequel. Michael Bay kind of digressed to the Transformers for a few minutes and then came back to good Turtle Action! I would suggest you sit with a child who lived through the times way back when. You will enjoy every minute of it.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
188,legend-is-alive,Could have been something,2,25 October 2014,An OK action stupid plot and terrible HUMAN acting. Why is Megan Fox even considered to be an actress ? God she is sexy and beautiful as hell and terrible at acting as beautiful she is. Anyway it was an OK time wasting movie with a really stupid plot. Action part was OK sometimes very entertaining. I am happy I didn't pay money to watch it at movie theater. I knew it would be waste of money. IMDb is keep asking for 10 lines and that's really annoying sometimes only saying the movie is bad or good should be enough. I really have nothing else to say about this movie jut filling 10 lines now! The story in this movie has nothing to do with original TMNT that would be my last sentence. 2/10 for action,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
189,mjk280,"No, it really is that bad",2,10 August 2014,"You know how us nerds tend to freak out over movies, TV shows, etc. that we don't think do our favorite properties justice? Well that being said I usually frown on that type of exaggeration but honestly this new TMNT really deserves to be bashed and battered. I kept telling people I was going in with an open mind. I thought it would be forgettable but not insulting. I didn't mind the new look of the Turtles because I figured they were just trying something a little different. The voices rubbed me the wrong way but nothing a good overall movie couldn't remedy. Little did I know....The first misstep is that this follows the Transformers formula too much, where you're watching a movie about people who interact with the turtles, not a movie about THE TURTLES. The first 30-45 minutes is about April and her eventual discovery of the turtles. Big mistake. Far too much time passes before the turtles show up, and even then it's pretty brief. Then we go back to April, doing a terrible job convincing people that the turtles are real. I think the turtles actually fought a total of about 60 seconds in this movie, and 45 of those seconds are at the end. At this point it's just a bad movie we can all try to forget, but what shocked me the most was the script. I can say with confidence that a loyal turtles fan that grew up in the last '80s, early '90s could pen a script better than this in an afternoon. For some bizarre reason (or most likely laziness) they decided to make the turtles origin this: They were created in a lab by April O'Neill's father who was a scientist. She treated them as pets when she was a kid and set them free along with Splinter when the lab caught fire. You read that right: April actually knew the turtles when they were babies, and 15 or so years later she is the first one to catch a glimpse of them. This blew my mind. The next thing that blew my mind was that Splinter taught himself and the turtles martial arts from a book he found in the sewer. He knew nothing of martial arts until then. We also see glimpses of them as babies and around age 10 or so I'd guess, while they dance to ""Holla Back Girl"" by Gwen Stefani. At that point I legitimately though the writers were having a laugh. There are other things that reek of a rushed creative process. Shredder is given pretty much zero back story. He is a billionaire's lackey and has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles. Will Arnett, who is funny in everything else he's ever been in, is completely wasted here. It wasn't his fault at all, there just weren't any good jokes for him to deliver whatsoever. Whoopi Goldberg as the news editor was out of place. The product placement was too much. You could even tell they sold the ads in packages of two. The Skype logo is shown on a phone, then a character mentions it a few minutes later. There is an entire scene dedicated to how irresistible Pizza Hut pizza is, then later on a couple of Pizza Hut boxes take up the bottom third of the screen for a few seconds. Some more specific atrocities in the script: April and Will Arnett hide behind a desk while the villain shoots a gun at the desk without, ya know, walking over to them and shooting them. One of the plot points that broke the movie was the ""fact"" that the turtles are actually bullet proof! I'm not making this up, and no not just their shells. Their entire bodies. This wouldn't be relevant if the Foot Clan actually fought them hand to hand, but they don't. They all have machine guns instead. You see, if you want martial arts in a movie you have to do laborious things like cast people that know martial arts, choreograph fight scenes, etc. We don't have time for that. Nevermind that 'ninja' is one of the operative words in the title of the movie and in the collective name of the characters. When you consider all that you have bullet proof turtles standing still while enemies shoot them in vain. Then instead we're treated to a chase scene where turtles slide down a snowy mountain that I'm guessing is roughly 100 miles to the bottom. I say that because the scene went on for I would guess 10-12 minutes. Snore. While we're on the bullet proof thing I also want to point out that the turtles can also bash through the side of a van they're hiding in in one attempt, somersault through plexiglas while standing still, and if a turtle is hanging off a steel girder riveted to a building they will actually BEND AND EVENTUALLY BREAK THE STEEL GIRDER. This all happens in the movie with no exaggeration I promise you.Look I realize the movie is directed at kids but come on. It's also for people that grew up loving the turtles that are adults. Plus the kids argument doesn't take you very far anyways. The original movie holds up, why can't this? This movie fails in almost all aspects. They didn't make it enough about the turtles, the turtles hardly fight, and the script was a slap dash effort and everyone involved knew it. In fairness the script does fall into the ""give it a break it's for kids"" category, but combined with everything else this is just a bad movie. I liked the style of the intro and opening credits. That's literally it. Unfortunately we all took the bait and a sequel is undoubtedly on the way. I'm guessing since the movie came out on Friday that the ink on the new script dried some time on Saturday around 4PM.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
190,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,"Good for the kids, OK for everyone else.",6,8 August 2014,"You should be aware going in that 2014's film version of the Turtles is another all-new reboot. It has no ties to any of the previous movies or TV series, and creates its own origin story. Older fans like myself might see this and ask, ""What the hell, why do they need to keep changing how they mutated? What was wrong with the 117 other origins they've had?"" (Are there 117 different versions by now? That feels accurate.) I'd say that maybe us old-schoolers just need to sit down and relax somewhere, but this movie's back story is so odd, I can't help but be bothered by it. Could have been worse, though at least they weren't aliens Now that I vented on the origin issue, I have to vent about the major issue on this movie: Megan Fox﻿. You are going to be seeing and hearing a lot of her. A LOT. Not that April O'Neil is a bad character, it's just that the movie becomes the April O'Neil story, and that's not what we signed up for. And if you had a problem with Fox getting this role, well there's not a whole lot in here that will change your mind. You'll be very much aware that you're watching Megan Fox as April. (Speaking of casting, Will Arnett is funny as April's cameraman but how old is his character supposed to be in this movie? He seems way too old to be throwing himself at Megan )Let's get to the good stuff. The graphics are well done, and the Turtles look great, for the most part. They definitely look like 'roided up, imposing versions of your favorite Teenaged Ninjas but what's up with Mikey's face? And was it really necessary to have Donatello wearing glasses the whole time? Could we not tell he was the intellectual of the group by how he spoke? Or all the high-tech equipment he carried around? Who gave him that prescription? They don't look like they came from Lenscrafters Anyway, the movie looks nice in 3D, but I wouldn't call it a must.One strong point of the movie is the action. There are some great action scenes in here. The fight scenes are very well done (and well shot – no shaky-cam means you can clearly see every hit), especially when it comes to fights involving Shredder. The chase scenes and set pieces are also very exciting and fast-paced, especially the downhill mountain scene, and they mix in a healthy amount of comedy along the way. The movie itself moves at a quick pace, slowing down only to shove more Megan Fox down your throat. (Just kidding, Megan. I don't hate you. BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE MY APRIL.)Ninja Turtles is a fun movie that younger audiences will get a kick out of. Older fans can find some enjoyment in there too, but will also likely find plenty of occasions to complain about how THEIR Turtles were better.Ninja Turtles scores a 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
191,chi-cerca-trova,Fun but forgettable movie,6,3 September 2016,"Overall: A weak story and poor supporting performances drag down an otherwise enjoyable TMNT movie anchored by surprisingly effective performances by the Turtles themselves. Here, the story of April O'Neil is given much more prominence than in the past, which is unnecessarily convoluted and ultimately robs the Turtles of any genuine motivation beyond ""we want to do good"". Coupled with very weak performances from Megan Fox as April and Tony Shalhoub as Splinter, the movie is at risk of buckling under its own weight. But the Turtle performances were a surprise, injecting the movie with humor and heart. With the Turtles as an emotional core to the movie, the movie moves at a breezy pace that bows out just as its wearing out its welcome. The result is a fun movie that will be quickly forgotten. 6/10 Detailed Breakdown: Story: Ninja Turtles is not supposed to be known for its highbrow story lines, but even here, it suffers from an unfocused script. The main evil plan is satisfyingly stupid for a Turtles movie, but suffers when it forces everything to be connected in some fashion. The idea of Splinter training the Turtles to be ninjas literally comes from the trash heap while an unnecessarily convoluted connection between April and the Turtles gets shoved into the center of the movie. Fortunately, the script doesn't get too bogged down in this, so the movie still moves along at a brisk pace. 0 Characters: The true charm in the Ninja Turtles comes from the titular characters and their relationship. This is where the movie surprisingly shines. The four brothers feel like actual brothers, and while the personalities remain generally unchanged from earlier iterations, they feel organic to the story. There is a comfortable chemistry and comes through the performances, with genuine humor and care between them. Unfortunately, this becomes weighed down by a weak Splinter, who lacks the gravitas and authority that one would need to be a father to the four brothers. Combine this with an underwhelming performance from Megan Fox, means the Turtles are barely able to carry the weight of the movie. Will Arnett is funny as Vern, but he's given literally nothing to do and is not in the movie enough to really help the film. +1 Production Design: The movie does a good job with building a new environment for the Turtles to inhabit, but is really held back by spotty CGI. The equipment and costuming for the Turtles stands apart from its predecessors in a satisfying way, but the design of the Turtles themselves draws a bit more of an ambivalent response. On one hand, their design feels like it serves the story at times, with them feeling like they would be able to actually do the things they are doing on the screen. But, it also follows the recent trend of superheroes being unfathomably ripped, which feels unnecessary. Overall, the world feels well fleshed out. 0 Music: The music here is your typical summer movie score. Doesn't really add or detract. 0 Misc: This is the first remake that really hits home for me. TMNT was a key part of my childhood, with the original 1990 film one that I can still go back and watch to this day. But, we as a nerd/geek subculture really need to get over this idea that a remake or belated sequel can destroy the original. Watching this, it became quickly apparent that this movie wasn't going to hold a candle to the original movie for me. But, there was no way it was going to. Whether or not this movie was good or bad doesn't detract from the original. The original will always be there for me to enjoy. And that goes for any property that gets rebooted or remade. The presence of something new doesn't erase the old.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

You know, like the 'virtual' scenes in The Matrix, but then more greenish and all the time!-Awesome! Hey, what's up with that Shredder guy, what's his back story?-Who cares? He had blades on his arms in the series if IIRC. Just add more blades and make him speak some Japanese, it will be cool.-Hey, how about we add another villain? More is better! I'm out of ideas though.-I just watched that Spider-Man movie, and it was pretty good. Let's add a generic villain and copy the entire final scene from Spider-Man.-Good call! What will be the setting?-I don't know. Winter is cool! But spring also. Hey, wasn't there a character named April in the series? Let's make it winter and spring at the same time, and don't forget to add a pun about it.-This movie will be so awesome. We need action. When I think action, I think Michael Bay.-Right! Make stuff explode while the camera is zoomed in all the way, and then shake it uncontrollably. Duuuude!-Make sure to have him add the longest chase sequence with impossible physics in entire movie history. And add some extra explosions to the final scene even though there is no reason for anything to explode! Steel beams can spontaneously explode, right?-Of course. Hey, it seems the original series had a rat in it that knew something like kung fu. That doesn't sound realistic. The Dark Knight was realistic and was awesome. If we make our movie realistic, it will be awesome too.-Just make him learn it from a book! That is way more realistic than anything.-Damn, why couldn't I think of that? All right, that's about it.

194,tyreeewebster,Ty Reviews- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014),8,22 October 2014,"After a brief hiatus off from the big screen, the heroes in a half shell make a most triumphant return in one of the most entertaining and action packed blockbusters of recent years that ISN'T produced from Marvel Studios.That's right, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are back! This time, they are created using motion capture technology and have been backed by a huge $125 million budget, courtesy of Michael Bay.Let's start with the good; the turtles are perfect. They look just amazing and are played brilliantly by the four actors who embody their individual personalities perfectly. Leo's the level headed leader, Raph is the angry, ill- tempered rebel, Donnie is the smart geek and Mikey is the jester of the group and is actually one of the highlights of the movie. What am I kidding, they're all great! They're so much fun to watch that I cherished every single scene they were in. I know that when this movie was first announced and they started to leak photos off the set, there were some questionable design choices, like Donatello's equipment and Raphael's gargantuan size, but believe me when I say this, it works in the movie's favour. These aren't the 1990's turtles anymore, they're the big, new epic movie turtles!Another highlight (although I can't really say much) is Megan Fox as April, she wasn't everyone's first choice for the part but she does considerably well for the material. Will Arnett was quite annoying as April's camera man, Vern (but they DID change his characters' personality, after all. No longer the cynical ass wipe of from the TV series). His jokes fell very flat and failed to get a laugh out of me, especially when you have the turtles in the movie, who have the funniest scenes. Splinter was pretty cool, too. Due to the motion capture and animation, we are able to see him fight this time, and possibly has one of the most epic fight scenes in any comic book movie, I won't ruin it for you. His look is very gross, though, since they made him look too much like a rat with his beady eyes, but it shouldn't bother anyone too much.The action was some of the best action I've ever seen, with the martial arts being the best I've seen from a Ninja Turtles production. The turtles may be built like Quarterbacks, but they are quick. Their movements are so fluent and fast, they live up to their namesake. The Shredder was quick, too, and shares an intense scene with the turtles in their lair, even though he wasn't on screen for as long as I would have liked, I also loved it when he showed up. He was just really, really cool, as you would expect. But, the best part of the movie by far is the mountain top snow chase, this is a scene in the movie when our amphibious heroes escape from secondary villain Eric Sacks' mansion. I wish I could say more, but it's just too awesome to put into words.Speaking of Eric Sacks, played by William Fichtner, the writers didn't really give him much to do, possibly due to the re-shoots, but he does a decent job as a villain, and is actually one of the weaker points of the movie, next to Will Arnett and the fact that this suffers from 'Transformers' syndrome, where the humans come first, but don't worry, after around 25 or so minutes of Megan Fox running around, it's ALL turtles. It's like they came into the picture and said 'Move it! This is our movie!'My only small complaints is that the comedy was off at times (for humans only) and I thought it could have been at least 10 minutes longer, but at 1 hour 41 minutes, it runs at a brisk pace and is a fun movie to watch if you just want to enjoy yourself, and for any turtles fan, too!Actually, while we're here; I would have liked to have heard the original actor for Leonardo, Pete Ploszek in the movie. I'm not saying that Johnny Knoxville didn't do a good job but he sounds out of place amongst the other three turtles.An enjoyable film that could have had more of an original story, but it definitely isn't the train wreck most stuck up critics are claiming it to be.

Too much stuff going on too fast too shakily.

And once I saw Michelangelo as Jonah Hill, I couldn't unsee him. Donatello was Urkel (complete with snorky laugh). Leonardo was... vapid. Raphael looked more like a gorilla than a turtle.

197,scottjohnson7896,Half Baked Half Shells (Raging Film Review),6,10 August 2014,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven't exactly had the best track record when it comes to feature films. Most will claim that the 1990s film, the very first feature, is the best; most would be right. Where the comic books and the TV shows have been exciting and well- done, the films have always lacked something or been made far cheesier than the pizza the Turtles crave so much. Luckily the latest reboot of the series is among the more exciting ones of the bunch, but it probably won't be having you shout, ""Cowabunga!"" The film opens with a neat little summary of how the turtles came to be, and one would think that was all would be necessary, yet after meeting April O'Neil (Megan Fox), we are inundated with multiple summaries of the events that created the Turtles—and Splinter—as well as a flashback which further explains their past. The first act of the film is essentially just a repetition of explanations of what the Turtles are, who the Foot Clan is, and April being a persistent reporter. When the film finally does pick up—which takes a while to do so—it is able to somewhat make over for the lackluster beginning, aside from the horribly stupid plan of the Foot Clan. We come to learn that the Turtles were an accidental byproduct of some experimentation to find a ""cure-all"" medicine. Their blood is needed in order to create the cure again, but they were lost when a fire destroyed the lab. That horrible plan that I just mentioned is to release a deadly toxin into the atmosphere, and then sell the cure to the government to earn loads of money.When people think of the Ninja Turtles they think of their awesome action scenes. Though this movie is advertised as packed full of action, most of said action lacks any sort of fun. The turtles in this movie are more like the Hulk than turtle, appearing over six-feet-tall and using mostly their strength to fight as opposed to their respective weapons. This really dumbs down the fight sequences because in other iterations they have their own unique fighting style. The fight scenes are really rough to watch; most of the time the camera is so tight on the action and moving so fast that it is hard to follow who is actually winning the fight or even what is going on. Aside from one exceptional sequence, most of the fighting is repetitive and difficult to comprehend; it doesn't help that the camera is shaky either.Other than the one great action sequence, the movie is saved from more failure thanks to the humorous banter between the Turtles. Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo, voiced by Johnny Knoxville, Alan Ritchson, Jeremy Howard, and Noel Fisher, respectively, are hilarious to watch. Unsurprisingly, Michelangelo is the funniest of the bunch as he develops a crush on April while also having some of the more comical writing of the film. Raphael and Leonardo are at odds in this one—as they always are—about who should be leader and whatnot, so it is good that they are bringing back that dynamic. Supporting them is a rather annoying and unnecessary supporting cast. Fox's April takes center stage most of the film as she is trying to find her way to the bottom of the mystery. Though it is nice that they don't use her appearance as a marketing draw (having it be Megan Fox is probably enough to draw in those who still want her after Transformers), someone else would have been far more suited for the type of role because she has become too much of a sex-symbol. She is assisted by Will Arnett who plays her love-struck cameraman who is almost the cheesiest and most unnecessary characters in the film. His dialogue is idiotic and his only real purpose in the film is to drive the news truck around. The only character who is more unnecessary is Whoopi Goldberg as April's boss who appears to only be in it to add more to the star power and whose character has no overall significance to the story. William Fitchner, who plays the main villain other than Shredder, who is wickedly awesome, is just your run-of-the-mill bad guy. He does not bring anything new to the villainy table, and instead his motives are, like I said, stupid.In the end, this is not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles everyone has been waiting for. Though it is weighed down with excessive dialogue about the events prior to the film, contains some rather difficult to follow action scenes, and features one of the most absurd villainy plans, It is not a complete failure thanks to the Turtles and the fun action scene later in the film. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a half-baked attempt at a reboot for our Heroes in a Half-Shell that will leave you hungry for something a little more—and for pizza.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
198,xodanielcasterox,Stick to the original.,5,26 October 2014,"This reminds me of the Three Stooges movie; they did the heroes justice but the rest is either pretty weak or just boring. The CG is obviously CG. It's not Gollum CG but it's not Scorpion King from Mummy Returns CG. It looks pretty good just not great. This movie is just another Michael Bay formula where all kids care about is some bad-ass action and no good story or depth in the characters. The only one who seems to have the most depth is April O'Neil, played WONDERFULLY by the student of Kristen Stewart's school of acting, Megan Fox. I just ADORE how emotionless she is. I am just MOVED by how she doesn't care what she's doing. How did she not get an Oscar?Dude, they just cast her just so young teens can repeat the Paul Reubens act! I'm against hitting women, but she needs a good slap in the face. I don't care about what Hollywood wants; nobody does. This might sound weird but you know who I think would be a good April? Ellen Page. Think about it! She's tough, smart, funny and she can...what's the word...ACT! I think she would look good fighting with the turtles.

The film starts off in an extremely dull, non-exciting mode but surprisingly the ""Bayish Transturtles"" present some fun and hilarious moments which shall entertain the kids and the fans of the genre. However, the plot itself does not offer anything special but to again, recycle the same kind of formula which is easily predictable when the movie starts its first minute. Director Liebesman has applied a fine CGI treatment, good visual effects and plenty of actions on those naughty adorable turtles, proving that he is not a lazy director, just that he has yet to get a chance of good script. Overall still better than Smurfs and Chipmunks with Brian Tyler's scores but do not expect a good performance from Megan Fox as well.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
200,mockfilmreviews,Creepy overdone garbage.,5,24 January 2016,"I will preface this review with a confession of sorts. I am a tad geeky when it comes to certain pop culture properties. With that, I find it sad when a film tries to get witty with the writing and origins of characters that where just fine the way they were. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) has become the latest victim in a long line of travesties where a property is given over to those who have no clue how to handle it. Not that TMNT is Shakespeare mind you, but what was done here can been seen as nothing short of mind boggling.First off, this film was craptacularly bad. I mean, really bad. We are talking like if Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) had sex with the Super Mario Bros. Movie (1993), had a child, fed it sugar, gave it sharp objects and told it to go play in a crowded city park. The script is completely off the rails and takes the genesis of our titular heroes to places that are so ludicrous that I makes the Ninja Turtles original origin story (as ridiculous as it may be) seem plausible. Now, if you decide to take this movie on, be warned, you could fall down any one of a thousand plot holes along the way. I may even break my ""No Spoiler"" rule for this one, because honestly, at this point, who cares.Why this movie is garbage:-The Turtles and Master Splinter are nothing sort of terrifying. The rat, once cutely badass, now looks like a monster. A literal monster. The turtles are no better. (We miss you Jim Henson.) Who thought children would like this? Oh, yeah. Michael Bay produced it. Question answered.-They learn Ninjitsu from a book. A BOOK! Seriously?-April O'Neil is more of a conspiracy nut than a reporter who helped to raise the Turtles and Splinter in a lab with her father and an evil scientist. She even recorded her time with them with a video camera that has Bluetooth in big letters across the side of it. (I'm going to nit pick this, 'cause f*$& this movie.) Bluetooth wasn't even a thing when she was a child.-Shredder is basically a cumbersome knife show robot-man.-The Foot Clan (Remember, they're Ninjas) have a small army worth of guns. But don't worry, the Turtles are ""Bullet Proof."" These ballsey writers actually have Raphael say it in the movie at one point. Although, they can crack their shells if they get kicked too hard. What the what!-The Turtles also seem to be able to travel by sliding everywhere on their shells like a Slip and Slide. Because, you know, that's how turtles get around. Duh.-They even made a Turtle Van. Because nothing says 'hiding in the shadows' like a disco ball and green neon trim.—",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Many of this backlash in the product of Michael Bay's involvement with the movie, even though this Michael Bay seems like he didn't have much of an affect on the movie. However, most of the movie's criticism should come from a horrible human cast. Megan Fox has proved once again that she has the acting ability of an amateur model and her character comes across as try-hard journalist that you really don't care about, at all. Will Arnett somehow provides an even weaker performance, and his character seems almost like an afterthought that end up making the final cut of the movie. The chemistry between the two is also terrible, and instead comes across as a weird, high-school like crush. However the actual turtles prove to be a high point in this movie and are absolutely awesome. The turtles almost equally share the spotlight, but at times the focus proves to be blatantly uneven between the four. Still, the turtles carry the movie with their awesome motion capture combat, and a couple of funny lines.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
202,rossini-1868,Megan Fox deserves better...,3,2 June 2015,"I can't remember the last time I saw an actress rescue a project from unwatchability as completely as Megan Fox rescued this one. The turtles weren't as bad as Jar Jar Binks but that disgusting rat thing was actually worse. This was a big budget B movie in every sense of the word, and maybe, some congratulations are in order for the director, for having the skill to turn this nonsense into something that could actually pass for a movie. Michael Bay produced this chaotic, mindless mess, and it shows in every over the top tasteless turtle frame from beginning to end.The only thing that saves this from the garbage heap (beside's Megan Fox's face and butt), is the fact that the turtles themselves have a genuine likability, so much so that they came dangerously close to being almost kid cool. The ""poison the city"" plot is frankly, no worse than anything we've seen in any other comic book/superhero movie, so that's not really to blame. Its just that the turtles, no matter how earnest and good hearted, are in the end just plain creepy. Megan Fox has redeemed herself for being anywhere near this project. She deserves better, and if the audience doesn't love her, the camera sure does. She photographs better than just about every other actress in Hollywood, Angelina Jolie notwithstanding. Fox's humility around this whole ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" fiasco was impressive. Hopefully, the rest of her career will be a reward for the sacrifices she has made since that unjust Transformers firing. The poor girl deserves better.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
203,mistercsays1,Turtle Reboot Lacks Imagination,5,24 September 2014,"If it looks like a Michael Bay film and it sounds like a Michael Bay film, then it probably is a Michael Bay film. Therefore, it was no real surprise to learn that Bay served as producer on this latest screen incarnation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Although directed by Jonathan Liebesman – whose previous efforts were the very underwhelming Battle: Los Angeles and Wrath of the Titans – this adaptation of the popular comic book characters is chock full of typical Bay bombast; over-the-top moments that only serve to further reduce the credibility of a concept that requires a considerable suspension of disbelief before it even begins. Having said that, these characters have stood the test of time through four previous feature films and as many different television series', numerous video games and myriad merchandise and toys, so there is an obvious affection for the ""heroes in a half shell"" and the other characters that populate their subterranean world. Given the credentials of those involved, it is no surprise that there is action aplenty as the four eponymous anthropomorphic reptiles set forth to save New York from being infected by a deadly virus. The film opens with television reporter April O'Neill (Megan Fox) desperately seeking a story that will enable her to be taken more seriously by her colleagues, including her cameraman Vernon (Will Arnett) and boss Bernadette (Whoopi Goldberg). When she stumbles across a robbery in progress and encounters the four vigilante turtles – Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo – O'Neill sees the story as her big chance; except nobody believes her:Bernadette: There are four six foot talking turtles walking around New York City, and no one has seen them but you? April: That's what I'm telling you. Bernadette: Okay, get out.Having survived a laboratory fire, the four turtles have been raised by Splinter – a rat who was subjected to the same scientific experimentation and has developed similar human characteristics – who serves as both father figure and sensei. Of course, a connection between O'Neill and the turtles is soon established and they find themselves working together to foil the plot of a – you guessed it – genius scientist with evil intentions. In a role beneath his talents, William Fichtner plays the dastardly Eric Sacks who, of course, also has a connection with O'Neill and the turtles. There is very little character development and none of the performances are particularly noteworthy, with Arnett looking especially bored as a character whose motivation for everything he endures is seemingly to bed April. The Transformer-like samurai Shredder is in cahoots with Sacks to poison the atmosphere and much mayhem ensues in the race against time. A sequence aboard a semi-trailer descending a snowy mountain rates as particularly preposterous.Despite my reservations, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles seemed to play well with the younger members of the audience, although the violent nature of some scenes – which earned the film an M classification – will make it inaccessible to many TMNT fans. There is certainly nothing subtle about anything that happens and whilst there are a few chuckles to be had as the turtles engage in posturing and one-upmanship in their efforts to impress April, ultimately the film becomes bogged down in extended action sequences that deliver impressive visual effects and little else. An attempt to muse on the importance of family is ham-fisted and half-hearted; playing as nothing more than an afterthought and a poor attempt to add some gravitas to proceedings. This isn't the worst movie you'll see; in fact it isn't even the worst Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie you will see, but there is certainly nothing particularly new or interesting to be found.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The cartoons are light-hearted, family friendly fare made-for-TV treats, but the original Eastman and Laird works are darker and wouldn't appeal to a typical TV watching family, at least in the United States, the original Turtles were more adult oriented and that was the appeal.Many say the acting sucked... again, what did they expect, the acting was appropriate for a more mature audience while also appealing to a younger audience. And, not being a fan of Megan Fox' acting, she was born to play April O'Neil! Sexy, kind of vapid and pointless, but still kind of a bad-ass character... April only existed because without her the story is just an adrenaline fueled, masculine ego pumping, ""sausage"" fest. Fox is a great actress to play eye-candy!

206,nagyistvanandor,"fun for kids, disappointing to older fans.",4,23 August 2014,"Its fair to say this movie got many attention in the production state, and lets just say the smoke was bigger than the flames. And think that's what annoys me the most. I wished this would have been a better movie than its turned out, specially cause it feels the creators while making many bad choices they also cared about tmnt and fans.Why its bad?1) Megan Fox, shes the typical case of ""light travels faster than sound, that is why some people looks bright till you hear them talk."" Shes not a good actor. Maybe... just maybe if she would been a side character, with few line only, and the director told her ""god damn honey breath through your nose"" she would have been passable. But nope she plays a bigger role than the tmnt dose in there own movie. So its horrible.2) the trailer. the movie is short so not that much happening, but the trailer actually tells it all there are no surprises.3) the changes in the origins. When a Idea is for the better i don't really have problems with changes. But thats not the case here. Splinter learning from a book how to fight is stupid, but worst being able to hold up agents the shredder makes the villain less treating. And having Megan O'Neil be the center of everything its not just bad because shes cant act, but because it turns the hole plot to be the fantasy of a stupid lil girl. Seriously the movie was one step away declaring Megan O'Neil being Jesus.4)Villains and there plan: Shredder was a stupid transformer, with not to bad build up... but when a rat who learned from a book can stand up to you, and reporter can penetrate your defense your not treating anymore. Karai it just felt so bad seeing her with a gun, and getting beaten so easily >.< Alex Sacks was pretty pointless. Only more pointless thing is there evil plan which basically a rich guy want more money and power. Really thats the best you can come up with? But beside all of this big issues In my opinion its still better than the first tmnt movie. ignoring the design flaws of there look (the over buffed size, and there face looking odd) they look lot more a life and there personality are slightly better represented. The action are more dynamic. And compared the two plans of Shredder ( steal stuff with kids vs poison the city so we can save it for money and power) this movie is better. Don't get me wrong the fact that its better dose not mean its good. While it trys it best to please all fans, the major focus is obviously the next generation of fans. this and the above listed bad choices make it doubtful that you will actually enjoy the movie. But if you have a kid do him/her a favor and let them experience the fun, probably as your parents did in 1990.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
207,borneobrian,A tense bit dissapointing,4,19 April 2019,"When I heard about this movie, I was excited to see the turtles back on the big screen! Unfortunately, when I left the movie proved to bee not all its cracked up to be. One issue I have with the film id that it gives 90 % of the screen time to Megan fox. I have nothing against Fox or the character of April, but this is about the turtles, therefore, most of the screen-time should be given to the heroes in a half-shell and April being in a more supporting role. Another thing i didn't like was that William Fintchhner is not the Shredder like early reports said he was going to be and the real shredder instead is kept in the shadows for most of the film except for 3 fight scens. The last issue I have is with the story and speacial effects. The turtles don't really look like ninja turtles more like a seas monster group. So the mocap wasn't so great and the story wasn't engaging enough and was honestly pretty boring. So yeah this film is not the best TMNT film made sadly.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

209,jacob-m-ford97,"Felt good, looked awful.",7,11 August 2014,"I was born in 1997. Ninja Turtles was a little bit before my time, so going into this movie I didn't exactly have the nostalgia to sit me down all the way. I never really watched the old television cartoons or got excited about the feature films that came out in the early 90s; to be perfectly honest going in I didn't know very much at all about the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" except their name. In the end though, that's all you need to know. They're Teenagers, they're Mutants, they're Ninja's, and they're six-foot Turtles. That's enough of a plot basis right there to support three television shows and five full length films, including this one.Megan Fox plays April O'Neal in this version of TMNT, taking the part of the essential lead for this film. Giving her as much credit as possible, receiving a role like this does come with some serious constraints. We've all seen the aspiring news reporter waiting to catch her first big story a million times, so nothing new was expected from Fox as she took the part. Which is a good thing, because nothing more was delivered. I was hoping for a little something more, especially considering that Fox said this was her dream role, but I wasn't given anything more than what we always get. Fox did what she should and didn't venture any further than that. The Ninja Turtles were voiced by Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Pete Ploszek, and Johnny Knoxville in their respective roles. Each were delightful in their place, however Knoxville's vocal work as Leonardo did tend to bother me at times as he didn't seem to fit in quite as well with the rest of the gang. This is could root from the fact that he was only Ninja Turtle to not perform the character's Motion Capture work as well as voice the role. Co-starring in the film were Will Arnett, William Fichtner, and Whoopi Goldberg, along with Tohoru Masamune as Shredder and Tony Shalhoub voicing Splinter.As you walk into the theater to watch this film you have to take a moment to realize that you are sitting down to watch a movie where the main characters are giant karate fighting turtles. This isn't a movie made to portray things realistically, this is a movie made to be a movie. A time when you can let your imagination run wild and see and experience things that real life is never going to give you. Yes this movie is laughable at times because of how ridiculous it is, yet it's cheesy beyond belief (five layers of cheese with a stuffed crust! Cowabunga!), but it's meant to be. Seeing this movie is a time when you go to the theater to forget about work tomorrow or the math test you have on Monday and just have fun.If only director Jonathan Liebesman and the various character designers had realized that. There was only one thing that seriously turned me away from this movie once I came to that initial realization. The way things looked. I understand this is the first live-action version of the Ninja Turtles and that they wanted to take advantage of the incredible Motion Capture technology that there is today, but the characters honestly just looked pretty nasty. The turtles were easily lost in their surroundings, save the fact they are green, and I initially thought Splinter was a villain from his appearance. Typically if you see a slimy nosed rat with black eyes and stringy whiskers it's safe to assume it will turn out to be a bad guy. What I suspect is that the designers were intending to take our modern technology to make them look as realistic as possible. This would work if the rest of the film was made the same way, but this film was not made to be realistic; it was made to be fun. If the story and the characters had been consistently fun or consistently realistic we would have ended up with a good film, but since they were conflicting we got an overall unpleasant experience.It seems like such a tiny and amateur detail, but in the end it made a complete difference for me. There were wonderful parts to this film: the snowy mountain slope chase was excellently choreographed and the brief elevator interlude brought me to tears with laughter, but overall it was like watching two conflicting ideas battle it out on screen. So as I walked out of the theater it wasn't too much of a hike. I give ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" a 6.9/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I feel as if the same thing happened with Independence Day. People either say it's bad or great. I actually think TMNT 2014 acts as a gateway to a new series. There is a couple nods in the movie that lead me to that conclusion, but i'm not gonna say what. I don't wanna spoil anything. They action was you're typical Michael Bay action. Things going super fast and then slow motion. There were a couple of action scenes which were actually really well done. The turtles are of course the best thing about the movie. I think they really nailed the characters in most areas. Meagan Fox actually did what she had to do when she played April O'Neil, she wasn't that bad. Not great, but still okay. I also really like some of the new ideas for the turtles back story. There are things wrong with it, but still, well done. So in conclusion, it's popcorn entertainment, it's not that bad.

213,AStormOfSwords13,"Decent as it was, but needed a better plot",7,30 January 2015,"Coming into the movie, I wasn't expecting much. Hell, the trailer made me know this movie was going to get panned. With Megan Fox in a starring role and Michael Bay as producer, I felt I needed to see this, especially since 2007's TMNT movie, decent as it was, had this huge flaw of being way too short for it to be anything special. This movie is still a little on the short side, but it's going in the right direction, and with another 20 minutes to make it 2 hours, it would have been right where it needed to be.Speaking of the length, just like the 2007 movie, this one was too short to have a fleshed-out plot. Instead, without much of a chance for character development outside of the turtles and Splinter (and even that seemed a little off), it was, in a way, a rip-off of The Amazing Spiderman when it came to the villain's big scheme. With all this in mind, it ended up taking away some fun from the movie.But at 101 minutes, it was still long enough to be fun and not exhaust itself out too early. It gave time for some laughs and some action. That's why the stars of the show, the turtles, were able to keep me entertained in this movie. Because they were still fun characters. Speaking of which, I like their design this time around. It's not perfect, but it was enough to satisfy me, especially Raphael. I liked Megan Fox as well in this movie, but she still has room for improvement and I think with the right cast, she can become something likable to a lot more fan-bases when looking past her looks. As much as her looks are noted in this film, it's still nothing compared to Jennifer's Body from 2009, which was a movie that straight-out tried to capitalize on her looks.So obviously the biggest flaw was the plot, which needed a lot more development. But with more movies and more flesh, this turtles group has the potential to be better. Some aspects of this movie is already going in the right direction, so as long as improvements are made where they can be made, a diamond can be hidden in the rough. As it is though, the film was only decent, but it also could have been a lot worse.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Then I heard that his Turtle movie was coming out this year and I'm like, ""No. He's going to singlehandedly ruin the entire franchise"" I'm proud to report that he didn't.While I still dislike the Turtle's and Splinter's designs, I think the movie is pretty damn good. No Casey as promised, which is a good reason to dock points from this movie. He's my second favorite character.While the plot is highly predictable and bland, the action and comedy are a notch above decent.

And most of that stuff came out in the trailers and previews.As stated previously, the plot is painstakingly predictable. No plot twists. Nothing you're generally surprised by. You've watched the movie before you've seen it.Unlike the Internet when his models were shown, I actually like Shredder's design. It's a really cool robotic suit that looks just like Shredder does, except with these badass wrist-mounted knives. Some people say it's overkill, but hey, it's cool and I'm a big fan of the Turtles and I don't give a crap about it.

I am going to be truthful, with as much hype and dismay that was wrapped around this movie, I did not have a single idea of what to expect. I came into that theater expecting the very worst that Hollywood had to throw at me. While I was not thrilled to see April O'Neil played by famed Bay actress, Megan Fox, even she had some dignity to add to this film. They put my mind at ease when we really started to meet our four stars of the show, and how they interacted with each other and in an outward way. Yes, I was very impressed with how well it turned out, but no it was not perfect. I did not like how they handled Donny's character. Making him far- sighted, giving him extreme-nerd tendencies and making that pretty much the only side to his character was a little distracting every single time you saw him. Michelangelo stole the entire show, and as my favorite of the turtles, that is really fitting. Once the second act kicked up there he was still cracking the jokes and kicking major ass along with it. Raphael even had his time to shine, and he did so with great gusto. Leo, as usual, is not given much to work with, but still manages to pull off his own part. There were other elements that they left out, but all of that is forgiven, at least in my eyes. It could have turned out ten times worse than it did and I am extremely grateful for what we received. It is indeed worth seeing in the theaters, and worth purchasing to add to your turtle film collection for all of you true-green fans.

No one has the guts to stand up to them, and the city is almost paralyzed in fear. One reporter, April O'Neil,runs across one of their heists, and finds it is stopped by a vigilante. She wants to expose the vigilante, and then soon finds out that there are actually 4 vigilantes who still stand for justice in the crime ridden city she loves. Along the way, we'll discover past connections to the vigilantes, and a few minor (predictable) plot turns, and find teamwork, brotherhood, and a boring movie even with all the explosions.The turtles take about 15 minutes to show up. For a movie that is just over an hour and half, that is too long, also considering that much of the story is going to have to be told in flashback...and was still boring. The CGI tries to balance between creepy and cute and stays in creepy too much. The mask on the turtles or the mask off, they don't get cute. The rat is just vile. And, isn't he the same age as the turtle? Well, turtles are long lived, I guess, and so he might be nearing his mortality stage.There are other small faults. I could have sworn I saw the scar switch from the left side to the right side on one of the turtles. The bad guys were weak and throwaway. Seriously...how bad is the unemployment out there when you take a job with a bad guy, and they murder you just to demonstrate the effectiveness of a drug? If I were another bad guy in that room, I would just casually walk over to the locker room, take off my machine gun and swords, change into my street clothes, and go take that job at McDonald's. It's bad enough that ninja turtles are gunning for you, and your own organization kills you, too? Not to mention the police or the vigilante justice that awaits you if they ever find out, so, isn't that job at McDonald's looking better all the time? They have a free meal program at McDonald's. And tuition reimbursement. But, you stay with the ninja Foot Clan? Really? Anyways...my six year and eight year old both loved it. I was standing in a line with a guy in his 30's, who had brought his his wife and three kids to the movies. He was so excited. He told me had to drag his family there. I saw them after. He said he loved it. So...if you are a turtle fan, and there seemed to be lots of adults without kids, so maybe they are tuning into the right audience, maybe you'll love it, too. But, if you weren't a fan, I don't see a reason to spend 40-50 bucks at the theater (tickets, popcorn, soda). If you have to spend that kind of money, I'd go see Guardians of the Galaxy again. A much better movie, and funnier. Your choice.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

It is everything that I want in a TMNT movie!!! It has action, comedy, suspense, drama, catchphrases aplenty and even just typing this I feel like a kid again which is all I ask for any reboot of a show from my youth :)Everyone has their favourite turtle and I think they captured the characters of the show (and the style of the original comics which is nice to see) - my personal fave Donatello was perfect! Even Megan Fox was OK as April O'Neill and I normally hate her in movies... If I have to be negative about anything it would be that Shredder was too bulky and hi-tech for my liking and didn't have enough screen time :(Roll on the next movie, I'll be first in the queue for tickets!COWABUNGA!!!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
219,TVpotatoCat,Good for children and young teens,2,27 April 2016,"If you have one or two hours with absolutely nothing to do and no way to entertain yourself, I suppose you can enjoy this movie. This movie had so many plot holes that I'm not even going to go there. There are a few things that strike me the most with their stupidly. One is the logical (illogical) process of decision making of some characters, which could be acceptable if those were ten years old kids (although even they have some survival instincts. Like not go willingly into a hostage situation). The second is Megan Fox's bad acting. I seriously wondered if she has some face distortion that unable her to close her mouth – since it was the only expression she had through the duration of the whole movie. It's damn obvious why they chose her for the role and it's not because of her acting skills. Hell, even the turtles had more genuine expressions.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
220,film316-125-427677,Missing the Hero,1,1 February 2015,"When we are children, there is a toy we love above all others, that is a holy grail of imagination and enjoyment. For me that was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I loved the TV and toys so much, and the films still hold a special place in my heart. So here we have a reboot, This will not end well. OK, let me get over my own personal hang ups towards the film straight away. It's not the Turtles I knew and loved, it's not the same premise, it's not the same message ideas and for this reason alone the film should not be watched or tolerated by anyone. Ever. I can't guarantee this side of me won't return later in this review but for now, I'm going to try and judge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as best I can without bringing in my personal feelings for the product. The Turtles Movie Is a film that attempts to have it's cake and eat it. It wants the integrity and prestige of the original movies and cartoons, but it wants massive set pieces and unoriginal thinking. That's the main problem with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, we have seen it all before. There is nothing to make the movie stand out and be proud of itself, I mean in truth there is nothing horrifically wrong with it enough to make me angry, but considering what the film had to work with I just wanted something more remarkable.The plot is the same plot of any superhero film, Hero's exists, are hidden from the world, a super villain wants to do something bad, they have to come out of hiding to defend the city they love. That's the other thing; that considering the film is just over an hour and half, there isn't a whole lot of action in it, nor is there much comedy or anything else, the entire thing just kind of runs together without any kind of variety. I think that the films blandness is really what comes to the front of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I just never felt like I really knew anything about the Turtles that made them personally unique, or why Shredder had any ties to their past, the film never goes into detail about anything. I could overlook the look of the turtles themselves if they had enough character, but simply put they don't. This is a travesty that cannot be forgiven. It's not even like we see the turtles fight the nameless foot soldiers that much either. There is a sequence in the middle of the movie, where there is a chase and an escape for the turtles, each turtle is used in turn to achieve a goal but instead of looking spectacular or impressive the sequence just looks messy. Now, I am fully aware that for a child who has never seen the turtles or is just a young kid, this film will be engaging and exciting and fun, but that isn't who I am or how I watch the movie. Also the inner film references in the movie are just lazy. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a bit of big dumb inoffensive fun. However I'm predjudist against a film that would do this to my childhood so it's still awful.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This is not a grand work of cinematic masterpiece. This film will never be a classic. lets face it. No super hero film will ever be a true classic. so lets stop looking for gold in a dung heap and just enjoy the fertilizer. Clear you mind. get a snack. pour a drink. watch the movie, and..now this is important. laugh. stop looking for reality, don't hunt for plot holes and look for flaws. yes there are lots. just watch the movie and have fun. there are ninja fighting turtles in combat with evil!!! and they are not even old enough to drink(as the title would leave me to believe, but anything goes in international waters.)

222,JackRice100,Surprisingly good!,8,3 November 2014,"Everyone knows the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles are but for the few that don't, they are turtles that mutate into massive turtles in the sewers of NYC who get brought up by a Rat named Splinter who teaches them fighting skills and to speak English. I was going into this film thinking it was going to be awful I thought there would be crappy unnecessary explosions and they wouldn't focus AT ALL on the turtles, so I wasn't expecting much to say the least. Surprisingly tho I quite enjoyed it the turtles themselves were the best bit and so they should be lets face it, they don't look all smooth and perfectly made, they looked a bit ugly and freaky and oh I dunno mutated! so that was great. The personalities of the turtles, for me, they got down to a tee, amazing work has to be said by the voice actors. Splinter as the mutated rat was impressive too but were this film lets its self down for me is the origin story the way they made Splinter learn how to be a master Ninja was just laughably bad I have to admit. Then they don't even go into why the Foot clan is so deadly and dangerous apart from a few news bulletins that show what they've been doing and them saying its bad. None of the history between Splinter and Shredder was explained at all. Also something that I expected when I heard Michel Bay was involved in the making of this film is that they won't concentrate on the turtles as much as they would with some other human, he did it with transformers he did it again here. I would of much preferred a film that was based from the turtles and not April O'Neil's (Megan Fox) one big reason this should of been done is the few moments the turtles had that you saw them on there own being teenagers and stuff were the best parts of the film why they couldn't of played or at least showed that more is beyond me. Overall tho I thought this was a lot better than I expected and didn't ruin my fond memories of the TMNT and instead brought them back to the forefront and for that I would and could watch this a again.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
223,BB02,There goes my childhood,3,2 July 2020,"The character design of both the turtles and Splinter looks terrible. The jokes are silly and the characters all unlikeable. Splinter is meant to be a loving father figure, but physically abuses his teenage boys. The Turtles have no real personality, except for Michelangelo, who is the most annoying character since Jar Jar Binks, but he has a dead ringer in Will Forte, being absolutely useless and profoundly unfunny in every scene. Megan Fox might not be a great Actress, but she is clearly the best thing in this mess.At least the voice acting is good. And the action scenes are fun in the typical Michael Bay style, which is evident all over this, sadly especially in the humor. This reboot has nothing on the classic movies from the 80s.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
224,streetrodfan,Too modern...,7,16 August 2014,"Imagine that like a great surgeon some one is giving a great speech, every line is like the action of a surgeon , which is precise, and lacks no less meaning than the last. Now to say what a great script is to a great movie to me is like to compare the actions of a great surgeon to a great writer. \In a way both are art forms of their own.What I liked about the 90s Turtle movie and most 90s films as opposed to modern film will come out as I further paint a picture with this metaphor Now imagine a surgeon who goes into a body to dissect it starts to pull and tug on the internal organs of the patient, puts on some heavy metal music takes out a chain saw to heal a hernia and slices and dices the patient just to get his pump on, and give the other doctors a show.Obviously that doctor would have failed his patient as well as his art and his viewers would likely be un-entertained. Like wise a writer who lacks precision and clarity in their work , like a surgeon will lack realism and for a movie there for depth. Movies today lack realism and depth, because their scripts are contrived with long action scenes, relatable characters and drama. To me this is the problem with this movie and most movies this decade. To me this film and script has over the top stupid action scenes that unlike a great speech lack true art, dimension and soul.To me they are sloppy and over the top and forced and lack the sophistication of the 90s film. Let's compare the 90s film ending to the 2014. The end fight scene like a skilled surgeon is precise, there's no cars falling on top the shredder, no flips or explosions going off. It's REAL, it has dimension it's almost poetic. It's a simple fight scene yet like a skilled surgeon who keeps his work simple and precise it works perfectly. This movie is basically a super hero film with the turtles and it lacks the emotion and intensity, drama and realism of the 90s film.You can not tell a deep and meaningful story with pure action scenes, you can not have substance in a movie geared towards children that is drown out by too much action. That's what makes the 90s film one of a kind and one of my favorite movies even as a 26 year old. It was the first movie I had ever seen. I was 3 years old and I remember that end fight scene. I remember the realism of it, how it took me in as the shredder was falling my heart jump. There was nothing quite like that in this movie it was an adrenaline rush without any real script at heart and the characters wrapped up in that weren't as near as real and dramatic as the 90s film.This is the main reason I'm giving this movie a 7and the 90s film a 9 or 10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
225,snakes3992,Disappointing,3,13 August 2014,"This movie sucked, Michael Bay do yourself a favor, quit making movies, because you suck at them, okay I will admit you do have some good ones, but you keep on making suckish movies for us. This movie is just as bad as Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The best part about the movie is the turtles, it's nice we get to know what they're like, and know about their personalities, which is good, but that's not enough to make this good. The problems I have with this movie is this, April O'Neal In this movie is just a damsel in distress, she is just a girl for the turtles to save, she barely helps them in this movie, also there are parts, where she is an idiot sometimes, like for example she tells the turtles secret to the villain. Will Arnett in this movie is not funny, he is really annoying, the jokes that he says, are terrible, plus some of them he says don't come off as jokes, every time I see him or hear his jokes, I just want to punch this in the face, really f***ing hard, because he reminds of Jar Jar Binks. Splinter is not really that wise, he's mostly a dick to his sons, which I didn't like, because I never find Splinter that much of a dick. Shredder in this movie is so lame, and forgettable, his evil plan doesn't make any sense, also he doesn't come with evil plans, his son does, which is Sacks, I thought he'll play as Shredder, because he's a better villain than Shredder in this movie, speaking of Shredder, they try keeping him in the shadows, but they fail, because I saw his face, wow nice try. The action in this movie is not that exciting in this movie, most of it is just boring, and they try to use slow-motion to make it look cool, but it fails, because they re-use it over and over, also it has the same ending as The Amazing Spider-Man, even though it's in daylight, that still doesn't make it different or good, also it fails at being dark, because the dark moments in the movie don't become that dark, they just come off as being silly. Now for the positives, like I said the turtles are the best part in this movie. There is one action scene that I like in this movie, it was the avalanche scene, because the action in that part was pretty well done, and that rap song at the end credits. Over all this movie sucked, the action wasn't that good, the villain was lame, the human characters are idiots, and over all is just a big disappointment.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

That's not what this movie, produced by Michael Bay, did. The action scenes were all blurry and shaky, so you had no idea what was going on.The characterization in this movie was terrible. All paper board cut out clichés. And to make matters worse, there were no less than two characters, including Michaelangelo, that claimed April O'Neil as their personal property. Nice way to treat the ladies... NOT!Character design was awful. The turtles really looked off-putting. Not to mention the Shredder, proving that Michael Bay is incapable of producing a movie without at least one giant robot.The only saving grace of this crap fest were the in-jokes, making this movie just barely acceptable to watch and earning in three stars instead of just one.Watch it once, to obey your curiosity.

THe Turtels alone would be enough action, the shredder part well OK has to be i suppose but why in Hell we need that over the top stupid action. It was already boring in this never ending explosions and falling , yea falling this movie should be called as the falling, it seems there's a little talking and a lot of falling.It really sad it had a lot of potential. They got the characters of the Turtles really good but there was not really much of scenes with them other than fighting. The backstory was made bogus and in a hurry, all of that just drags the premise down.It could have been better with way less action, classes better and is it really to much to ask for proper writing? really? investing xxx millions of dollar in special effects but only 5 bucks for the book? really?i still give it 5 because you know its the TMHT, but it deserves more like 1 or 2",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Because that's obviously not what you are going to get. But some people seem to not really understand that and come in to this movie wanting and already expecting to hate it and that, from my point of view, is a scummy thing to do.It doesn't matter if you have nostalgia for the older movies or if you hate the premise or even if you just hate action flicks in general, all movies deserve a chance, and, if you give ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (2014) one, I think you will find there is much to like in it. It is by no means a perfect movie. No, not even close, it is flawed in many ways, it's plagued with childish humour and bad exposition scenes, but deep down, there are definitely things that work and are actually very competent.For one, some of the humour that sticks is great. I am not ashamed to say that I laughed very hard at some of the jokes, although not all.The CGI is also very good, and whilst it might be too much in your face in some scenes with the amount of explosions happening, it doesn't go for the awful trope that is shaky cam action.I did wish the movie focused more on the turtles and less on April though, I really wanted to see more of them, and even though I loved the first scene with her, she ended up being the weakest part of the film, along with the kinda of romance plot that's mashed in.Overall, please don't hate this movie just because and actually watch it to form an opinion.

231,EdwardNashtonReeves,Great fun with awesome characters,7,18 January 2015,"I enjoyed TMNT very much! That is the reason I wanted to share my opinion of the film to all of those who haven't seen it, but have doubts due to the bad reviews and bashing. Obviously people have some kind of problem with all Michael Bay films, and while I do see some of the issues, in this case I didn't mind. First of all, the director is Jonathan Liebesman, not Bay. The film doesn't suffer from overuse of explosions, on the contrary, action scenes rarely end-up wrapped in them. Second, if you are going to see the film, it's because you presumably like the Turtles. And here is where you will probably get exactly what you want. All four brothers have really similar personalities to their animated counterparts and their brotherly bond, even in teasing and competing with each other, is very believable. Megan Fox as April O'Neill is pretty good too, despite being called bad actress multiple times. She comes off as likable, dedicated young reporter who wants to uncover the truth about her father's old projects as well as advance as a reporter and I think she is easy to connect with. Splinter is a cool teacher and a fatherly figure who makes them the team they need to be. April's relationship with TMNT guys is also quite nicely built up to the point they fight together (which isn't big spoiler to anyone who knows anything about the premise). The villain of the film is The Shredder, who is usually their arch- nemesis. What works is that he is a mystery, and doesn't show his face nor we know for certain his origin. He is also big, menacing and knows how to handle any situation himself. He maybe comes off as a blank slate so far, but we get hooked-up by his persona and I expect we will get a lot more from him in the sequel.The action is very good, as well as the stunts performing them. Visual effects provide additional epic touch to the film. Also, the soundtrack is great. The story itself is, as said, somewhat predictable, but not more than most of the films. But it doesn't suffer from poor characters, nor obvious plot-holes. The story can be followed and understood without laughing at inconsistencies, equally by children and by adults. If you are a fan of these characters, and you love the Turtles, April, Shredder, Splinter and the rest, I can guarantee you will have a good time. While the plot and designs are somewhat different, it has been done with intention to give fans something new, yet recognizable and cool. Characters are nice and the action is good. At first, I gave it a solid 7, but as the film grew-up to me and I wanted to see it again, I gave it an 8 for what is and needs to be.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The heroes have a rat as master and father figure. As always, the opponent is the evil character Shredder. The movie combines computer animation with acting. The well-known artist Megan Fox was cast in the role of the friend of the mutants named April O'Neil. You can already tell that this movie has a bit of a resemblance to the Transformers, because Michael Bay has his hands in the game. The story is well told and there are many action-packed scenes.It was a pleasure to watch this movie and it satisfied my thirst.

234,mikecart1,Full Review of TMNT 2014 From IMDb's Biggest TMNT Fan,5,7 August 2014,"By now you've seen many critics and the press rate this movie down big time. Whether it is because they can't stand Michael Bay or think that Megan Fox can't act or because they don't ""get"" TMNT, they all have their reasons.I was a huge TMNT growing up. I literally could cover myself from head-to-toe with TMNT merchandise: socks, shoes, sweatpants, belt buckle, underwear, tees, sweaters, wallet, bandanna, pajamas, watch, cassette, action figures, video games, hell I even went to their concert tour (yeah they had one and it was sold out BTW too).Entering Theater I debated all week whether or not to go see this movie. I lowered my expectations a couple of weeks ago and just wanted it to be ""ok"" in critic's eyes. This week, each review got worse and worse. Tonight I even had a plan B to see Boyhood instead.However, in line I saw that I wasn't alone. TMNT fans surrounded me. They were the 25-35 age variety, guys and girls, and they all were willing to be loyal to the brand they grew up with. Even the guy in front of me said ""Ninja Turtles for 10:15"". I said the same.The theater I went in was actually twice as packed as last week when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy at the same time. Now let's not get things confused. GOTG is 100x better than this movie. But that's not the point. TMNT fans never left. That is the point.What Works in the Movie? While everyone has complained for months about how bad the turtles look themselves, that isn't even a problem in the movie for me. It actually works. Every turtle has their personality and quirk. As expected, Michelangelo is the star.Also, the fight scenes were actually good too. You could feel the hits and kicks and the martial arts and weapons were all there in TMNT style.What Doesn't Work in the Movie? Where do I begin? Well I will start at the beginning.The first 15-20 minutes were actually solid. It was dark like the 1990 movie with rain and you only got glimpses of the turtles. At the 20 minute mark actually, this movie is a solid B.However, things get bad real quick. The storyline goes off track and starts making a lot less sense. I will focus on a few BIG issues with the movie.Shredder?We are introduced to Shredder early on in the movie (without mask). However, despite showing scars on his face, the movie never explains why. In fact, forget what you might have thought from the TMNT franchise. Splinter and Shredder have zero connection. Did Shredder then get those scars from shaving? I mean come on! See the 1990 movie if you don't see the problem.On top of that, Shredder has been transformed into a semi-Transformer being when he is in his ""suit"". The ties to the Transformers franchise are clearly there from the sound effects used during his fight scenes to all the aerial weapons he has suddenly got out of nowhere.Overall, his story, design, and costume make zero sense. Oh and did I mention his scars yet? Splinter? Ugly, ugly, ugly. On top of that his connection to the turtles is even more weird. Even worse, because Shredder has no connection with Splinter, you can only guess how Splinter ever learned how to do karate or how he even taught the TMNT karate.April? Forget Megan Fox. The bigger problem is April's story to everything. Without saying too much, let's just say that April's connection makes up for the lack of connection between Shredder, Splinter, and the TMNT.On top of that, whoever directed the movie decided that the TMNT were attracted to April. Who knows why.The Foot?Maybe the worse part of this movie? Motive is never there. How one becomes a member is never explained. Forget about the 1990 movie showing that it was troubled youth getting recruited by Shredder to take over New York. From what I gathered in this movie, Shredder had no part in recruiting any of these guys.-Overall- I'm giving this a 5/10. I found myself daydreaming about 1 hr into the movie thinking on why the direction went the way it did. I tried to reason with what purpose the creative team had to completely change the story yet again. I tried to ignore the sound effects that repeatedly sounded like Transformers transforming. I tried to ignore Shredder's ridiculous suit. I just couldn't.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
235,authorcamilson-499-156858,Watch the original instead. More entertaining!,5,21 November 2014,"We all know the story by now. 4 mutant turtles are raised in the sewers on NYC by a giant rat, who teaches them the way of Ninjutsu, to protect the city from the likes of Shredder and the Foot.The action and SPX were good to a point, then it started to comes across more like Transformers. (Especially when Shredder dons his armor suit).Megan Fox plays the role of April O'Neil. The wanna-be journo who is stuck with doing bits on trivial going's on in the city, while she desperately aspires to be ""a real journalist"". I will just say here that her character comes across much like Fox's acting Desperate. Ms Fox may be attractive (according to some), but her acting abilities are very much lacking. It is obvious she struggles with any real depth in making a character believable. A good portion of this film seemed to be dedicated and focused on Ms Fox, rather than the story of the TMNT.Will Arnett plays the role of Vernon Fenwick, April's ""sorta"" love interest and partner in filming crime. Vernon is the stereotypical character who constantly makes with the bad pick-up lines, and always helping April out of at a drop of a hat. (Doesn't this guy have a real life?)Tohoru Masamune plays the role of Shredder. The badass of the film. While the back-story on this guy goes completely off the rails compared to the original films, his acting was okay.I did think that the film could have stuck with the original plot, of Splinter being raised (more or less) by Shredder, to give the film more credibility. But, in this version, our pal, Splinter, is the ""lab rat"" (no pun intended), who is injected with test mutagen to see what the effects would be. When a fire destroys the lab, April (the child) saves the turtles and rat by dumping them in the sewer (great job!). It is in the sewers that Splinter becomes a ninja master, all by reading a book he so ""conveniently"" finds. With no sparring partner or mentor of his own to instruct him in the ways of Ninjutsu, Splinter becomes a ninja master and then instructs his clan of 4 mutated turtles in the ways of being ninja's. Hmmmm. Too many plot holes here that it does my head in :)I was sadly disappointed that this film went completely off track from the original storyline. And for those who watched the original animated cartoon series, and the original movies, you will know the back- story all too well.The only redeeming feature of this film was the epic fight scene between Shredder and Splinter. For that I give a huge thumbs up. But the rest of the film was sadly lacking.I will say that as far as appealing to kids, this is not a film I would allow my 6 year old son to watch. The original films, yes, but not this.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
236,dan_marsala,Not a Fan of the Turtles? Skip it!,7,9 August 2014,"First of all, let's take a moment to reflect about the title: ""Ninja Turtles"" ""Ninja-Turtles"" Great! Now, if you really know these four brothers, whose adventures almost covered since the eighties, then you should know they weirdly take things seriously, they're always funny, they're always cool, and, most important, their movies are completely preposterous. This suits producer Michael Bay and the director, Jonathan Liebesman. The first one never takes his job seriously and the second one is preposterous. They both stirred their talents to give birth to a not-so-good, but immensely funny production that could easily compete with the 1990 version. There are some terrible flats here as well. The Shredder (the sworn nemesis of the TMNT) has almost no relevance outside of the action scenes what I mean is: he is the master mind behind the evil plan (to take control over Manhattan), but he kind of remind me of the Ra's Al Ghul Henry Ducard is protecting in the League of Shadows. He doesn't prove he is the leader. He only fights and lets others to speak in his behalf. The origin of the TMNT is different as well. Splinter's too. And you'll realize that they don't have to be ninjas to be super bad, 'cause they're really big now. For sure, they're the kind of heroes that could make a good match against Superman or Hulk. Just look at the images of Raphael. Do these mutated, pizza-lover freaks, seize a good portion of your childhood and you would like to see them once more in action and as you have never see them before? This is a must see, then, and with an open (very wide open) mind, you might even get to love it. But if you hadn't even played the arcade, or seen at least a couple of the cartoon chapters, then you'll probably end up seeing another piece of trash, because it is what it is. Not a serious thing, but a good piece of karate action, and a more than acceptable performance by Megan Fox, this time taking over the role of Matt Witwicky. This is probably a fan exclusive!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
237,oneto-1,"Michael Bay's paid HATERS, Please go F*ck yourselves!",9,27 November 2014,"There are many reviews where people given 2 star just because ""Michael Bay"" has produced this movie. Seriously Guys? Is this enough reason to hate a movie and spoil it's ratings? Few universal truth about ""Michael Bay's"" movies are 1-The Best Sound Effects 2-The Best Cinematography 3-The Best CGI 4-The Best Special Effects 5-The Best Action Scenes 6-The Best Editing and this movie is not an exception.I know this is an unpopular opinion. But is far as I'm concerned, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first came to life in Michael Bay's movie. And it is therefore the best TMNT movie until something better comes along to replace it. The thing about Michael Bay, is that he's a master of layering different types of cinematic movement. It is not enough for Michael Bay to film someone having a conversation on the telephone. In that shot, everything will be moving. The camera will swoop around the actor in one direction from below, as the actor himself will turn in the other, which in conjunction with layers of depth in the foreground and background will give the scene an effect almost like parallax scrolling. This makes quiet shots feel epic, and epic shots even epic-er. But the shots themselves are almost always the same. In many ways, Bay is like a purple prose writer, always trying to knock it out of the park with every sentence, but never considering the subtle rhythms that need to work in the good of the whole. He's a slave to his own eye, who needs to make every image dynamic even when it runs contrary to the theme of the film. So why do people continue to go to Michael Bay films? The issue is a disconnect between our eyes and our brains. Bay's films prove that while we have become quite visually sophisticated, we're also, by large, visually illiterate. Haters blast Michael Bay films because they are paid to think about that way. In any case you can Like him or Hate him but you can't ignore him. His movies are milestones and he is creating another masterpiece every day. In India there is a famous saying ""When people start talking against you ... then certainly you are making progress""",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
238,andynaik,Fun fest with a Michael Bay touch,6,7 August 2014,"I was stoked for this movie since I've been a big fan of TMNT for most of my childhood. On the other hand though, I was kind of doubtful this would reach the likes of the Batman reboot.Shredder and his Foot Clan are wreaking havoc on New York City. Megan Fox, who plays April O'Neil is a struggling journalist who is on the lookout for some exciting story for Channel 6 news. She stumbles across some Foot Clan activity and sees a vigilante fight them off. Unable to get a clear shot of him and with her coworkers not believing her story, she is desperate to find another situation. Enter the subway station attack, where she is conveniently present and held hostage by the Foot Clan who are looking to fight off vigilantes. She follows them and gets introduced to them.How Splinter and the turtles evolved are revealed in the movie so one does not need to know their origins. Later on, we learn that William Fichtner, chairman of Sacks enterprise has devoted to fight off crime in the city. The journey then begins to fight off Shredder who with his Foot Clan are prepared to release toxins in the city.The premise was good, however there the execution was poor. How April manages to conveniently find and help the turtles with no major brain power required, how turtles are conveniently stocked with gadgetry and knowledge about computer systems and with an over clichéd plot of releasing toxins in the city (haven't we seen it all too well before?), the movie was all too predictable. Not to mention the special Michael Bay touch, unnecessary shaky cam in some situations, an over the top fight scene on the snowy slopes of a mountain and poorly written script (Will Arnett's character was a mess).The CGI effects were good though, the turtles didn't look like men in costumes, the fight scenes were good and every scene of Michelangelo was funny (thankfully!). Megan Fox's acting wasn't too bad either. If you want to relive a part of the childhood craze, go see this movie but be aware that this is no Oscar worthy endeavor.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
239,tj0331,Horrible re-imagining,1,18 August 2014,"Save yourself the time and just watch the original. My main complaint is the over use of CG. Sure I get it, fake CG turtles. They honestly were not the worst part. Shredder was an over hyped up joke to me. Some parts were fun. But, they could have done all this in similar fashion as the originals using real costume/puppet formation and had a much better outcome. I hope they scrap this franchise and try again with maybe the Henson company instead of Mr. Bay's production team which has its place, just not in the TMNT realm. It is a bad mix!!! With all these badass comic book films out why not pay homage to the original TMNT and make something dark and badass, it was a comic book first after all. I knew they would get it a little wrong, but I was expecting them to muck it up so much. I should have bought tickets to re watch GOTG instead.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
240,santiagonunez16,The Title Suggests What You're Gonna Get!!!,10,9 August 2014,"Every now and then a movie comes along with some old hash of retro mixed in with the new school tricks. This movie is a clear example of the fun you have when you check your brain at the door. It's a movie about ninja turtles based on a cartoon, based on a toy line, based on...well you get the idea. So if you're expecting Oscar winning performances, look else where, but if you're looking to have some fun at the movies this August, it's not a bad way to spend 100minutes. In 1990, I thought Jim Henson's muppet company did a fantastic job bringing the cartoon turtles to life. This around the budget is bigger, the effects better, and the action is top notch fun! Personally, I'm no fan of Michael Bay, but he managed to capture some originality in the Turtles franchise. Much like the fun of the first 2007 Transformers movie, there's decent character development for a huge summer movie like Ninja Turtles.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
241,albertsmith-32785,This is not an adaptation of the Turtles I remember as a kid.,2,27 August 2018,This is a turd of a movie and I say this as a massive TMNT fan(especially of that 80s cartoon series). The turtles aren't friendly- they actually look menacing and quite frankly- creepy. April O Neill played with aplomb by Megan Fox who is subjected to so many voyeuristic shots of her body that I expected the makers of this travesty to put forth a disclaimer at the start: Not to be seen by feminists. But then this is the kind of subject no feminist would rather watch. The action- much like all of Bay's films is so fast and joyously edited that you forget who is who. It begins and ends and that is it. If you are a fan of the cartoon you will be borderline suicidal. If you are a new inquisitive to the turtle phenomenon you'd be bored and wondering when the interval will happen. This is one film you should definitely miss.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
242,azeezhaneef,Very good entertainer,9,2 October 2020,I dont know why there is so much negative reviews for this movie. I enjoyed watching this movie.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
243,alexrwatson-888-169026,"Fine for Kids, Terrible for Anyone Thinking and not Just Watching",3,10 August 2014,"My review will not focus on the movie's similarities or differences they took from the TMNT ""lore,"" because I did not grow up watching the movies, reading the comics, etc. The film summed up in one word: messy.The script is quite frankly, terrible, with characters spouting out stupid lines of dialogue, characters placed in scenes entirely for exposition, and mindless characters you could not care any less about. I will say that the turtles were good in the movie. They were voiced well and actually had a couple funny moments between them. That gets me to the humans; they were so dull, yet the movie focuses on them more than they do the turtles themselves. This is what I like to call, ""The Transformers Syndrome."" Arnett is a funny enough actor, but he serves absolutely no purpose in the film. Fichtner is a really good actor, but the character he is playing is just your typical bad guy that needs to do bad things to move forward the plot. His ""motivation"" for his plan contradicts itself once you actually think about it. If Megan Fox is your most likable character in a movie, then you are in for a rough time,.Also, going back to the turtles, they are huge, and they even say in the movie they cannot be shot. The turtles are nearly invincible, which is fine if you actually care about the humans they are saving. But you do not, which leads to a messy movie.All this being said, kids will love this movie. But that cannot be an excuse for a being terrible movie. 3/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
244,just_for_movies,Entertaining but dumb at the same time,6,7 September 2014,"Before I begin I'll just say that I know nothing about TMNT and haven't seen any of the previous movies. Here is my review: It's a fun movie for sure with some great action sequences but it's ridiculously dumb also. First off from the trailer I thought the turtles looked plain stupid but then I remembered that they were supposed to be mutants....... anyway after that I kind of got used to them. The characters (April, Vernon, Eric) weren't developed very well but you did get a sense who they were and what they were up to. The action sequences though were probably the best part of the movie even though they looked a bit like a video game at times. Some sequences were quite fun to watch like the one on the snowy mountain with the truck or the one on the roof of the skyscraper in New York. But the CGI often went a tad overboard on these sequences and you usually noticed it. One problem also with the action scenes were that often the camera would shake A LOT. For me that's not too bad but for some it might be to much. Also, from the beginning I didn't really like the whole concept of these ninja turtles. I don't know why but I just didn't like the idea. I wasn't going to watch it at first but then I went with some friends just for the fun of it and found out that it wasn't as bad as I thought. But it's still miles away from being perfect. The bottom line: it was a fun ride with some entertaining parts but really had no real intelligence or logic behind it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
245,mober1996,"Had a nice feel, but did lack some essentials",7,5 February 2015,"Alright. So let's get it out of the way. This movie had a lot of s*** go down about it. A lot of people said it was good, a lot of people said it was bad. And honestly? You can go either way. I originally wanted to see this movie when came out, because I grew up on the TMNT Cartoon Network series that began in the early 2000s. So, when I saw that this was coming out, I got really excited..until I saw the trailer. I felt like it was going to be a shipwreck. And in reality, it was. But not in the way that most people expected. I thought it would've been just a bad movie, but there were so many mixed reviews that it actually did end up getting a sequel. Anyways, I did promise myself that I would eventually watch this movie once the storm of criticism calmed down.Let's get down to business. The things that this movie did right were pretty substantial. They perfectly captured the personalities of each of the turtles. Each one had the clear strengths, weaknesses, and bond that I had gotten so used to growing up on. The Foot Clan (despite using guns now and not being ninjas) did feel more intimidating than I would normally have expected. They felt more threatening, which is a good transition from the cartoon version to a more ""realistic"" style. The Shredder himself, was exactly the kind of force that he needed to be. Yes yes he did have a new suit, yes yes people were angry about that. I DON'T CARE! Honestly? I liked the suit change. Compared to the original suits, it went through Michael Bay makeover and turned into exactly what I would've liked it to have been. He was practically a tank, and yes that does sort of ruin the ninja feel of the Shredder, it did feel like it was needed for this movie. The story was interesting (despite obvious reasons) and it did not take me long to get interested.Now, what they did wrong. The voices for the turtles in this movie were terrible. Yeah, they were fitting, but the only one that I really liked was Raphael's voice. All the others were meh at best. Megan Fox was nowhere near the April O'Neal that anyone ever wanted. There is no comparison between Megan Fox and April O'Neal. They are nothing alike. Personally, I would have MUCH more preferred to have seen Natalie Portman play April O'Neal. And I can say that with an honest to god smile on my face. And lastly, the BIGGEST problem that I had, was that they rewrote the backstory (which I won't go into detail to). I had fallen in love with the backstory of the cartoon from the early 2000s and so when I saw that they had COMPLETELY changed it for this movie, it took a big hit on me. I honestly almost flipped.The way they were able to counteract the bad parts of this movie, were honestly just making a good film. If you went into the movie knowing NOTHING about TMNT then you would probably have really liked this movie. And personally? I actually did really enjoy this movie. I don't know if it is because I'm a TMNT fanboy, or just a bad critic. I honestly can't tell. But I did enjoy this movie. It definitely was not perfect in any form, but for me, it didn't deserve the crap that it originally received. Final Score 7.5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
246,jamiepick-16042,"Amazing, Absolutely Fantastic and Hilarious.",10,16 January 2021,"An Absolute Fantastic Film. Highly Underrated in my opinion. Screw People that say this is Trash, This was Hilarious, Fun Packed And Enjoyable. The Main Character Incarnations were on Point. I heard a lot of people complaining About them being horrendous. But Cmon y'all, this is a LIVE ACTION film. They aren't meant to be like the 1990 Film. I Think these incarnations are some of the best from the franchise Being like there 2003 Incarnations. Shredder Looked like a Transformation though, but I really liked it because (A) Transformations I always loved, and (B) Shredder Has Always been a favourite Villain Of Myn. Splinter also looked very cool, and very wise of himself as he should be. The Cast was Very Entertaining Especially some of the stars Of this film being Will Arnett that Plays in some of the best films ever directed, as well as Megan Fox as April O Neil. I though Megan was the only Problem of the film cuz she was kinda of a jerk in this film. Thankfully, she's much better in the sequel. Now Some of the best scenes of this Amazing Film is the MC Mikey Scene(That is the film highlight of history). The ice chase Scene was Intense and kept me on my Toes, the final Fight was Epic and Insane Especially Seeing them doing the Buck-Buck Scene, Splinter battling shredder was on point and is such an epic scene, and the Best thing about this film is the ending with Mikey Singing Happy Together at the end. But another epic thing I liked about this film is the Song Called ""Shell Shocked"" That plays at the end of the credits. It was composed By Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla Sign with specials like Kill The Noise & Madsonik. The song is epic and is memorable with the turtles after saving the day. This Film is Highly Recommend For The kids especially the adults. This is a Family Movie that Is Definitely worth a Watch if Your a Big TMNT Fan. It's exactly what a TMNT Film has always been. Silly, Fun, Hilarious and Epic at the Same Time. You won't regret this. 10/10 COWABUNGA!!!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
247,jerrywright15,To The Point,6,9 August 2014,"This review is going to be simple and to the point. Do NOT go into this movie with a pessimistic attitude or chances are your going to hate the movie before you even see the turtles. If you go in with a positive outlook or hell even a neutral one I promise this movie will provide a decent enough amount of laughs and fight sequences to make even the coldest of Michael Bay haters, smile. This movie had plenty of laughs provided through dialogue with the turtles (especially Mikey) and Vernon (April's partner). The choreography for the fight scenes were also VERY enjoyable to watch. The movements were smooth and fast and fit the 6 ft, ninja turtle, in a half-shell perfectly. These scenes truly shine when it comes to the Shredder moments. The turtles, although missing their friendly appearance, are also pleasing to the eye. Each character model looks like it the creators had taken time to learn the personalities of each of the brothers and mold their build to fit exactly that. This is very evident in the case of Raphael who is just a monster of a turtle but in a very good way. The only real,few, down sides to this film were the pacing. It seems like your stuck watching April deal with her struggling career for an ungodly amount of time and in all honestly its just completely uninteresting. On that note Megan Fox, who is beautiful to look at (you'll see this referenced through the film constantly as well) was such a dead character in this movie. She felt dry and painful to watch. I'm not sure if she was really trying but if she was she may need to find a new career. The plot to the film also seems a bit rushed and forced in at parts. Don't get me wrong their is a completely different take on the turtles and a couple little surprises that were a breath of fresh air but a lot of the back story and character building is lost in favor of action scenes. (In their defense these action scenes did come out very nicely). IN the end like I said don't go in with a negative attitude or your just going to waste your time. If you truly give this movie a chance I promise you, you'll enjoy every minute you spend with the turtles. Here's hoping that they continue with the franchise and make a sequel starring Bebop and Rock steady and maybe even a krang arc.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
248,mounirabbas,good but uh!,7,23 December 2015,"i don't know how to put this but um!!!! , it should've been the greatest box office in this year but it lack a lot of stuff it was more like selling tickets and making money off of it not making a kick-ass story, it just as regular movies these days,fights and explosions that's it. i hope second sequel will be much more enjoyable than this,not a downfall this brought. but my rating for Megan Fox 9/10. otherwise it's nice movie with family and especially kids who loves Turtles i mean Ninja's Turtles and in second movie which will be released just a couple of months i'm really looking forward to it and see what they've changed,first one was good but it has soo much potential to becoming blockbuster with all animations listed movies that topped the world wide records in the last few years. hope u enjoy it or at least try for ur own kids sake lol and let's be ready for 2 movie. finger crossed!!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
249,mattslim333,The rubbish i thought it would be.,2,14 December 2014,"This being a TMNT movie, I thought it would be a bit stupid, but not so stupid the film becomes a farce of the franchise. I don't feel the comedy in the movie works well, and the jokes don't come over to the human characters. Another problem was the sheer amount of pointless back story. The turtles are so bogged down in this some of them lose there characteristics, whereas the humans have zero back story.The only way the movie redeems itself(slightly) is through the CGI towards the end of the film. It makes the action feel real, even though the film is about ninja turtles. This being produced by Michael Bay, we can expect this, however I feel the rest of the film didn't live up to this, making the film shocking and lacking in any real plot or involving elements that make movies good.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Just reminded me of my childhood days when we used to watch it as a cartoon.You can watch it once, nothing great just a fun time with kids. Story was OK with OK acting. I hate when they shake the camera while action is on with animation running. You cant enjoy totally whats happening. lots of camera shakes to give a real look but fails.Oh God, cant think of what to write as there is nothing much to say about this film.

251,jackgradis,The Turtles have run out of Gas,4,9 August 2014,"Let me start off by saying that while I am not the biggest TMNT fan, I loved the TV show as a kid and still have good memories of the first live action movie. When I first saw pictures of the Turtles, I was worried. Why are they so huge? Are they trying to make them aliens? Then I heard not only is Micheal Bay producing, but Megan Fox is starring in it as April. So my expectations were very low to begin with. I was wrong about one thing; the Turtles. I bought the CGI, and their back and forth and chemistry was exactly what I wanted. That is the only positive for this movie. The human cast, led by Fox, is boring, goofy and like in Transformers movies, overly analyzed. The villain, Mecha-Shredder, has no personality or motivation for his evil. Also, the plot has some odd similarities to some other movies(The Amazing Spider-man!!!) and the action is not fun to look at. All in all, the kids will love it, but casual viewers and especially Turtles fans will be praying for it to end.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
252,CoolKid23,Turtle Power,7,7 August 2014,Let me just start off by saying that I went into this movie not expecting much given this movie was already made when I was a child. Everyone around the time of the 90's loved Ninja Turtles. When I first saw the images of what the turtles looked like I was really thrown off. They went from Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles to steroid pumped reptiles. Luckily their bodies fit in with the story line which I applaud that the new producers did not just change the entire purpose of the Turtle franchise. The old school turtles were kind of laid back besides the orange one which we know always made jokes. The new turtles are revved up killing machines with no need for an introduction. The acting was good enough for this type of action movie but it was nothing to write home about. Megan Fox has become that girl that's always in the action movie just to look good. This movie was a good action film but it won't really make you ask for a sequel. I am sure there will be another two or three because that's what Hollywood is doing now a days. Don't go in expecting too much and you should enjoy yourself.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
253,chilichilipepper,Grab your popcorn and that pretty much sums it up,6,12 August 2014,"TLDR at bottom. There's a lot of fan boys trashing this movie however, it achieved what it was going for. It was made for the new generation of 10-15 year oldsOverall, the theater I went to was packed, with both people my age (35-40) and kids (10-15). The adult's weren't thrilled about it, but it's not a one star ""OMG THEY RUINED OUR CHILDHOOD"" film that so many people like to post as reviews. This film was for our children and the young people in the crowd loved it. It is purely a summertime popcorn film. Lots of action, pretty weak storyline, little character development, but overall it succeed by bringing TMNT to a new audience of the next generation. Point and case, before I went to see it, I had my kids (12 year old boy, 10 year old girl) watch the movies I grew up with. They weren't really that impressed asking why they were wearing rubber suits and such. Meanwhile the older movies hold a special place in my heart, but seeing it through their eyes, it is obvious that they are a little dated now.They LOVED this movie, and that's the main point of this review. If you are someone that is trying to relive your childhood or search for continuity, this movie wasn't made for you. It was made to introduce our children to the brand, and on that, this film 100% succeeds.In retrospect, when I saw the first Live Action TMNT I'm sure my parents thought it was a horrible movie, but to me it was amazing. Difference is, nowadays, parents now accuse Hollywood of ""ruining their childhood"". If you go into it with that attitude, then yes, you are going to hate it. If you go with your children, you will actually get a taste of your childhood if you watch it through their eyes.It's a popcorn movie for sure, which is what 10-15 year olds want. The whole film was designed for a 10-15 year old mentality of the new generation. So in general, your kids will like it, and if you just want to share the experience, watch it through your children's eyes because this film was not made for us as I said earlier. It was made to attract a new generation of fans to TMNT. And although there are a lot of flaws in this movie (and for everyone who thinks the first live action ones were back in 1986 were awesome well, they were pretty full of flaws too) However, those flaws don't matter when you are younger.So grab your kids, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the movie for what it is : a way of introducing your children to something you loved at their age. After all, now they enjoy the older movies and cartoons (for another example after the movie they asked me where Casey Jones was since he was their favorite character in the originals.) It's fun to now share something I loved, that before this movie my kids just quite didn't see the appeal.TLDR : The movie is designed for 10-15 year old children to introduce the new generation to TMNT. If you are expecting reliving your childhood, you'll complain that Bay ruined it. If you watch it through your children's eyes, you'll realize that it indeed was made for them, just like the old cartoons and movies were made for us when we were their age.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
254,Pjte,Perfect for fans,10,15 September 2021,Anyone who grew up with the teenage mutant ninja turtles should enjoy this. Amazing to see all the characters come to life and I ended up liking some characters even more than I did from the comics/cartoons!,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
255,yelsinnestfort,Characters,6,7 May 2020,"I like Michelangelo the short turtle, he the most interesting part of the movie for me. The heart or kindness is Micheangelo and it's what this movie needed more than anything.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
256,JMT-Studios,You really should know what to expect by now,6,7 August 2014,"Here we goSo Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the reboot to the ever so popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman for some reason and produced by Michael Bay, also for some reason.. You all know the story by now. 4 mutated turtles grow up in the sewer raised by a giant rat who knows martial arts and trains them so they can protect the city from Shredder. No difference in this movie.So the movie opens up in sort of a graphic novel type animation telling the story of the turtles which I'll admit was a nice nod to the original source material from which Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came from. From there we meet April (Megan Fox) who's trying to get a story about the evil foot clan that have been terrorizing the city. She then witnesses the turtles stop them and follows them to get evidence of their existence. The turtles stop her and return to their master who says they need April's help. I won't spoil why. From there they must work together and stop Shredder from releasing a toxin on the city.I wanted simply one thing from this movie after all the crap I've seen from it over the last few years. I want the turtles to be the turtles. I want them to reflect how they were in the 2003 cartoon preferably. A darker take but still humorous and likable. I grew up on that and the 80's cartoon and 1990's movies. Thank the lord I got that. The turtles are the best part of this movie. They deliver some funny lines although not everyone of them hit. Like you can feel that the jokes were modeled for kids which the whole movie is basically. It's like a big toy commercial. Or a Crush soda commercial. Or a Samsung phone and tablet commercial. Yeeeeah lot of product placement in this movie. Very obvious at that. Anyways as for the other characters we have April O'Neil played by Megan Fox who was alright. I really wish they worked on her dramatic screams though because those were just awful. We also have Will Arnett as her camera man who I guess is supposed to be the comic relief in this movie but literally does not have one funny joke in the whole thing even though you can feel you're supposed to be laughing but I didn't even smirk. It was like watching a stand up comic bomb his performance. Splinter was an enjoyable character. You could really see how he tied this family together.Now if there's one thing I like in a movie it's a good villain. Did I get this? No. No I did not. Shredder has no character to him at all. In the 2003 version of him he got all this character development and I learned the motivation behind why he did what he did. In this he's literally just a guy who wants to make money. Or at least help Eric Sacks (William Fichtner) make money which is a very stupid motivation in my book. Usually villains steal money for the purpose of something bigger but in this.. they just want money. Which Eric already has because he lives in a freakin castle on top of a mountain! How much more money does he need?! Sigh.. Shredder was just so one dimensional and uninteresting. I was so let down by this.Well what about the effects? They're actually pretty good. They did make the turtles sweat a lot though. Like A LOT. But it looked nice so I was happy about that. One downside is the CGI went down a little when interacting with humans. Like in Transformers 4. Not much to say other than those two things because I didn't focus on it much.One last thing and I know every reviewer is saying this but it can't be said enough. The climax of this movie literally is the end of The Amazing Spider-Man only in the day time. Seriously watch The Amazing Spider-Man before you see this and see how similar it is. It's crazy.Going in if you know this director and producer you're not expecting anything amazing. I went in with extremely low expectations and they surpassed them but only very very slightly. I give it a 5.5/10. The theater had a bunch of 10 year olds who thought the movie was amazing so at least they hit their target audience. But as a long time Ninja Turtles fan I left disappointed and wanting a little more. If it earns back the money maybe a sequel will be better. It won't but a guy can dream.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
257,mippin,Not much here,1,11 February 2020,Well I went into this with no expectations and an open mind. I started watching and boom whoopie goldberg was on my screen and I had to shut it off. That automatically makes me not watch so no review here.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
258,vincent_tillema,Surprisingly fun!,6,29 August 2014,"Many words have been spoken about how Michael Bay would tear trough the Turtles as he did with Transformers. Many hours have been spend discussing how this movie would be complete and utter crap. How Megan Fox shouldn't be in it. How explosions would ruin it. How basically everything would go wrong.I'm not going into that here. Instead let me just draw this to a personal perspective. You see, I am a TMNT fan. I was that little boy back in the early 90's that identified himself as Raphael. Who called his dad Splinter and who, when his youngest brother was born, told his grandmother the boy's name was Michelangelo which caused great confusion. In other words: the cartoon TV series was my childhood and although I had some comic books somewhere in my room I was just drawn in by the series and by the toys. Flash forward about 20 years, and that is still my nostalgic little idea of the Turtles: cartoon and toys. I haven't seen the latest series. I don't like the style: its something for this generation, not mine. So yes: I was skeptic going into this movie. Who wouldn't with Bay's track record? 2 hours ago I stepped into the theater expecting nothing. What I got was not a great movie. It was however a movie that did capture the goofiness of the 'original' Turtles and delivered quite a few laughs. It does a lot of things right: being goofy, referring and mocking other superheroes, great Turtle designs, being lighthearted, great chemistry between the Turtle bros, and forgive my bias but Raphael...just wow. That's not to say it is without flaws. Far from! The biggest flaw is already evident for me now. I just got back home and I don't even remember what Shredder's big evil plan was all about. New York isn't really portrayed as a living, breathing city. Instead it is filled with cardboard people who just pass along anonymously. Add to this the lack of urgency in Shredder's plan and the result is a story you just don't care for. Shredder has another flaw: he basically is a dude in a life sized Swiss army knife costume with no real connection to Splinter. Changing that back story was unnecessary. Lastly: the movie is a bit too clean for my taste. I prefer the gritty 80's/90's vibe the comics and the first movie had.Then again: that vibe was typical of the era. The whole 'dark city filled with 80's punk rock thugs' vibe movies like Terminator, Predator 2 and the likes (including the first Turtles movie) had is long gone. Besides: Shredder's plan sucked, but we're talking about a guy one of whose first plans in the cartoon was to destroy the Turtles by sending pest-control robots at Splinter...It is not as if he has showcased any great intellect in the past. Take this movie as it is: a simple joyride not to be taken too seriously. Expect just that and you'll be enjoyed. Go the Turtle-fanboy path and you're bound to be disappointed. My inner child was satisfied!As for the sequel: a better story, less flirting from Mikey, introduce Bebop and Rocksteady and have Shredder be more down to Earth. Flaws aside, this was a nice step in the right direction for these Turtles!7/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
259,alex_howells92,A 'Turtley' Awesome Movie,8,28 October 2014,"I used to watch the cartoon when I was younger but I wouldn't say I was religiously into the Ninja Turtles when I was growing up. I do feel that this film isn't as bad as critics said it was and I think it lives up to the cartoon pretty well. After reading some other reviews I picked up that quite a lot of people are saying its as bad as Micheal Bays Transformers franchise, but don't worry, its really not. Fair enough it does have some over the top action scenes and bit of a ridiculous story but what do you expect from a plot involving four Mutant Ninja Turtles protecting a city from a clan of evil ninja's. Its going to reasonably over the top. Anyway, Some of my favourite things about this film were - * The actual Turtles, They weren't all the same character just with different colour masks. You could see that Leonardo was obviously the leader and played the samurai role, Raphael was the bad-ass rough guy who's bit of a brute, Michelangelo was the comic relief character and then Donatello, who personally was my favourite, was the smart nerdy one with all the gadgets and toys. I watched this in 3D and felt they all looked very life like and believable so the mo-cap tech worked very well. I know some people have been saying their to ugly, but what do you expect, their mutants. You can see from the fist time you see the Turtles that their bond as Brothers is strong and will play a big part in the film and even their relationship with Splinter is shown very well.* Master Splinter looked amazing, hes pretty ugly but he is a mutant rat in fairness. apart from looking amazing his role in the film is great, You can easily see he is the Father to the Turtles but also their Protector and coach by raising them and teaching them. You can see when they first introduce him he isn't afraid to punish them for doing wrong and can be quite strict. * I really liked the Turtles home in the sewers, I heavily reminded me of how the sewers used to look back in the cartoons and in the previous live action movies.* I quite enjoyed Megan Fox in this, She wasn't the same annoying, but nice to look at, girl we see her as in Transformers and I liked how they kept her yellow jacket like she had in the old cartoons.* The action scene on the snowy mountain was surprisingly better than i expected, i thought the choreography was really well done and I'm not a big fan of 3D but i thought this scene look amazing, the detail was perfect. There's not much i didn't like in this film but there were a few things i think could have been done better such as-* Shredder, He was pretty much just a Samurai in a mech-suit, it looked cool, but i was hoping for a bigger back story and to flesh him out a bit. Hopefully in a sequel he can play a bigger part.* Eric Sacks seemed kind of pointless, He didn't really do anything and felt like he was evil for the sake of being evil. I didn't think he had much of a story to him.Overall its pretty good, It is what it is, a film about mutant turtles fighting ninjas to protect their city. I think if you have an interest in over the top CGI films with pretty good characters and an entertaining story like I do then you should give it a go. Im hoping to see Beebop and Rocksteady in the sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
260,www-hiall,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Best or Worst movie ever,6,1 September 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles isn't all that bad. This movie does a lot of good, good origin story, good acting, and fun scenes. This movie does have it's fair share of bad elements. 1. Splinter's teaching. Splinter is a good guy proved by the TV shows and comics, but in this movie he comes off as weird with his motives. He wants his sons to protect the city of New York by stopping crime, but prevents them from going to the surface, so how are they supposed to save the day. He also is weird in how he teaches his sons ninjutsu perfectly from a how to book. 2. The Shredder. This guy is the main Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain, who is scary for his actions and personality. In this movie however, the real Shredder is seen like twice and never again, unless in his armor. The only thing that is scary about him is his armor, and this shouldn't be the case. This movie gets a Worst movie ever for the fact being Splinter forbids his sons going up top, bur yet he can get Domino's pizza in the sewer.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
261,Providenceyaway,This movie really opened my eyes,3,14 September 2014,"to just HOW HORRIBLE Michael Bay really is! I saw this movie with expectation of ""hey, maybe they won't ruin the story's legacy. Maybe they won't take a dump on such a good name"". I was wrong. I've been waiting for this movie since I first heard it, and i was utterly disappointed. The movie had more focus on Megan Fox's April O'Neil more than anyone, trying to make a connection from her to the turtles like nothing else, calling her a ""Great Spirit"". They should've actually called the movie ""The April O'Neil Movie"", that would've been more honest. I used to like the transformers franchise for it's action and plot devises, now i know WHY transformers TV fans hated it, too much human focus. You don't write a Superman story focusing on Lois Lane's part, so why would you do it with 5 different movies, Michael? WHY?!? A friend of mine told me Transformers 4 was made exactly the way it was for the Chinese audience, and because of it it got #1 over their. You now gotta wonder if they did the same with the rest. The point is, if you really feel bad about April, and you really want to get to know her story, the side the cartoons never wanted to exaggerate on (dumb writers!), and waste your money all at the same time, then go. Enjoy.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

265,furtherdownfilms,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Review,5,30 December 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) A Review by Nathan FischerI have been a fan of the Turtles since I can remember. They were probably the single most important pop culture figure of my childhood. So it's great to see that 20 some years later, the Turtles are in the peak of their fame. Its just a shame that this movie, although polished and entertaining, left out the charm of the Turtles that made me love them so much. The film follows a pretty formulaic plot, which is to be expected. After all, this is a kid's movie. Shredder and a corporate tycoon are banning together to take over the city of New York for reasons that aren't very clear, but who cares, Kid movie. The Foot Clan are here, who aren't ninjas, but more of mercenaries. They like shooting and blowing things up more then kicking and punching. So it's up to the turtles to cooperate as brothers and save the day with super sexy reporter, April O'Neil (Megan Fox). Surprisingly, I think Megan Fox was the most refreshing thing about this movie for me. I never liked her all that much, but aside from being beautiful, she is very likable in this movie. Determined but vulnerable. Will Arnet keeps the dialogue light and funny as O'Neil's sidekick and William Fichtner does a passable job as being the slimy villain.But lets talk about the Turtles. First off, I don't mind the way they look. I kind of like the style they went with. What I don't like is how they are so one-dimensional. I know, I know, kids movie. But the 1990 film, although it was still giant talking turtles, made you care about these characters. You felt tension between Leo and Raph. Mikey was funny and endearing, and Donatello was someone that I wanted to hang out with. I may be bias because of nostalgia, but the 1990 version focused not only on the honor of being a ninja, but the importance of family. It taught kids a positive lesson. Watching this version, I found myself hoping that they would throw in some down time, but that's not how blockbusters go these days. Granted, the action is very well done and the snowy mountain scene was spectacular. But the turtles are bullet proof and 7 feet tall? That's like four hulks. How does anyone stand a chance? The shredder is also monstrous in size and totally metal so he stands a small chance of course. I did really like splinter. I felt that they portrayed him well and even gave him the spotlight in some very cool action scenes. But I guess this is just how the turtles are going to be now, wall-to-wall action, a dash of heart, and maybe a lesson to be learned. But probably not.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
266,ColeMan88,"Fun For Kids, May Disappoint TMNT Fans",7,10 August 2014,"'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' is about aspiring news reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) who is looking for her big break in the news industry. After attacks from a criminal organization known as the Foot Clan take place, April snoops around and is taken hostage by the Foot Clan. After being held hostage and being saved by the Ninja Turtles, April must team up with the Ninja Turtles and cameraman Vern (Will Arnett), to take down Shredder and the Foot Clan. TMNT is directed by Jonathan Liebesman and written by Josh Appelbaum.There was a lot of skepticism on if Megan Fox was the right role for main character, April O'Neil. Honestly, Fox did good in her role as April O'Neil. It was nothing special, but I think it will be better than what people were expecting. Probably on pace with her performances in the 'Transformers' movies. Will Arnett was Will Arnett, goofy. He was a fun character, while a little unnecessary he served as a more comical role alongside of Fox. William Fichtner plays Eric Sacks, an evil owner of a corporation who is working alongside Shredder. He did an okay job in his role. He was not terrible, but he was not very good. Overall very average acting, but it's a Ninja Turtles movie. We are here to see some TMNT action right?Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello all looked really cool. The CGI was bit spotty at times, but nothing too bad. Almost like a XBOX or PS3 game, but a little better. However, Splinter had some terrible CGI work done and it just looked awful. This can all be overlooked though, as this film is action-packed and a lot of fun. One thing I personally liked was all the personalities. They are all still the fun, pizza-loving turtles that everyone knows and loves.They stayed true to the original and maybe even added a little heart to certain characters and I really liked that. One thing TMNT fans should know is that the Foot Clan in this film is much more evil than in the 90's films. This is probably for the better as it adds to the suspense.This film felt very rushed. A lot of things happening at once and you are left wanting more. There is never really a huge moment that makes you feel as if the end is near. With that being said, that does not mean it was not a good time. This movie was a lot of fun, especially if you are a TMNT fan. There is a ton of action and people will love that, but there needed to be a little bit more. The cinematography was shaky at times, but when it was not it was average. The score was okay. The costume design was good. The Foot Clan costumes were great, they stayed true to April's signature yellow jacket and of course we can not forget how good those turtles look.One thing TMNT fans may get turned off by is the back story of how the turtles and April came to be. It is definitely a lot different from what the fans know, but it can be good in some fans eyes I guess. The directing in of this film was not very great. As stated, it felt very rushed and fans may get turned down by the overall story of how the turtles came to be. The screenplay was not terrible, not not great by a long shot. Honestly, this film is geared more towards a younger audience, with some adult intended humor thrown in, and I know kids will love this TMNT movie just like those 90's kids liked their TMNT movies. Ultimately, this is a very fun, action-packed film, however there were some pretty bad aspects that may or not be able to be overlooked by TMNT fans. This is going to get some pretty bad reviews from the critics, but if you go into the theatre looking for a good time, you will get one. I believe with a directing adjustment and more advanced CGI a sequel could be a good thing for this series. Right now this film is headed for a huge week at the box office and if they want to continue this series, there needs to be adjustments. TMNT received a 7/10 stars from me, at least that is what my inner TMNT fan is telling me. However, from a critic standpoint, I would give it a 6/10 maybe 6.5/10 stars.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
267,tfbowler314,Poor movie,2,21 August 2014,"I just saw this at the drive in and it was a waste of time. The special effects were OK but I didn't like the physical features for characters for one thing. Splinter looks more like an anteater and shredder just looks like a robot transformer. The acting was so awful. The 1990 TMNT is so much better. I didn't like the storyline at all. The turtles' faces looked like frogs. This is a movie only kids would enjoy. The fighting scenes didn't look brutal. It looked like play fighting. The movie looked more like watching a video game. The cast who played the animals should have gotten into real costumes to play the turtles and splinter. This movie should never have been remade.

This movie is a really good movie. Yes it has it's holes and problems with story structure but overall it's fun and enjoyable to watch. The action is awesome, the characters are funny and the acting isn't great but decent. The film moves to fast and not enough time for the characters to know each other well enough. The CGI of the turtles are fantastic. Cool kids movie. They will definitely love it. Also the 3D really shows in the movie. Go see the movie in theaters.

269,jagarcesnevarez13,The Cliché of the Year,6,9 August 2014,"Yeah, I've seen some episodes from the old Ninja Turtle's series, and this movie absolutely becomes a fool, after the great action scenes and the comedy lines, this movie has an obvious starting and ending, showing the typical ""Indestructible Ninja Turtles"" failing for first, but I have to admit, that I like the super Ninja movements they did at the time of fighting.Well, Megan Fox is, as usually, the pretty girl that is loved by one of his friends, who in fact, ends being important in the movie, and she's obviously connected to the Ninja Turtle's born story, as predictable.When I saw the Turtles, I told myself ""I don't think they can look better"", because is not normal to see turtles that looks as humans, even worser while they're fighting like ninjas.The thing is that, the funny lines and the unnecessary action makes it incredibly acceptable, but, knowing the TV shows, it is a rare fail, but a great movie.""Yeeeaaah, we'll fiiiind yoooou!...

271,BronnFlakes,"An overall average TMNT film that is, at least, pretty watchable.",6,27 December 2016,"I'm a 31 year old guy who grew up on the old TMNT cartoons, games and toys of the 1980s and 1990s. I'm heavily nostalgic for the old TMNT series, and I wrote this movie off the very second I found out about it after its announcement.Fast forward two years, I still hadn't seen it. I heard online that it was garbage (but, of course, the internet has a habit of saying that about everything) and people I know in real life either said it was a little disappointing or just average.After deciding to give the movie a go when I was looking for something to watch on Netflix, I was actually pretty surprised by the movie. Granted I went in with absolutely zero expectations, but still! I didn't feel that, in any real way, that this movie was awful. It's not great and it has a lot of big flaws, but it's not terrible. As a longtime TMNT fan, I didn't quite like how the turtles in this movie are so intertwined with April's past. I also felt that Leonardo and Donatello were criminally underused in this movie. Both had as much personality as the cardboard boxes their pizza comes in. Michaelangelo didn't get to do much, but his goofy and fun-loving personality was definitely evident. Raphael ended up being way more hot-headed than he should be, and I feel like the writers put way too much attention on him. Raphael had the most screen time (and lines) of any of the turtles by a significant margin, and for no really valid reason. Late in the movie when the four turtles believe they're about to die, everyone but Raphael throws out a quick one- liner. What does Raphael? He spews out a long monologue about how he loves his brothers and his own deep insecurities. I didn't really like this aspect of the movie. Way too much attention on Raphael.Shredder in the movie looked goofy. Much like in Bay's Transformers movies, Shredder here suffers from a case of his design being overthought. As a result, his ""costume"" just looks very cluttered and messy due to them trying to cram way too much detail into it. They should've gone simple, like in the old cartoon or even like in the movies from the 1990s.Megan Fox was surprisingly okay in the movie. Of course there were MUCH better choices for April O'Neil, but I feel that they did a good job of downplaying Megan's sex appeal here and making her a pretty legitimate character with aspirations, goals, and an actual personality. She wasn't really here for the T&A for once, though there was that one scene where Will Arnett's character was checking out her butt when she was hanging out of a window. I've been critical of Megan Fox before and I've never liked her as an actress, but I felt like she was actually pretty likable in this movie (and you can't really blame her specifically for April being shoehorned in as the main character, which was a misstep).William Fichtner, one of the most criminally underused actors in Hollywood today, did about as well as you could hope with the material he was given. His acting and delivery was 100% solid, but his character's ambitions seemed kind of murky and poorly thought out. His whole end game was just to make a lot of money and to get ""stupid rich"" even though he was clearly insanely wealthy to begin with.There are a lot of negative points above, but I still thought that this movie was okay and was very watchable. I liked the personalities of Michaelangelo and Raphael, some of the action scenes were well done, and Splinter (despite looking a little weird) had some great moments. The final fight was a little anti-climactic, but I didn't mind that too terribly.Overall, an average movie. If you go in with an open mind and zero expectations, you should be able to find this movie to be pretty watchable. It won't end up being very memorable, but it might entertain you for most of its running time.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
272,sashoh,A little bit disappointed,2,31 August 2014,"From the beginning of this movie you can clearly see that this is Michael Bay movie. If you've seen the transformers movies, then you would know what I mean. I starts with some hint of nice story, but then...it fails to deliver. The story itself is...not very intriguing. They also strayed a little from the original beginning of the turtles which is very adequately portrayed in several cartoon adaptations, but why change it in the movie...who knows, maybe some genius though it would be better. Well...no! This is a portrayal of a cartoon classic and if you want it to reach the fan base of the classic, you make it stick to its roots and what made it great, not take chunks of what you like and throw away the other stuff. Shredder, wow I didn't think I'd see Optimus prime in the Turtles movie, but I guess I was wrong. The whole time I was watching Shredder, the only words that hung around in my head were ""WTF""!!!!!!! Seriously, WTF was this !?!? This was what blew me off in the trailer, but I was kinda hopping it wasn't gonna be true or be just for a small/tiny part. WRONG ! The acting - well you know the actors, you should be familiar with what they're capable of. April's role in the movie, was just being there and making it harder for the turtles to complete their job, seriously if she wasn't there, they'd be better off, but I guess this is as far as the thinking of the role was - nuisance.Overall I give it a 5, just because of the jokes, animation and seeing what a buffed up steroid induced turtles would look like (yes, I'm especially looking at you Rafael - you just gotta stop with the damn anabol)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

When people see this movie try not to forget you're watching Ninja Turtles!!! Not Citizen Kane. And go in with an open mind, don't already hate it because Bay is involved. Now about the film, the turtles look great! Best ever in my opinion, and their fight scenes are also the best ever. More flipping and weapons and stealth than ever before. They even have the turtle van!!I thought Knoxville as Leo was kinda weird when I first saw the cast but I barely noticed and got over it quickly. Megan Fox was fine too. I didn't go to the theater to see April O'Neil so I don't really care who plays her. It just gave whiny fan boys something the complain about. I actually wish the film was longer, seemed too short. But during that hour and a half I had a grin on my face the whole time. I don't really understand the view of critics because they will bash this and say turtles that are ninjas is stupid, but at the same time praise Guardians OTG on how brilliant a raccoon is?... They are irrelevant though. See this movie! Even the biggest Turtle fans will not be disappointed, unless you're stupid. Bay actually came through in the end.

It was a fun summer movie that did a great job of staying in the spirit of the original turtles with a modern twist. Megan Fox's character was played very well and the film is generally very family friendly. The turtles were funny and the movie is action packed. The final hour of the film is every bit as action packed as any of Bay's films. The middle of the film slows a little as they explain the history of the turtles, etc... but its all necessary to explain the story to a new generation.I recommend this movie for people who enjoyed the original turtles films. Bring your kids, they will enjoy it. My daughter (who likes action movies) laughed multiple times at the turtles as they make a lot of silly comments and the scene where they rapped in the elevator was especially funny.Go see the film and take it for what its worth...its silly fun with a bigger budget than the previous films.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

It uses April O'Neil as an anchor for ""normality"", and does a spin on the cartoons' story of her father without going into too much detail of it. She is featured prominently in the movie, just like in the old kids comics. The main feature is however the turtles' back story, them as a team. The heart of the story is them reconciling their differences, the exact theme as the story has had before; but of course with a modern twist.Enough of the old was in with a splattering of new.But still, the most important elements are the following: The action and the jokes.

280,ZombieFlanders,"Not as bad as it could have been, but not enough effort behind it either...",5,6 September 2014,"I'll just get it out of the way and say that if you grew up as a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you probably should indulge this film at least once. If you're a film fan who didn't, it is pretty average to poor and offers little, even for a summer blockbuster. This has Michael Bay-isms all through it (banal scripting, video-game sheen, blatant sexism and product placement – the movie is basically a Pizza Hut ad at times) and even if he didn't direct it, he might as well have. And, if you're a kid (specifically a boy aged 10-15), you should definitely lap this cgi- fest up just as Bay planned. If you fall into neither of those categories, there is no reason what so ever to watch this movie even in the context of a kids/family action film.Even if you do fall into one of them, you cannot escape the overwhelming half- heartedness that nags the film. It leaves you wanting more – especially as a fan – as if the whole production is only behind it because it CAN be made, not that they really wanted to do it. Bizarrely, it cruises along at only just beyond 90 minutes. A good half hour shorter than most modern blockbusters. Perhaps an extra 30 minutes may have made it even duller, but it possibly could have given us a little more of what we wanted too. That would mainly be the Turtles themselves. Actual combat is thin and seems to take a back seat to more screen time for a miscast Megan Fox's April O'Neal. The turtles have their moments with some genuine laughs and camaraderie retained for old school fans, but then there is laughable dialogue and terrible characterizations to counter anything that was good or fun. These are the Ninja Turtles for the iPod generation and sometimes it's a little hard to swallow. A massive set piece involving a lot of things sliding down a mountain is a confusing centre piece, but exhilarating nonetheless. Shredder is here to act as bad guy, but he should be called Mecha- Shredder as he looks like he was left over from Bay's Transformers franchise, and not in a good way. It all adds up to something that looks more like Playstation 3 territory than a film.I won't deny it, but there are a couple of moments when you're almost glad, as a fan, that this movie has been made (!) A fun sequence of their origin as told by Splinter to O'Neal and a couple of decent nods to the original film and comics come to mind. Plus I don't care what any hardcore fan or non-fans might say, I think they look great in a ""let's try and re-invent the image"" kinda way even if they're basically just stereotypes of all those brainless gym junkie tattooed ""men"" that exist today (you know the type). Raphael is way too big to the point of distraction though. How the hell does a sewer dwelling mutant turtle get as ripped as a wrestler exactly ? I'll say they got the voice cast pretty right too.Unfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of Jonathan Liebesman's film seems to be the undeniable fact that when the credits roll, missed opportunity and forgettable are the first words that come to mind. I thought it might at least offer something for a guilty pleasure re-watch. Not really. Perhaps an inevitable sequel will remedy some of that. If it doesn't plan too, maybe just forget about making it as I finished it simply wanting more and I thought that was going to be the least of its problems. If they're willing to give Guillermo Del Toro (Pacific Rim) and Gareth Edwards (Godzilla) squillions to handle such things, I just wish this one didn't cross Bay's desk and landed on someone else's of their ilk. It might have all been worth it then. As it stands, unless you're a pre-teen, or going in for purely nostalgia reasons, you won't find anything really redeemable.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I'm sure the comic book junkies are outraged. Just bypass this movie sit at home and watch the first two.I have to do 10 lines about movie that's almost about nothing so here I go.

This one reached my expectations, but was more enjoyable than I would've thought. I would say the worst part is the protagonist's oblivious reaction to everything. She looks drugged, or is it her normal reaction to overwhelming? Though she nailed her voice somehow. She's pretty much useless and could've been replaced by one's turtle curiosity. But she's good looking so it automatically attracts the male viewers, amiright? the second worst part is the laziness of animation, not that it's bad animation, but it's easy to tell when they decided to hide the animated character to save money. For the rest, the humour is light and pleasant and the whole plot is interesting. though I'm sure that movie is made for younger people. the soundtrack was forgettable and the antagonist was bad-ass (maybe too much), a way to make me like a villain. Everything was well timed. Good in general, but I think I just need to not take that movie too seriously.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

And don't even bother with the ""you expect too much"" stuff. If you just want to enjoy a brainless action movie with memorable moments and repeatable lines, go see Guardians of the Galaxy again. Somehow, beyond all reason, Michael Bay took a story about anthropomorphic turtles who fight a man who wears a box grater and a brain in a robot suit and made it even dumber. I want the last two and a half hours of my life back. I suppose since I did have a few good laughs heckling the first half (before I gave up hope and started looking for sharp things to slit my wrists on), I can at least look forward the the INEVITABLE Rifftrax commentary.I give it a 2/10, and that's only because 1/10 is specifically and forever reserved for The Last Airbender.TL;DR - If I had terminal cancer that would shrivel my head into a raisin, and the only known cure was watching this movie a second time—I'd probably see this movie again.

286,bushidoie,Really poor live action adaptation of the original,4,28 July 2015,"It's just a turtles movie, right? Low expectations? Well, sadly for this cheesy cash-in, we already HAD a turtles movie, way back in 1990. So, 25 years later, they try again, and somehow, somehow, managed to make a WORSE film? Pretty sad.The original had a real feel of the turtles oriental origins, Splinter felt genuinely wise, Leonardo was portrayed with a samurai's demeanour, selfless, reflective and dedicated, and Donatello, Rafael and Michelangelo were western without being generic or boring.I feel like this new crack of the whip is aimed solely at New Yorkers, little kids, and controversially, African Americans. Some of the references and attitudes are sickeningly forced, pandering to an intended demographic, and I'm going to guess it swings pretty wide of the mark even for those in that demographic. I disliked the actor voicing Michelangelo, even though he was actually good in Battle:Los Angeles. The entire cast of voice actors just dropped the ball, Michelangelo was the worst because he was irritating, but Donatello was overly nerdy, he didn't have a single line that wasn't babbling geek-talk. Big Bang theory's geeks have more depth, they could have learned something from that show. Leonardo was so generic and boring, nothing of the leadership, no spirit of a samurai, just a generic New Yorker. Rafael wasn't too bad, but Splinter was another let-down, he wasn't wise or mystical or intriguing.As for the story, is there one? I mean, the Saturday morning cartoons at least tried to establish a premise, in 20 or 30 minutes. I don't think I could give spoilers if I tried, the big danger, and the need to save people, is so watered down and lacking in any form of impact that you can literally miss the plot completely. Not once does it actually become relevant to the action on screen, and there's so little reaction from the characters.I watched Transformers and just took it as a goofy movie, low- expectations, cool visuals, nice robots. This film managed to be worse than Transformers. The turtles didn't even look good! If the voice acting was endearing, and the turtle animation looked good, I'd probably up the rating by a star, because this is 25 years later, we should have excellent turtle character models!Anyway, I've rumbled on long enough, I barely made it through the movie, I took 3 cracks at it over meals and spare time, I couldn't watch it over one sitting, it was just too boring and unengaging.You want to see a Turtles movie?

All these people giving it horrible reviews aren't taking that into consideration. Adults weren't the filmmakers' target audience and that is very apparent. Still, I was thoroughly bored with the thin plot, horrible character motives, less than par CGI and terrible fight sequences and acting.

289,infernalaffairs1980,Turtle Power?,7,2 November 2014,"OK, so I went into this film with both excitement and trepidation.I was taking my daughter to see a film which was based on characters I had watched and loved when I was her age. Now, I know the original 1990 film was hardly an Oscar contender, but for a young child it was the right mix of action and humour. Would the new version be a load of crap? Mumblings from other reviewers had been less than positive and that worried me. However I wasn't going to be put off so it was away to the cinema with an eager 9 year old girl in tow.The plot is simple; four teenage mutant ninja turtle brothers must face the evil Shredder in order to save New York. See, how uncomplicated is that? Of course there are other elements to the story but nothing overly convoluted which is good seeing as the film's 101 minute run time is already crammed with action sequences and plot devices. The scenes speed into one another; We meet Eric Sacks (William Fichtner) and establish his relationship with April, then in the very next minute, he is meeting with Shredder and discussing their evil plans. Nothing is given a chance to build up, questions are answered as soon as they're asked.There are also unnecessary links between the characters. Without giving away too many spoilers, the writers (Josh Appelbaun, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty) have tried too hard to establish a shared history. While I can understand why they have attempted to do so, it does not add anything and should have just been left alone.The main action sequences are stunning, especially the downhill chase that has featured heavily in the trailers. Jonathan Liebesman has directed effects laden movies before (Wrath of the Titans and Battle Los Angeles) but this is probably his best attempt so far.The turtles do not have equal screen time, with Michelangelo and Raphael receiving most of the attention. Also, I was a little put off by the fact that Leonardo was voiced by Johnny Knoxville. His voice is too recognisable above all the others (even Tony Shalhoub who I thought did a good job as the voice of Splinter). Apart from that niggle, there is a great relationship between the turtles (and the rat).Megan Fox was not awful as April O'Neil, yet she wasn't that good either. She spent too much time being the object of various lustful comments, and not enough being the fearless reporter she is supposed to be (taking photos on a phone does not make you a journalist). And Will Arnett's character is next to useless; I'm hoping that they bring Casey Jones in to the sequel.As a reviewer, I should probably abhor this film, but as a movie lover, I walked out of the cinema having enjoyed it. Yes, the humour is immature but this is a children's film for adults. There are several references that will be certain to go over younger heads yet they can enjoy the fart jokes and physical comedy.So, was my trepidation justified? A little. But the child inside me couldn't help but love it and I am actually looking forward to a second helping.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
290,pmn923,A bad start for a Franchise,2,31 August 2014,"This movie is terrible, and what is worse, is saying that they are going to make a franchise out of this. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) has NO REASON TO EXIST, NONE WHATSOEVER!!! It's badly enough that they want to make as movie after a semi-successful series, but it is downright insanity that drove Nick Movie Studio's Michael Bay, and John whatever his name is who made the crappy sequel to Clash of the Titans, to acquire the movie franchise to dig it up from retirement, only to murder the franchise and then parade it's body like a F%&*king Parade float.But surprisingly enough their is some things, in this movie, which gives it higher than a 1/10, and that is the personality of the Turtles themselves, they can be funny, but then they can also have vague humor. Will Arnett is completely miscasted in this film, he sucks in it, he makes this movie worse. And Megan Fox (while having the look of the Character) still did a bad job, she just like her other films, has no emotions, and that is just terrible.The Villain Shredder, is boring, and Eric Sachs is their for no reason, only to have William Fichner in the credits, but the thing that get's me the most, the thing that pisses me the F^&k off is saying ""we are going to make a franchise out of this"" what the *Bleep* this movie made a horrible first impression, for a franchise, are you kidding me, me a big TMNT fan, had no fun watching this piece of S&%t movie at all.The Foot Soldiers are Soldiers with Machine Guns, did they realize that the swords, cannot stop them, did these foot soldiers watch the original films, and think F&%k this, i don't want to get beaten to a pulp, let's use guns, because that is totally what people want in a ninja Turtles movie, foot soldiers with Machine Guns.

291,christianstauffer,Don't do it (seriously),3,27 November 2014,"I'm not one of those fans who freak out when a movie takes certain... liberties adapting a beloved franchise. If Michael Bay turned the Turtles into aliens instead of mutants, I would have raised an eyebrow, but - assuming the end result was a fun film - I couldn't have cared less.Also, generally speaking, I like films from Michael Bay, and I don't care that they're mostly about blowing stuff up. If that's done well, it's fun.So I wasn't in an overly worried state when I went to see TMNT, even with all the negativity, and I was even ready to give Megan ""I don't know how to close my mouth"" Fox a shot, even though I can think of 12 ladies that would play a better April O'Neill than her. I was in for a night of mindless Turtles fun.And boy was I disappointed. The story ... obviously I don't expect that much story, but here it is: Turtles come to the surface, Turtles get captured, Turtles get rescued, Turtles stop Shredder. There is nothing more to it. Now Transformers didn't exactly surprise with tolkienesque story telling, but at least there was something going on. The Turtles themselves are somewhat likable and distinguishable, but there isn't enough of it. There were so many opportunities to include the banter between the 4, but most of them were not made use of. The other characters are plain boring. Shredder has a total of about 5 lines in the film. And then you only see him as bloody robot. Sometimes less would be more. A more original, sinister and deadly shredder would have been a lot more interesting than this... anonymous hunk of junk metal.The fight scenes are plain boring, and Megan Foxes performance is simply cringe worthy. It might be because of her lines as well. Shocking enough, even the special effects look like something from 10 years ago. And there's a lot of CGI, in quite a few scenes there is nothing alive on the screen. The final fight scene was the last straw. I've never seen anything as pointless and boring as that.You might be intrigued, feel free to watch it. But don't come to me complaining. And if at some stage you think about leaving and only stay because you think it will get better and something cool will happen: It won't.Bottom line: That was 1h40 of my life I'd like back. I give this 3 stars, and that's not because I'm a disgruntled hardcore fan, on the opposite. If this was a generic film with unknown characters, I would give it only 2 stars. This gets one undeserved extra star just because Turtles are still bloody cool.If you want Turtles, watch TMNT (2007). It's not a fantastic film, but it's so much better than this crap. And if you want a mindless, stupid, ridiculous movie that doesn't make sense and where stuff constantly blows up, watch the GI Joe films. They were a lot of fun.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
292,KevinReal310,Dissapointing remake,6,22 May 2020,"I remember having Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures along with a toy Technodrome. I stopped watching that TV show around the time Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came on TV. Those earlier episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that a lot of us remember when we were kids have long since not aired on TV. There were also a couple of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games I remember playing as a kid, like the 1989 Arcade version along with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In Time for Super Nintendo. I played the 1989 Arcade Version as recently as 2006. My friend had the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for Gamecube I think, and it had the original game. It was also at that time where the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a newer series from 2003-2009. Now, I think kids today are familiar with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I think there is a newer version of that show since 2012 which I haven't seen. We also remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies from the early '90s, where a lot of the action in those earlier movies is slapstick humor along with the turtles being played by people in costumes rather than CGI effects we are used to nowadays. They would later make a 2007 computer animated version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which I only saw once and didn't like it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
293,unimatrix972,A movie potential that got wasted,6,8 August 2014,"I was never a big fan of TMNT, but the concept was always a unique one. Instead of the far east style of mutual cold looks and ""Yaaa!"" yells, while the tough good guy fights a cruel enemy, you get these ""karate kids"" who are in fact mutants and they fight the almost super-human villain. You get the tension of they having to hide in the sewers as they are still being feared by us - regular people - and the realization that as much as we admire them we also want them on the research table. Add to that the character of April - a journalist who finds herself in triangle of conflict (up yours Louise Lane!): a journalist who uncovers secrets, the confident of the turtles and (in a way) the role of the mother, who would rush to danger to help them and protect them. This could be a great platform for a good deep movie heavily spiced with great ninja action. But instead what did we get...1) An absurdly idiotic storyline which kinda gives you the feeling that the story writing was revolving around the already shot action scenes.2) Action sequences which appear to be copy paste from transformers and only replaced by turtles (I don't count shredder as he always looked like a robot).3) The role of April is basically something I would put in ""Little Pony"", which is reduced to nothing more then a brain dead, incoherent (she's a goddamn reporter for crying out loud!) and basically doesn't contribute anything to the good cause.On the plus side: 1) It was nice that they emphasized the uniqueness of each turtle beyond the color of the head band. Their entire gear is crafted to their different personalities.2) In the past movies or TV series they were always turtles fighting in human style, in here for the first time they make use of their physical turtle attributes.Bottomline, this movie could have been so much better, and it feels like it was a wasted opportunity. a reboot I might watch, but if there is a number 2 on the way, then yeah...I'm not giving it another 2 hours of my life.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I loved the Turtles growing up, the first 2 movies were great, and while I have not watched the new cartoons, I still saw the 2007 cartoon movie because I grew up with these guys. I of course had reservations (Michael Bay only does over the top action movies, the Turtles don't look the same, Megan Fox as April?), but I knew if a studio spent millions putting them back on the big screen, I had to see it.The dialogue may be poor at times but the action scenes are great. All the fight scenes showcasing the Turtles, Splinter and Shredder are some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.The core story about brothers learning to get along and deal with family issues, while loving and trying to protect their father, is still the same as it always was, which means it's familiar but also looked at in a different way.Like I said, if you love the Turtles you'll love this movie, as they have a bunch of throwbacks, classic lines, jokes that span many ages and a decent story.As someone who has seen all 4 earlier movies in theaters, there's a chance this could be the best one.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I just wanted to be entertained and I knew that Michael Bay productions are always fun and high quality. So I just decided to go watch that movie without much expectations and finally, I was just blown away. It's a great action-comedy movie that definitely understands what it is - an entertainment. The director mastered the shots and the way the scenes are taking place - particularly the introduction scenes. The script is really good (no surprise when seeing who wrote it - aka Amazing screenwriters), they never take it too seriously which is awesome! I had the feeling to watch one of these great movies I was watching as a kid, those 80's flicks that knew how to tell a fun story and keep you surprised until the end. I really fell in love with that movie - of course it won't get an Academy award, but let's be honest, that award is really overrated now, we prefer watching an awarded movie - aka a very often boring movie talking about the same things over and over - than a great entertainment movie. Respect to the cast and crew, finally Megan Fox is back at the top and that makes me more excited to see her in some future movies. It's definitely a movie that got mastered and you should definitely watch, not thinking too much about the reviews or whatever, it's a movie you're going to enjoy and like very much!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
296,txmayer89,You know what you are getting with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014),7,4 December 2014,"Before I start, I would like to say that while I did watch the cartoon series, played their games, and watched their first movies, I do not consider myself a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Not that I don't find the concept interesting, because I do, but I usually found myself enjoying the X-Men and others more so than our four friendly turtles.Regardless, while not being a big fan, I decided to take the dive into this movie even with the mediocre reviews. When I came out of it, the film was almost exactly what I expected it to be. Let me explain. I knew, going into the film, that it was a Michael Bay film. That aspect of the film is prominent and often. I also knew that the turtles were going to be CGI, and lo and behold, they were. I actually thought they looked really good, and I enjoyed the fact that they all had subtle differences that helped them stood out as individuals. I went into this film, just looking to have fun, and I came out being pleased with what I saw. I knew this wasn't going to be a great film, by any means. But for mindless action and fun, this movie is exactly as prescribed. I also found the performance of Will Arnet to be absolutely hilarious.However, there is one part of the film that degrades to film to the borderline of a good movie, and an okay movie. That part is Megan Fox. She is just simply not a good actor. And to make matters worse, she shows up in almost every single scene. They would have a cool scene where Splinter was making the turtles do some intense meditation. It was cool to see their dynamic, and they were, of course, a lot of fun. However as soon as you go back to Megan Fox, who is either constantly complaining that no one believes about her turtle friends, or trying to over step her job description and be too ambitious, and does this in a very unconvincing fashion. In a sense, I understand the reason for her being casted as April O'Neil. She's a big name, and she's known as one of the more attractive women in the world. However, if the producers knew that there would be THAT much of her on screen, I am surprised they didn't take it in a different route. I could think of a dozen, or more, actresses who could have better filled the role.All in all, I think when it comes to seeing this film, you know what you are going to get. You are not going to see a movie that will revolutionize film. You are seeing it because of two reasons. The first, you are looking for senseless action and a lot of fun. In that regard, the film hits a home run. The second reason is you are trying to watch your favorite turtles. I think the film does a great job in representing them, their differences, and I thought the guys playing them did a good job in charisma. However, I wasn't keen on Johnny Knoxville as Leonardo. So, all in all, if you are going into this film knowing that it won't be the best, you should enjoy it. However, if you are looking for a movie filled with great acting and an emotional story (or the original story of TMNT, they do rewrite a bit), then this film is not for you, especially if you aren't fond of Megan Fox as it is.6.5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
297,george59883-36-312142,Strange,4,12 October 2014,"This movie is just strange. It has some things that are going for it, but just as many things that are trying to weigh it down. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is enjoyable sometimes, but can't balance its comedy with its drama with its action.The voice acting is good. Nothing is really special and nothing really stands out. Megan Fox does an okay job with what she is given, but as the script goes on becomes more and more of a damsel in distress even though she began as a character trying to find something. Her character just isn't written that well. And Will Arnett is just annoying. His character is simply there for comic relief and is there so that she has a ride. He simply can't feel like a real person with the writing given.I do find the turtles as the one shining thing in this film. I like how each of them do feel different and can actually be recognized from each other. They each feel like they have personalities, but their characters are so unbalanced in their writing that they create a lot of laughs as well as some oddly timed ones as well.Not all of the dramatic moments hit me in the way I believe the film was going for. I just didn't feel connected to the story at all. The writing is so horrendously bad that I don't even understand how they came up with it. The story is also filled with several coincidences that make it feel unbelievable.I do think that the CGI is impressive, but it doesn't always mesh well with the real world and sometimes feels out of place to me. The directing is okay, but doesn't have any distinct flare. The action is shot well, but sometimes it feels overdone. Sometimes less is more.I can't recommend this because I just can't find the story interesting enough and most of the characters are just as bland. I am giving this film a 4 out of 10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
298,pilkkari,So you like the turtles? A blockbuster without blocks to bust.,4,2 November 2014,"This movie will not satisfy your turtle needs. It clumps up a bunch of characters from the old turtles lore and gives it back as a crap smoothie. And that's why the movie made me angry.The action sequences (when they happen) are mostly wobblycamera nonsensical. The turtles' different characteristics are not really explored until the end of the movie, but then it's too late to make an impact on the plot.The acting is.. well wooden or cgi, and the plot is oversimplified. And that's saying a lot for a 90's pop phenomena that basically had no sense to begin with. But they manage to merge 10 characters into about five to save screen time.If you want to see a better turtles movie, watch the 90's ones. If you want to see a good ninja movie, watch anything else.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
299,peterlov,Unwatchable peace of .... cinematography!,1,4 December 2014,"This movie is so awful, that I have decided to review it, to warn other people from watching it. I need to say that as a kid, I was a huge fan of TMNT, but what they do to them in this movie is worse that what the mutagen did to them.First the appearance: the New Turtes look like some zombie monsters, they are ugly and huge, something like the clone between the nice TMNT from my childhood cloned with Godzilla. Maybe this is, what the kids of today want to see, who knows. Shredder looks like some Decepticon from Transformers movie mixed with bird, as he has some kind of steel feathers / knives at at the end of his hands. It is unbelievably ugly what they did to him too. Splinter is the ugliest of the all, so no further comments.The plot: they changed everything now, so Splinter didn't learn his martial art skills from his master but from a BOOK !!! Yes he just found a book in sewers and learned martial arts like that in no time. And Aprils dad worked in the lab with mutagen, and knew the Turtles and Splinter and rescued them when the lab burned down. The connections between the characters are really unbelievable, so prepare yourself for more logical nonsense, but never mind it is a movie for kids.The jokes: they are none. The Turles of my childhood were all about fun and jokes, the Michelangelo was always the funniest turtle around, but as he grow 3 meters tall in this movie, hi became boring. So there are almost no jokes at all, just Godzilla sized turtles packed with muscles. The only joke is that the turtles are bulletproof (yes really), so that is quite funny really.The movie is boring as hell, if you can, don't watch it! But maybe your kids will like it and you could buy them some ugly toys which are gonna be on sale soon. That is why this movie was made for, or not? Cowabunga!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
300,the_match_maker,Paint By The Numbers Fun.,6,19 July 2015,"In truth, this telling of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' is a prosaic 'paint-by-the-numbers' telling. It hits its plot points without unnecessary clutter, and it follows a standard issue narrative thread. And in truth, that's not a bad thing.Far too often movie adaptations of comicbook/cartoon properties are just bad. Too many changes are made for the sake of change, the property itself isn't treated with any respect, etc. This being the case, an instance where an adaptation is simply 'average' is actually something to be glad of. I'll take an average 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' over a bad 'Catwoman' any day.While the turtles as characters lack anything other than the most overt of character traits, they are at least the right character traits.April's characterization (if not her look) seems to be acceptable. The 'hungry' reporter who wants to do more than just 'human interest' stories.What's more, the cameraman/sidekick to April's character actually adds something to the film with his presence. In fact, one might say that he's the most well rounded character in the film.The plot itself is nothing that we haven't seen before. But that's OK.Really, the only aspects that don't seem to jibe are the addition of certain characters to the origin story of the turtles, and the troubling crush that one character has on April.The bottom line is that this film could have been worse. And while that may seem like damning it with faint praise, it is at least praise.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

302,dacookielad,"A fun, yet flawed film",5,14 August 2014,"So I went into the theater with little expectations. I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to movies so I honestly completely ignored any complaints from fanboys before I saw it. It started off with a decent direction, the main characters had cliché problems(seemingly underachieving protagonist being stuck with doing lame jobs, with a laid-back partner) but it started to pick up when the action started.As the film progressed there were more and more cliché characters(like a roommate that does absolutely nothing to the plot other than a one-liner of ""Mom, I want to move back home again""), plot holes, and horrible plot devices. Then I realized something. Despite all of these flaws, I was having fun watching these humanoid turtles come to life.It didn't try too hard to be like the original 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it didn't try too hard to be like a superhero movie, rather it was almost like a parody of superheroes. There were lines involving people mocking the idea of turtles as ""superman"" or whatever, and these kinds of things are stuff that I could appreciate since the original comic book series itself was a parody of Frank Miller's run at Marvel(Including Daredevil, Wolverine, New Mutants, etc.).Megan Fox did decent in her role, I mean it was way better than how she was in Jonah Hex. April O'Neil wasn't a damsel in distress, in fact she was far from it. There was also a slight alteration to the origin story and the connection between the turtles and April, I won't go into detail but I will say that in my opinion, I actually really liked this new origin story.Anyways, if you're not the kind of person that thinks too much and you want a movie that you could just sit back and enjoy this film is for you. The turtles were great, the visuals were pretty awesome, and there was several humor to keep you entertained.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
303,dgrv75,A good piece of fun,5,5 November 2014,"So, by the title and the Michael Bay production name, you should already know what to expect. I went in expecting a bad fun movie, bu instead, i was well surprised. Not by the action, or the fun ( the effects are ILM kind of good, there is nice, though over-cut, action), but by the fact that it was actually a smart blockbuster. Not Dark Knight smart. By a league. But as in ""with nice jokes, playing with the rules of the genre (kid-friendly, bad guys/good guys simple narrative, full blow-up show), and without the usual bad lines. A lot of lines were aware of the context, the references, and played with that. The characters were actually nice. Oh, and don't forget what kind of material this stems for. In that sense, this movie was a nonsense fun, well made, but mostly well written movie. So all in all, I was extremely pleased with the result and didn't feel taken for a stupid no-brain human consumer. As a ps, I actually like the director. I think he does very good entertainment. Most time, i see people get disappointed in movies because of the expectation. so expect action, jokes, and a well oiled fun machine.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
304,reputederror-1,Compare to old TMNT? Well here is the deal...,5,5 January 2015,"I gave this movie 7 out of 10 due to a few areas that needed changed. Now I have read all the reviews of everyone comparing to the original turtles and before seeing this movie, I was one of those. So when a family member bought it I thought, ""Here is the chance to watch it without paying for something I may hate."" Now taking that into consideration and that people seem to think Megan Fox can act. I mean come on (Transformers). She would of been a change I would of made. The CGI was okay but they made the turtles look weird. Their heads were really shaped to small. They looked like they would scare little kids. Splinter looked like he had a boars head. Not really rat looking IMO. Now the cons out of the way, I quite liked it other wise. Their was humor in the movie that you would see with TMNT. The CGI made the fight scenes awesome. They did make the turtles have super strength. I know die hard TMNT fans compare but really it is dated and with todays technology this seems more viable. So I suggest you watch it and make your own opinion about it. But go into it without comparing, this movie (Besides the things I stated above) deserves a chance.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
305,prism9,Half-assed turtles,8,29 October 2014,"The Turtles look OK. Except maybe it would've been better if they had a bit less wear and tear for lack of a better word. Between the four of them it looks like they've already avoided the end times several times over. Oh and they're a bit big. As characters they're way too exaggerated and 1D (in that regard they remind me of One Direction). I mean when did Donatello become THAT nerdy? He was just as much a source of calm. A voice of reason. When did Raphael become THAT sulky? He usually had some attitude and was confrontational, but this was way over the top. When did Michaelangelo become SO lame? No nunchuckles here. Leonardo was alright if only from being quiet. Will Arnett did a good job of adding some comic relief. Better than when the Turtles were trying. Shredder is way too bulky, but at least he's Asian. Points for that. Splinter should've been too. The 'new' origin story was OK, with some nice referencing of biotech, etc. but falls short in the sense of the relationship between Shredder and Splinter. This was one of the more engaging aspects of TMNT for me as a kid. Shredder was an emotional, vengeful wretch. I didn't get any vibe from him at all in this, except that he's menacing. Megan Fox as April was OK, though she did disappear into the movie as it went full Baytard. After a while I felt like Mark Wahlberg was in it. PLEASE don't let him be Casey Jones! The whole back story was fast-forwarded through, but the way April was weaved into it was actually great. All in all and unsurprisingly, the movie tried to cover too much ground and was too reliant on action sequences. TMNT was always as much about sentiment and fairly slow- paced by today's standards. Last but not least, I hated the score. Again, overdramatic, 1D, etc. I'm not expecting much from future efforts, but I'll definitely see them.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Well, it satiated my thirst of comedy and action. Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and of-course sen-sei Splinter all were superb in this movie.Megan fox is so beautiful and Will Arnet just make me laugh even more and more. Awesome CGI and awesome effects to be honest. Yes, the antagonist is not that awesome but i still would give it a 10 hands on for the other characters.

I recommend 1990 TMNT movie...Is all of Hollywood that blind? 1000's of people making it can't tell how bad it's going to be? Someone said ""this is great writing""? Someone watched this 100's of times while editing, and screening, and they were OK with it? No one thought the CGI was awful? I also thought they had ugly faces, and the overall appearance was poor. Worse looking rendition of TMNT I've ever seen. A CGI house presented these to the movie makers, and they OK'd them? yuk Story: Lack of real characters. What was the role of the Karai character? The movie spends 10 minutes on real plot, and the rest of it is fluff and useless scenes... Take the scenes with Whoopi Gioldberg... All those could have been cut, and the movie would have been better.Seemed like they couldn't make a choice... try to make the turtles look more ""real"" (which makes them ugly), and then they do all this physically impossible action... one way or the other, eh?

309,kurtsinteff,One Can Still Wish Can't They,5,8 August 2014,"First off, I absolutely loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a kid. I went into this movie with low expectations, not expecting this movie to be really good or extravagant. I walked out will the long *sigh*. I really wanted to like this movie. I was still optimistic after the backstories changing, the design of the turtles that I wasn't a big fan of, and I just couldn't do it. This movie was a mess. To start, Shredder was not a good villain.Now, I love the Shredder but, He had no character. He was more of a big, burly guy that they had to get through to get to William Fichter's character. Splinter looked terrible and wasn't a wise, master. He was more of a guy who just disciplined the turtles. The only reason any of them even knew ninjitsu is because Splinter picked up a book about ninjutsu and taught himself. Also, this movie as a whole only happens because Megan Fox stumbled upon them on a rooftop.This entire movie is based off of coincidence. The only good things about the movie is the turtles and how they interact with each other, and an action sequence down a snowy mountain.The only thing this movie did well was the interaction between the turtles. Flawed still, they felt like the turtles. They still changed their personalities a bit. For example, Donatello is a talks like a stereotypical nerd, and Michelangelo is always making remarks as to how he thinks Megan Fox is hot. Raphael is hard, wannabe rebel. And Leonardo doesn't really do much at all.I still realize that this is a childish movie. But, children deserve better than this. This movie was pretty bland and bad. I would really recommend this movie to anyone.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The story is tweaked a little to make a little more ""sense"" of things but let's face it...they're TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES! Don't nit-pick. Could've used a little more of the turtles in there youth, but an hour and 40 minutes just isn't enough time to do that. All in all it's hilarious. It has action. it's 4 awesome looking turtles kicking butt. Please don't go in theaters expecting to have a Dark Knight performance, because then you will be disappointed. Have fun with it!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
311,itclark64,Ridiculous is in the Title,7,9 August 2014,"With a concept as ridiculous as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you can't expect a complex plot, deep characters, or anything to make sense. This movie knows it's ridiculous and embraces it. The advance is continually reminded of how crazy pubescent deformed martial arts reptiles are. Cool adrenaline filled action scenes and juvenile humor make it a perfect fit for its target audience. If you're a Ninja Turtle fan there are a ton of references and fanfare to satiate your pallet. Not a great movie but it's entertaining enough and probably my favorite Ninja Turtles movie.I was never a huge fan of the Ninja Turtles. I wasn't allowed to watch the show as a kid, because my parents thought it was too violent for my young impressionable mind (they were probably right). I grew up in the 80's and the Ninja Turtles were unavoidable. I can't tell you how many of my friend's birthday parties were Ninja Turtle themed complete with pizza and a Ninja Turtle Cake. They were everywhere; on TV as a cartoon, in toy stores as action figures, and in theaters as three feature films. It's understandable that a lot of people my age, grew up with the Ninja Turtles and have an emotional connection to them. Having said that there is a certain nitpicking that goes on in nerd culture whenever there is a reboot of a beloved franchise. The Ninja Turtles were a pop culture phenomenon, not the Bible or Shakespeare; both of which have been adapted and modified by Hollywood multiple times. So any of the changes this new movie made to the lore are minor in my book. The movie is in keeping with what a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie should be about and it does it better than its predecessors. The characters are all there; Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Leonardo. Everyone has their favorite Turtle and they each get their time in the spotlight, both character wise and in action scenes. None of the characters are very deep, this is mainly a movie for kids after all. There are times when it tries to get more heartfelt and it feels out of place. The strongest emotions I felt during the movie is when they let the Turtles just be themselves and be juvenile and silly. They are funny if you appreciate that type of humor but they can kick butt when they need to. The other standard characters are there too; Shredder, Splinter, Vernon Fenwick, and April O'Neal played by Megan Fox. As attractive as Megan Fox is she's still not that good of an actress. Lucky for her, this part doesn't require much range and she does an adequate job pulling it off. Her character is definitely the weakest link in the story. They try and center too much of the plot around her and tell the story from her perspective. She's just not that interesting to carry the movie although, if I was a teenage boy I probably wouldn't care...she is attractive. I can't imagine that there is a person out there that would fit the demographic for this movie and has never heard of the Ninja Turtles but if they do exist then the action scenes alone are enough to entertain. They are bigger than life and are just cool to watch. Nothing groundbreaking but they let the Turtles show off their ninja skills well. Every time the Shredder shows up expect things to get crazy. It did feel like they forced some of the scenes and half the plot was just a setup for the next action set piece. All in all it was a pretty decent popcorn flick. There was plenty of references that went over my head but I'm sure they will keep fans busy speculating until the inevitable sequel. I wasn't expecting much but it was better than expected.SPOILERS! OK, let's get a couple of fan rumors out of the way first. Eric Sacks played by William Fichtner is not the Shredder, as was rumored. He is a totally separate character. Yes, Shredder is wearing some type of Japanese power armor but it looks cool and isn't really that far off from his original look. The Turtles are not from space but there was a mention that the mutagen that was used to create them was. All in all not the travesty that it was rumored to be beforehand. There were a few things that I thought were silly. I really don't like how coincidental it is that April O'Neal knew the ninja turtles because her dad created them in a lab when she was little. It just feels like they are forcing her to have a bigger part in the story than she deserves. I was never really clear on the Turtles origin story, this one makes more sense than the previous movies, but the fact that they learned Ninjitsu from a book is a little weak. Splinter is supposed to be this master martial arts expert; are you trying to tell me that fight in the movie was his first real fight in his life outside of training the Turtles? There was also some pretty glaring potholes in the movie. First, why didn't April show here boss the pictures she took of the Turtles instead of sounding crazy? Then in the very next scene she shows that picture that is clear proof of their existence to Eric Sacks. Second, the bad guys plan doesn't make sense. Why would they dispense the gas from the top of his own tower? Wasn't his ultimate plan to make money off of selling the cure? Did they think that no one would notice that bright red gas coming from the top of his corporate tower? Plot holes and weak characters didn't ruin the movie for me though, I kind of expected that.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
312,katie_d_photography,90's kids will love this movie! Might contain SPOILERS...,7,2 January 2015,"Im confused on what exactly people were expecting. Is this movie Oscar worthy? NO! Wake up and get off your high horses. This reboot of a ""classic"" children's show was a fun one. It takes a different and refreshing spin on April and the turtle's relationship. Although I will admit that the over use of ""heavy breathing"" sounds from Megan Fox got under my skin. I thought she did a decent rendition of the news reporter. The fact that each turtle resembled more of their personalities instead of 4 identical green suits with a different colored face masks was a nice touch as well. Lets not forget to mention the GREAT Tony Schlub as Master Splinter. Even if he was just a voice, his presence made Splinter even more witty and fatherly. Over all with great graphics, more in depth storyline and the frequent humor. I would say this reboot won over my 90's kid heart. PLUS my children sat down and watched the whole movie. That in itself was a miracle lol",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
313,ianjwood-73912,Lacks the humour that the turtles would normally bring.,6,17 October 2016,"Watched this with a couple of knuckleheads, we voted, ended up watching Turtle's.To start, I absolutely love the old Turtle's live action movies, they're really funny. Which gives the remakes a hard act to follow. I'm unsure how I feel on how they've changed the turtles, making them massive creepy half human turtles. It takes a much more realistic approach, weather it's good or bad I can't deliberate. If I had to compare the turtles from the 1990's movies and these ones, the old ones would edge it. By what they had to work with back then, they did really well. With what we have now, they did alright, I understand it must be hard to make a live action turtle that isn't creepy looking.Megan fox works as a great piece of eye candy, when she's bent over out the window of the car, lord have mercy. As April though, ehhhhhhh, not very fitting for the character. Considering it's a Turtle's movie, it lacks humour, the action is great though. It's a good adaptation, I'd have preferred the original origins, like any turtles fan, but by no means is it bad. If they added a lot more humour and better casting, it could of been a lot better.The biggest flaw I would say is Shredder, he feels like a massive robot, rather than a very powerful ninja. I don't like that all the characters seem to have quite big changes or altered origins, it takes a lot away from it. The majority of the target audience must be the old Turtles fans, and to change such big details, it hurts it's rating a lot. If it wasn't for the nostalgic factor, I'm not sure I would have watched this movie, it seemed so generic. I'm glad I did though.62%http://afilmadaykeepsthedocaway.blogspot.co.uk/",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
314,michelgizy,"Some parts good, others not so good",4,30 May 2021,"I want to be nice on this film, I really do. But...there are so many things wrong with it that I can't possibly give it a good score.Let me start with the positives. There are some scenes that don't make this film entirely awful. Like the snow fight scene, or the elevator scene, or the camera flash thing. The turtles are...somewhat accurate in personality. The scenery is great too, and so are the fight scenes, but that's all the nice things I can unfortunately give it.And now we get to all of the problems that don't make this film work. The designs of the turtles, Splinter, and the Shredder are just...no...why? Only Leo and Raph are decent, but Donnie and Mikey are really lacking and kind of uncanny. But all of them have the same problem: They're doing too much, it's like...tone it down with the clothes and accessories! And Shredder, he looks like a discount Transformer and it's just wrong. And Splinter is just off. I don't know what it is, but he just looks too dark. Leo is probably the best looking considering that he reminds me of Usagi, but even then, all the turtles are unnecessarily huge and bulky. Raph is okay, but it's hard to notice him sometimes in dark environments. Donnie...oh my god... I hate his design the most. Too much stuff on his shell and his body, he has goggles over his mask. And speaking of, what mask? Where is it? Oh wait there it is, behind unneeded glasses. Never mind how he gets a prescription, just give him glasses because we have to showcase he's a nerd! Mikey's face is just all kinds of wrong. They tried to make him expressive, but it doesn't work in his favor at all.Oh, but I haven't even touched on the fact that the turtles don't appear fully until like 20 minutes into the film! And it's filled with April and Vern shenanigans that could easily have been cut. There is a way to establish those two, but not like this.And the origin story, ugh. All of it just feels like a huge stretch. I don't know if it's because it's really convoluted or it's because they wanted to be different, but I am not into this origin story. The turtles and Splinter are lab experiments...while also being April's pets. Because sure, that's something that needed to be added. Just have a little girl in a dangerous lab and not have Hamato Yoshi at all. Even though that part is crucial and without it, the Splinter/Shredder rivalry is really pointless and has no sway.Eric Sacks' plan is just stupid XD He wants to be stupid rich, but he already is, so what's the point? And his character is basically taking away time that could be used on the Shredder. But no, let's have a backstory where we have him being Shredder's student even though the mentor himself is just there and give me a break!Most of the humor isn't funny, either. The dialogue for the most part wants to get a laugh out of you, but that only happens like...three times. Oh, and let's have fart and butt jokes, those aren't dead yet either!April takes up so much screen time that she feels like a main character. It's to the point where she stabs Shredder with a sai and then defeats him on her own later. Yeah. The turtles who are supposed to be the central characters in their first time on the big screen for the first time in years are there in like 60-75 percent of the whole film. And they get upstaged by a news reporter instead. I'm not against Megan Fox, I think she's okay, it's just the writing that is the issue.And even then, the action scenes and the turtles being there and like the two scenes I can remember being enjoyable right now...it's just not enough to save all of these problems. The origin story is just so jarring that it's almost pointless, especially since it does nothing later. We get like 10 minutes of it and that's it. The designs are awful. The turtles are not even the main focus. The humor is cringe-inducing. And the whole evil plot is just dumb. And Shredder is barely even in it that he feels like a background character. I'm not even kidding. Sacks has more screen time than the main villain of the franchise.It's not the worst turtles material I've seen, but it just reeks of wasted potential.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
315,pillskins,That didn't happen,5,19 December 2014,"Ridiculous.. Message to Mike Bay: Stay out of my childhood toy box. I can look past the turtles being giant for some reason but whats with changing everything about the storyline. So vernon fenwick is april's full-time cameraman now? Shredder and splinter never knew each other in japan? April knew the turtles as little pets and basically saved them and is responsible for their lives? Splinter learned martial arts AFTER he became a rat? Gimme a F%%&G break. So you put vernon in the movie but no erma, bern thompson or casey jones. Shredder looked and sounded like a transformer (shocker) The villain scientist's (i cant remember his name) plot was pulled right out of 1983. Poison the world and sell the only antidote, because we've never hear that one before. IT was just so thrown together, thinking the effects would make up for it. I found myself just bored, esp with the snow cliff scene. Megan fox is a good actress so she did what was required of her but it just didn't feel like a ninja turtles movie. The storyline felt so rushed, it had 0 folklore and nostalgia for the true TMNT fans out there. Eastman and Laird shouldve never signed off on this, if they still own the rights that is. I mean it sucked. And splinter looked F&%$G retarded, like a star wars alien, not a rat. There was no buildup to the foot's plan, their history, anything.

316,DeathWantsMore,Ignorance Level 99.,1,11 January 2015,"So I browsed some IMDb user reviews before watching this movie and amazed by a quantity of 1-star ratings, I thought, come on its just a TMNT movie, it cant be that bad, right? But it turns out that its even worse than 1 star...I don't know even where to start. I like the turtles design, they look pretty cool unlike those old nickelodeon cartoonish slug-turtles. Well, and thats about it.Now to the bad things.The story is just ridiculous. April saves turtles and Splinter from a burning lab only to bring them to the culvert and leave there on their own..!? Bullshit.Splinter is just a plain mutated rat, not Hamato Yoshi or even his pet. The question is - how the hell he knows ninjutsu? The answer is simple according to the writers - he found some old ninjutsu related books down in the sewers and mastered them to perfection in no time. Oh, he also taught it to 4 mutated turtles and they also mastered it in like 10 years. Sounds ""great"".Turtles seem to have super strength, destroying cars, brick walls and other huge stuff with little effort. They are supposed to be NINJAS not freaking HULKS, although Raphael looks almost exactly like Hulk from Marvel Comics... They also seems to be somehow totally bulletproof.Shredder... The pain. I would fire and then kill a person who's responsible for his costume. It looks even worse than some Chinese plastic figures from the 90's. Hell, even super Shredder from The Secret of the Ooze looks better than this trash can with a swiss knifes. And not to mention he's a 2-liner, he just said ""This city will be ours"" and ""Tonight I dine on turtle soup"", thats surely in top 10 worse developed villains of all time.Karai. I doubt I even heard her name once, but I assume this is Karai portrayed by Minae Noji. I think she only got slammed in the wall once during whole movie. Yes, that was her role.Eric Sacks. WHO THE HELL IS THIS!? Why they invented such a boring and pointless character? What is he doing in this movie? Working for Shredder to get money? He's living the dream in the huge villa, I suppose he already has ""some"" money, no? Like there are no other characters from TMNT universe which could participate in the movie instead.The Foot Clan. Is a joke. Just a masked mercenaries with firearms shooting left and right, nothing more to add.Action is there yes, but again, coated in such ignorance - any enjoyment just fades away after you learning a few things about this movie, action scenes becoming pointless to watch.Whether you are a TMNT fan or just a person who want to see a superhero/action movie - stay away, this is clearly not what you are looking for. This is CGI pop-flick completely ignorant to the roots of TMNT and common sense in general.1/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

When the movie was coming to fruition, I didn't want to spoil my memory of the cartoon & how much I enjoyed it so I didn't see it till just now. I really thought the movie would ruin it.

The action was virtually nonstop from the time the TMNT showed up till the credits rolled. Never a dull moment. And any scene that even looked like it was slowing down, they filled with humor!! Well done, well done! Great movie!! And I don't dish out 7's or higher like candy! Movies, for me, need to earn them! This one got a solid 8!!

I never get bored, I am not selfish, thankfully am a REAL Christian who woke up to the problems of pushing feminism into the church long ago with women going to church to find rich men who will give them babies and anything they wanted, things totally opposite of the Bible, as women and men are looked at as equal. Men being the head of the household and women submitting to them as their wife in love, etc etc. So now we get these movies that come out obviously directed at these problems of getting the family into the theater without any regard to the issues of conditioning them to accept anything Hollywood throws at them. I give it 5 for action and 0 for everything else. I am a single man, age 44, virgin and never been married.

319,soundwave86,This Film Was Great: A Non-Fanatical Turtle Fan's Review In Brief,7,9 August 2014,"I loved this film. It delivered exactly what I wanted to see. Was it perfect? No. But very few films adapted from comic books are truly done perfectly and in a way that satisfies true fans. There were just the right number of ""Hell Ya"" moments from the turtles. The action was great, the fight scenes were terrific and their character portrayals were bang on. Nothing will ever outdo the original 1990 film in terms of creativity and charisma for its time, but the action in this film felt so much more satisfying to watch. One of the best was seeing Splinter totally kick ass for the first time in a film. As much as I loved the wise old mentor archetype from the 1990 film, there was something totally awesome about seeing the radical rat brought to life like that. Meghan Fox? Totally passable. She gets more hate than she deserves. April O'Neil is always a damsel in distress character and Meghan Fox was as good as any other actress for this role. Her character was under developed but that's the writers and producers fault, not Fox's. My nod to her character comes from the fact that she wasn't relegated to merely being eye candy like she was in Transformers. The film came up short in the villain category unfortunately. Like many other folks have said, Shredder's back story was non-existent and the character was extremely underdeveloped. The shredder armour was over-the-top but we still got to see him fight in a more vigorous and robust way that previous films always left us wanting more of. In terms of changes to the original back story, there were plenty of artistic license moments but when you consider how many different iterations there have been on the original story - this film is no worse than the lot of them. While it feels unnecessary to always tie the characters together with plot convenient back-stories, its a forgivable alteration when you consider the film as a whole and what its trying to accomplish in terms of entertainment and that's where it succeeds. My only other complaint would be of the unnecessary inflation of the character of Vernon Fenwick. Just because they had Will Arnett in the role they felt they needed to escalate his presence in the film. It became old really quick. If less time had been spent on the character of Vernon and more on developing April's relationship with the turtles or perhaps the back-story of the villain this film would have been much better. In sum, this film was fun and I enjoyed it a lot. A solid 7/10. There aren't nearly as many reasons to hate this film as people will lead you to believe. If you're a turtles fan, go and see it; but with an open mind. Its supposed to be fun. Its okay to let yourself have a little.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
320,Tyler_Simpson,"The ""First Michael Bay Transformers Effect""",7,13 August 2014,"Before I start my TMNT review it'd like to give the reasoning behind the title. Back in 2007 I was amazed by Michael Bays Transformers with how visually pleasing it was watching the autobots and decepticons transform for the first time on the big screen, that and the fact that Shia LaBeouf was still alive. But a-lass 10 minutes into Revenge of the Fallen, I was already done with the franchise all together.Fast forward to 2014 and I fear I will say the same as Transformers.So after missing out on a SOLD OUT 730 3-D show, I went at 10 pm to a still filled theater 4 days after the movie premiered.The movie opens with really cool 3D visuals depicting the original turtles look from the comics as their comic book origin is revealed through a very visually pleasing intro.The film also did a good job at poking fun at it's self making numerous references to more serious superheroes such as Batman and SupermanThe turtles them selves look very good thanks to CGI and are a big improvement from the muppets fight scenes in the original.Michelangelo consistently made audiences laugh with his child-like innocence Donatello was nerdy Raph was angry And LEO WAS JOHNNY KNOXVILLE, which is more than enough awesome for me! And together the turtles hangout in their own smelly batcave in the sewers. Splinter was a badass until Shredder destroyed himAnd on that note, Shredder was a lot more intimidating but seemed too much like a body guard than a leader Now when it comes to human performances, Megan Fox does her best Shia LaBeouf impression but often comes off sounding dumb but they do poke fun at Fox and her career while exploiting her good looks for brief moments in the film. All while Will Arnett and Michelangelo try to nail her. Go figure. Overall the movie gave some laughs and provided some cool visuals to bring the turtles to life, but the story line was too much of a ""coincidence"" in the film, and fox just cant lead a movie with talking.I just pray the 2nd one focuses on the turtles and the story and not Fox and her body. As much as we love it",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

323,frenzy227,Criminally Forgettable,3,18 May 2015,"Speaking as a non Ninja Turtles fan, this film did nothing to change my mind about the franchise. I got more of an appreciation of the characters from TMNT, an animated movie from seven years ago, than this big budget blockbuster. The biggest problem is that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of the title are pretty much background noise. Megan Fox's April O'Neil gets the majority of the focus here. To her credit, Fox does her best with a severely underwritten part that gives her virtually nothing to work with. She may not be the perfect April O'Neil, but you can tell that she's trying. The turtles themselves, though they look impressive, are just objects in action scenes that fail to dazzle. The only time the film really tries is a single, static shot inside an elevator with the turtles dancing to a beat, which is the only time character shows in these two hours. The worst crime about the film is that it's completely forgettable. I forgot the majority of the film as I was leaving the theater. You'd think a movie about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would at least be memorable, but the fact that this movie left no impression should speak volumes.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
324,garrvanorden-378-358098,Worst Turtles movie.,2,9 August 2014,"I watched the new Ninja Turtles movie so that you don't have to. In the animated series, Splinter is a really cool character. He used to be Hamato Yoshi, he was a martial arts master, and was betrayed by Shredder. In this new one, he's just a lab rat who found a Karate book in a storm drain. There are no characters in this movie, so I didn't care what happened to any of them. The turtles aren't introduced until a 3rd of the way into the film. That strategy worked brilliantly in Godzilla because he's a monster. Here it doesn't work because they should be the heroes of the film. And here it doesn't even matter that they know ninjutsu because they're all giant, bullet proof, hulking monsters. Will Arnett's character, Michelangelo, and one scene in an elevator are funny; the rest of this movie is way too serious. And the whole time the music score tells you bombastically that everything you are seeing is just as amazing as a transformer. Go see Guardians of the Galaxy. It actually has characters, and wit, and charm. I'm not super surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping to enjoy it. I wasn't expecting high art, but I was disappointed that it was wasn't even as good as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993).",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
325,minibeech03,I can't take it anymore,6,9 August 2014,"I cannot take it anymore. No, I'm not referring to Michael Bay. I have no issues with him. He was nothing but a co-producer. What I can't take is how lovers of this movie can't see what was wrong with it. I'm a long time turtles fan. Born in the 80s, grew up on the TV show, seen all movies and series, and had many action-figures. This movie was disappointing. I'm not saying it's terrible and normally I don't really agree with critics, but this time, I'm inclined to. It simply wasn't that great. Here are the reasons why: 1 - This is the biggest mistake of the movie of which I still can't understand how they didn't realize it. The back-story/history between Yamato Yoshi and Shredder. There was no mention of Yoshi. Splinter was nothing but a NYC rat, experimented on with the 4 turtles. They escaped a fire and found themselves in the sewer. Why does Splinter have a Japanese style moustache and know everything about the shredder? Sacks mentioned a bit about Shredders rival clan back in Japan never went into details nor gave any indication that the rat was there or would've known anything about it. This rivalry is one of the main plot points in the history of TMNT and they took it out.2 - The Ninja turtles are the main characters in TMNT, not Megan Fox. She had way more face time than any of the turtles. I can't even think if Leo of Donnie had more than 10 lines.3 - Yes 3D is neat, but it's been years since we've developed it. Watching the massive overuse of close-ups and slow motion 3D was almost as painful as the slow motion action scenes in the last resident evil movies. I read one critic review mention around 800 close-up shots of Megan fox's lips. He could be right.4 - The plot was completely generic and unoriginal. Evil man wants to release Bio chemical weapon so he can be the hero by selling the cure, making billions of dollars. Yeah, that's never been done before.5 - Mutagen is the cure for everything? Let's pretend I buy that. Why does Donnie require eye glasses? Along with Donnie's glasses, a list of other things that made little sense. Splinter teaching himself Ninjutsu from some dirty book he finds in the sewer, somehow becomes some ninja master capable of fighting the Shredder, because remember, he's not Yamato Yoshi like he's supposed to be, nor did he have him train him as a pet rat, like the old 1990 movie did. The amount of times Shredder threatens to kill them, the amount of chances he had, yet he does not. Shooting blades from his X-men style silver samurai armour(that fly back and reattach by the way) while fighting splinter. Then just punch-stabs him once and tosses him down. Later fighting Raf, threatening to kill him. Just cracks his shell and walks away. The ridiculous fight scene, consisting of a semi being drive down an extremely steep, snowy mountain side. Not once coming close to losing its balance or crashing. With the turtles sliding down the mountain on their shells, keeping up with the speeding vehicles and staying ahead of the avalanche they cause. April trying to convince her boss of these human-sized ninja turtle teenagers. She actually has a decent photograph but doesn't show her and gets fired. Tracking Aprils GPS deep into the sewer. Normally many cell phones lose service just by being in a basement, let alone 50 feet below the surface. Wireless signals don't go through solid objects so well, especially the ground and dozens of feet of concrete. The ninja turtles are invincible now too. Bullets don't even penetrate.6 - The sexual objectification of Megan Fox. The many close ups, although nice to some, not really ideal for a PG13 audience.7 - The time-line. The movie was rushed, short intro, abrupt ending, with the simple and generic plot.8 - Choice of actors. Arnett was the best choice for his role compared to others. He gave the little bit of comic-relief that was believable of an April O'Neil camera man. The turtles voices were okay, although I don't know how they came up with Knoxville as Leo. Megan Fox, I gave the benefit of the doubt, but didn't seem like an April to me. I found out that Anna Kendrick and Jane Levy had tried out for the role. Either one would've been a better choice.9 - My last point is Hollywood in general. They seem more concerned about finding ways to maximize profit as opposed actually making really decent or epic movies. It just seems like they chose to do TMNT knowing how popular it already was anyways, then not really care how good of a job they did. In the end, it will likely make half a billion over a year anyways. Many movies lately are nothing but big names, product placement, and the mention of famous producers/directors. My dislike of this movie had nothing to do with BAY as the lovers of the movie seem to think. There's 5 other producers and 4 executive producers. People should realize that someone can like/ dislike movies for simply being what they are and have nothing to do with who's in it or who made it. I gave a 6 because it's still slightly entertaining but I couldn't bring myself to giving it a 7. That would require at least a good solid movie with nowhere near as many mistakes.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

While the turtles designs themselves I think look good they do not fit well in this world and this is really basically Teenage Mutant Ninja Transformers which really isn't a good thing to me because the TMNT are not transformers. They are an entirely different animal and to treat them just like Optimus and the Autobots doesn't make sense. I am only going to give this movie a 4.5 out of 10. It to me is personally a fail.

I'm not as interested in the newer cartoons, because they are,....well, they just aren't the same as what I enjoyed as a kid. That being said,...these turtles look NOTHING like the ones in the original films. I originally thought this was a bad thing. However, having watched it, they appear far more ""hero"" like in their new forms. I took my little buddy to watch it (8 years old) and he loved it too! There are a couple of curse words, but nothing very bad. I felt that the creators got the personalities down FAR better in this version than the previous ones. It made you remember they were teenagers. The ONLY complaint I have is the fact that Shredder looked more like he belonged in the Transformers movies than Ninja Turtles. It seems to me they WAY over thought his look and it just came off as too much(IMO). Other than that, I couldn't recommend this more!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
329,Adam-woolston14,Exceeded my low expectations,7,16 August 2014,"When I learned of a TMNT movie. I was excited. Then I learned Michael Bay would be doing it. I was no longer excited. The First Transformer movie is watchable if you turn off your brain, the second is robot/explosion porn, the third... Well let's just forget that they made a third. I haven't bothered with the new one. Even if it has Marky Mark. Anyways, when I learned April would be played by Megan Fox I only bought a ticket out of morbid curiosity as to whether this movie would replace the Last Airbender and Bay would replace Shyamalan as the principle ruiner of childhoods. The end result? It was OK. It was fairly enjoyable. The action was great, Michaelangelo actually made me laugh a few times, Raphael is a beefcake, Leo is everything he should be. The only turtle portrayal I didn't like was Donatello. Director says ""Hey guys, with all the gadgets and big words and stuff, Donatello is a big nerd. But do you think it's obvious enough that he's a nerd?"" Crew member jokingly says ""Maybe we should put taped glasses on him too so it's unmistakable!"" Director says ""Good idea Jenkins!"" Crew member says ""Bro I was kidding."" But they used it anyway. I won't get into the origin story because everyone else makes it clear they hate it. I do too. But I enjoyed the action and had fun not thinking about how stupid the movie was and being entranced by the pretty turtles. It was like an acid trip. Michael Bay is certainly evident throughout. Unnecessary explosions, product placement, Megan Fox bent over and a gratuitous Pervy camera angle of her butt. All of the Bay trademarks are there. But it's somehow less annoying than in Transformers. The weakest point of the movie is, not surprisingly, Megan Fox. It's like after she was cast someone told Michael Bay ""hey, you probably don't want to sexualize April. That's not how fanboys want to see her. She's like the girl next door."" So Bay gave her a significant subplot and character development with only one money shot on her (of course I throw around terms like subplot and character development loosely. This is Michael Bay I'm talking about. Just because it's done, doesn't mean it's done well.). The problem is Megan Fox wasn't cast in Transformers (or anything she's been in) because she can act. It was just so dull.Overall, the movie exceeded my expectations, but only because they were low to begin with. I do still feel like if studios took this movie seriously and hired intelligent, talented people to make it, it would have been great. Maybe Shredder would have been scary and not just seemed like a man-sized decepticon. It could have been better. But it could have been much, much worse. I'll take it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
330,blackmagic1092,don't waste your money,3,10 August 2014,"Teenage mutant ninja turtles is a cartoon franchise whose story lines and characters could be closely related to other comic book hero's or are loosely based caricatures, but works well in 1980s cartoons due to fact that its target audience was children. Being an 80s baby I am a fan of the 90s films and understanding how ridiculous or corny these caricatures were i never lost sight of the fun behind them. But the new film completely dismantles the simplicity of the story it is trying tell but not so much its origins. Instead of expanding on the story and trusting its audience of children. They dilute the film with senseless action with no consequences, a plot involving killing a whole city, and conveniently connecting all of the characters backgrounds to each other to serve the story while simultaneously making the characters invincible. So when I saw this film I couldn't help to make some comparisons to the original film and not so much the cartoons, because the cartoon story lines were campy fun, but the first 90s film had elements of realism with a darker tone, but had plenty of fun moments.Plus the Turtles were made to be vulnerable hero's whose self preservation was maintained by their solidarity. This new film sheds most of those qualities and is replaced with dumb fun, explosions and poor comedy. Megan fox as April was a straight up miscast. Her acting was poor and gorgeous looks were once again maintained throughout the film despite what ever explosive danger or run away vehicle her character found herself in which reminded me all to often of the directing logic and style of Michael bays transformer films. Fox's lines were forced many times over and her attempt at humor was flat. I've attributed this to not so much her acting at times, because she has shown acting chops in her other films like Jennifer's body. Perhaps if she was given better lines i could stand her girlie attitude throughout the film which is all over the place and presented another problem. The film wants to portray April as a starving journalist aching to make the big times and report on more serious stories without ever getting her clothes dirty which brings us back to the directing style of the film. Fox's character pretty much receives all the screen time in the film and takes away from Turtles. Her passionate speeches of wanting to save the city or spewing out anecdotal evidence to convince people of the turtles existence were repetitive and any attempt to make her sound somewhat witty fell short. The Turtles attitudes and personalities were familiar for the most part. The problem with making the Turtles CG creates endless plot holes in the storyline and throws logic out the window. I never felt like the turtles were in danger. Not when they're home was raided and blown up. Not when they were beaten then captured and later forced to have their blood vessels sucked dry. And not even when Raphael bites off more than he can chew and tries to fight shredder in a brief 1-on-1 battle. Then reveals his shell is cracked limiting his ability to fight. Then the film completely forgets that fact and you see him barrel himself like a cannon ball shell first into a Humvee completely obliterating it. But before that the turtles miraculously discover they are immune to bullets and use their shells as shields and acts as a tactical advantage to take down the foot clan. At other times i just couldn't see much of what was happening while they were in combat because the camera angles were over the shoulders, close ups shots, or confusing quick cut scenes. All in all the ninja tactics were hardly used by the turtles and most of the actually martial art fights were saved mostly for the climax. This ultimately reduced the action scenes early in the film where you see the foot clan members being kicked around like rag dolls. Turtles are over sized and seemed invincible. The only worthy opponent was shredder in a samurai robot suit. yahoo.. another borrowed storyline from the wolverine film. Splinter on the other hand was decent and the only character that showed some vulnerability. The foot clan is under developed for the most part. You have no understanding of why they want to take over the city or how they are initiated into the clan. Their martial art abilities were non-existent and instead were replaced by a vague militaristic style combat group with lots of guns. This pretty much makes them chew toys for the turtles to kick around. They serve as basic bad guys to move the story along to create a sense of danger. The main plot of the film is a sad rendition of recent batman films like dark knight rises and old cartoons with the joker. The clan wants to infect the whole city with a toxin killing most of the population and leaving the rest to be saved and later ruled by the foot clan whose numbers are no where near a sizable army and is more like a small police force. Once again plot holes. William Fichtner who plays Eric sacks is a billionaire and aims to profit off this tragedy by providing the cure. Which is strange, because how much money can you really make if you killed off most of the population? Another plot hole. ugh.. enough said.Anyhow this was a huge disappointment. This film is passable for children, but for the average fan it hurts to watch. This film is riddled with plot holes, and dismisses its own story rules. I could pick apart this film all day but that would be to easy.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
331,cloudsurfer,"A Bad Movie, Not Just a Bad Turtles Movie",3,10 August 2014,"Folks, it's no exaggeration when I say this one is bad. And I'm not just reviewing it as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. The Ninja Turtles are a lore. Every telling of the story deserves its own version, like Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, or Batman. Adam West, Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck all play different versions of Batman in different universes. Though I have a version of the Turtles I like best, I can set aside that prejudice for this review. It's just a very awful film. It's so bad, I don't understand how the current rating stands at 6 stars.The movie has no real sense of identity, like the filmmakers really had no idea what to do with it. Where are the Turtles going to go? What are they going to do when they get there? Is it going to be spring time or winter? Should it be in the city or in the mountains? Low to the ground in dark settings or high up on roof tops in broad daylight? Are the Turtles stealthy ninjas or mini-Hulks that just needlessly destroy stuff? And are they main characters or secondary plot pieces? Is April O'Neil tech savvy, or does she still conduct interviews with pen and paper? (Through the first half-hour, perhaps even by the end of the film, you'll have a tough time convincing yourself the title shouldn't have been ""April O'Neil: The Movie."")It's very evident that the writers did not know how to work with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" Again, this has nothing to do with a faithfulness to any kind of version of TMNT. Just, really, they had no clue how to make those four elements work. They're not so much teenagers as they are just dumb. The movie lets the Turtles aspect be self-implied. The Mutants part as well, though it does play loosely into the plot (heh, just kidding, there is no plot). The idea of ninjutsu, though, is a complete afterthought. Seriously, it's just sandwiched in there somewhere and plays no relevance to the story whatsoever, nor has an identifying presence for any character, even Splinter or Shredder.Yeah, Shredder. That's a whole other useless incorporation. The guy is somewhere between a clunky Power Ranger villain (the ones in great big suits that don't move very well) and Bane from ""Batman and Robin."" He doesn't even fill the main villain role. That ""honor"" would go to William Fichtner's character, Eric sounds-like-sex Sacks. Shredder's just a tool. His appearance, fighting-style, and overall awkwardness are all loud, awful reminders of how the filmmakers knew nothing about ninjutsu or how to use it. ""You know what? Just make 'em fight with ninja weapons, put lots and lots of blades around, and be sure the word 'Japan' gets into someone's origin story somewhere. Close enough.""Yes, the Turtles are kind of funny, but it's completely incidental. There were times when the movie tried to force something humorous, but in the theater I was in, no one laughed. And I was in a packed house. Their personalities are nothing but typecasting: Leo is the serious control-freak, Raphael the brooding B.A., Michelangelo is a goof-ball, and Donatello is the inventive... nerd! Yeah, nerds are inventive, right? Let's make him a snorting, glasses-wearing dork! You know what, just make him Simon from Alvin and the Chipmunks. You never feel like you get to be a part of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They're just kind of there. The viewer is more watching from April or Vern's vantage point, never fully involved in the brotherhood.There's a whole lot more stupid that goes on for the sake of convenience: like Donatello's bo able to flip over an SUV, or the fact that an iron construction beam can't support the weight of Leo and Donnie, but Raph who comes to their rescue can (what, are they as heavy as semi-trucks?). Watch out for the abundance of product-placement. This is a Michael Bay produced film, remember. At one point, Splinter pretty much monologues a Pizza Hut ad.In closing, I want to leave you with this, because until we get this, these horrible, ridiculous movies will continue to get made. In an interview with an MTV whoever, TMNT producer Michael Bay said that he doesn't care if people think his movies are bad. Speaking specifically about the latest Transformers installation, ""They love to hate, and I don't care. Let them hate. They're still going to see the movie!""This movie is a poo-pile of a film. I'm intentionally avoiding the usual puns like ""it was a shell-acking"" or ""I left the theater shell-shocked"" because, again, my affinity for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has nothing to do with how bad this movie is. As long as we keep paying to see what we know is going to be a bad movie, they'll keep getting made. And it doesn't matter that they're bad, because we'll pay for it no matter how bad it is.Or maybe these movies keep getting manufactured because there is actually a niche of people who like them. After all, it has a rating of 6 out of 10 stars...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
332,idennis32,Not as good as the original but better than TMNT 3,6,3 January 2015,"The heroes in a half shell return to the big screen(or DVD if u didn't see it in theaters)after a 7 year absence. I'm a huge turtles fan, and I was hesitant to see this movie. With Michael bay producing this and the director of Wrath of the Titans bringing the turtles back since their last movie, TMNT(2007), the movie looked like one of Michael Bay's stupid attempts to ruin everyone's childhood. But let me tell you, its actually a fun movie! The heroes are the stand out of the movie, they're funny and unique in there own way. Leo's the leader, Raph's the hot head with a soft spot, Donnie's the nerd...seriously he has glasses now which I don't get since he's a turtle, and Mikey is the lovable idiot. Megan Fox is April O'Neil, she's not terrible but she's not good either. Shredder is actually Oroko Saki or at least we believe its never mentioned and his suit is sick, when its hand to hand combat u can feel his hits while when he uses the knifes it seems very cartoony. Now know this is a kids movie, its not the original 1990 movie meant for both adults and kids or the TMNT 2007 which was meant for a more teenage audience. This is basically Secret of the Ooze the remake, kinda, not really. It's still better than TMNT 3.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

And not to forget the inspiring torture of our damsel in distress Megan Fox! Most of the events seem forced into the movie just to keep it running for a hundred minutes. Karai's expressions had to be used in a movie filled entirely with C-list actors. Poor direction, poor casting and a lovely way to ruin the wonderful memories of Ninja Turtles cartoon. I understand these things generate a lot of money, but at the cost of ruining something beautiful. I hope these stupid directors and producers understand that. And to top it all, I watched this and 'Into the storm' back to back. I should be given some kind of award for having the will to tolerate **** like that!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

First I'll do the cons, to get them over with. Should have been longer, felt like it went by too fast and a bit rushed. It was a bit more focused on April then the turtles. They're wasn't so much conflict between the turtles then usual, especially Leo and Raph. Now for the pros. I see critics saying the turtles are unpleasant to look at and be around, but ya know, they are mutants and they are suppose to look pretty badass. I get that previous turtles looked like people you want to be around, but in my opinion, these turtles actually look realistic. They had some pretty funny lines too. Critics have no sense of humor at all when it comes to these lines. The fight scenes were really awesome as well. I couldn't get enough of the action. Hopefully, in the next one, they see the errors and fix them, so that it is an outstanding movie! COWABUNGA!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
335,brucezwarts,Unholy to the core of what was called Ninja Turtles,1,6 February 2015,"OK. I honestly do not know how there's people on this planet that are granted huge amounts of cash to produce something like this. I mean, sure the production is fine. But why is it, they always have to mess with the story lines. Same with Transformers, same with X- men, same with all nostalgia we grew up with.This movie is certainly no different. After 30 minutes i started to get Pi**ed off and if you love the Ninja turtles from childhood, that is exactly what will happen to you. I can not start about all that's bad in this movie. I am the last person that would be overly critic about anything. I am not the wining person that only writes bad reviews when it comes to movies like this. AT ALL!The concept of the ""real"" look of the turtles is great. It's what put me up for this movie in the first place. Megan Fox as April? Hot!All i want to do now is cry and put back on the old stuff that I'm used to. !!! TIP !!! If you want to watch a turtles movie, watch the 2007 3d animated one. If you haven't seen it, watch that one instead. Great epic story line, awesome animations, Turtles as they're supposed to be.Don't WATCH THIS PIECE OF ****!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
336,nadmtg,A new twist with good and bad,7,8 August 2014,"Growing up with the Ninja Turtles shows, movies, and action figures, I was pumped for this movie. I had no problem with the reveal of how they looked, as... wait for it... THEY'RE MUTANTS!!! This movie was almost what I expected. For the first fifteen minutes, they focus on April. When the turtles do appear, we only get quick, shadowy glimpses of them as they kick Foot Clan butt. Then the movie opens up, and we quickly meet the adversary Shredder in an interesting scene. As the movie progresses however, we see less of the man under the armor and eventually he simply stays in it.Splinter was... simply put... BADASS!! We finally see the turtles' master do his thing. The turtles? Amazing. They capture the attitude we felt back in the 80's and 90's with the same style of humor. They fight with a smoothness and agility even cartoons couldn't quite nail, much less the 90's movies.On the downside, the origins of the turtles and Splinter we grew up knowing have been scratched and re-written. Not to mention tying April O'Neil's father into the back story (as though that's original), making her more important than previous Turtles renditions would have her be.While there are parts you may look at and sigh with disappointment (April being so obviously dumb in her choices), this is basically an hour and forty minute, live action Ninja Turtles cartoon episode. Definitely a must see for TMNT fans!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

It was a bad movie, but an okay ninja turtle movie. Now, the original movies aren't that great to begin with (besides the 1990 movie), but this new movie somehow is the most boring ninja turtle film that I've ever seen. The old films were at least entertaining, but this was just boring. The CGI on the turtles were great, they looked amazing. The CGI on splinter was pretty bad but I've seen worse. The shredder costume looks like a transformer but still looks cool.Megan Fox as April O'Neil wasn't the best choice but i thought she did a decent job, but pretty forgettable.William Fichtner as Eric Sacks was funny as hell, he was just plain stupid but very enjoyable.Will Arnett was awful as Vern Fenwick, he was really unfunny and was kinda creepy.The turtles were the best part of the movie. The actors did an awesome job! Just wish they were in the movie more.The designs of the turtles are pretty cool too.Splinter was a good character with a bad design and terrible CGI.There wasn't enough action in the movie, which really weakens it. But when there was action, it was awesome!The music was forgettable.OVERALL: 5/10The movie was kinda forgettable. It had cool action (not enough though).Awful writingAndokay characters, but great turtles.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
338,thepopcornside,Who will be Karai's dad now that Splinter was never human?,1,13 November 2014,"So people have been comparing this new TMNT with other versions of the franchise to describe just how awful it is. I will stick with the Nickelodeon version, because they have a hand in this and the other way.... better series version. Over the years there have been some sensible changes like giving these different colour bands so that we can tell the difference,makes sense, then the crang were made into robots so that kids wont have to watch their heroes running around slaughtering bad guys and leaving a bloody mess behind, again makes sense. Then we have this. I know it's Bay's fault, I knew it the moment I saw the miniature transformer version of Shreder. My nephew kept asking me if he was turned into a robot. Now he call him robot Shreder. And he hates that. Then Splinter is now and always a rat and never ever has he ever been a human... So who is going to be Kairai's dad? Did they think about that? April O'niel? I kept seeing Megan Fox? My nephew kept waiting for the real O'niel to pop up from Fox's back peekaboo style, coz she looks nothing like her. Since that girl couldn't fake a personality to save her life, at least do something with the hair to slightly resemble the real deal. That's what really good actors do, they go the extra mile. Went to this movie with my nephew because he loves the other nickelodeon turtles. It was his reward for doing so good in school. Since he took it like a punishment, I'm only expecting bad grades next time. With all the bad stuff going on with this that the other reviewers mentioned, I don't even think these guys are turtles anymore. Bootleg movies should be legal if they come with bay's name on them. I'll stick with the series those guys rock.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
339,LZMcK,A film that can be entertaining but very forgettable overall.,3,10 June 2016,"What is good: The turtles themselves are entertaining and they aren't as terrible as I thought they would be in terms of their look. Also some of the action is okay and some of the effects are okay but I definitely felt the best element of this film was the turtles. There is also one scene in this film where I genuinely laughed out loud but it was only 15 seconds in a film that is 1 hour and 41 minutes long.What is bad: Megan Fox offers no emotion and no genuine interest in what is happening throughout the film. Her inability to be taken seriously as a journalist is not the problem at all, her inability to give a convincing performance is and I honestly didn't care what happened to April at all. Will Arnett in this film gives a terrible performance to create a terrible side character. Vernon, Arnett's character, is supposed to be comic relief, which doesn't make any sense because the turtles are the ones that are supposed to be funny. Having a character that is trying to get laughs, emphasis on TRYING, and also hitting on April is just a pointless character. I questioned Splinter as a character as well. His actions made no sense to me. I had the same amount of emotion in him as I did with April. The villains in this film are all poor as well. William Fichtner as an evil scientist offers nothing, the Shredder, Tohoru Masamune, is a boring robotic mess and Minae Noji as Karia is a character that has no purpose at all. The only good thing I can say about the villains is that if Shredder was actually a well rounded and interesting character then I would at least feel some sense of fear because he does look intimidating, but because there is not actual substance to him I don't fear his villainy at all.Filming Content: The film's look is overly bright and flashy which doesn't work at all when they go down in the sewers. There is an insane amount of lens flares that just bothered me throughout the film and, aside from an entertaining action scene on a cliff side, the action in this film is very dull. The editing is really bad as well. I was able to notice how bad some of the editing was and I can forgive some of the little mistakes in films, but when mistakes are this apparent it is too much to just let go. There really is no directorial vision in this film either. It doesn't seem like one director's property. It just seems like some people in the production team where behind the scenes telling the director what they wanted. The biggest problem of this whole film aside form the actors is the terrible script. It was just copy and paste, lazy, storytelling. I laughed in disgust when shown the scene where the turtles and Splinter learned ninjutsu and how we are shown that April has a connection with the turtles and Splinter. It's absolutely annoying to hear the things that the actors say and do and it's so obvious that you are watching actors because the script's characters are just so terrible. It's also sad to think back on the film and realize after only a few hours after seeing it I barely remember anything that was done or said which is the biggest film sin of all, creating a film that is absolutely forgettable.Overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a film that really has no reason to exist other than sell toys to a younger generation who will no doubt enjoy this film. Personally I didn't like this movie. Aside from the turtles and a few entertaining moments I didn't care about anyone. The editing, bad writing, and lack of direction turned me off of this film, and the actors certainly didn't help either.Personal rating: 2/5 Film Content rating: 1.7/5 Overall: 3.7/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

341,hatchels,Way more than I expected.,9,10 August 2014,"Possible spoilers in this, so be warned.Anyway, growing up in the late 80s and early 90s, I was skeptical as anyone would be at a reboot. Especially with the flop that was RoboCop, I didn't expect much from this one. After going in without the rose tinted glasses and low expectations, I found myself wanting to see the sequel right then. The characters actually have some development throughout, and even though some of the lines were cringe worthy, the actors still made the best out of what they had. The changes to the origin story of how they were April's pets and her father's work with Erik Sacks and mutagen created them was actually done very well, yet the Splinter and Shredder plight is basically non existent, and maybe they will do something with it next time... but doubtful.This may have been portrayed as a kids film, but I greatly enjoyed it and will be buying the film when it's released, and wait whole heartedly for the next one.Also, the kick at the alien idea, though it's a throwaway joke, was awesome. Well done Platinum Dunes.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
342,clynnsweetman,"Holy Cow, Megan Fox can act.",10,9 September 2015,"April was one of my first long time strong female heroes growing up. And the ninja turtles my first favorite heroes growing up.I expected to be severely disappointed by this movie, because of what I've seen Megan Fox in before, and because of the pedestal I have the turtles on.Not so. Megan shows a huge range of emotions, and all the quirky expressiveness I expected from the tenacious April. The red brown long hair nodded at the original red without overdramatizing her Cartoon-style red.The introduction was a beautiful head nod to the comics, and the art direction of the movie is darker and grittier, more like the comics. I was also very okay with the CG once I saw it in action.All in all - I highly recommend this movie to any turtle fan or even as a family movie. The plot isn't too complicated or too dark, nor is it too campy. Fantastic job.My only regret is listening to all the negative hype and waiting this long to see it instead of going to it in theaters.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
343,niklhoer,"Good movie, but WORST STORY EVER",4,20 September 2015,"Alright so basically this movie tells the story of the teenage mutant ninja turtles saving New York again (as if we haven't seen enough of it yet). But that would be alright if the story would not be that predictable. Everything you think happens now actually happens, which ruins the movie. Because if you already know what is going to happen the movie just gets boring. It's not like ""Ok what is going to happen now"", but more like ""Is it gonna happen the way I think it will?"". You can already tell what the plot will be after watching one quarter of the movie.The rest of the movie is well done: The turtles look good in my opinion, good cgi effects and of course lots of action scenes with a lot of slow motion (Michael Bay worked on this - what did you expect?). And these scenes save the movie in my opinion, because they are really good and it nearly seems like this was the part of the movie the put the most afford in.I forgot to say: you will have absolutely no childhood memories coming up while watching this movie, it doesn't involve the series in any way.Result: For me, the movie can be summarized like this: Oh, some money would be nice. Let's hire some great Hollywood stars and take a really popular franchise. But then they forgot to write a story so someone wrote the whole story the night before in his bedroom. Might be nice for small children, as they really get impressed by kind of everything and hey they are ninjas and turtles and such but if you are over the age of ten please save your time and watch something different.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

But pretty much everything else sucked.First of all, to all the people claiming it is just a kids movie, it is not JUST a kids movie, since most of its audience aren't kids and anyway that doesn't excuse the movie for having no plot, bad characters and completely missing the point of the turtles.The only thing I'm going to actually complain about here is the misrepresentation of the turtles, everything else I can get over, but this is just plain horrible. First of all, in no variation of the turtles, are they a bunch of monsters on steroids. My little brother is genuinely too afraid of them to see the movie and he loves the cartoons, which makes it an amazing kids movie obviously. Secondly, they are not supposed to win their fights purely by brawn, THEY ARE NINJAS! They attack from the shadows, and beat stronger opponents by skill and smarts, THEY ARE NOT BULLET PROOF FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! And thirdly when they fight they always use the Spider-man style insults and jokes which this movie completely lacks.The movie completely disregards the source material and not in a good way.

There's plenty to like about it, but the biggest thing for me is that the relationship between the turtles was spot on. They all had memorable characters, funny interactions and probably aside from Leonardo about the same amount of screen time and development. Actually I went out of the movie wanting to see a bit more from the turtles - that's how fun they were. Overall to me the movie hit the main theme perfectly - it's a story about brotherhood, about growing together and counting on each other. And I enjoyed it for that.Sure there are many drawbacks such us the acting of Megan Fox (personally not a huge fan of her mouth breathing and duck-faces) or the absence of some of the most famous characters from the cartoon, but since the franchise has been already given the go-ahead for part 2 I'm sure we will get to explore the universe even further.

348,thecoloroftea,All I can expect and hope from TMNT!,8,11 August 2014,"If I judged this film on story, or character development, or even acting, I'd have to remind myself what the title is: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This is not a film that requires any of the aforementioned traits that good movies are usually known for. This film requires mutants, ninjas, action and excitement, and this film delivers just that. That said, the story is odd even for TMNT standards. Here are a few examples:-April knew the turtles before they were mutants, and even owned them as pets many years ago. Then she forgot about all that until she met them as full-grown mutants. -Master Splinter learned Ninjitsu from a book he found in the sewer. -Shredder doesn't even seem to have an inherent rivalry with him. -The love interest for April is...Vernon. The last one I have to give special attention to: In other adaptations, the only person who April ever had much of a love interest in was Casey Jones. Casey was a crime-fighting vigilante who wore a hockey mask and shouted ""Goongala!"" Vernon on the other hand, was always just a dorky middle aged reporter used for comic relief. In this movie he's...a dorky middle aged reporter used for comic relief AND a slap-on love interest for April. These oddities mean nothing to me however, because in the end I'm not watching TMNT to make sense of things. I mean, does a group of mutant ninjas being trained by a rat make sense in the first place? April seems more manic than usual in this movie. I'm not a reporter or anything, but why would you show your boss obsessive amounts of convoluted nonsense in a deranged tone, knowing you don't have any evidence? Actually, she DID have evidence (sort of) but didn't show it to her boss (why, I have no idea). What would you expect to gain from all this? It doesn't matter, she gets fired and hunts the turtles down herself with the help of Vernon, and he has no reason to do this other than that he has a crush on her. She gets help from someone who two-times her by planting a tracking device on her so that he can know the whereabouts of the turtles when she finds them. This man is working for the Shredder. April finds the turtles, ergo so does the Shredder, etc. then there are action scenes galore. In fact, the entire second half of the movie is basically just action scenes, and they're really well done. They're done so well in fact, I'm judging this movie almost entirely on them alone. If you do watch this movie, watch it for that! It's fun, exciting, and doesn't make you think too much. What more could you want out of a TMNT move?",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
349,Larrypj20,Way Better Than Expected!,7,7 August 2014,"TMNT turned out to be a decent film. The acting and action sequences were done well. I was surprised with how well the CG animation was for the turtles and other characters. Shredder was awesome and the new suit was a spectacle within itself. The comedy was perfect and timed very well. The only qualms I have is the desire for more depth to each characters development, personalities, and story. I guess what I am trying to say is that the film felt a bit too short for a proper new presentation for this franchise Also, Tony's voice work for Splinter didn't really fit for me but I hope there will be a sequel and an extended director's cut.

350,denton-finley,I wasn't at all impressed,1,31 August 2014,"I suppose growing up in the 80s and watching TMNT as a kid set high expectations for me and this film. I absolutely loved watching TMNT cartoons as a kid. I even thought that the movies in the early to mid 90s were great. The cartoon movie they came out with several years ago was pretty well done as well.This movie however, is an absolutely horrible addition to the TMNT franchise. First of all, they changed the turtle's back story - no thanks. The turtles appeared to be on steroids and there was little resemblance to their original image. Donatello sounded like a girl. Shredder was 99% of the time a poorly done CG image that lacked any detail and resemblance to the original Shredder. He was more robot-like than anything else. While there was an attempt at some classic TMNT whimsical humor, it was poorly executed and delivered.Overall this movie falls in line with the majority of today's films - little, if any, acting talent covered up by computer generated and over the top action sequences.1 star.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I mean her expressions were emotionless and unbelievable and her acting was terrible. She ruined an otherwise decent movie for me. Being a TMNT fan growing up, I was pretty disappointed.Otherwise the movie was OK. I don't like that they made all the turtles different heights.. I mean, why was Raphael so huge? I don't understand the glasses on Donatello either, they should have used goggles or something like that because they don't have ears.

The quick lines, fighting spirit and all the fun they express - its all there. Megan Fox does this movie really good. Ï seriously think that this is one of her greatest films ever, much more ""acting"" than in her Transformers role. Like I said earlier the movie had some really nice effects.

354,benwageman,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5,23 December 2014,"Where do I even begin... While there has been a recent love for recreating super hero movies and bringing new one to life, this is one of the worst. So many things went wrong with this movie, and really the only thing that I enjoyed was the humor. Thinking back to how I remember these guys, there was always humor, especially with Mikey and the movie did pretty good with that. Mikey's overall commentary and the elevator scene were just the kind of humor that I imagined. Now to the negatives. Oh man. Well the first one that pops into my head is when they blow up the Turtles cave and after they ""blow"" it up, April walks right in and there is almost no damage. Shredder and Raphael fought in the lab and Shredder kicks the crab out of Raphael. At the end of the fight, Shredder just walks away, he had a chance to kill one of them and I would have to believe he would have put the dagger in him but he didn't. There really wasn't much fighting from the Turtles in general, a lot of scenes where they got shot at and then threw a few punches and walked away. Now onto the mountain scene. Terrible, just terrible. I mean not that I have ever taken an 18 wheeler down the side of a mountain but their ride seemed pretty smooth considering the fact that they started backwards. Smashing through a snowbank and knocking April out of the truck was good but then they blew through the second one and she hung on? I don't think so. There were plenty other scenes I could get nit picky with but I will spare my breath. Aprils part in this movie seemed too forced. She kept popping up and all I wanted to see was Turtles fighting, not another scene of Meghan Foxx running no where important. April seemed to have this heroic sense about her that was just too much, they made her seem like more of a hero than the Turtles.

The action sequences are bland but plentiful. Faithfulness to the original series is lost. Megan Fox acting is quite possibly the worst part of the movie, unbelievable and disconnected throughout. With as many franchises that he shits on, I advice you to try to stay as far away as possible from anything Michael Bay touches in the future.If you look at it objectively it's like a mash between most popular action films with extremely distinguishable parts taken from others. Combind that with a story so shallow and predictable that a 5 minute trailer video would be a more appropriate medium for this release.

358,Gamezopher_,Much better than what the critics made me expect,9,8 August 2014,"I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this reboot after reading all the negative and harsh reviews. Another reason is that I'm not a fan of The Transformers by Micheal Bay. Anyway... I decided to take a risk, especially because most of the time so many other great movies are underrated by the public. What's more, I'm not a person who's hard to please, I'm still a kid in my heart, it gives me a greater flexibility than others to be entertained.I wasn't disappointed whatsoever with this new movie. It's exactly what I expected: a summer flick for kids, and it delivers. The CG animations are very well done, the turtles look credibly real. The storyline is interesting - although the segment how they learn ninjutsu felt a bit rushed. Each turtle have their own outfit and personality, they stand apart from each other better than in the old movie IMO. Their tall and massive look is a detail I liked very much. Shredder don't have much back story but his fight scenes make him feel like a powerful villain.Was it better than the old movie? as far as I'm concerned I didn't feel outraged by this new direction. Some elements were greater in the old movie, other elements are better in this reboot, but the spirit is still there, at least for me.Verdict. If you expect a Christopher Nolan or Planet of the Apes reboot, save your money for another movie. If you have kids and want to share a good time with them I definitely recommend it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
359,madamtmmtlofthestrangepl,Boring and Here to Stay,1,9 August 2014,"As the title says, it was boring. Jokes as they played out where were childish that it hurt or cringing at times. CGI was an eye-sore, at the night moments maybe, but when full on light, it was off and very unpleasing to look at.The acting ranged from good/okay to hammy to block space. Once the plot is finally pointed out, it comes with a shoving point for viewers. Just as well with the sub-plots (We all know movies have them) there, leaving wondering why they were put there in the first place.Leaving what is rest with the movie to become hollow, lack-luster, money grabbing (See at how many have already seen it; I as well), and waste of chances of taking more look into the source material and do something with it.In turns, this movie is not worth all the bother anymore, it's out and all we can do now is deal with it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
360,burningphoenix36,One of bay's best,8,30 August 2014,"I must say for how awful I thought this movie would be, it was pretty awesome. Very funny lines, awesome action, not too long. Another thing is it pays a lot of homage to the original movie. I did not like the way splinter looked though And at first I was worried about Donatello's design But I easily Got Used to it Now I don't like how the foot clan are terrorists, but hey. The casting choices were fantastic. I mean Compared to that awful movie that came out earlier this year by Michael bay Transformers 4! This was awesome. But as you see, their were a few errors in the script but hey, I'm not picky. All In all, i really enjoyed. Great job Michael bay. I am definitely buying the merchandise, and will buy the movie when it comes out.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
361,jawavs,This movie delivers the goods!!,9,22 August 2015,"I don't get where all the hate comes from, but I think it makes this one of the most underrated movies I've seen in recent years. There was very little wrong with it. What exactly were people wanting with this that it didn't deliver? It was fun, exciting, had good comedy, and heart. The writing of the characters was extremely faithful to their roots. As a TMNT fan, I've very much enjoyed the original '80s cartoon, the '03 cartoon, and all the previous movies, but this one may take the cake. So what if Bay was involved in this? It still turned out as an excellent, more than satisfactory adaption. I know I speak for the minority, but man am I excited for the sequel next year!To sum it up, while this may not be the deepest movie of last year, let's remember it's also a story of talking mutant teenage turtle superheroes. Considering that, the movie express themes of teamwork and courage, and also showed the turtle brothers' love for each other. The writing was charming and entertaining, as were the special effects. The action more than satisfies as well. The turtles also have maybe their best designs yet, not only making them truly look like humanoid turtles, but also giving them further unique aspects to their costumes, as well as differentiating between their personal physiques. Do yourself a favor: ignore the immature ranting most haters are giving this movie and give it a fair chance for yourself. If you are a TMNT fan like me, I have a hard time imagining how you could come away so disappointed.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
362,cnickels13,Deep in the snow covered mountains of...,3,8 August 2014,"Wait a minute. Snow covered mountains 1 hour outside of New York City? While everyone in New York City is wearing t-shirts? Yeah, makes perfect sense. This movie was poorly done and did the TMNT franchise no justice whatsoever. Boring at times, too much Michael Bayness, and the whole ""you went up to the city? You're in trouble, here balance this egg on chopsticks and you hang upside down while I tempt you with pizza"" was just plain stupid. And what about Michelangelo and his obsession over April? Yeah, in the originals the turtles all had ""crushes"" if you will, but they didn't drool over her. Michelangelo has a really creepy obsession over her. When he first sees her he says ""guys, my shell is getting tight!"" Really? That's just wrong. And he and even has a line where he says ""I will find you. OK, that wasn't supposed to be creepy. But I will find you."" Yeah, that was a little weird. I guess I didn't expect much considering this was a Nickelodeon film, but wow. Total let down. Oh, and spoiler alert! There's an explosion! Thanks Michael Bay. We couldn't have done it without you and your big booms.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
363,styc1,"Spoilers will be at end of review, real turtles fans please read this review.",8,15 August 2014,"Ugh stupid character limitations. This review has Been shrunk down to why people hate the movie and what fans should look forward to.Personally I think people are hating on this cause of one or more of these reasons. 1. People are expecting a movie that is going to blow them away.2. People want a movie of the 80's/90's cartoon series because some fans only know the turtles through that.3. They are your typical Internet hater who will hate anything Michael bay.The movie caters to fans and introduces the concepts of the story to any new fans in a great way. Time for spoilers!First thing's first, the stuff they changed. The origins story was changed but in my opinion it was for the better in terms of adding realism (assuming your already accepting the fact that there's a chemical that mutates animals). In the original splinter learns how to fight by imitating his master/owner, moves to New York with his owner to only find himself in the sewers after his owner is brutally murdered at the hands of oroku saki where he meets the turtles after an accident involving a boy carrying said turtles home in a fish bowl almost gets hit by a truck which drops the mutagen into the sewer. Not only is that pretty far fetched with a rat learning to fight by watching his master BEFORE being mutated but then pretty coincidental with everyone being in the right place and right time when the famous accident happens. In this movie the turtles and splinter were being used as experiments for the mutagen and due to a lab fire, had to be saved by April who is the daughter of a scientist working at the lab, and dropped off in the sewer where they begin to mutate and splinter finds a book on ninjutsu teaching himself and then the turtles. Much more believable in my opinion.Another thing they change is Karai's back story. It's cool that she finally appears in a live action film but she basically played tatsu's role from the first two ninja turtle movies where she is basically the general of the foot clan. Her back story where she was adopted by oroku saki as a young girl and trained to fight and obey the shredder is transferred to a new character.The foot solder in this movie were not foot solders. They looked like your generic body guards in action movies that are there just to get their ass kicked.Vern is way different then in the old cartoon. He is actually a nice guy in the movie and pretty funny. Also shredders gear has been heavily updated but I will get back to that in a sec. Anyways that's all the major changes to the original story, now all the stuff they got right and threw in for fans?Shredder's outfit is IMO based on the 2003 series shredder where he was more technologically advanced. The movie exaggerates it a bit but I think he ended up looking pretty cool.A lot of similarities in not only story, but also in quotes and shots to the first one. Some examples would be when April is attacked by the foot in the subway and when a pizza is being sliced in the air by Leo for the family and a slice happens to fall on splinters head.When the turtles and April first meet, Raphael uses the chain weapon his night rider persona used in the fourth movie.An utrom can be seen in an ancient painting of a battle in Japan. Fans of the 2003 series will know this is actually shredder who is an utrom that has been around for centuries. The word Kappa can also be seen on a scroll.The turtle van is in the movie!The turtles lair is awfully similar to the fourth movie's lair and the 2003 series lair.They totally nailed the turtle's personalities. Mikey still cracks jokes with perfect timing and they are actually funny, Raphael is still a hard ass, Leo is your bland leader (IMO probably the worst of the four in this movie) and they nerdy Donatello. When I say they nailed this down, I mean perfectly albeit a bit subtle. Hardcore fans know that Mikey and Ralph share a special bond they don't with their brothers. Mikey loves to prank and mess with Raphael because he is so serious and Raphael is a hard ads on mike so that he can be more serious. Well in the movie, there's some Japanese symbols on Raphael's shell the whole movie that apparently say Mikey was here. Mikey wrote that in Japanese so that Raphael would never be able to read it and know. Meanwhile Raphael is seen being a grump to Mikey in the movie at times. There's also another part where Donatello for once is the bad ass of the group and saves the day. After the moment has passed Donatello has 5 seconds to himself where he chuckles all nerd like to himself proud of what he did. Moments like that is what made me enjoy this movie.Of course cowabunga is thrown in there and the concept of family and teamwork was there. The rivalry between Leo and Ralph could have been touché on a bit more but it was there just not front and center like in the first and fourth movie. What the movie didn't have however though was Casey Jones who will hopefully show up in the sequel.All I can say is, if your a true fan but haven't seen this latest movie, your doing yourself an injustice by not seeing it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
364,vincent_scrivens,Ruined my childhood...,1,1 January 2015,"Ever since I was a kid I loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even before I watched it, it looked terrible. They don't look like turtles, they look like monsters. Also they keep on saying they're 6 feet tall. It's really repetitive and stupid. It's a strange observation but it is bothersome. Also, I don't like the acting of the characters. Everything about it is terrible. Just leave this series alone! It was perfect! It is like how the transformers cartoons were amazing but then Michael Bay made them look bad. And stop using Megan Fox! She horrible at acting! Even though I had low expectations. I didn't think it would be this bad. I can't wait to not see the sequel. F*ck you Michael Bay!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The new York sewer system is riddled with martial arts weaponry. One can teach themselves to be a ninja from a manual. Scaffolding is explosive. Billionaire scientists carry gps trackers that are disguised as business cards. Michael Bay wasn't the director. Cgi will never replace good old animatronics. None of the actors playing the turtles were not white.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
366,mwjshrader-08048,Amazing movie.,10,8 December 2019,I think people expect more then what is sitting in front of you. Simple but with a good size budget. Cgi is not bad great cast. I think people want to see a huge plotline but that's not what the franchise stands for simple funny and action. I think they should have been smaller in size but that's my only complaint.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
367,nhossain-15971,Taste matters actually,9,13 April 2020,"Watched this movie 4 years ago. And today again. Missed those turtles, their acting, their fighting just awesome.

368,jazzman1023,"Not good. Not bad, though.",5,13 May 2015,"Mediocrity has a name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2014. By now, most everyone should know the basic storyline of TMNT; turtles mutate, turtles learn ninjutsu by a giant rat, turtles fight guy with lots of knives.This is not rocket science and certainly not worth anything more than the movie we got: a stupid, fun popcorn-fueled action flick. Those lamenting the supposed destruction of their childhood memories may want to step back away from the ledge; the original idea, the original movie, the original cartoon, and even the original comic series just we're as good as you remember them. This lines up with the current incarnation: it's not good, but it's not bad.There are some that will also continually stand on their soapbox, hating Michael Bay for everything he does; we get it, you hate Michael Bay. Here's a thought: if you hate Michael Bay, want high-brow humor, quality acting, thought-provoking scripting and a plot that makes sense, don't watch this movie.If you, on the other hand, want some brainless fun, decent CGI, excellent action sequences and Meghan Fox, come join the party. There are worse things to do for an hour-and-a-half; like whining about an intentionally low-brow action movie on IMDb.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
369,samxsteal,Awesome Action packed TMNT Comedy,9,8 August 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the movie. As A lifelong fan of TMNT I have been very excited for this movie for a long time. I was very happy with what I saw. This is a TMNT movie have been waiting for, for years. I enjoyed my Self through the whole movie and AM excited to see where this movie Franchise Goes after this it deserves to have a long and Action packed life as a movie series.Direction. I feel the Direction Was Very well done. My one Gripe is that the movie does feel as though there was a lot ""left out"" IM sure the studio had and ideal length so part where cut. This is not a bad thing. I feel like he conveyed all the information in a way that keeps the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats.Cinematography. I feel the Cinematography was great. The wide shots of the City Were Epic in scale and were reminiscent of Batman Begins, The action was Very well done. Though there were some time when the Action was a little too focused using closer shots making it hard to Focus, but there were few and far between Writing. The Script was well done. All the Characters were very well written, some were a bit corny but that really fits their characters. One important thing about turtles is that they feel like the turtles we know and love, and they were definitely written this way.Editing. The Edit was well Done Scene flowed from one to the Next nothing was Jarring. The scenes that took place at night transitioned into day well and smoothly.Effects. The Special Effects were very well done. One Thing We as fans have been Worried About if the look of the Turtles and While Opinions are mixed about the designs, They are very well done Very realistic During the whole movie the turtle feel very Physically present they have weight to them. And look fantastic. All the special effects were done.Costume design. I personally Love the Designs of the turtle some feel the turtle look too different. I really enjoy them they help to bring out the personalities of each character. You can tell each turtle was very well thought out and developed Down to the littlest details. Some aspects seem stereo typical but in the context of the movie it works.Actors. Each Turtle where Cast perfectly. Noel as Mikey is perfect his comedic timing is perfect he's funny and a stand out in the movie. Though this does not mean the other do not shine. Alan as Raph Is great as the hot headed Turtle. Thought HE does have several Emotional scenes I don't want to spoil anyone. Jeremy IS very good As Donnie, though some may think he is overly stereo typical but he really does kick some butt and his staff skills are amazing. Pete as Leo IS great as well. Though the voice for Leo is Knoxville Who actually does a very good job as the Mutant Leader. One Aspect Of the turtle is that you really see the performance of all the turtles when they are on screen you can see each actor in these mutant turtles and is very well done. Megan As April was actually Very good. She get a lot of flak, but she really proves herself in this movie. She really does a great job in this movie. William Fichtner's Character is very good as well he's does a good job at being dynamic. Shredder is a little Light on the story But there is enough there to Elude him and His personality is Perfect and His very Intimidating. Will as Vern is funny but kind of a through away but he gets the job done.Set design. The shot of New York Are amazing when you see the turtle out as night in the City it looks absolutely fantastic. Their Lair Is very well thought out. There are tiny little thing all over the lair showing this is a very detailed Sett I can't wait to see Special Features about the designing process.Score or soundtrack. The Score and Soundtrack are amazing. Brian Tyler Does an Amazing job with his Score he has and underlying theme throughout the whole movie. His score feel epic and Very reminiscent of older action movies like Indiana Jones and similar movies. The sound track is Very good as well. Shell-shocked is very similar to the. T.u.r.t.l.e. power and Ninja rap, from the Original movies and it works in this day and age.Plot. The Plot was streamlined Cutting out much of the fluff other movie add to Keep the Action moving. Though as said before there are many aspect that seem to have been cut. Even some scenes from the trailers. But in the context of the movie is flowed well. And Worked. Sure I would love to see more of the turtles but that's a good thing. Action. Many people were worried that there would be No Action. But this movie has just the right amount. There IS a lot of Action, the foot keep coming and the turtle keep cleaning up house Till Shredder Comes Shredder in the movie is very well done He is a force to be reckoned with. Tone. This Movie is an Action Comedy threw and threw. It's very funny to watching and there is plenty of action. These are Staples of TMNT and have always been. And this movie worked and that is all there is to say.Cons. More time in the lair. Turtles relaxing. More development, There are Certain Character that While for this story did not need to be drawn out, there is a sense of wanting to know more about the character. Which I feel has been done to leave Option available for the sequel.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
370,carljohanf,"Stealing good stuff from previous movies making them bad, doesn't compensate the altering of the original story..",6,10 August 2014,"Seriously.. If you don't want spoilers.. Don't read this!..OK.. So if we sum this up.. Splinter looks like a Japanese drunk homeless person who only know of one barbershop, which happens to be the worst in the city.. This can be accepted, given the facts that he actually lives 24/7 in the sewers.No worries.. The fact that Raphael, and actually most of the turtles now looks like the Evil Ant general Mandible in Antz, doesn't turn me on much either. However, Aprils constant nagging of getting a story IS more connected to the original story than anything else in this made up sub version of the real thing..NOW THEN.. What I actually miss.. The Scene that SHOULD be there!A dojo in Japan, a nice evening when sun sets (or early morning for that matters.. capture the feeling.. DO IT!).. some sherry blossom leaves falls from the tree outside.. On the inside, Hamato Yoshi and the other practices Ninjutsu.. One foul student named Oroku Saki feels that Hamato Yoshi is a more promising student than himself, and thereby stands in his way of becoming the leader of the clan. Some scenes, and some days passes. Oroku Saki decides to strike. When the students of the Dojo are about to commence training, and bow down from seiza-position (on their knees), Oroku Saki takes his Tanto-""knife"" and nails Hamatos GI-Jacket (His upper training clothes) to the floor.. Making it impossible to bow down to their Highly honored sensei.. Someone shouts out.. ""Are you refusing to bow down to our honored Sensei.. you filthy dog!"".. He removes the knife from behind his back, and ends up in a position looking like he is about to attack the sensei.. Oroku Saki shouts: He wants to kill our beloved Sensei!! Hamato Yoshi is apprehended and thrown out of the Dojo, Banned from Japan for all Eternity..He then ends up in New York, in the sewers.. (I know but that's the original story.. right?) He finds 4 turtles swimming in some kind of ooze.. (The Mutagen).. The contact between him and the Turtles makes the turtles humanoid.. The contact between him and a rat makes him Rat-anoid? (Is that a word?) Anyway.. That's how he becomes Splinter!.. And he is awesome!!!.. He can shew thru anything, biting thru wood and stuff simultaneously making splinters out of other solid wood with his hands.. Unlike the recently released movie. However he can use his tail in the original story as well as in this one.. One thing they've got right, But it's not very nice done in this one..It lacks a bit of the calmly ""Buddhist"" thinking of the original series.. But it's not that far off.. If it could be perfected and not have so much ""fast rendered"" scenes blurring by.. I would definitely appreciate it more.. And the humour.. It needs a face lift.. The original Foot Clan soldiers ARE way cooler than these normal soldiers.. seriously.. make it right!And Shredder, who if you didn't catch up.. IS Oroku Saki who has taken over the Japanese Clan and named it the Foot Clan (or ""The Foot"" for short) and moved it to New York to steal stuff ""Ninja Style"", and hopefully become Ruler of the World.. Or at least a small Universe.. Well, he should not be a Robot.. Seriously.. Have Iron Man be Iron Man.. And Shredder be Shredder.. Please.The rest of the story is OK.. I like that Michaelangelo is quite like he was in the original series.. I don't like the way Donatello was turned into a screaming Geek.. He is awesome even tough he creates and fixes things.. Due to this movie the producer inflicts upon us all that geeks are silly. And that everyone should do American football or practice heavy lifting to be awesome.. Which OF COURSE!!.. is just a bunch of BS.I like the physics more in this movie tough.. A turtle of the size of a man should weigh enough to make a Humve fly like a glove.. Well at least it should affect it.. That's was better than in original series. And the effects are also better of course.. It's 2014.Stolen scenes? Well when the Turtles runs and finds the foot clan standing doing all the filthy business a foot clan usually does, and they drop some stuff leaving a uncomfortable silence.. That's taken from one of the earlier movies.. I liked the old one better.It's quite fun that Vernon wants to name an article ""Heroes in a half shell"", which is what they sing in the original 90's series Intro-music. The music moment in the elevator is also quite nice.Well that quite sums it up, it's overall a good movie for people who don't know the original series. But not for the ones who lived in the 90's and appreciated the old series.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
371,kokojones,Dumb fun,5,8 August 2014,"The stigma going into this film is that Michael Bay produced this film and that must mean that it's a Michael Bay film full of all the Michael Bay-isms so many people have come to hate. That is not the case. This film is its own movie full of fun action and humor free from Michael Bay's influence. This film shoots to be very akin to the TMNT cartoons and it shows with the cheesy one liners and the fun interactions between the four brothers, and combined with modern CGI animation, the movie looks and sounds great. The plot and villains are generic, but then again, neither were they anything special in any of the cartoons either, and neither should you expect anything more from this movie.Do not go into this movie expecting it to be a masterpiece, because it is not...nor should you instantly expect it to be bad because of what movie critics may think.

The movie has a very dark undertone and lacks the fun and pleasure of the old series. This is typical Michael Bay with explosions that go BOOM and a story line that fizzes. This really lacks the substance and the heart of the old movie and though brotherhood is still the theme the chemistry between the turtles is all wrong especially that of Raphael and Leonardo. Megan Fox is completely wrong for the roll of April, I would have preferred someone more quirky like Zoe Deschanel but obviously Michael is into her so whatever.

Great movie ??? sorry, but you do not have sufficient experience to analyze what is a good movie. TMNT is an empty completely, overkill in CGI! When he was 10, 12, loved seeing the ninja turtles,, but this changed history, the plot is weak, the jokes, cgi cgi CGI and take on your face.

374,DoctorVenkman,"Just a good, fun Turtles film!",7,7 August 2014,"OK, so I just saw the 7:00 PM showing at my local AMC.I'll start with my background... I'm 29, and grew up on the original movies and cartoon. I had tons of TMNT toys, and really loved the Turtles growing up. I've seen the 2007 movie, and a few episodes of the various cartoon series since the first series. I haven't read the IDW comics. So I would consider myself a fan, though I haven't seen/read every iteration.First things first, the movie could have used more of a plot, but I would put it on par with Secret of the Ooze in that regard. No huge plot twists or major depth of the villains or anything. It's an OK story, with plenty of action.The CGI looks decent if you can get past the drastic change in their looks. The Turtles and particularly Splinter... in my opinion, definitely look like how you could expect mutated animals to look. I didn't like the look of the noses when they first debuted, but it had started to grow on me.The voice acting is really very good. Knoxville is an awesome Leonardo. Ritchson really does a great job with Raphael's gruff, gritty voice. Noel Fisher is hilarious as Mikey. Jeremy Howard does a good job, and definitely pulls of the nerdiness (I must admit, though, that I love Corey Feldman's Donatello). Shaloub does a really nice job as Splinter, as well.Megan Fox is fine as April. Not memorable. Not horrible. Not great. Just fine. Honestly, she does better in the beginning of the film, but when the action kicks in, she's not all that believable.My absolute favorite scene... when the Foot have entered the Turtle's Lair and Shredder and Splinter are fighting. The emotion that Michaelangelo, Donatello, and especially Leonardo show is just amazing. It's chilling, in the greatest way. They look like they're truly worried about their sensei, their father. You can't pull that off with the old foam-rubber suits, no matter how much I loved those. The CGI look of these Turtles is really great. There's so much more emotion to them now, and its really a great thing.The fight scenes are actually pretty awesome, and probably where most of the PG-13 rating comes from. There are times where the hits are pretty brutal, but in a good way. It's good for the fights to not just constantly be blows being deflected, but for there to actually be some hard hits.With the way the movie ends, they've definitely set up a sequel (which they obviously would with this being such a big franchise). We'll see if it does well enough, but you can sign me up to see another Turtles film done in this style. It was good fun.Overall, probably a 6.5/10. Not amazing, but just a fun Turtles film.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I did not like how they changed how the turtles were really brought into life from the OOZE. I don't know as a kid that is how it was and that is how I think it should have stayed instead of an experiment gone wrong. Shredder looked very good as did the turtles but they did go a little overboard with the characters. The foot clan was the WORST out of the WHOLE MOVIE. I remember them with steel masks not FAKE FACE MASKS and some not even wearing any. I don't know, I still gave it an 8 because the effects were great and the story was right to the point and not DRAGGED OUT FOR 2 hours.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
376,christopherpresscott,"Stop the Hate, This movie was amazing!",9,26 October 2014,"I read multiple reviews by ""Prolific Authors"" on IMDb about this movie before I started watching it. And I am pleased to tell you that almost as always, the critics are over-exaggerating the cons of this movie to make it look like a total waste of time. In reality though, it was one of the best summer flicks I watched this year. It had the action, it had the chemistry, and most of all, it had the professional Michael Bay special effects, that made it that much more unique. I have seen many other Michael Bay movies, and I know that he has had failures in this industry that has made him a negative title to be attached to a movie. But judging the present based on the past is not exactly reviewing a movie truly. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles still has the trademark Bay-explosions and the super hot chick. But this time, they both serve a purpose. They are there for a reason, and not just for the sake of blowing things up or getting guys excited. The depth of the character played by Megan Fox and the four turtles really amazed me. They had a solid character development, and the movie had laugh-out-loud moments that you would love your child to experience. It is totally worth your time and your children, and there is no explicit scenes or gore in this movie that might scare you to bring a child.That is another reason why this movie is absolutely amazing. Without showing gore or any visible blood, TMNT provides us with exhilarating action that actually makes you wonder about how the protagonists can possibly win the fight. Especially when Shredder fights all 4 turtles, the special effects are mind-blowing. And the martial arts feats demonstrated by both parties are astounding. Other than the action, the plot itself is simple but really effective. it does not bore someone, or give them deja-vu feelings (Like previous Michael Bay movies did). The turtles themselves will be very funny and emotionally attached. This film will entertain you for sure. The 9 out of 10 is perfectly deserved.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
377,Rockcomputers81,"Meh, the film is a mess.",5,22 August 2014,"The only time it is good is when the turtles are on screen and even then it's just OK. One really great action scene, when they are going down the mountain that is only 20 mins from New York who knew! Shredder is just a dumb robot who has no motivation for his plan at all. Megan Fox is awful. Will Arnett has nothing to do. Splinter is awful and a racist caricature. He is a just a rat who is not even Japanese and learns the ninja arts from a book in the sewer. Mikey is the only turtle with a true personality. Every one is else is barley a character with depth. On look Donny has glasses so he is a nerd. Ralph has anger problems. There is nothing more to any of them. The original film is so much better. The turtles feel like real characters, shredder is interesting and actually has a purpose. Splinter is wise and caring. It's a story about family The turtles real family VS shredders fake manufactured one. All the flashy CGI effects in the world can not make up for the lack of heart missing from this film.Please, if you have never seen the original one from 1990 go watch it. It is so much better then this.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
378,briannjs,Lame,4,30 November 2014,"it was really lame movie, the whole time i was watching it, I had no changes in my face expression. No thrills, suspension, laughs, smiles; cringed the whole time.Scenes were so foreseeable, and the lines the actors read are like for kindergarteners, Unless that is whom the movie is made for. storyline, predictable. An easy hero movie, that cannot get audience to agree with it.Lastly, the movie just couldn't get to me because i felt like i was with this kind of person who tries to be funny all the time, making jokes that are not funny, but thinks that is funny. So disappointed that I had to leave a bad review like this",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
379,tusharlalmohan,Ninjas kicking b*tt,8,7 November 2014,"Thank you IMDb, your 6 star rating made me watch the movie without much expectations. But it was fabulous. I do not understand why so many people are putting up negative reviews for this movie. It is a fun movie with brilliant action. The story isn't bad either. Yes, it is the usual good guys kick bad guys movie, but the story isn't as bland. I actually enjoyed this movie. Raph gives a really amazing speech towards the end, that I actually re-winded to listen once more. I wonder why this movie isn't counted among one of the better releases of 2014 yet. It is annoying when people speak highly for the over-rated and glamorized Avengers, but movies like these fail to stand up to their billings. Again, IMDb, what's with the 6 star rating? For starters this movie has MEGAN FOX in it! That itself should give the movie at least 4 stars, I give 4 more for the brilliance of the movie. Just kidding, the 8 stars exactly depict how much I enjoyed the movie, and I would recommend this to anyone who have loved the original TMNT series, and to those who would love some cool fun superhero action movie!

380,edisonlightinghouse,The Turtles are back! Cowabunga!!,10,8 August 2014,"I went into the Cinema, not knowing what to expect, the funny thing is online reviews seem to be negative while word-of-mouth is very positive.The movie was unexpectedly good, it is not a typical superhero movie, it is a movie filled with fun, laughter and action and it made me, a non-tmnt fan become a TMNT fan.The four turtles are extremely realistic, yes, they may look ugly but this is very down to earth because it shows why humans are afraid of them, they are no longer the cute, cuddly turtles we see on TV or on previous movies, they are mutated turtles which are not pleasant looking and packs a mean punch.Raphael seems to be the main character of the movie, showing huge emotional struggles and physical abilities throughout the movie, while Mikey often steals some limelight with his light-hearted jokes. Leonardo as usual, does his job well as the leader while the genius Donatello can always be counted on in terms of finding an escape route.Megan Fox's April O'Neal is surprisingly well-acted, she has matured as an actress, and her acting chops have improved. She is no longer the sex icon, and can be charismatic while fully cloth.Shredder is extremely terrifying yet still close to the roots as he is Asian and possesses extreme martial arts skill, other than his very advance armor.All in all, a very entertaining movie, where tense action sense is always accompanied with humour, jokes which sets the theater laughing every few minutes.The snow scene is extremely good, and easily the best action scene in a movie this whole summer.The Turtles are back, DUDE! True to the origin, with some new twist, which can create new fans(like myself) yet remind old fans of their childhood! Let's hope that there will be a sequel!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
381,Mdluffyonepiece,Turtle Power!,10,5 August 2014,"This is one of the funniest, light-hearted action films I've ever seen! Any person who screams this movie is screwing up their childhood or doesn't get the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is completely wrong. Kevin Eastman (co-creator of TMNT) has worked on this project since the very beginning and he along with Director Jonathan Liebesman delivered their best work yet.The cast and crew embraced the ridiculous nuance in the source material and made a better movie for it. Every joke works and the interaction between the 4 brothers is spectacular, you can tell these actors have wonderful chemistry! Megan Fox is fine as April O'Neil and that's the best compliment I can give her. Splinter is the wise mentor archetype but they have fun with him as well, including a hilarious pizza scene much in line with the Turtles past incarnations. In fact, there are a ton of nods to previous incarnations! Everything from the visual style of the Mirage Comics to the goofy antics of the original cartoon series. Even the 2003 Series and IDW Comics get their due!The action scenes were amazing, there is a nice balance between the fun 'video game' brawls and the more seriously bad-ass Ninjutsu duels! All the spectacle you'd expect from a big-budget Ninja Turtles story is there and better than ever. The CGI is up there with some of the very best. These Turtles were fully realized and crazy! I can't wait for the sequel and return of Turtle Power. Cowabunga!(10/10)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
382,mostwantedengineer,Not Bad but not the best,7,8 August 2014,"Good enough movie, full entertaining, great action and funny. i think this movie is recommended to see for a people who need an entertainment. i love Megan Fox so much, because she is so hot and mature and also her acting is a world class. and of course she makes this movie having more attraction.Michael Bay is involved in this film, so don't be surprised if you find the action scene looks like in his other great movies like transformer. and about the storyline, in my opinion it is good enough but too simple and predictable. and also the plot is too fast so make the movie quickly ends. maybe two hours running time is perfect.Overall this movie is recommended to watch. So funny, sexy (Megan Fox), great action and hilarious",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
383,vtortola,Horrible,1,6 December 2014,"When I watch a remake, I expect another angle, a darker or deeper story... That is why the Batman remakes were so good. In the TMTN comics, Splinter was a samurai master, and betrayed by Shredder almost died but he transformed in a rat and found the turtles. He trained the turtles to kill Shredder, to avenge him, it was not a bed story for youngsters, it was dark. This movie has nothing of that, plain argument, sexy girl... damn, what a waste of time. It makes me mad, not only the money spent, but the opportunity wasted... Bad actors, bad argument, terrible adaptation of the story, bad characterization of the protagonists... This movie is exactly the same thing than Transformers.Now I will have to wait 10 years hoping for a new remake like The dark knight...",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
384,quadrafx,A very good movie!,8,26 August 2014,"I have absolutely no idea why this movie gets so much hate. It was an awesome, entertaining and cursive movie. I even liked it more then Guardians of the Galaxy, which was all about jokes. Megan Fox is HOT, and there's nothing wrong with her acting neither. There were about 2-3 explosion in the entire movie, so you can't complain about that neither. I don't see anything wrong with this movie. The back story may have been changed but it was really good, nothing to complain about. The acting was good, the CGI was perfect, the turtles are not grotesque like some said, they look a bit more serious, still friendly but if they were more cartoony, than you would be complaining about that. The story was fine, of course it's about saving the city, but isn't every comic based on that? You cant turn a children's comic book into ""Dark Knight"" seriousness !!! I was a big fan of the turtles when i was a kid, and i still am, fantastic movie!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
385,glakhmed,"Fun, Fast Paced Movie",8,7 August 2014,"First off, to the Michael Bay haters, he didn't really have much to do with this Turtles movie. Jonathan Liebesman was the director. Michael was just one, of MANY, producers. Anyway, as an old turtles fan, I was really nervous about this movie going in. It took probably close to ten minutes to get rolling, since of course they ALWAYS have to give the back story, and I was starting to get nervous, but when it kicked in, it kicked in. The fast pace was a drawback to me early on, but it made the movie a great ride overall. Megan Fox did a great job as April, and though not red red like the cartoon, her hair was not black, but a very dark red. I'm still not a fan of the faces, but I thought the voice acting was pretty good, though the voice for Splinter just didn't fit. It's sad that there are so many pre-haters of this movie, because it's really a very enjoyable, fast paced 90 minutes. No, it's not going to win any major awards, but if you are like me and go to movies to escape for a couple hours and just have fun, I HIGHLY recommend this movie!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

387,stranie1,good with some good action & comedy,8,16 August 2014,"I don't know why so many negative reviews about this movie. My husband, kids and myself enjoyed and laughed throughout the movie. I like to see a movie that has some ""funny"" parts in it. Tired of the same old bam, bam, killing, techno movies of the generation today. It livens the show. YES, it does not follow the original TMNT life-line but overall not a bad movie. If a movie is rebooting from an original, it should follow some of the storyline of the original, but this one is totally a new storyline. Lots of action (you can see Michael Bay's work). Sorry Megan Fox, you are pretty to look at but acting is not your forte. The turtles' and Splinter's costume/face looks creepy/ugly. It's a good family/matinée type of movie. I would definitely see part 2 when it comes out in 2016!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
388,paulbhamence79-131-3635,mostly good,6,12 October 2014,"I liked what they did with the origin story, they developed the turtles appearance and character excellently, keeping their personalities original, so it was more familiar in that sense. Splinter looked/ acted like he should, I wanted his voice to be more like the 90s Kevin Clash's but hey, it was still pretty good. Some great action, a few decent laughs. The Shredder was badass, I liked that, but they could have made him more menacing with skill, ferocity and evilness rather than just making him a hybrid of Silver Samurai and a transformer. Raph having his redemptive ""I love you guys coz we're gonna die"" moment at the end was over done and a little shallow as far as writing goes. The only thing that really bothered me about the film was the plot that was basically a cut n paste from The Amazing Spider Man and various other films. Baddie tries to kill New York population, let's fight on top of building, get pwn'd by baddie, insert suspense, narrowly beat baddie, add huge insurance write off, save the day. It wasn't nearly as good as the first TMNT movie but much better than the sequels.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Moreover, I felt like the turtles were the bad guys, not the good guys .?? Anyhow, bad acting, especially Megan fox, bad script, mediocre directing .... The only good thing was the few laughs i got for Michaelangelo jokes.Finally, lets talk serious now, most of us who watched TMNT the movie, already know about the story of TMNT, so to wait 45 minutes for the director to show us their faces was boring, and frustrating, as i went to watch TMNT, not Megan fox ( sorry guys, but my wife reads what i write ) !?!?!?",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Surely it is a nice family movie and a movie children will enjoy. I am too old for this now, since I also used to watch the cartoons as a kid.Having that said, the movie portrays the 4 turtles and Megan Fox as a reporter which I guess was okay. Hot girl for young boys to watch. Further to that, the turtles were funny but nothing exceptional. The graphics were REALLY cool though and the beginning was also very nice, further than that, a very predictable, nothing wow type of movie! Seeing it was so upgraded, I thought it would be more targeted for adults, but I guess I was wrong. It REALLY IS A KID'S Movie. Enjoy!!! :)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
391,steve-2575,Great movie! They did it right.,9,8 August 2014,"Given the pathetically low advertising done for this movie, I had pretty low expectations going in last night. My 14 year old daughter came with me. (I think she went out of pity so I wouldn't be going alone!) What a surprise! The jokes were funny and well timed. The action was well carried out and not done just for the sake of having a fight scene. Nothing seemed forced or trying too hard. They really did a nice job.Megan Fox's April is a tough girl looking to make it as a New York City reporter. Fox's acting is spot on and the pace at which she learns about the Turtles makes the whole thing as believable as it can be for someone meeting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles :-) Here's something that made this movie terrific. The Turtles themselves were the most differentiated and developed characters that I've seen in any of the movies. The acting, script, and great costumes all contribute to letting you see their personalities and quirks in ways that I felt the previous films felt short on. I love the original movie but in this, their voices, height, mannerisms, etc., were all paid attention to and the movie took the time to let each of them become their own character. It is a great re-introduction to their individual personalities.To her great surprise, my daughter loved it too. I am not sure why the studio doesn't seem to be marketing this film to the next generation.It's a winner in my opinion! Go and enjoy!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
392,rj_klimpel,The turtles can still kick shell!,2,19 September 2014,"As a young man I was a great fan of the cartoon and was an even bigger fan of the motion picture. The turtles had an edge about them and their four personalities managed to cover about all I needed as a child. Having recently seen the old cartoons, I was disappointed at how lame they were, I mean ""cowabunga"" Jesus Christ! My favorite part about this entire production was the digging up and subsequent re animation of uncle Phil from the fresh prince of Bel air. (Voicing shredder again) This is his third time out of the pine box having been biggie smallz to name another reincarnation. He truly is the the best voice actorist going around these days and was far better than will smith (also known for his work as big Willie style I'm told). I will admit that some of the storyline - or 'plot' if you will - was largely irrelevant as with most big Hollywood productions that rely on how amazing the special effects really are. The cgi was what I have described in other media commitments as 'adequate'. Also, credit to Grant Bowler for his uncredited cameo in the sewer scene. As always top notch work from the faux Aussie. He really has come a long way since his bit part in wild hogs. I hear that there is also a character in the film 'sons of anarchy, I musical about being a motorbicyclist' based on bowler's struggles growing up as the only child in New Zealand to have training wheels still on his bike at age 32. Bowler is said to have approved the character providing that he is played by Harold from 'neighbors', known to some as 'Mad Dog Ring'ole'. This however is largely unconfirmed. As mentioned earlier, the four character traits portrayed in the film of the turtles suggest the director (whom I understand to be under the guidance and advice of James Cahill of ""Snitch'd"" gravitas) was trying to make a broad social commentary about the 4 rascally characters that seem to dwell in the subconscious of most balanced and unsettled humans. While he does miss the mark at points I feel that his point was made however clunky and tacked on it seemed. Many of the scenes featuring Casey Jones and Baxter stockman seemed tacked on and one particular scene in which they discussed the downfall of big business in relation to the global financial crisis just ended mid sentence. This to me suggested script problems and tired actors who had had enough of the (from what Hollywood insiders are describing) poor toilet facilities. Megan Fox as always however was stunning both visually and actoristically. Despite news reports that she was stealing muffins from the catering truck, Fox stole many scenes and the hearts of viewers worldwide, particularly with her musical number in the third to last scene. Many other sub-plots seemed out of place early on in the film. Of particular not was the idea that bebop and rock steady were searching for their natural birth mother while competing in an international snooker tournament. However, this was nearly tied up in the closing stages of the film during the scene in Bangladesh in the sweatshop/garment factory that was burned down while producing April O'Neal's yellow jump suits. All in all this movie was a rich tapestry of narrative and action that explored many themes. It asks the audience to look deep within to those areas often best left to be explored in the safe confines of a mental health practitioner's office. And as usual with anything involving a large talking brain controlling an over sized retard, more questions than answers. But I guess that leaves room for a sequel. They truly are heroes in a half shell... Turtle power!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I loved the cartoon series of the 90's and the early movies.But this.....this......they just destroyed the turtles, they were cool, funny, with some humor but here they are a mess, unfunny, pathetic, a gimmick of some kids who wants to act ""black"" and look cool, hip, swag...My favorite character Donatello looks like a damn geek/nerd with huge binoculars (glasses) and is basically Egon from Ghostbuster. I'm a fan of Ghostbuster but not a fan of a strange mix of the 2 franchise into a single ridiculous character.F@#K that movie!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Right, what we see on screen seems good and impressive. But the things that are really essential for the film are missing. The plot is boring, the jokes are weak and predictable, the soundtrack is an absolute catastrophe. I really wanted to like it but simply couldn't. I just waited for the movie to end to leave the cinema. There's no spark in this movie, it's lifeless. Can't recommend it to anyone. Oh, wait.

395,mr-sool,"Better than I expected, but there is a thing",6,30 October 2014,"The time and effort that was put into this movie is undeniable, and it was refreshing for its kind. There is something that bothered me from the start until the end that I couldn't help myself to just ignore, Megan Fox, despite the fact that she was a poor addition to the movie for her bad acting, her part was mainly to look good, way too good and the most important is to keep looking good even if she was falling from a snowy mountain for 5 minutes, hanging from a building struggling for life. You will find her make-up, clothes, hair almost perfect that makes you want to stop looking when the camera is on her to keep enjoying the movie.Now what I liked the most is the turtles characters, the nerd, the badass, the leader, and the funny guy. and they all ninjas, I loved it.I think in my personal opinion that this movie would have gained a higher rate if it cared more about making Megan look more real, no one comes out of the dirt clean, and no she doesn't need to be happy about it if she didn't want to look less clean, its a movie role. I really wanted to see more of the movie, but I don't think a part 2 (if any) will be better.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
396,xinloom,Shell shocked!,7,6 August 2014,"Okay, going in I knew Micheal Bay had a hand in the production of this movie so I let my expectations drop to the floor, we all know that famous scene from South Park, ""Those Aren't Ideas, They're Special FX!"". So when the movie opened with Megan Fox we know something will be like the transformers, so I brace myself for more action then story. Rightfully so there is more action then story in this Turtle movie, but for once I got a feeling that the action was not as offensive, and repetitive as it has been in previous 'Bay productions, and Megan Fox finally, kinda, in some ways was a normal breathing human.. Shredder got a transformer makeup, making him more robot in disguise then samurai on mutagen, but maybe they are saving that for the sequel? So with more action then story we have ninjas and explosions and more computer animated fightscenes then ever seen before in a supposed live-action movie, well if you don't count transformers of course, I know some people loved the transformer series, but me personally could just not stand them, here though, it works better because you can tell who is fighting who instead of a metal mess. The turtles have their personalities intact and are lovable and heartwarming. Had I been in the age 7-12 I would have loved this movie, no time is wasted on meaningless love affairs, or intellectual bla bla bla, its all blam blam thank you ma'am Sunday afternoon cartoon action, and its OK. I don't hate it, I don't love it. But its a nice ride, It does what it aims to do, entertain the younger audience, and thats all it seems to want to do, so with that in mind I give it a 7/10 because there are loads of movies who do not even hit the mark they aim for as well as this one does.If you enjoy the cartoons and want a live action version of it, this is it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
397,theLuauKing,One-Dimensional Hollywood Fluff with Lousy Writing and Over-the-top Action...(spoilers),3,8 August 2014,"I'm not even quite sure where to begin with this movie. I mean, I had decent hopes for it. Leading up to it, so many people seemed to be taking it way to seriously. I mean, come on. Its about giant talking turtles who fight crime. Its not supposed to be that serious. Hoo, boy.I guess I'll just start by saying this (spoilers ahead), the changes they made to the origin story don't make any goddamn sense, both in terms of simple logic and quality narrative structure. They completely removed any connection between Splinter and the Shredder, so say goodbye to any emotional connection or tension that that would have brought. And this version Splinter wasn't the ninja master, Hamato Yoshi or even a pet/student of Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi seems to have been omitted completely. So, how does Splinter become a ninja master himself? He reads a book. I'm not even joking. After both he and the turtles mutate he finds a book and teaches himself. And it wasn't even at the very beginning. I mean when Splinter begin teaching himself, the turtles are already walking and talking. He not only learned all of ninjitsu but also somehow mastered it, without any instruction or sparring, in less than ten years? AND he taught it to the turtles? BULLSHIT.The turtles themselves are one of the few not-terrible parts of the movie. All of there individual personalities are right where they should be but we are also kind of short-changed on the amount of interaction they have with each other. A bunch of brothers together, getting up to shenanigans? What a great, natural way to have conflict! But no, the movie follows April way too much.All of that is indicative of a larger problem with the writing. Both of the villains are BORING. The pacing is uneven and a lot of the dialogue is forced and ham-handed, Michelangelo was the worse in that respect. And believe me, I get it. Mikey is the loud mouth, party turtle. But is is possible (kind of necessary) that if a main character is annoying, to also be likable. Yes, it possible. Severus Snape. Perry Cox. Deadpool. These are all characters that are bad or annoying people but still likable as characters. After a few minutes of listening to Michelangelo, I just wanted him to shut the hell up. It doesn't get any better with the villains. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie with such boring villains. Instead of just sticking with one main villain, the Shredder, we now have two...for some reason. WE have Eric Sachs, who is a rich scientist/industrialist and the Shredder, an evil ninja master with no personality. Eric Sachs is working for the Shredder for money? But isn't he already like a billionaire with a castle on a mountain and his own skyscraper?Doe he need more money? What the hell for? Shredder is the most shallow and one-dimensional out of this whole damn movie. We're not really told anything of his back story or shown any of his motivation for anything. The foot clan is also no longer a group of ninja warriors, they're...guys with guns. Completely useless guys with guns (that'll be relevant later).They also unnecessarily tie April, Sachs and April's dad into the turtles' back story...for some reason. We don't even really meet April's father. And April is the one who saved them from the lab fire that killed her father...or wait, was it Eric who killed her father? The movie seems to confused on that point. And instead of keeping the baby turtles (like any little girl who likes animals would do) she...dumps them in the sewer? What the hell? The who thing is convoluted and doesn't make any damn sense.April O'Neil is uninteresting and stupid. Seriously, I mean she is unintelligent. She is supposedly an educated journalist but spends so much time trying to convince he boss of a ""story"" of talking, crime- fighting turtles without one single goddamn lick of evidence. Vernon Fenway is apparently supposed to be the comic relief but none of his jokes are funny and his sole role in the film seems to be driving April around. And why the hell is Whoopi Goldberg in this? She had like six lines. Why is she here?The camera-work was clichéd and chaotic. There were times when the camera was moving around too much for you to easily follow the action. There is also a serious lack of cool martial arts fights for a NINJA Turtles movie, which is not surprising when you turn their main antagonists from ninja into guys with guns. I also couldn't even begin to take the Shredder serious in the action scenes. Are those giant swiss army knives on his hands? What the hell?Finally, the one thing, in my opinion, that sort of breaks the movie the most is that they made the turtles too damn powerful. Yes, the turtles are kind of superheroes. But wasn't being a bunch of kick-ass ninjas enough? No? You gotta give them super strength too? AND MAKE THEM BULLET PROOF!? Remember the previously said bit about the foot being a bunch of guys with guns? Yeah...you might see where I am going with this. It was bad enough to see the turtles throwing cars around and shattering concrete with punches. On some level, the audience needs to believe on some sort of fundamental level that the heroes are danger, that the threats that they face have meaning. Without that, there is no tension, no real conflict and with that...no excitement. No story.This movie nuked the fridge.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
398,pokemark,Turtle Powerless,4,16 December 2016,"Michael Bay has a history of taking a much loved property and rebooting it while destroying everything that made it so loved and successful in the first place.Now it's the Turtles turn and although Michael Bay is only the Producer on this one it still suffers from all his trademark madness.Obviously the most important part of a TMNT movie is the Turtles right? not in this movie it isn't, it's April O'Neill who has top billing here and it's a disaster.The character is supposed to be a top investigative journalist but she is just so stupid, the only reason she is a credible reporter is that all her colleagues are even worse.Meagan Fox is terrible in this role, she might as well have been a cardboard standee for all the emotion on display. She has the same spaced out look on her face the whole way through. April is also very poorly written with no scenes of any real depth, You get the feeling that they knew Meagan Fox was to play her and knowing that she can't act, dumbed it down intentionally.Miss fox was cast for one reason, she looks hot in the advertising, something to draw in moviegoers who are then disappointed that in reality she isn't sexy at all because she lacks something that the original April, played by Judith Hoag, had in bucket loads, personality.Now we get to the Turtles themselves which are by far the worst versions of these characters to date. Firstly they look hideous, it's no wonder they live in the sewers. Secondly they also suffer from April's no personality syndrome, the exception being Michelangelo who is a total jerk who constantly makes sexual innuendos and jokes at inappropriate times destroying all the dramatic tension.The other main character is of course Shredder and it is he who suffers the most. William Fichtner's character Eric Sacks is the same main villain and appears to be Shredder until ii's revealed Shredder is actually just this guy stands in the corner.Unfortunately the terrible script is least of this movie's problems, it's real enemy is the CGI. Every time the turtles engage in any action it feels like a different movie as they fly all over the screen and the cameras spin around all over trying to distract you from how awful it looks.This becomes a real millstone around the movies neck and totally destroys the end of this movie. The final battle with Shredder looks like a video game, there's nothing real for the audience to connect with. The 1990 movie may only have had 2 guys in rubber suits hitting each other but you felt every contact.When you can't do better than a movie that was made 20+ years earlier, you have to wonder why they bothered making this in the first place.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

They actually focused on them being Teenage (Child-like, brash & arrogant)....Mutant (Bulky, ugly, tank-like beasts)....Ninjas (Inexperienced, but great at what they do). Their humor, combined with the action, is what makes it a TMNT movie. If you're a fan, you will truly enjoy it. Casual viewers might find it a bit weird, but the back story is decent enough to lay the plot, followed by great CGI, action sequences, and fun humor.It's the 2nd Best Turtles Movie ever, although I loved TMNT 2: The secret of the Ooze. The 2007 animated rendition is a better 'Movie', in my opinion, but it was darker and the Turtles were already established, after having slain The Shredder. In this movie they are kids, so its the beginning of their journey. The humans were good, but not great. William Fichtner was very good, Megan Fox did well, and the others played their part too. Shredder's voice was right for the part. Apart from a very cheesy, non-TMNT soundtrack, the movie was incredibly entertaining. Would have also liked Shredder to have a meatier role and more dialogue with the Turtles, since his voice was perfect. Also, Splinter's voicing (since he it was non-Japanese) and back story could have been better, although the new one fits the voice. Would have loved if they could have fit Casey instead of Vernon Fenwick's character, although Will Arnett did a good job. The movie had a different but decent back story and hopefully laid the foundation for a couple of sequels, with a few things tweaked, like an actual TMNT Soundtrack, and more characters. I just hope that people are not put off by the unnecessary hate and the -ve reviews. Guardians of the Galaxy, which is rightly ruling the box office at the moment, is not that much better, and is in fact similar to TMNT on many levels, while being worse at times too. This movie is well worth the admission price and deserves to be a box office hit, encouraging a must-have sequel, to further the Turtles' journey into legendary awesomeness.

400,music-959-776644,101min. Toy Commercial,2,25 February 2015,"The Turtles were originally made into TV cartoons to sell toys, which is a very effective strategy often used by the Pop Culture Illuminati to bore into kids brains. G.I. Joe and Transformers are other glaring examples of this. Though the TMNT franchise started out as a bona-fide indie comic book success story - basically created on a kitchen table by Eastman and Laird back in the '80s - it only reached Pop Culture icon status as part of a well-orchestrated toy merchandising campaign. As a result, TMNT is another summer toy movie that can't decide if it's animated or live action.The 3d looks 2d. Tedious digital rack focus and fake lens flares are tacked on in a desperate attempt to impart style to Lula Carvalhos' hackneyed cinematography. The arch villain Shredder comes off as something out of Power Rangers. Basically someone in a suit stomping around a miniature set, like the old Ultraman. The Turtles' characterization doesn't help to give them personality either and they can only be told apart by the color of their bandannas.Megan Fox as the only standout provides tame sex appeal. This is paradoxically a good role for her and jives well with her Transformers past. Her crossing of the desert must be over as Michael Bay and the Hollywood bigwigs have re-evaluated her box office draw despite the 5 or so last bombs she did (Jonah Hex anyone?) It's too bad Minae Noji as Kari doesn't quite come off as the hot villainess. Poor costume design hid rather than highlighted her assets. The rest of the cast is forgettable. (Is Whoopie Goldberg secretly one of the turtles?) Sophomoric humor, great for 9 year olds or mentally equivalent adults.The opening titles are the best part of this 101-minute toy commercial.Review by Mike Hammer",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
401,osvaldoebg88,"Disappointed,Horrible,Disgusting",1,10 April 2020,"How can I describe something as bad as this movie? First, I must thank the team that made the turtles and the master Splinter, because they did the worst job in the history of cinema. Do you remember the masks in the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1990? In this film, the characterization was 100 times better than the 3D work they did in this film. I only have one word to describe this project: Crap",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
402,Nickkford,"Decent CGI, utterly cheesy.",6,31 October 2014,"Granted it is supposed to be a child friendly movie, but all the cheesy lines and crummy jokes. Megan fox was disappointing as well, but it seemed to be more her lines and the way it was written.The only redeeming factor is the CGI. It is quite well done. They really Disney'd the combat though, but that is to be expected with children's movies.In fact, what little hype it managed to generate from the trailers was rapidly dissipated during the opening scene, and went negative for every minute after. This is all after thoughts though, while watching the movie it flows decently smooth, smooth enough to keep your mind off the sub-par production.Well enough made to keep your attention for the hour and forty minutes, but try to forget it as soon as you're done watching, thinking about it only further disintegrates the plot.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
403,Coreytheguy,Form Your Own Opinion- Bandwagons Are Lame,10,11 August 2014,"First and foremost, for whatever reason, critics have done all they can to bash this movie. This movie is not the disgraceful failure they would have you think it is. In fact, when audiences (not critics) were polled by CinemaScore after seeing this movie, the overall grade was a B. Some people have said that this movie is ""formulaic"". Of course it is. It's the first installment of a superhero movie. The formula exists, and it was in Ironman, Spider-man, Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, etc. This formula is: introduce characters, supply familiar plot, use some source material. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did the crowd in the theater that night. There were a lot of laughs, which were in response to Mikey most of the time, and there was a little clapping session when the credits rolled. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when people laugh and clap, they can't be bored, can they? The voice acting was spot on. The fighting scenes were pretty cool, and Splinter has some nice moves. My only wish is that there were more fight scenes. The turtles looked great to me, but some people are bothered by their design because they look ""weird"". They're turtles that were mutated to the point of having arms, legs, vocal cords, etc. Of course they're weird. The plot is decent. You have to realize, this isn't Inception or anything like that. This is an action movie with talking turtles and Megan Fox. It's not trying to be complicated. Speaking of Megan Fox, she wasn't bad in this movie. She held her own. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. DO yourself a favor. Don't be sheep. Don't jump on the bandwagon and hate this movie because critics told you to. Form your own opinion. Don't miss out on a good time because it was produced by Michael Bay. Bay did not write or direct this movie. He does not act in it, he has not part in this movie, aside from the money he paid to have it made. Give it a chance and decide for yourself whether it was good or bad. Don't let critics dictate watch you like or dislike. Have Fun!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The movie feels like it's so short, it's like a long trailer. The CGI characters look like they ware based on every African-American stereotype, they almost never stand still and there is almost no evolution of relationship between all of the characters in the movie. Other characters act so stupidly and unrealistically it's just sad and hard to watch. It is also obvious that many scenes ware cut out of the movie. the only good thing about this movie are a few good jokes and some cool action scenes but that's it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Instead we are fed an endless supply of visual with no real meat behind them.These guys took a great storyline (original TMNT), chewed it up with a heaping helping of green screen and CGI, and dumped this load on us. Then to add insult to injury, they cast Meghan Fox as the lead. Don't get me wrong... I am a ""red blooded male"" through and through, so I appreciate the fact that she is incredibly beautiful... but let's face fact. Meghan Fox is at best a ""one line of dialogue"" extra. The girl can't act!

There weren't to many funny things, in fact Mikey seems to be the only one who puts in comedy. The story was in my mind well thought out and executed. I will say Splinter initially gave me shock when I saw how realistic they were in the morphing of human and rat, but I liked it. I always wanted people to show realistically how thing would look and they did. Michelangelo, Rafael, Donatello and Leonardo were done is the same realistic manor, though not as shocking as Splinter. The graphics were amazing, I watched in Real D 3D, so I noticed the little details fairly quickly. The story was overall maybe a little spotty but it continued forward nicely and I wasn't lost at any point. All together I really liked the move and plan on buying it on DVD or Blue Ray.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
407,dnel-s,"Talking, walking, pizza eating turtles",5,10 August 2014,"I am not a professional reviewer what so ever, I'm just a regular movie lover. So please don't hate me for not writing a good review. Don't hate and have a nice day! Talking, walking, pizza eating turtles. The premise alone is stupid enough for someone not to take this seriously. The problem is that the movie takes itself way too seriously and it makes no sense. Or maybe I am wrong for trying to find some sense in a movie about 6 feet tall talking turtles. But the movie doesn't even makes sense in its own universe in terms of consistency. At one time in the movie Shredder is wrecking all the turtles at once, and the next moment he is getting his a$$ kicked by the stupidest trick.As for the turtles them self, I would say they did a pretty good job capturing their different personalities. But, while they did a good job at making the turtles believable, they managed to do the opposite with Shredder. I didn't really watch the TNMT cartoons so I don't know that much about Shredder, but if he is as stupid and nonsensical as he is in this movie, then no wonder he never wins. Cause the plan that he has is really stupid, I mean like damn stupid, on a The Amazing Spider-Man 1 level of stupid. The acting in the movie is, tolerable. Megan Fox as April O'Neil is only there to be looked at and to get teenage boys to see the movie. April could have been played by someone else, but to be honest, it would have made much of a difference. I did like the new designs for the turtles. They look bad-ass, probably how a bunch of mutated turtles would look like if they were real, with exception of Donatello, he looked stupid with hes glasses. This is very much a Michael Bay movie, even though it is not directed by him. There is a action scene, a pretty cool one to be honest, where Megan Fox is leaning out of a vehicle to take some picture or what not, and meanwhile she is doing that the camera focuses of her ass from inside.. They even blow up a car at the end for no reason what so ever.I would say go see this movie if you know nothing about the Ninja Turtles, but if you do, you would probably hate this. The comedy can be pretty cringe worthy at times, but it is not bad enough to ruin the rest of the movie. As long as you don't thing about the stupid a$$ plot and why it is happening, then you will be fine.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

From the constant flirting with Megan Fox to the hip hop Christmas album joke I felt that Mikey really carried the film. Also with the amazing graphics in the snow battle was totally EPIC. A very settle comeback for the TMNT remake. Also the casting of Megan Fox helped by drawing me to this movie. The personality of the brother really impressed me from Raphael aggressive moods to Leonardo leadership and determination amazed me to be more active into the franchise. This film DESERVES a 10 in my eyes as a great family movie.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
409,agnivesh-mishra,Didn't disappoint,8,23 August 2014,"I am pretty surprised with the harsh and overly negative comments that this movie is receiving from some of the other authors. My friends and I enjoyed the movie and , as a childhood TMNT fan, I wasn't as disappointed as others.I loved the visual effects in the movie as well as the humor and ninjitsu skills of our turtle heroes. Megan Fox didn't disappoint as well, although I do think she could have done a better job settling into her character. Their could have possibly been more character development on Shredder. I think it would have been better if their was a little more attention given to his character's storyline; nevertheless, I still think he was a strong villain given his amazing martial arts skills, his resilience (demonstrated by his survival despite falling of a skyscraper), as well as his cunning acumen.I think the movie writers wanted to add a different twist to the TMNT saga in this edition departing from the traditional storyline for the series. It appears most people, harsh critics in particular, wanted to view the movie from a pre-established lens derived from their early years comprehension of the TMNT storyline, and were frustrated when they found that this movie didn't necessarily adhere to that structure. While I understand that people generally wish to have orthodox story lines preserved for their favorite stories, I don't think it's appropriate to be so negative or harshly critical of a movie primarily because of a change in its story format and whose producers did a good job (IMO)on an otherwise nice movie.Yes,I agree the storyline could have been a bit more interesting; again, however, I really don't think it was as bad to have deserved such harsh criticism.Also, I see no reason why Splinter or the turtles could NOT learn ninjutsu within a couple of years, especially if we consider Tom Cruise mastering the arts of a Samurai in a couple of months and defeating the Samurai master Ujio in The Last Samurai, or Jaden Smith's ability to learn Kung fu within some months and winning a junior championship in China in the Karate Kid, etc. Bottom Line, if you want to like this movie, watch it through a fresh set of eyes without letting prior story lines or character backgrounds influence your perspectives. This is a movie for all ages and is sure to ensure some good laughs! I recommend ..",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
410,michaelmiranda34,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,1,14 August 2014,"Cast: Megan Fox,Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Pete Ploszek, Johnny Knoxville, Jeremy Howard, Danny Woodburn. Director: Johnathan LiebesmanSynopsis: The villainous criminal organization known as the Foot Clan has been terrorizing New York City, led by the ruthless Shredder. Beneath the sewers, the rat Master Splinter (Danny Woodburn) has been training his four sons until they are ready to take Shredder on and become heroes.ReviewJohnathan Liebesman has possibly ruined the camp humor filled childhood of all Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan. He brings us alien faces in alien territories, facing alien opponents. When crime increases in New York City, reporter April O'Neill (Megan Fox) is on the case. There's only one problem with this: she's not an investigative reporter. She gets the grunt work of news and only jumps headlong into the crime story to try and be given better stories than the typical light hearted assignments given to her. While New York is falling apart, there is only one man in the city who is confident enough to reassure everyone that things are fine and that his security implements are working; Johnathan Sachs. Growing up having watched the original live action movies from the 90s, and the animated film that came out after them, TMNT Turtles Forever, this movie not only gives them a bad name but makes me hang my head in shame that my favorite heroes in a half-shell have been given such cruel treatment in this movie. This movie should be taken out of theaters and burned, never to ruin the dreams of avid Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fans again. I wish I could say that there was a lot that stood out, but alas I'd be lying. There was never enough time to get to know the characters, they were all cardboard with no real conflict. Megan Fox was an absolute joke in this movie and you could tell they borrowed some Batman Begins ideas. If you aren't creative enough to write a movie that stands alone on its feet, do the world a favor and don't make it. The one thing that you noticed was that the turtles..were kind of the same as they had always been. Donatello was the nerd, Raphael was the asshole without a cause, Leonardo was the leader and Michael Angelo was the skater/surfer boy that was always cracking jokes. That is the only tip of the hat I will give to this film. From its gross prejudice of Japanese culture (an American rat that just so happened to dress like a Japanese Master and speak in an American accent) to the total annihilation of the origin story for the turtles and the rat,to the complete disrespect they showed the Shredder character (he wasn't even the main villain!). This movie is a complete embarrassment. The above isn't even all that was wrong with the film, there was so much action you had no time to take a breather and get to know anyone, at all, in the slightest. The villains they made you believe had huge parts, had absolutely no foundation and were just awkwardly placed there to fill spots. The action too, was so heavily splashed in there that frankly, it just annoyed me. Imagine every single Jason Statham movie crammed into one 90 minute block without any foundation, and you have this movie. Then they had this OTHER foundation there about April's dad knowing the bad guy? And April having the turtles and rat as pets..kind of. I don't know. There were so many loose threads there I could've sewn a sweater. Hell, I would've given it a chance if anyone else but Fox played April. April was a great character and she was so great in the series and the 90s films. But this one was so transparent I thought she was a ghost. It doesn't help I hate Megan Fox with a passion, especially after reading that she told the fans of the original series to go screw themselves if they didn't like the movie. Megan Fox, here is a novel idea: instead of showing everyone that you are a hack with nothing to show for your popularity but a marginally pretty face and a nice body, why not try ACTUALLY acting? Novel idea, but please, try and run with it. I plead with you to save your money and go see something else. Anything else, go pay circus clowns to sleep on the floor at a Denny's, it'll be way more entertaining than the ninety minutes of my life this movie took away.This is possibly the worst movie of the year, and it is a complete insult to anyone who truly loved the camp and comedy the original turtles brought so many many years ago.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

As a business person, I could not, for the life of me, figure out the target market while watching it. The script was stupid humor for little boys, but the scenes were full of death, torture, and dark negativity. I could not imagine allowing a child to watch this movie. And as adult, it had no entertainment value. Note: I watched the original last month, and it was still a great movie.

For example, the main bad guy Eric Sachs - or whatever his name is - creates this amazing chemical drug, and then, instead of just selling it decides to poison the whole city in order to sell the cure.So imagine that terrible story wrapped around any generic action film you've ever seen.Whhhhhhhhyyyyy!!??Splinter - and therefore the turtles - learn their ninja skills from a jujitsu book found in the sewer....that was it for me. Dire.Splinter looks repulsive if I'm being honest, too say he's the ""wisest"" of them all, he looks the least human. Again, because Splinter is a rat that has learnt his moves (and his apparent ability to speak having been raised by himself) from a soggy book in the sewer, we have no back story. Terrible.The whole film just seems rushed from start to finish. Very patchy, it feels like your watching a film with lots of scenes cut out of it, e.g. like character development.There is hardly any character development here. Like none.I thought Shredder was awesome. I thought the turtles were pretty good too.The film just so much wasted potential which makes me angry. The Batman films, successful right? Why couldn't we have gone down that route at all? I'm praying for the day we go down that route. Even Planet of the Apes is slightly realistic.I'm hoping the next Turtles is more developed and has way more action in it.Michael ""yeah, I make it rain, who cares about integrity of a film"" Bay, how could you do this to my beloved franchise.People will say ""but look how much money it made!""Yeah exactly, but imagine how much more you'd make on word of mouth if people said ""that movie was awesome, you should go see it"", that's exactly what is happening with Guardians of the Galaxy.

The biggest problem was Will Arnett . Holy crap was he bad. I felt whenever he delivers a comedic line I was supposed to laugh, but he was so bad at acting that he couldn't even deliver a funny line correctly. This movie was DEFINITELY not his cup of tea, especially when he tried to hit on Megan Foxx who is 15 years younger than him. Shredder was even a character. I wished shredder was the main bad guy and the movie would've been solid. Megan Foxx was pretty good as April Oneil, but the highlights of the movie, was the turtles.

I believe most people do not realize this (as she was so gorgeous all the way), to me she was quite distracting in this movie, not in a good way. I felt that she wasn't engaging on the role. So her expression and acting didn't go with the flow somehow. In the first fifteen minutes of the movie, I felt that the movie zoomed in too much on her expression, that was when I realized that her expression a little unnatural, almost emotionless, not engaging in the movie, almost bored me.

They looked cool and were the most entertaining characters by far. Mikey was funnier than he was obnoxious and Alan Ritchson(?) pulled off a suiting Raphael. The low part of the turtles I thought was Johnny Knoxville's voice for Leonardo. I felt it didn't fit. The fact that the turtles were teenagers if today resonated well also. I was impressed their was a WuTang reference. More pluses include the action sequence and fx. They were both well planned out and on point, but the plot, oh the plot. This brings me to the minuses. The plot seemed quite stretched to make Megan Fox's April character carry more value in the storyline of the turtles. Also I know the demographic for these films is always a young one but the dialogue concerning the story was far too simple and laid out for the viewer. A lot was conveyed by means of telling instead of showing. Especially when Splinter was around. Jesus Splinter needed something different going for him in this movie I found he was a weak point in voice acting and his place in the movie in general. All in all I enjoyed the film.

It doesn't deviate much from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles story. It contains all the main characters including Splinter, Shredder and April O'Neil. It also presents us a background story with an explanation as to how the mutant turtles were created. It doesn't promise more than what it delivers. A very entertaining but rather lengthy movie with a few funny scenes. They made sure through those funny scenes that we understand those turtles are young teenagers.

The story was kind of generic for an action movie, you know, bad guys get stopped by heroes, heroes get their base infiltrated, heroes are in peril, then heroes save the day. The Shredders costume was kind of over the top, not in the good way.The pros, well surprisingly there was a lot pros for a Micheal Bay movie. The turtles voices, personalities, and body figures were perfect to each turtle. The plot is finally easy to understand unlike regular Mike Bay movies.

422,grace-saia05,Not totally disappointed,7,17 August 2014,Today I went to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Although the characters were undeveloped (bad guys mainly) and the story was basic it did have a good closeness between the brothers and their father. I walked into the theatre with no preexisting opinion about the series. Being my first TMNT movie I didn't know what to expect but I have to say I wasn't 100% disappointed. The beginning starts out with the comic book pages flashing across the screen and from there it takes a good amount of time for the protagonists to show their face. The movie then begins to develop Will Arnett and Megan Fox's characters. Contrary to what you may think Will didn't have very many comedic lines. Michelangelo seemed to be more of the funny man. I was never really bored during the film but I wasn't entertained by the movie. I spent most of my time laughing at Megan Fox's character or admiring how advanced special effects have become over the years. The action did keep your eye but it was hard to understand what was happening at times. The hardest thing I found about this movie was remembering what each turtle was doing at the same time. Right when I thought this was like any other superhero action film with a reptile-y twist I noticed the great bond between the brothers that made this movie worth the money. I would not go see this movie twice but I defiantly don't regret seeing it. :),Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
423,trunks1686,Disappointed,1,17 August 2014,"So disappointed. I understand now why people were so harsh on Megan Fox and Michael Bay when this movie was first announced. Does Fox always pant so hard in her other movies? That's all she did in this one. Too many references to previous movies, cartoons and the comics. Biggest issues: it took almost 30 minutes before they actually showed the turtles. Why? They made it all about April. Then when they did show them the majority of the time it was during fights and the camera kept moving around too much you couldn't see anything. No Foot clan ninjas???? They were face panted, military wannabes. Why?? Fox's constant heavy breathing/panting. The turtle design...they look like Shrek. Lacking in actual personalities. I love Raph but this one was so one dimensional with a poorly written 'I love you guys' speech at the end. Leo wasn't a leader. Mikey was a gangster and Donny....poor Donny. Stereotype geek who didn't create anything or tinker with tech. Broken glass?? The 18 wheeler staying on its wheels going down the hill? Really people? Really? Not even good for fiction. Then there was the falling of the tower then POOOF!!!!! There on the ground. Falling but no impact on the ground??? They're just there. No injuries? And no people around to see them but there were people when the building was falling down and when Shredder hit the ground??? This movie had potential but the writing was just terrible. And they targeted 'younger' crowd BUT made it pg13?????",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
424,kenziebaxter1313,Horrible Movie,1,13 September 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been around for many years and many kids have enjoyed it very much. Those children must be severely disappointed with this horrifying display of a once semi-interesting story line. Honestly, the new animated TMNT Nickelodeon TV show is better than this movie, and that show has some very questionable and disturbing things. For one thing, what kind of writer has plot changing scenes that are all based on conveniently placed objects or stupidity of characters? I mean really, the rat conveniently discovers an advanced ninjitsu book in a sewer? What did Jackie Chan drop his hand book last time he wrestled a crocodile? And what kind of evil mastermind, who doesn't want anything getting in his way and wants all the turtles dead, would settle for a simple ""yeah, that turtle is dead"" and not even attempt to be completely certain and just basically is completely okay with that? Not only are the fight scenes terribly disappointing and short, but the jokes aren't even laugh worthy. While sitting in the theater, not even a pity laugh was uttered after the failed attempt at humor. If there is one thing TMNT is known for, it's the humor, specifically Michelangelo's jokes. It's really pathetic when the only jokes the, theoretically, funniest character can come up with are potty humor and stupidity. Nickelodeon is more clever than that, and they didn't even have as much money on the line. Yeah, the box office results for TMNT are huge, but just think about it. Box office results tell you how many people went to see the movie, not how many people actually liked the movie walking away from it. It makes you ashamed to have participated in the box office results that are leading more people to waste their money on this movie. So, basically, if you are a TMNT fan from childhood, don't waste your time if you haven't already made that mistake. And don't fool yourself into believing it's a good movie simply because you hoped it would. I would say, don't waste your time or money. I'm sorry for those of you who actually liked this movie. It is just simply disappointing, and I guess an opinion is an opinion. I just hope that you won't have to walk away wishing you hadn't walked in in the first place.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
425,Marcussense,I had high hopes for this remake of a classic,4,9 October 2014,"I had high hopes that this movie was going to be good. I grew up watching TMNT cartoons and had all the action figures. 45mins into the movie, I realized I had made a mistake of purchasing a ticket. The only good part in my opinion was seeing Master Splinter fight Shredder. I could tell Will Arnett was trying his hardest to make every scene he was in the best scene, because he knew the rest of the movie was going to awful. His jokes and quirky personality was honestly the best acting in the whole movie. Megan Fox once again proves to the audience that she is unable to grasp the concept of good acting. I felt like this movie was Transformers, but instead of machines fighting it was turtles. Michael Bay has really once again ruined CGI for me. He must think, the more CGI the better. I stayed through the whole movie and regretted I did. I could not ask for my money back. Cheesy one liners that didn't even resemble the TV show or comics. Michelangelo only says his catch phrase once in the movie, during the boss battle after a cheesy buildup. Horrible movie. STOP MAKING REMAKES OF GOOD MOVIES!!!!! Come up with something original.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
426,raylaena,"Not too horrible, but could have been better",7,20 December 2014,"I liked some of it, however, there were certain things I wish would have been different. (Spoiler Alert) First, how they made the turtles and Splinter. The turtles don't look like turtles, they look like they're on steroids and Splinter looks like he did in the original 80's version (which wasn't that great). Why did they give Donnie glasses?? Why didn't they use the VA's from the Nickelodeon cartoon version? Those voices seem to have suited their characters a LOT better. Why was Whoopi Goldberg in the movie? She doesn't seem important at all. Was she just there for the very small amount of humor? Overall, I'm not as excited about seeing it as I originally was. I honestly hoped it would have been better than it turned out to be.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
427,moosedal,2 hour long commercial,4,4 June 2015,"Even when Michael Bay doesn't direct a movie, he still directs a movie. He is the Wormtongue of summer blockbusters, hiding in the shadows and controlling the production from there, right down to the hired actors. Many Bay mainstays are here; Megan Fox, William Fitchner, Madison Mason...etc. None of the goofy comradery that was so prevalent in the first 2 turtle movies was here, and Megan Fox must have won a poker game or something to have landed this role. I was also unaware that there was bluetooth in 1999. (watch carefully when Splinter is telling April his life story)And why does Fitchner always play the ""bad guy""?also, product placement, sooo much product placement.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
428,hannahwasabi,Movie is not as bad as everyone here is saying,7,3 June 2016,"If you watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a child, and with the same mindset you had when you were a kid you would actually appreciate this movie. I am not saying this movie was the greatest thing to hit theaters. But the characters stayed true to their cartoon characters. Michelangelo IS the funny and laid back character who loves pizza. Donatello IS the smart nerdy type. Raphael IS the easily angered brother always wanting to lead. Leonardo IS the serious leader type. They stayed true to the characters. It was a fun and light take, more modernized than the show was. The story changed a bit. This is something kids would like to watch and allows them to share with their parents. So if you watch this movie expecting something phenomenal and Oscar worthy or what ever, it's not going to be. If you watch this movie to share in memories and have something nostalgic it does the trick. I enjoyed the movie. It brought back some old memories of when my brother and I watching this show after school.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

If Michael Bays goal was to create a good looking movie with zero plot, he succeeded. The Shredder has zero back story and his motives are completely unclear. Fans of the comics will find no semblance of the original comics story lines. Meghan Fox is in the movie and gives a Sharknado worthy performance. As a TMNT fan it had moments that made me chuckle. Overall a thoughtless stinker of a movie. Proves that the TMNT title alone will get you big box office numbers. Nostalgic 30 somethings like me will always continue to shell out (pun intended) money hoping to relive their childhood.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

If I were the director I'd be embarrassed that my name was on it. The moronic dialogue, sexist jokes, non-existent plot, aside; what was with all the guns!? The Foot Clan were martial arts thugs not mercenaries with machine guns. The 80s cartoon/movie was at least credible in the fact that it tried to teach kids some sort of moral lessons about family & honour.

434,jaydenlundbom,"""The Last Airbender"" of TMNT Movies",1,4 February 2021,"I call this ""The Last Airbender"" of TMNT Movies because the amount of dislike that movie receives is what I feel for both this movie and its sequel. Never in my life had I ever been so disappointed in a film than this one. Yes, it tries something different and I can give the film credit for that, but that doesn't save this movie. The faces on the turtles are absolutely ugly and it feels like they went out of their way to make them as horrid as possible. There are several 'emotional' scenes that all fall flat, and never does it feel like there's any real danger happening. The worst of these 'emotional' scenes was towards the end where the turtles are falling and Raph decides to have this whole speech and the whole scene comes out of nowhere and adds nothing to the already lacking character development that the film doesn't have. The one saving grace from this movie is the elevator scene, which I generally enjoyed and is probably the only thing people remember about this film. Well, besides the hideous turtles of course.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
435,Catoleptic,Ruination devoid of any life.,3,11 January 2015,"As a fan of the Eastman / Laird franchise growing up, I have to say that this is a heartbreaking rendition of TMNT. What it lacks most is giving the turtles any redeeming character qualities at all. There are no accents, no jokes, no camaraderie, no team up fighting moves. Nothing No reason at all to fall in love with them. Shredder did look pretty cool in some of the scenes, but just another lifeless CGI character at the end of the day.The CGI characters are highly stylized, but no one should really care because none of them have any personality worth defining, in fact, all of the voices and accents are literally the same. Who cast this turkey?Arnett and the broad are absolutely horrible actors in this, and at least Arnett can do better, but since there was zero comedy in the role, no doubt he had trouble motivating himself for any reason whatsoever.If you really want to invest any time in TMNT, watch the earlier movies with men in suits and animatronic masks put out by Henson Creature Shop. Funnier, better fight scenes (although not taken serious), so many more reasons to actually like the turtle characters, even Shredder, who has next to zero character development in those films, is a hundred times more sophisticated.Better yet, go read the early black and white comics where the turtles absolutely bristle with character.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
436,OcelotProblems,A bonding moment with my son!,9,11 August 2014,"I took my 4 year old son to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and had a blast. We gave high fives, air punched during the fight scenes, and he was practically dancing in his seat by the end. Don't go to this expecting an overly complicated story - full of foreshadowing and surprises, go to this to watch CGI turtles eating pizza, telling bad jokes, and roundhouse kicking bad guys. I really enjoyed the few scenes that were recreated from the earlier movies/series, and loved hearing my son laugh, just as I did 25 years ago. It was a trip down memory lane. While some balk at the more imposing size and build for the turtles, I say... They are freaking turtles! These turtles look more realistic than the slimmer earlier versions, why over think it?I will admit, the Shredder felt a bit off, like he may have gotten lost at the Transformers casting, but my kids found him as menacing as I found the original when I was a child. My wife was the only one who enjoyed Will Arnet, reaffirming her terrible taste in men. I also felt the foot clan were very forgettable without their trademark uniforms.After reading reviews by people who are paid to write them, and the rest of us who aren't, I can't help but wonder why all the narcissists bothered watching at all. TMNT isn't supposed to win an Oscar, it's made to entertain children, and hark-en back to our own childhood entertainment. While I might not remember the jokes next week or the film at all in a month or two, I will cherish the time I spent air punching with my son while CGI turtles beat up bad people because it's fun.In the words of my 4 year old son: Its kinda cool, I liked it Daddy.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
437,son012189,A Story Written in the Corporate Boardroom!!!!,1,29 August 2015,"The script for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) was written during a corporate boardroom meeting at Paramount Studios. Like all lame, boring, stupid boardroom meetings, people (with no artistic talent) take turns blurting out the dumbest ideas. That is why we should not be giving non-artists such as MBA wallstreet types any creative control. They come up with the dumbest ideas with no respect to the source material. This movie is nothing more than a cash grab.Allow me to explain everything wrong with this piece of garbage. The casting is terrible. Whoopi Goldberg? Will Arnett? Megan Fox? Sounds more like the cast for a TMNT parody. Megan Fox displayed her worst acting to date. The ridiculously cheesy dialogue kept me cringing through the entire movie. ""the 99 cheese pizza"", the stupid elevator beatbox scene, the gwen stefani scene. This movie has FLAT OUT HORRIBLE!!! Fart jokes and pop culture references are NOT funny. I'm sure the actors felt embarrassed reciting their lines.The worst part is the &%#($(*# flying skateboard that Michelangelo has. It took away any sense of realism. I know TMNT isn't supposed to be realistic but the dumb flying skateboard is beyond ridiculous. Some guy who was on drugs probably came up with that idea in the boardroom. All the turtles acted and were designed to look like bad black stereotypes. They made Michelangelo look like Lil Wayne. Giving the turtles ""SWAG"" in order to appeal to a younger audience is just stupid. The turtles never had swag and making them into a parody of the Cash Money / Young Money crew is a terrible idea. The dumb hipster glasses on Donatello in order to appeal to the hipster crowd is another bad idea. Why the *&%* did they give him a stupid ghost busters backpack. The cheesiness of this movie is way over the top. The TMNT trilogy of the early nineties was cheesy too but not on this level. At least it didn't have #*($^$ flying skateboards and swag turtles.This movie represents everything wrong with the movie industry today. The corporate big wigs make all the creative decisions. It's time for the artists to take Hollywood back.CREATIVITY IS BORN OUTSIDE THE BOARDROOM!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
438,rnunner,Just Right.,8,8 August 2014,"This movie was GREAT! Again the critics have it all wrong. I grew up in the TMNT generation and the movie was fantastic. The Origin story changes were GOOD ENOUGH and the comedy/action was superb. The turtles looked great and had a amazing presence on screen. If I HAD to pick apart anything, Shredder could have been bigger, the Turtles dwarf him, and the Raph ""love speech"" could have been a line or two shorter and still achieved the same humerus effect. This film brought me back to my childhood and I have to thank Mr. Bay for exceeding my LOW LOW expectations with this fantastic movie. Sure it was a little campy, but its a movie about Mutant Turtles! Come On! Critics are way to hard on this movie.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I like how they tied April O'Neil's past into the turtles and Splinter! I felt like this movie did a better job at explaining the background of the turtles than the 90s movies did. I hope we get a sequel involving the history of Shredder and maybe some new mutant animals! I enjoyed the movie and the entire audience was always laughing and even clapped after the elevator scene!

442,rochey_evertoneva,"Brilliant Film, but not for fanboys.",8,30 December 2014,"There are a number of bad reviews for this film. I have read many of the user reviews below and felt compelled to write my first ever review. If you are a massive fan boy and obsessed with TMNT then there's a good chance that you won't like this film because the story line doesn't fit with the original comic/cartoons. If you watched the cartoons as a kid and enjoyed them, but wasn't obsessed with them, then you'll probably love this film. As far as I am concerned it contains everything you need. Brilliant humour, a good storyline and cool action scenes. It doesn't lag and most scenes and sequences are straight to the point. The pace of the film is good and you don't get bored waiting for something to kick in. As I have said above if you're looking for a nice film to enjoy then this is it. If you're a stickler and obsessed with it being identical to the original then you may be disappointed. If you're watching it with your children then they will probably love it. It's full of silly fun. Seriously, how serious can a film be about mutant ninja turtles? The only thing I was disappointed about was that there was not much back story to Shredder and he's not in it much. Which is disappointing because you need that hatred for him to make the film better. Also, contains standard Michael Bayisms.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
443,christhacker,Great movie,7,8 August 2014,I was not sure if I was as excited as some fans were when I heard this movie was coming out as I was a fan of the original movie and cartoons in the 80's but I am not usually a fan of reboots. This was a bit of a surprise to Me.There are a lot of things the older fans who grew up with Ninja turtles in the 80s and 90s can enjoy both from the older movies like scenes that pay tribute to the movies and characters that were in the 80s Cartoon.The Plot was Good from a standpoint that it didn't spend the whole movie on the origin and while they did tweak the story a bit it wasn't as bad as some fans think and better then the original script which called for the turtles to be aliens which in the movie Is discussed with April and Verne in the van early on The one thing I will admit that while I liked the modified shredder costume though it did seem a bit like something out of another Micheal Bay movie though I am not taking any stars away for it.When it comes to the movies plot while it was a good movie I was very very disappointed in the plot of having Sheader spread a toxin over New York and honestly was waiting for a cameo by Spider Man and The Lizard considering I seen this with The Amazing Spider man in 2012.Overall I will say the movie was not as bad as previously thought and it did feel a bit rushed. I do think with a bit more time and work on the script this could have been better and i do hope there is a sequel.,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

When I watched the Trannies 4 (worst movie of 2014 probably) I thought TMNT couldn't be worse...and it's not because it's TMNT but the movie is horrible beyond belief. The plot just doesn't make any kind of sense. It is and abomination and it's an offense to the public's intelligence. The dialogs are laughable, the artistic direction is a deception, the CGI is (in my opinion) worse than average, the cast is uninspired to say the least, even though I really like William Fichtner and Will Arnett...just not in this movie.

I really think that this is the first movie that I have seen that Johnny Knoxville is in that I did not like.

Vernon may have a good heart but he was kind of a sleazeball and I'm glad April didn't pay a lot of attention to him which him made him look just ridiculous.

April O'Neils character is portrayed as a daft girl who no-one listens to, but wait, she's hot so that's okay. Get a grip! The bum staring jokes are of particular concern. This is what we're teaching kids? That women can try to change the world, but at the end of the day they should only be valued and judged by how good they look? All she does in the film is parade about screaming with her boobs and bum hanging out, being told that she's crazy and receiving chauvinistic comments about how much of a ""hot chick"" she is. It's actually pathetic! Writers care more about this than the actual story line, plot and character development. It's a standard ""make it sexy and full of guns"" approach. Sadly, that's what sells. As for the male parts: they're written to characterize the typical ""men should be strong, keep their feelings hidden until it's too late and only pine after a women because ""she's hot"" attitude. Grow up Hollywood and ditch this 1950's view of the world. Spend more time working on the actual purpose of the movie and help the viewer understand why this is all happening. As for the acting and plot, it's poor at best. They've completely neglected the original story line and left plot holes the size of Jupiter to be considered. None of the actors can actually act. They scream, shout and shoot guns. Big deal, my 10 year old brother performed better in his school play. Do yourself and your kids a favour; avoid this film!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
450,hyperspice,original better,3,17 January 2015,I would have to say the storyline was changed way to much and no casey. Not as funny as the first movie in the 90s. Casey was a big character that brought laughs to the movie. Koabunya was also not used enough plus there was no getting to know the turtles personalities like in the first. this movie was more for using graphics and having action scenes. When i watch a movie i want th e character to build a rapport or get to know the characters fears dreams like in the first movie. Shredder outfit was way overly loaded with weapons.

In the end, all I wanted was for the Turtles to be themselves... and I got that. Donatello got shafted a bit (my favourite turtle), but otherwise they behaved how I expect them to in a two-hour reboot flick.The only real weakness this movie has is the villain. Shredder is extremely shallow, and that was disappointing. A good movie with heroes and villains needs a good villain, and this film had a mecha-samurai suit that wrecked crap... not a villain. However... what this movie does have are some lean, mean, turtle machines.And that is where I got my enjoyment from... enough to say that I'd watch it again when it comes out.

I fully expected that it would be targeted for a younger, new generation. I wanted to excite my teens about characters I loved, but instead this movie turned them off a once pop-culture phenomenon. As I watched it with my two teenagers on Blu-Ray in 3D, the overall pain of a poorly written script coupled with off target humor was too much to bear. Two-thirds of the way through the movie, I began wishing for the movie to end and, then, finally I began to ask myself why I ever started watching this movie in the first place.The script is in limbo between trying to be silly, trying to be funny, and trying to make a point about family unity but never really finding its mark. The action sequences are splattered about the storytelling almost as if they needed something to fill the voids between the lack of story and character development. The special effects, while well done by Industrial Lights and Magic, are nothing new and nothing groundbreaking. Even the attempts to poke fun at the older movie fall flat.The references to hip-hop culture are actual annoying and the original characters, who used valley and surfer terms (which are still in use today) are washed away in a jumble of attempts to bring in modern teen culture. It also misses the target with both my teens disliking this movie. My college aged teen gave it a 0 out of 10 and my High School teen stopped watching as surfed the web on his iPad stating ""This is boring."" Lacking a core of goofiness or culture tie in, the movie continues to degrade into wasted film.Even the music score is out of place in this movie and was better suited for a 1970s television SITCOM. It was actually annoying and taking away from the film (if that is even possible in this jumbled mess of a film) Add in a laugh track and it would be complete.In summary, this will be two hours of your life wasted and I wouldn't bother watching it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The storyline and plot are full of holes, the movie might have been better with no director at all and I think the casting director should jump off a bridge. Casting a terrible actress for her good looks doesn't make it any better (specially since April O'Neil was supposed to be a red-haired woman) and even worst for her co-star the SNL man Will Arnett who actually thinks he's funny (Shame). On the other hand I will say CONGRATULATIONS to the VFX and Special Effects team. All those 640 people who worked their behind off to create great work that was soiled by the above the line crew in this production. Only you guys have my respect concerning this production. Hopefully people will want a remake of this film and will guide that big machine that spits out awful productions like this one called Hollywood into some kind of enlightenment.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
454,jordo66,"Good action scenes, rest mediocre",5,18 October 2014,"After watching some of the new cartoon last year and being a fan of the series since childhood, I went into the cinema today expecting anamazing sci-fi blockbuster with an intense, deep storyline. I was disappointedDon't get me wrong, the movie itself is good enough, with amazing action sequences and a few funny jokes, mostly from Mikey, but the storyline was incredibly average.Might as well get the good few things out of the way first: *I loved the interpretation of the turtles , and CGI was great, Shredders armor was top notch and they did a great job toning down the foot clan and making them look like a proper street gang. *The chemistry between the four tennage turtles was good (let's just forget that whole elevator beat box atrocity thing didn't happen) + The layout of their sewer home was pretty nice.Well that's about it really... *First of all I'm just going to point out how pointless and unfunny Arnett's character was. Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor, it's just his character wasn't really needed, and his attempts of flirting with ' O'Neill 'were just plain cringey. All he was really needed for was a go-to-driver. *April next, who is basically the main character and gets about twice as much screen time as the turtles put together, was really the biggest disappointment for me.They could have done so much more with Fox but instead gave her some of the stupidest , most obvious lines I've ever heard. Example when Sacks pointed out that he shot Aprils dad, April then goes on to point out 'you killed my father' which I hope was only put in for the benefit of confused 6 year old. *Raphael and April are the main characters for me because out of all of the 4 turtles, Raph is the only one who gets any character development whatsoever, with a rather heartwarming but cringe worthy speech in the fall off the Sacks tower near the end. Mikey is put in for laughs and as usual delivers, but Donny and Leo had about as much lines as Aprils flatmate, with Donny giving a geeky line about once every ten minutes and essentially Leo just repeating 'do as i say' in different ways. *But the thing that annoyed me most more than anything else was the back-story. The whole relationship of April's dad creating the mutagen and everything to create the turtles was interesting, but the fact that April referred to the turtles as her childhood pets and the footage of her feeding them was completely absurd. Also the one of the main plot holes is that Splinter was apparently also a project in the lab,which isn't so. Splinter was originally a man, as referred to in all, or most of the previous films/ cartoon series, and came from ancient Japan as a samurai warrior who was exposed to mutagen with the turtles and 'mutated'. He also knew The Shredder well and used to be friends with him, even learned ninjitsu with him, which leads to an intense vendetta/ grudge which heightens the level of their feud to new levels between Splinter and his 'sons' and The Shredder and his Foot Clan. But this, annoyingly wasn't the case, with Splinter only knowing The Shredder through reputation, and the rat Sensei learning ninjitsu from a DUSTY BOOK HE FOUND ON THE SEWER FLOOR to protect the turtles.This was overall the main reason why I am not giving this movie a 7 or 8.-giving this movie a 5 for the action sequences, Richtners performance, Raphael and the special effects. (would be a 6 but the adrenaline scene was ridiculous and just annoyed me) I hope this movie was just aimed at 6-10 year old for laughs and cool fights, because if it wasn't it really didn't work out.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
455,MegaeraXD,It was actually a quite good and enjoying movie,10,22 August 2014,"I don't know where to start at but I think the movie was done very good in general. There some points that I laughed and I was in to the action parts. Honestly, I think Megan Fox did great on this movie considering she's been out for a lot of months or years. I'm so happy for her to finally get back on the road. I missed her LOL! <3 She did really fine in the acting and damn it man if you didn't notice.I don't understand why there are a lot of haters because of the people who made this movie including those in the movie. We know they've been in a tough time to entertain us and for me, they did :)Also, it was a good combination of SCI-FI, drama, action, and comedy interfaces.Let's just consider the fact that there is NO PERFECT movie, just great maybe. Moreover, they made a success on making this a funny movie and enjoyable for kids. I watched it with my family and we did like it especially my little brother.So Bashers and haters, knock it off please.. You don't have an important value and that is APPRECIATION If you're really sure it's a worst-movie-type, then you are blind enough not to see it rank 1 in the movie meter including it's remarkable box office results. -_-",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
456,kenneth_yhh22,Too Short !,6,8 August 2014,"I think it wasn't that bad but what bothers me the most is, the movie is kinda short and not that worth it to be watch in a cinema. Overall wasn't that bad. Hope there is part 2 with a better plot and not that short anymore. On the other hand, this action movie contains the most humor. Also, i don't think it makes any sense for a small rat to be able to fight that shredder alone whereas the 4 turtles couldn't even handle it. I know its their sensei but it kinda doesn't make sense. The show is predictable. Was hoping for something way more interesting and unpredictable. They should show a little bit more of O'Neil's channel 6 boss whom didn't believe her at first, like talk more about it. I believe that would be better (at least not that short). But still i think it wasn't that bad. Great job. Looking forward to seeing the part 2 if there is.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
457,malcolmyeates,Half as good in Half a shell,5,1 June 2015,"With Transformers having a great first outing, my expectations were quite high for this new version of TMNT, however they were quickly diminished as the film developed. Perhaps my fondness of the cartoon and the original movie has obscured my enjoyment, but the ugly faces of the turtles were not a pretty sight. Worse still was the portrayal of Splinter, looking more like the Grand High Witch's transformation in The Witches, rather than a respectable wise ""father"" of the turtles. The storyline was OK, but again, if you like the origins from 20 years ago this was a little different. There were some great funny bits (in the elevator for example), and some good action sequences and these scenes were the main reason for giving any score out of 10 at all. I don't know what's happened since Transformers, but Megan Fox's acting also seems to have dropped down in to the sewers. A shame - but still worth a watch with your kids!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
458,hlinn1386,Solid Turtles Outing,8,23 August 2014,"Let me start by saying that I am a big Turtles fan having grown up with the original cartoon and the original films, etc. I find the first film to be a quite underrated comic book adaptation, along with this one. It seems that many people of my generation went into this film expecting the next Dark Knight. That is neither the Turtles that anyone grew up with nor the Turtles that anyone knows. Rather, what we got was a perfect characterization of the four Turtles' personalities to a T. While it would be cool to have a gritty, violent Turtles film catered to adults, it is neither logical (from a business standpoint) nor familiar territory for the vast majority when it comes to the Turtles.Of course the film has its flaws, but nothing detrimental the the material at hand. So let's start with the good. They could not have patiently eased the Turtles onto the screen any better for the big reveal.The four personality traits of the turtles was nailed seamlessly and it was apparent before they had even set foot on-screen. Michaelangelo stole the show just as he was always known for. Leo was portrayed properly as the leader. Raph's role was perfect, along with his spiel at the end of the film. And Donatello was awesome and hilarious as the nerd; they did a great job exemplifying this characteristic which allowed him to stand out much more than ever before.I also really liked the direction they went with Master Splinter. Rather than an old decrepit rat we get a wise warrior with enough intellect to become a ninja master from studying a ninjutsu for dummies book. I didn't mind that Splinter studied and taught himself as that is quite the impressive feat for a mutated sewer rat, and learning from your master as a rat like in the previous versions is hardly better. The past relationship they all had with April was a worthy addition to the story and tied in great with the story. And they did leave a lot of Shredders background open to speculation and elaboration in future installments (notice he did have his signature scar across his face). Also, Shredder was a badass in his updated armor. His moves, voice and mannerisms could not have been done better (not to mention the classic trademark he dropped in Japanese paying homage to the old shows and video games). April O'neil could have been played by a better actress but that ultimately did not ruin the film as it was the Turtles' show.We also got a glimpse of the Turtles' past which was a great addition to the story and never been done before. The new story line was ideal for a comic book film. I found it obvious that Oroku Saki motives were the same as Eric Sachs' as they were partners in crime; it was the same premise as is with every comic book movie (including the good ones), but only with the Turtles! We are going to be seeing more shredder and the sequel is open to a lot of elaboration on both his character and Splinter's.I also want to add that the look of the turtles was a perfect fit for the dark, realistic look of this film. This was a film that is made for the younger generation (just as with all Turtles incarnations) but tailored to be enjoyed by the original fans.In all honesty, when I discovered from the back of the toy box back in the day that the original turtles were only about 5' I was kind of disappointed. I really liked the fact that they sized them up and made them much tougher, which allowed for the awesome fight sequences that I always wanted from a Turtles movie. They were still trying to pin down the art of the ninja just as they always have been in every other version, but they were very much ninjas and teenagers. I really liked how they put their shells to use throughout the film too. It was also awesome how they utilized the cascading designs of the sewers; very nice touch.A small complaint of mine was the foot soldiers lack of identity and even their outfits left something to be desired. But then again, this could be left for sequels as there wasn't necessarily much room for those characters in this one. As for the guns, it did give it a more domineering presence - and don't forget, they used guns in both the video games and television show. And I would say that the turtles shells being bullet proof really worked well for this movie as it did amp up the action a bit and allowed them to further use their turtle attributes to an advantage. The fact that they were turtles was ideally a strong-suit as they really utilized their shells in this rendition.Ultimately, the Turtles film stayed true to its origins and delivered a fun thrill ride that can be enjoyed by any fan of the material with an open mind. It is very much a popcorn flick, but this is both what I expect and what I desire from a Turtles film. I look forward to the future of the franchise and am really happy with the direction they are headed. It was a very satisfying experience with our four favorite humanoid reptile badasses; this was achieved by staying true to the formula that gave the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles their name with the ideal mix of the original comic book and cartoon while adding a little flavor of their own that bears a comparably dark tone to the original film.Looking forward to seeing which villain(s) they decide to add in the next rendering - not to mention, some Casey Jones.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
459,sfb450-588-270751,Great Movie,10,5 August 2014,"I saw This Movie Last Night it was one of best movies ever. I am sick of all of the haters that always talk down on this.

This is better then the frist movie that came out in the 1990's.I think this move will be great for a long time if people are always gonna hate movies then don't see it. Megan fox is amazing in this movie she did a really good job in this movie.The basics of the story essentially remain the same as in many incarnations. New York is under siege by criminals called the Foot Clan, under the command of a leader called the Shredder.

460,toysu077,A movie for True Followers,10,16 August 2014,"First of all, lets start off by saying that there should not be that much negative reviews on this. For goodness sake, it's a kids movie. To me and only in my opinion those who only gave 1 to 4 stars are not true Followers of the Ninja Turtles. Yes the movie is a bit goofy and yes they have change the story line a bit, but it's still a good movie. I have followed the Ninja Turtles ever since the first cartoon came out. I can say that I like the CGI version more than the first live action.There is enough action to keep you interested, funny parts to make you laugh, and the acting is good. This is one movie I would see again and will own on Blu-ray. Went with some great friends of mine and we all really enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it yet, don't always go by what the bad reviews say, you should go see it yourself and be your own Judge about it.It first started as cartoons, live action movies, then started there own live action TV serious. They were also guest stars on one of the Power Rangers serious too. The bottom line, its a kids show. Its really cool to see them on the big screen. True Turtle Followers will like this film. If this is your first time seeing them on the screen, please keep in mind its a goofy movie with good action that kids love.I give 10 stars because it is everything a expected to be. A fun film that a family would enjoy. A lot better than some other movies that has been playing out there. If I had kids I would take them to see this and feel safe about it. Once again, this is a kid and family type of a film to see.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
461,rimburgio11746,I wish I didn't see it,3,9 August 2014,"This movie is bad. A lot worse than I thought it would be. It had it's few good moments, but this movie was put together, in my opinion, the worst it could be. They made so many changes to this movie from the series that came out terrible in the end. For example, they took out Casey (The dude with the hockey mask), and they completely redid splinters story. Apparently he was a rat that was also mutated with the turtles. Also they added a new character, Vernon. He is a nerdy camera man that has a crush on April. I feel like he should be a nerdy 20 something instead of Will Arnett, a forty year old creep who has it for Megan Fox. He is almost exactly like Jonah Hill's character from Megamind. He is always an annoyance and only has a couple funny lines; I have no idea why they put him in the movie. And Shredder is... a scarred Asian dude with no personality what-so-ever. Yep. He's not the actual villain. They left the generic bad guy role to of coarse, William Flitcher who is ,(Of coarse), an evil rich jerk that only cares about money. I have a feeling the writers never even watched the show. And now for April. I think this is the worst acting choice EVER; they picked Megan Fox. She sucked. I honestly think she was the worst part about the movie. For some reason they made her more important than the actual turtles even though Megan Fox only has one face when she acts. She stares off at something evil with her mouth slightly open and breathes very heavily. Seriously. Every movie. But I still wonder how could have they have messed up the personalities. Michelangelo is completely hipster in this. He says Bra (Like Bro but with an accent) and wears worn hipster sunglasses on his necklace. He has some funny moments but the writers modified his personality for modern times, which was a really bad idea in my opinion. You'll be turning a classic character into someone that uses terms that will be out of style in a year. Raphael is too arrogant and doesn't have much of a character, Donatello just hacks things and has weird Google glasses that basically tell him if someone has a gun or not, and Leonardo is supposed to be a leader but just commands some people around. The actions scenes were pretty cool but were way too far-fetched and didn't make too much sense. Like Donatello flipping a moving car by sticking a wooden staff in between the front of the car and the ground. And one of them being completely fine after surviving an explosion and getting your back basically cracked. Te ninja foot clan didn't really have roles either, they were just the cliché goons that the turtles beat up with no difficulty. But halfway through they started using their guns and the turtles had to spend a lot of the fighting sequences blocking the bullets with their shells. So a lot of the fighting was them eating guys senselessly or blocking bullets. They took the magic out of the actual ninja part of the movie and the NINJA foot clan. A lot of the action usually had someone having a great advantage over the other person or party. It seems like they spent all of their time on the giant cgi sequences. Finally, the cgi. It was actually pretty amazing, but the only thing I didn't like about the turtles were the faces. They look too much like actual animals. Same with splinter. They made him look like a detailed rat.It's pretty disgusting. Please don't see this movie. There were some funny or entertaining parts, like the elevator scene (You would know if you saw it), but it's not worth spending 10 bucks on another one of Hollywoods failures. Oh and don't blame Michael Bay for this, he only produced it. He would of probably made it better. I'm just kidding. Sorry, one last thing. If you do see it, the final scene just like the final scene from the amazing spider man. Think about it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The turtles and splinter.. are disgusting..The script is bad, the story is horrible there is no character development, the acting is bad too The action scene is also not satisfying.. there is some good action stuff, but the fight scene is not satisfying at all, the fight like bunch of regular fighters, not ninjas (they are ninjas you know) so many slow motion on a scene that.. in my opinion not making the scene cool or something else.. just make the horrible scene longer.. so its horrribblleeeThey have michelangelo on this movie.. which is suppose to be a comical, funny character, but in this movie he is just being noisy, not funny at all.

463,crunchypepper-665-685260,Yuck.,1,8 August 2014,"Pretty bad movie. Total Hollywood fluff. This is a kid's movie to the hilt, and totally one dimensional. Some movies can pull off being a kid's movie but still be quite entertaining for adults, this is not one of those movies. Everything about every character and the whole story line is one dimensional. I don't know if it's because Fox has had so much botox, or simply because she's a terrible actress, but her facial expressions were awful. Every time she reacted to something it was so deadpan, so forced.. same with the annunciation in her voice whenever anything happened. She is awful. Takes a lot away from the movie.Shredder lame as hell, and getting rid of the Splinter-Shredder connection?? wtf? That's like the heart of the story of the turtles. Splinter learning perfect ninjistsu from a book? c'mon.I'm glad Donnie's genetics had a predisposition that he was going to be omg such nerd, with the vision problems, heavy breathing, snorting laugh, nasly voice.Mikey, my favorite turtle, had me cringing the whole movie. I think 75% of his lines were about how Fox was *""omg so hot"", ""omg she my gf OK guyse"". Uh ohes, I farted!! Dumb, dumb, dumb.I don't have any major gripes with Leo and Raph's characters, other than Leo being pretty shallow and uninteresting and every turtle was hulked out like a mofo, indestructible as hell. Unnecessary.Why is the mutagen going to cure Splinter? The whole Vernon loves April arc seemed pretty forced too.

464,greatgaminguy01,"I can see why people dislike this, but it really is a good movie with great action",10,28 December 2014,"~Prologue~ Boy, did this movie get some AWFUL reviews. I mean, a 6 on IMDb, a 22% on Rotten Tomatoes (as I'm writing this), and a 31% on Metacritic. It can't get too much worse, can it. And I see where people would hate this movie, I mean, the turtles do look kind of crazy (in an interesting way though), some say the plot is quite stupid, some just hate the acting (mostly Megan Fox's). And I can understand that, especially if you have high expectations if you grew up during the 80s and 90s when the first comics and movies were released, or you just thought it would be a blockbuster hit (it did make a generous amount of profit...), but this movie isn't all bad. Frankly, this is one of my all-time favorite movies! (No need to say ""you must not have seen many movies"", or you're dumb if you like this"".) I got it on Blu-Ray because I enjoyed the movie.Now, this movie has some great action, I must say. The way the turtles fight are very realistic, granted they were made by real people acting out the moves. The acting is almost always solid, with my only exception being Megan Fox, (surprise right?) only because sometimes the way she says things, it comes out almost like an exaggeration. The plot is great though. It's not some top-notch blow up the world plan or anything like that, but it's an interesting concept. It actually makes sense to me to use a gas to essentially brainwash people. And the plot twist, when you find out the scientist April knew and cared about was actually the reason her father died, and was working with Shredder all along! (Might not sound interesting, but I was pretty flabbergasted. Maybe I should have seen it coming knowing Michael Bay and all). Now, there is only about 2-4 explosions in the movie, just a heads up. Don't expect there to be anywhere as many as Transformers. And I should add the Snowstorm scene had great action, and the part where Donatello used his Bo-staff to flip up the truck that was racing towards them, and he started snorting from laughing, was a hilarious part. The best part of the movie has to be the ""MC Mikey"" elevator part though. Just too funny!I actually give this movie a 9.5, but being IMDb and all, well, you know. It is still a great movie. I know this review is almost half a year after the film came out, but if you're curious about the movie, and even just want to rent it, you really should. Don't let people disjointedness by their high expectations keep you away from seeing this! It is definitely worth a rent from iTunes or Redbox at the very least!I'm quite sure I'll be getting some down thumbs for my high review of this movie that has been panned by many people, but I genuinely enjoyed this movie, and I will be going to see the sequel!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

As a major TMNT fan, I would like to say that this movie was good but I feel like it was going too fast. Maybe if they made the movie at least 2 hours long, it would be better than it is right now. Aside from that, I liked the movie. I don't know why people hate it. This movie is even nominated for Razzie Awards. This movie doesn't deserve a Razzie at all because it's so awesome. To be honest, this movie is way better than the 90s movies. People just hate this movie because of what the ""critics"" say. Who cares about them? You can't just hate a movie because of what a professional ""critic"" said. What if a critic said something nasty about one of YOUR favorite movies? You wouldn't like that. Those critics think that they're better than us because people follow their opinions. We have our own lives. We can make our own choices, we can make our own decisions, and we can make our own opinions.

469,lokishy,I Was Very Impressed!,10,11 September 2014,"I was skeptical about this film when it was first announced, especially when Bay said they were going to be aliens. But, it was quickly turned around and this radical outing is the result! First off, the origin of the Turtles is tweaked a bit, but it follows along more with the IDW Comic books and actually saved a lot of time instead of rehashing the same, 30 year old story. I am a hardcore fan from the very beginning and I liked the changes. The plot does have holes in it, but this film is meant to be watched with brains switched off. The Turtles new look never bothered me.(They're mutated turtles for Godsakes!) I welcomed the changes to their looks and it's hardly noticeable when you see that their personalities are spot on and perfect! Splinter finally breaks out and kicks some ass, a lot of the characters from the 1980s animated series appear and Shredder is pretty bad ass. I don't want to give anything away, I just think that if you just take it for what it is and accept it as a retelling for a new era, then the ""BAYHATE"" and the fear of nostalgia-raping will pass. It's fun, funny and action packed. This TMNT fan since '84 truly enjoyed it! COWABUNGA!!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
470,anonynez,Not quite the atrocity critics would have you think,8,10 August 2014,"I, like many, grew up on the TMNT cartoons, comics, and live action movies. This adaptation was absolutely necessary for an entirely new generation. It obviously had to meet a certain standard with regard to a ""live action reboot"". The remake of this classic with modern technology was done very well, despite all of the negative stigma toward Michael Bay and his summer blockbuster flare. This movie has every element that you would expect from a TMNT storyline. April O'neal is still the persistent reporter out for that big story, whatever it may be. Her character still maintains that ""damsel in distress turns friend to the turtles"" role that it has always been. The turtles are still four individual personalities (Leo the leader, Raph the aggressive loner, Donnie the nerd, Mikey the surfer dude jokester), although I will admit that their personalities seemed forced onto you. Almost as if you had never heard of them before you entered the theater. One thing is for sure. If you didn't know their character traits before you view the film, you'll certainly know them by the end of it. The action in this film is outstanding. The fight scenes, especially with Splinter, are very fluid and precise. The jokes are quirky and frequent, and of course there is pizza. The aforementioned elements have always been key to any TMNT installment. I think that the writers, Bay, and Liebesman nailed this part right on the head. I was absolutely glued the entire time, and I laughed at just about everything that came out of Noel Fisher (Michelangelo) and Will Arnett's (Vernon Finwick) mouth. All in all, this was a fun filled, action packed, enjoyable, entertaining, humorous, family friendly joy ride from beginning to end. I honestly do not understand why the critics have judged it so harshly. With that being said, I will give my only negative qualm with this movie, and please read at your discretion because the proceeding will contain spoilers. One of the staples of ANY TMNT installment, has always been predicated upon the storyline that Splinter was the pet of a Japanese martial arts master, and that this was how he came to learn the art of ninjitsu. Splinters master was killed by Shredder, and therein laid the foundation for conflict between Splinter and Shredder. This movie absolutely missed this key factor by 350%. Im talking totally missed the mark by yards. Not feet. If this part of the storyline were the end zone in a football game, Bay and Liebesman ran completely in the opposite direction. In this film, Splinter tells the story of how he became a ninja master, and it literally goes as follows: ""I was cleaning the sewer one day when I came upon a book. (*Finds book in sewer. Blows off the dust. Title of book reads 'Learn the art of Ninjitsu'*) I taught myself ninjitsu first, and then I taught my sons, and it turns out that they were really good at it."" When this happened in the movie, my heart sank, my stomach turned a little, and my childlike grin (that had been from ear to ear up until that moment) began to sag a little. This was their opportunity to prove the critics prior to the release of the film wrong, and they failed miserably at it. That would be OK if they had sacrificed it for a certain part of the film that made you say, ""Well, that was OK. I can live with that because of this..."". Unfortunately, that was not the case. This was always such an important and fundamental part of how and why these Teenage Mutant NINJA Turtles were such effective ninjas to begin with. Their training had always derived from ancient masters that passed their knowledge and wisdom down to Splinter, and he to the turtles. The ONLY thing that this allowed was for some character development. The turtles are still young and very unsure of themselves in this film. They've not been above the surface very much, and are only just now getting their first taste of combat and the outside world. So, this would allow for sequels and a lot more action, but they cant fix the way that they've massacred the subplot for how they learned their martial art. Splinter, I will say, was a total bada**. The fight scene between he and the foot clan leading up to his battle with Shredder was incredible. They did something here that hasn't been done before, and that was to show that Splinter can fight. He does to Shredder in one scene what all four turtles cannot do for literally the entirety of the movie. Although Im giving Splinters character credence here, I do not like Tony Shaloubs voice as the voice of Splinter. Although they have made Splinter out to be a younger version of his predecessors (old), his voice just simply does not match. Nor does the voice of Leonardo for that matter (Johnny Knoxville). Why they chose him over the actual character actor I do not understand. His voice in NO WAY exudes the word leadership to me. All I could think about every time Leo spoke, was that idiot Knoxville being shot in the groin by a paintball gun.To surmise, this was nearly a two hour thrill ride, blast from the past, eyegasm that had some minor issues that can be tweaked, and ONE major storyline flaw that cant be fixed, but at the end of the movie I was still in my seat and was left wanting more. I will see this film again in the theater and I will own it on Blueray. I'll also pay to see the sequels. I only wish they had shot it in Imax 3D. Don't believe the critics. Go see it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Splinter and the turtles were April's pets? And instead of Splinter being the rat of his master in the foot clan mimicking his movements he learns from a book he finds in the sewer. Megan Fox is also just a horrible actress who happens to be the absolute most unqualified person to be playing the role of April O'neil. If Megan Fox was not in the movie it would be slightly more tolerable, still a horrible movie. Michael Bay proves to have no creativity and no imagination as this movie looks and feels like his just as crappy Transformers movies. It has the same dark look as the transformers. The movie had 1 or 2 fun/cool parts but it isn't worth watching the whole movie just for those parts. Shredders suit is also way overboard and entirely made out of metal. The TMNT live action movies from the 90's seems to be the only good movies considering how awful this movie is, I cannot express how awful this movie is.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Otherwise, it was entertaining and action packed movie. The turtles have really been recreated to look more tough and skilled. I love that ""Monk"" got to play Splinter, his voice was perfect for the part. I'm happy to see Will Arnett in a leading role and just wish he had a better leading lady that does more then do breathy sighs, unbelievable with all the female talent out there. I did however really enjoy the lengthy trip down the snowy mountain and all the ""shell snowboarding"" that was in that scene, as well as the suspense of the big rig teetering on the ledge of he slope and once it went over I could actually feel myself going over in the truck....what a rush going down that mountain.

This is a fun, exiting, and entertaining Movie that's it don't go trying to find a deep message in it, after all its a story about a Giant talking rat who trains 4 giant ninja turtles and live in the sewers. I'm a huge fan of ninja turtles and i found this movie putting a smile on my face because it was the four ninja turtles i knew and loved from the original cartoon. Of course this movie has its flaws, Well a lot of flaws.

Now don't get me wrong the movie has it faults here and there but can we really down it when the general audience of the movie is kids? I went into the movie telling myself ""don't think about the reviews or what others say judge for yourself"" and honestly I think I had way more fun watching the movie that way. The visuals are nice , there's decent moments of deep meaning which give the movie rewatch value in the future if your a kid and I have to admit its funny to me. The movie however does have its faults in shakes camera motions which make it though to realize what's going on or a few cheesy (Pizza Hut pizza cheesy) lines but if your willing to ignore them and have some fun then you definitely will. This isn't your 10star gold movie or your award wining script movie but it is a fun summer movie filled with a good amount of heart.

I remember a week or so ago when Megan Fox slammed the haters of the new TMNT movie and I think we heard from every critic out there and they are the haters and I agree with her, if you don't like it, who gives a flip cause I did and my 4 kids loved it. Great action, comedy and a lot better story than the old movies had to them, plus the new Turtles look amazing there are times when They are fighting Shredder that you can tell that its all cgi but other than that it looked great. 8 out of 10 easily!

Johnny Knoxville was awesome and did a very good job as Leonardo. My opinion master Splinter needs a little upgrade and change. I can't wait to see Casey Jones in the next TMNT Movie . I loved the snow chase scene in the movie and it's the best scene. Mikey was awesome and hilarious. And another favorite scene of mine is when all 4 turtles are going into the pipe and Mikey farts and there like ugh Mikey and Mikey says yep pepperoni. Over all my favorite turtle in this movie is Mikey he was awesome. And i can't wait to see bebop and rocksteady in the next TMNT movie.

TMNT 2014 is just the beginning of future sequels to come in a franchise reborn. THE STORY IS DECENT FOR A REBOOT but apparently critics don't know what a reboot is. FOR example the foot-clan originally had no guns but in this version they do which is not a bad thing at all because you simply can not call it a reboot if you do not one up the original!!! THIS movie one ups the original in every aspect and it will live on for years to come despite ignorance amongst the critics.

The critics have forgotten what it's like to truly have fun in a movie. You will laugh, cry, and cheer! What an enhancement to my childhood memories. Slightly more grown up, but not TOO grown up. Loved the action and fighting. Shredder was terrifyingly bad-ass and although he was superhuman in his armor, I still believed that a mortal man could be inside. I loved that they each got to use their weapons in unique ways. Raph used his weapons the correct way, as a disarming blunt force weapon. They really focused on their love for one another and I really enjoyed that part. Brotherhood is such a positive, impactful topic for a movie! Nicely done :)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I thought they were ninjas? April O'Neil was well whomever Megan Fox thinks her actress persona is, kind of like her character in Transformers but like a reporter or something.

To be honest, it's rather good. It's funny that all audience laugh together ( including myself that rarely laugh out loud at all ), action scene was entertaining. Spoiler - Down hill scene was tense but camera was not too shaky ( like many Hollywood production ), and still packed some funny scenes to be entertaining. No complaint on CGI graphic, I like it that camera doesn't jump scene too frequent, so you're actually able to observe it in details. Personal opinion, it's much better than Guardian of the Galaxy ( it's not funny, action sucks, those galactic heroes looks super weak except Groot which is awesome )",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Michael Bay turned part of my childhood into a CGI infused/eye candy riddled mess with the last 3 Transformer movies. Needless to say, I was not excited when I heard he was producing this film. BUT I was excited for a Turtles reboot! The turtles were my life growing up from age 4-14. I, like millions of young kids my age grew up and adored these brothers and the lore that went with them. Last night I sat down and almost prayed to God that this movie would not be terrible. And... God answered my prayers! The interaction between the brothers was fantastic. It was funny when it needed to be and serious when it needed to be. There were a few changes to the story, but that has been happening since the dawn of the Turtles from the comics to the cartoon to the movies. I sat back and enjoyed the ride and it was a ride. I will point out that I can not stand Megan Fox BUT she did a surprisingly good job in this film. Others may not like the origin story but I was okay with it. Splinter has always been my favorite and he does not disappoint! Well, go and see for yourself. I did not want it to end. A great ride!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Hearing Johnny Knoxville as Leo was a tad strange at first, but he definitely had me sold about 30 mins in. The only real problem I had since I've grown up on TMNT, is (SPOILER ALERT!) the origin of splinter leaning martial arts. As most probably know he was Shredders pet, and learned from watching him. The fact that they were lab experiments who were saved by April as a child. Then learning MA from a book Splinter finds in the sewers. Not a big problem like I had said earlier, at least they weren't aliens like some of the early rumors speculated. I would totally go see this movie whether you're an adult, or bringing your kids.

488,ryancsnyder,Hollywood action turtles,7,9 August 2014,"The new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie actually has a lot going for it. The action was fun to watch and fights were well-choreographed. The turtles themselves had their classic personalities, good brotherly chemistry and plenty of genuinely funny quips. The movie's ""human"" acting was fine -- it didn't blow me away, but it wasn't painful to watch.Even without critical bias from growing up with the original movie(s), or Michael Bay, or Megan Fox or whatever, the film's biggest flaw is that it's too ""Hollywood"". The action and sci-fi elements are fun, but over- the-top in Hollywood fashion. Character development and story points were glossed-over (especially for the villains), and a few things were just silly (adrenaline). By comparison, the beloved original TMNT was down-to-earth for a comic-based action movie.With great action scenes and some shallow story points, the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is fun to watch but not quite as good as other great comic-based movies -- including the original.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

All of the previous turtle elements where there packed with new jokes and fun. It was nice reminiscing of youth with Pizza Hut and the storyline(a bit different but OK). Michelangelo always so much fun, and Donatello the genius with a GoPro on the forehead. Rafael seems to be the main character in this one in the sense that he pretends being the strongest yet he is emotionally/physically weak.

490,duke-anderson35,"I'm not going to ruin the movie with a summary - instead, read my review.",8,9 August 2014,"I feel as though this movie is being heavily slighted - in all honesty, it's a 7, but I rated it a little higher since it's currently a little below that number. I grew up watching the original TMNTs, so I felt indebted to see this (while not expecting much). Compared to the original, the new version succeeds better in some areas while surrendering itself more to absurdity in others. Considering what the writer's had to work with, the script is very well manicured. The story line is (almost) plausible, the script isn't filled with cheesy one- liners (it's actually funny) and they pay close attention to detail - even the ninja turtles are slightly different sizes/builds, as opposed to manufactured look-alikes. There are actually a lot of subtle characteristics to the film such as this which add to it's . The major drawbacks are the same as what would be expected from any other film under the control of Michael Bay - the action sequences. There are a few action sequences which feel like Rube Goldberg machines - one explosion, after another explosion, which leads to this explosion, and so forth. They reminded me of the dance sequences in the last ""Great Gatsby"" movie - a few times I wanted to shout ""Enough!"". Outside of these sequences adding to the utter implausibility of the story-line, I would say it's a good movie. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters if you are in your late 20s (like me) and were fans of the original franchise. If not, wait for it on Netflix.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

But each version grew on me and I love them all. I wasn't thrilled with the remake of the history (Splinter learning from a book???)or the reason WHY they were attacking the city (Make tons of cash??? This guy is RICH or he wouldn't be living in a castle!)but the rest of it was flat out awesome. Mikey was kinda creeper creepy sometimes though O_o I got to see it for my birthday in 3d and I was super excited. The reviews made me wary but I'm super glad we went anyways.

First off Megan Fox acting was horrendous. Strong word I know but if they recast-ed her character alone the movie would be a great deal better. I can't remember her in any other movies but I can say if she is cast an important constant roll in another movie I will wait to see it on TV if at all.The second issue I had was the story line. Their are many different story lines for TMNT and I honestly say I like most of them. This one just seemed like it was thrown together over lunch. There are so many holes and so much that just didn't meld together. It seemed like they just didn't want to take the time needed to invest in a solid script mainly a tangible intro.I think most of their time and money was invested in the CGI and action scenes which were interesting. I really liked the look of the turtles and the individual characters they created with them. They almost seemed genuine. I did think Donatello was a little to tech-ed out but I could live with that.Besides Megan Fox they really had a solid cast. Unfortunately she took up most of the screen time. In short if they recast-ed April, used the solid actors they had, and invested more in the actual story this could have been an amazing movie.

Didn't follow the bad press that was recently before the movie debut, nor could I care.Michael Bay, expected nothing less from him on the big action scenes. His work was great as always. However, because the movie itself sucked so bad, I was almost surprised and would have been shocked if he pulled and almost used a scene from Bad Boys which would have been a disaster. Bad Boys should remain its own movie and nothing should ever be copied or used ever! The scene in TMNT I am referring to is the car chase in the snow with the red barrels in the truck. Because the movie itself was horrible, I was almost certain Bay was going to pull the blowing up the barrels of ether on the ice cream truck scene from Bad Boys and use it in this movie. If he did that I would have lost all respect for him. Thank god he didn't.Apart from that, the story line was terrible and was a total disaster. I walked out wanting my money back. Big Fail.Expected more.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
497,rachel-foster-mail,Best TMNT Movie Yet,8,11 August 2014,"I wouldn't read the majority of these reviews posted here before watching the movie. I'm glad I didn't because this new iteration blew my expectations out of the water.First off, while the new CG models for the turtles took some getting used to--after all, all we had to go on before were bad costumes and cartoons--but after watching them in the movie, their expressions, the movements, and textures were believable. They really seemed like mutant turtles. A feat that previous movies have not accurately captured.I had the ""pleasure"" of watching a marathon of the older movies (all of them) as I was stuck home sick from work the next day. After watching them I came to the conclusion that each of the older turtle movies had each turtle with very little personality variation, focused more on cheesy 90's one liners, and way too much of Casey. I was delighted to see that each brother now had a well defined personality, different builds and faces, and the distraction of Casey was wonderfully absent.The story has been varied a bit, but this overwhelmingly helps to make the turtles much more viable. As someone who grew up reading what many consider the grittier turtle comics, I felt this captured some of that essence. Without giving too much away, the movie does get very emotional and real in one memorable scene. The look of anger and urgency on the brothers faces in that scene was palpable. Splinter's CG model was very expressive and did the affore mentioned scene justice.While the movie does at times focus on April and her bumbling camera man, the turtles still have a good deal of screen time. That being said, Megan Fox was undoubtedly the worst actor in that movie. Her role won't ruin the movie, but I didn't believe that she was really invested at certain points. If you watch the older movies, you'll also notice that the story seems to focus on the humans more than the turtles. The same is true of the most recent Godzilla, any recent Transformers movie, Jurassic Park, etc, etc. Bottom line is that CG costs a lot of money and time to do correctly. That being said, I'd rather have 30 minutes of amazing CG than an entire movie of badly dressed actors in turtle costumes.On to the villains. Shredder wasn't given as much background to his character as I would've liked. One reviewer mentioned that he was in it for money, which is incorrect. When talking with Sacks, he says to him with disdain that Sacks will have his money. Shredder's motivations aren't very clearly spelled out. Either this was left open for interpretation, he's simply following the patterns of history, or is open to a sequel is unclear to me. Though having him as this imposing enforcer figure made him a much more intimidating villain in my eyes. Sacks is clearly in it for money; yes even though he has gobs of it, but he's always been the embodiment of greed in the comics. I don't see why they would change that considering the changes they made were minor and typically didn't have a negative impact on canon.As far as movies go, this was a good one. Don't let someone's review on here steer you away from it because of product placement, Fox's acting, or their individual expectations. This was not a ""long toy commercial,"" or not serious enough, or a long running gag. It was by far the best movie to date for the turtles. Yes, it is funny at points, yes there is product placement just like in the older movies, and yes they're 6 ft tall humanoid turtles. But, it gets as serious as a TMNT movie ever has and still manages to make you laugh.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

They weren't just mutated to look like humans, they were mutated to be super heroes, and I think it worked great.6) Donatello was spot-on, Raph and Leo, not too bad, only Mikey was butchered, hopefully rectified in the sequel.As a long-term TMNT fan from when I was old enough to watch TV and read comics, this movie is not the travesty it could have been, and I think we have the fans (IE The Turtles are NOT Aliens, etc.) to thank for that. It was overall a nice new romp in the TMNT universe even with the complete deviation from the storyline. 5/10.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Really bad; please believe me. Save your $25!! I hope that you never see this movie for real. Josh Appelbaum should be brought out to pasture and you know shot. I fell sorry for the producers of Beverly Hills Cop 4 LoL. Anyway the CGI was not very good and neither was the acting. What do you have left? Oh the story was so bad I wanted to leave the theater after 20 minutes and drink some moonshine with ambien, and pull a Robin W.,but my wife and son were with me scarfing down twizzlers, popcorn, mountain dew; I wish they were smarter then I was. God help their souls:( I would give the movie a 1* ,but my mentally challenged son loved the movie, but he also likes eating dirt clogs. Johnny Z!P.S. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at like making movies twitchy and sporadic.

If you want action go see it. If you want the ""Ninja"" in Ninja Turtles then go watch the old films. The foot clan did not go around with guns they where a secret ninja organization not mercenaries. Additionally The Shredder did not have a exoskeleton, he was a ninja, thanks a lot for a terrible origins remake on the ninja turtles.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I really enjoyed this movie! The action was awesome , the personalities of the of the turtles were SPOT ON, the movie was really funny at parts, and the scenes with the turtles were great too.Though that doesn't mean that I don't have some complaints. While the actors of turtles were again spot on, and shredders' was as well. The rest not so much, Megan fox as April was just annoying,Will arnett as Vernon( or Vern) did a BAD job, like so bad that it's unbearable. William fichtner is usually a great actor so how is he in this, well, in this he's that one guy in some movies that while performing his role, he just has fun with it and acts bad on purpose! I'm not gonna spoil anything but you WILL see what I mean. I'm not saying anything else bad because again I'm not gonna spoil anything about the plot. But if would say anything else, is the voice of splinter, he was......okay. So yeah personally I really enjoyed this movie. It's almost everything I wanted in a turtles film. But that's my opinion, I do not know if you will like the movie. But I really hope you enjoy it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
503,warrenshov,NOT Surprisingly Disappointing,5,15 August 2014,"Just the fact that it is the Ninja turtles i felt the movie should of been a lot longer when your doing a reboot of a Iconic film. Second the MOST of my issuse with this movie the CHARACTERS! I really really believe that Michael Bay and the Writer were very poor in character development 1st Michelangelo as being depicted as a black teenager from his style and mannerisms! Being a black man i DO NOT like when DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS have their characters overly played to portraying a black male acting that way i really hate that!! Not too mention his joking side was OVER THE TOP completely in this movie i mean the real personality of michaelango is Dumb not a Qorky stereotype talking black guy!! Then there's Donatello was he in the movie?? Because I'm positive there were to Michelangelo's I'm this movie Donatello is a EGG/Nerd/Book-worm with NO HUMOR and he never pertraid that yes he was just the turtle with the computer but everything out of his mouth was something really goofy I'm a attempt to back up michelangelo!.. Now Leonardo i remember hearing Johny knox was redoing his voice and man was i excited well it was soo creepy! All i thought of was jack a$$ but i would of like to here how the first guy they casted sounded. Only turtle i felt was himself was Ralph tho they didn't develop him as well being very jealous Of leonardo and being a real hot head jerk was seen in this movie So basically the Movie's main Characters were out sync which really doomed the movie. Next April there was no more in-debt to her news career Which is if I'm mistake the only important information on her character. Next the Sacks guy i really really hated how very intelligent he sounded in the beginning and the to the end his character became really LAZY like after the Shredder he didn't matter ""I'm going to be stupid rich"" ""your a cute couple i wana pinch your cheeks"" yea super bad guy talk. Last i felt there was nothing done about the Shredder like Nothing i can't even tell you nothing i would of like to see how him and sacks met what he taught him at a young age but whatever i guess who needs to that with the Shredder but Splinter had maybe his best character development that's it. TMNT story should not be rushed it has important things that need to be shown told and develop 5/10",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

She probably single handedly ruined the movie for me...had they chosen better actors this film might have had some real value. You can tell they made it strictly to make money...they made it fast and cheap and picked the cheapest actors on the market.

The Origin story was crap. The turtles looked retarded. Shredder looked like a Transformer. Splinter looked like he was on meth. The only thing they almost got right was showcasing each turtles personality but then of course, they ruined it by WAY over doing it. I get that Donnie is a dork and all but he doesn't have to be like, half cyborg. This movie is garbage and Michael Bay should be castrated for making it. If you like this movie you're proof that the dumbing down of America is working. I wrote a better idea for a Ninja Turtle movie without even trying (NO, SERIOUSLY.)",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
507,thatdudeeddiee,I think people take this too seriously ...,9,23 August 2014,"It's a fun movie. Regardless what people say, its entertaining, funny, and pretty cool movie. People just tend to be way too critical when watching a movie. It's like they purposely try to find everything wrong with a movie then write a bad review about it. My friends and I were hanging out at the mall, decided to watch this one, had a good laugh and as well, enjoying a pretty good plot (right amount action, back-story, humor... FOR THE AVERAGE VIEWER). There are a few scenes that do get a little irritating like Megan's acting in the beginning (later gets comfortable and is pretty good IMO) and the way too obvious CGI effects in ONE action scene.At the end of the day, you're watching a movie about turtles, that are ninjas. Who cares. HIGHLY recommend if you're in the mood for a chill evening movie with friends, or maybe bring the little ones in your family to see this flick, they'll enjoy it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
508,pupsicle_princess,Typical Michael Bay movie,2,24 August 2014,"This movie should be called ""Megan Fox: Tries to look sexy meanwhile stuff happens around/behind her"" Michael Bay has this obsession with making movies that aren't actually based around the important characters, i.e., the Transformers, or the Ninja Turtles, but follow around some idiot who has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. All the movie is is people flirting with Megan and the occasional action shot of the turtles (alongside explosions, chase scenes, crashes, gunfire etc. in the usual Michael Bay fashion) Honestly, not only does April O'Neill have no relation to the plot other than one minor detail (from like 20 years ago) but the incorporation of the character made what little plot they had even more stupid. I just want a movie about the f*cking Ninja Turtles. Base it around them growing up in the sewers, training to become warriors, their brotherhood, etc. anything, literally anything other than ""a reporter following the story"". Does it really have to be in third person? There was barely any depth to the turtles, splinter or shredder. The plot was non existent and didn't really make a lot of sense, a lot of convenient ""oh I have to have a 5 minute count down so you'll have time to distract me and shut off the timer"" and ""Oh I'll just leave this adrenaline plugged in with easy access just in case someone wants to come save them It'll be easy and only take 10 seconds"" Minus all that, the plot was just your average ""bad guy wants to take over city/world, boom-bang-pow, good guys win."" Overall terribly boring movie, that's kind of stuck in no mans land. It's too mature (with the constant references to boning Megan Fox) to be for kids, yet is just too utterly stupid for most anyone else to enjoy. Zero plot, underdeveloped important characters and overdeveloped 'secondary' characters. So many explosions, Michael Bay has actually made watching fight scenes, and action movies in general, boring. Good CGI I guess. A couple old jokes that gave me a smirk. Props for including a bit of true background from the original TMNT.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I grew up with the turtles and it doesn't matter how anyone feels about the movie because I saw it and I loved it. I didn't go in expecting anything therefore I was not let down. It is cheesy at some points and things didn't make sense all the time but if you look at the TMNT cartoons from the 80's now, it's pretty much the same thing. Still a fan, love the details and action, the turtles are cool. I felt like a little kid again. My 8 year old daughter saw it as well and she loved it! So we're happy with the turtles.

The screenplay is original and stands out to the most action movies these days.It has tag of comics, TV series and cartoons all over it. A fan with pre-meditative expectations will not be disappointed with this movie!!Although i think megan fox could have dropped some hotness into the movie. Her role is limited, meager and dry.

The two things that made it an awesome watching piece was the fun.. comedy and the music. I must say, this movie lived up to that expectations and in some, even did a lot better. Some of the noteworthy scenes(this is no spoiler, people who have already watched will know, and the ones going to watch... will laugh their hearts out) are the elevator one, the roof one(camera click) and avalanche. The animations and 3D feel are awesome, no doubt! Along with that, Megan Fox also added extra stars to the movie, as usual her beauty and charm kept the audience glued when they were not busy laughing with the turtles.Mr. Michael Bay, I cannot say about the rest of the world, but you made a movie Indians would love to watch at least twice.I am definitely looking forward to an action-packed, and fun-filled second part.

It first was shown as a cartoon and many knew it was a kids/young people movie but the 2014 movie has changed that opinion. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2014 starring Megan Fox has gotten a new meaning. This movie can be enjoyed by Kids but also adults. It has a lot of action shot. What I think of it some people many think different.The movie is actually pretty good. I enjoyed most of it. There was funny parts in action scene and it just made the movie great. The plot was great not a lot of mess ups there. So in the end, i would recommend this movie to everyone. Its a great family movie that can be enjoyed by everyone.This movie gets a rating of 8 out of 10 from me. So Great but not so great if you know what I mean.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

There is so much confusion as to why the people behind this movie made it play out the way it did. There are so many terrible things about this movie.To start with, it seemed like April was mostly shouting in this movie. Why is Megan Fox in here? Let's be honest, she is cocky, over rated, and found oddly extremely attractive. April is supposed to be the girl next door, not a Fox. When did Shredder become a robotic like idiot? He is suppose to be a marvelous master mind. Who is that guy who is trying to become involved with April? Casey? Nope, not at all it's Vern. Vern? Who is Vern? Where is Casey? And Splinter looked like a dog that got squashed and stretched. Now the turtles? The turtles were extremely creepy and were made out to be ghetto, irritating creatures. Why the do rags? Not to mention, there could have been a better set of actors. Why in the world would they cast Johnny Knoxville as the voice of Leonardo? I think he is funny as all get out, but he would have been a voice for Mikey. And why does Ralph come off as the leader? That would be Leonardo. Don't even get me started on Donatello! What in the H*** did they do to him? He is a geek, and an annoying one at that! Mikey is funny, but with a creepy twist.I love the TMNT movies all the way up to the 2007 movie: so just not this movie and most likely not the one that comes on in 2016. CGI, is not always a good thing and this movie definitely proved that! That is just the actors and portrayal of the characters NOT the story line! The story line between Splinter and Shredder is gone. Splinter is no longer a rat that was in a cage that learned how to fight by watching his master, he now has learned by himself after April saved him and the turtles. Wait what? This movie shouldn't have been called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it should have been called ""The April O'Neil Chronicles."" This movie is all about April, not the brothers, who don't really interact with one another.All I'm going to say about the appearance of this movie is, I'd give it a -100 out of 10.There were some funny parts in this movie, but not enough for me to giggle all night. Like the title of this says ""there is a reason this has a 5.9/ 10, I would have given it a 3/ 10..."" over all. I am only discussing a few points that seemed to bother me: acting, casting, plot, and design. I give all of these a 1/ 10 all together.

516,rsh198725,A horrible mess - Michael Bay Ruining another childhood fave!,3,19 October 2014,"OK so I read many reviews here, one of which a person stated they were a kid of the late 80s early 90s. So I have no understanding as to why that person would rate this highly.I do not want to make this a long rant, because the film had some good parts but much of the story made to connection to Japan or Ninjitsu the way it should have.In the 1987 series, the 1990 film and the 2003 series - each of those were great for many different reasons. The 2003 series came closest to the original comics. Each of those 3 made connections to Japan and Ninjitsu the 2003 series took it 1 step further and made connections to the mystical parts of the comic story line. Watch the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles 2003, series 5 (ninja tribunal) its on youtube.There is a massive back story for the shredder and how the foot clan started, this was never explained. The story touched on the past, but nothing else.The biggest insult - Splinters Master! Master Yoshi!!!! Thats where the conflict between splinter/ TMNT and the shredder starts.Its just another childhood franchise Michael bay ruined.. Megan Fox ""I don't want to be in a film always screaming"" thats all she did.In the next film they will introduce Rockstead and B bop but they were exposed to the 'ooze', which is how the first film ended. They should have started with the Ultrons and the first 5, how Oruku Saki (The shredder came to be) through madness. Then introduced Yoshi and splinter, and finally the turtles who were destined to become great.The film is a bit of a train wreck How did Aprils father die? The fire or Shredder?

Bad acting, awful story line, over the top costume (specially for Shredder) the gadgets have no explanation and don't feel genuine, because the film is set in the real world.

520,mattreed927,Teenage Mutant Ninja??? What?,3,27 October 2014,"I had to see this film because I grew up as a huge fan of the turtles and now a part of me wishes I didn't watch it. Nowadays, the technology is so accessible, with minor training anyone can make a short film or movie. In part due to this, the standards have dropped in story telling to where the only things that matter in a lot of action films now are CGI, explosions and corporate sponsorship. With the technological advancement, a lot of the present and next generation of film makers don't and won't know how to write a good story or portray one. TMNT is a great example of huge failure in story telling. The quality of the technology presently, makes it so the audience invests more in the reality of the films we watch. TMNT is a fun franchise that isn't winning awards for original story telling, but they missed the mark on everything that made this historical story special and meaningful. Pizza Hut got more out of this film than I did. A more accurate and suitable title would have been Teenage Mutant Ninja Hulks. Their attire is good, but they are too large.There wasn't enough Ninja fighting, just a lot of throwing around and sliding on snow. The fight sequences with Splinter are good.Splinter was portrayed with an American accent when originally this character has a Japanese accent and a good back story that wasn't told. The back story to do with the turtles mutation has been replaced with what I will only describe as being lame and a travesty. Shredder looks like a transformer in this film. It's Ridiculous! Making a 21st century version of TMNT is respectable, but there is nothing identifiable with making Shredder the equivalent of a robot. In the story he is originally a skilled martial artist. The robotic suit takes away from his character. Megan Fox performed well considering April Oneil, for this film, was written as a reporter without stature, credibility, independence and red hair! Far from her original nature. To say nothing of the fact that the opening sequence made the rest of the film anticlimactic! How about showing us the turtles, Splinter, Shredder, The Foot, New York City and then tell us what the story is about before we have a chance to get comfortable in our seats! The film did not build to a climax, it stayed very flat.Here's the thing, good stories stand up over how they look. I give those who were a part of making this film no credit for the quality of CGI and motion capture because that is the standard in these films now, it goes without saying. The Story comes first effects come second and should only support the story. This is basic and it wasn't done.I don't think this franchise was taken care of. I think this franchise was seen as another tool for making money and the fun element known throughout the history of TMNT was taken advantage of to do this. The enjoyable and solid origin story was overlooked and replaced with nothing worth talking about. Just enough was done to make the characters and story somewhat recognisable, the characters were given their names and were said to be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But non of it meant anything. The 1991 original movie is better than this 2014 version.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
521,warrena49,"i love this movie , by far one of my favorite",9,27 October 2014,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Review ""Awesome!!!"" is the word my nephew Jacob descried the movie ""Ninja Turtles"" to me, after I saw it I couldn't agree more. Directed by Johnathan Liebesman (Wrath of the Titans, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) he turns these usually animated characters into real life characters with some of the most amazing graphics I have ever seen. This adventurous, comedic action-packed movie had it all. The first Ninja Turtles movie was made back in 1990 with less graphics and the Turtles were in costumes throughout the film. The film kicks off in a subway station in the city New York, when a gang known as the Foot Clan is terrorizing the people of New York. Among the hostages in the subway is April O'Neal (Meagan Foxx), a struggling reporter, today is her lucky day. As the lights in the subway station goes off and on you instantly see the Foot Clan get destroyed by the turtles. April pulls out her phone and begins to record, even though you could barely see the turtles on the out of date phone. Swearing she saw the turtles and the next big story she runs and tells her boss, he doesn't believe her of course. April then starts to seek out the turtles, and one night she finds them. At a ship yard the Foot Clan is at it again, the massive turtles come in and protect the city once again, all while April gets a clear recording this time. After the turtles pulverize the Clan they disappear like the cool ninjas they are but, April is determined and finds them chatting it up on a nearby rooftop. April snaps a picture and Rapheal (Alan Ritchson) is the first to greet April with his tough guy attitude, and in this movie Ralph is about 6 foot 5 inches and about 300 lbs. April so shocked and afraid she passes out, upon awaking she is surrounded by the four massive turtles brothers Leonardo (Pete Poloszek), Michelangelo (Noel Fisher), Donatello (Jeremy Howard) and Ralph. They made her swear to keep quiet about what she saw or else they would find her. This movie is truly for anyone it is exciting and funny all through the movie.In this update to the ninja turtle movie put out in 1990, I see nothing but improvement. The turtles and Master Splinter (Danny Woodburn/Tony Shalhoub) looked very real and they looked more like people in a way. In the original version you could tell that there where actors in costumes. Even though in the 2014 version the turtles and Master Splinter are animated on to real life characters you would think it was really 6 ft. mutant turtles was on running around on set. Speaking of 6ft turtles, in the 1990 film the turtles were no more than 5ft 9in tall. The super sizing of the turtles really added more of that ""the turtles really can really kick ass"" feeling. I mean the turtles were massive, they were all above 6ft and probably around 300 lbs. This movie even added more character to the already diverse bunch, and they did it through the turtle's apparel. On Leo, the leader, he was always dressed in his samurai gear and was more serious. Ralph, the toughest and cool guy turtle, he was made out as the rough guy he had tattoos and made sure he always had his pair of sunglasses around his neck. Donny, the genius of the group, wore his prescription glasses even during battle and had one of his inventions attached to his shell. Last but not least, the coolest and funniest Mickey, he had his skateboard with him at all times and had his favorite colored shirt tied around his waist at all times.This movie didn't only upgrade tremendously, it gave its own twist to it. In the original film Master Splinter didn't start off as a rat, he was a human turned into a mutant rat who goes to live in a sewer after he escapes from where the experimenters held him captive and found the turtles. In this movie Splinter starts off as a rat and is mutated when a April O'Neal (as a young girl) saves the turtles her father was experimenting on from a lab fire and frees them into the sewer while they still had mutation formula on them. Splinter, as a normal rat in the sewer stumbles upon the turtles and receives the formula as well. He mutates very quickly being an already full grown rat. He takes the turtles and raises them.This movie is an outstanding action movie, it even has that little romance in it. In the 1990 film Ralph has really deep feelings for April but, in this movie it's Mickey that has the crazy love for April. Throughout the film Mickey announces his love for April even during the worst times like when they are falling down an icy, snowy mountain. I'm not usually a fan of the love in an action film but Mickey's ways of expressing his love was too funny to not like and respect. I guess this movie can do it all.I even got excited when I saw villains! I'm telling you the costumes are awesome in this movie. They made Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) look like a straight up savage. He was probably equipped with hundreds of knives and could shoot knives out and they would boomerang back to him! He stood to be about 6ft 6in tall and around 250 lbs. I guess he had to be fighting those massive turtles. When Shredder was introduce you instantly knew the movie just got real. I couldn't wait to get back to where Shredder was when fighting was happening. An action movie is nothing without the deranged antagonist to make it a little hard for the hero.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I normally don't enjoy these types of films but my son is really into tmnt so I sat down to watch it with him and I thought it was great! For all the people that are giving it a bad review I think you's are all wrong! For the people that seem to say that they don't get the story straight about Aprils dad's death how thick can you be it is one of the easiest story lines to get I have Ever seen for one they think her father died in the fire but is later revealed that Eric sacs killed her father what is so hard to believe about that people thought he died in the fire but no he was killed easy as 1 2 3, so don't listen to all these stupid people who think it wasn't good because for me it was great I watched it before I seen any of the reviews on here and was shocked to see how harsh some people can be towards this film, I made an account solely for the purpose of writing a review for this so enjoy the film people it's great and hopefully the make a sequel out of this because I can't wait for next one if they end up doing another!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This Turtles movie blows it out of the city down an awesome snow covered armored car chase and pancaked into a crater in the streets of New York. Turtles are cheesy and that is just how I like my pizza. Those who don't like and spread hate amongst it just don't get these guys, and if they don't want to watch the movie they are obliged to. Megan Fox is a pretty girl and does a good April. Vern is silly as ever and just a little bit cowardly but can get up to snuff for the protect his coworker.

I have been a die- hard Turtles fan since the dawn of time. With that said, this film makes both Turtles 3 (1993) and We Wish You a Turtles Christmas (1994) seem like cinematic masterpieces a la Stanley Kubrick. The effects, oh my!, forever burned into my retinas. Both Shredder and Splinter look absolutely ridiculous. In fact, I can say without any reservation that the version of Splinter in ""We Wish You A Turtles Christmas"" looks much better ;) Oh and there's a terrible plot, sh*t acting, bad character designs!!! and effects that makes you wish you were born blind (and deaf!).

527,cldarrel2003,Full of Plot Holes But Somehow Entertaining,7,1 December 2014,"I struggled with how to rate this, but i went with 7 out of nostalgia for TMNT. The new origin story is just BAD. The connection to April is too forced, the girl who saved them is the same person to discover them 15 years later in New York? Splinter becomes a master ninja through studying one book? Shredder instantly talks to a giant Rat like its no big deal and assumes that this rat new of his plans all along? While he was right I don't think thats how any sane person would react. Bullet Proof Turtles? Fox had too many lines, as eye candy she is not bad but watching her struggle to carry a scene as a lead is painful. Shredder looked like a transformer covered in chrome. but with all of this, the CG turtles weren't the worst, the voice acting and turtle interactions carried it. the corny jokes from my childhood were relived in short segments with some decent action scenes. The action scenes started strong but fizzled hard at the end with the fight between the turtles and shredder. The turtles were fun to watch on screen and they should have been the main focus of the story instead of April. All in all, lower all expectations before watching and try not to think and its an enjoyable time.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
528,gtippett23,What are you all complaining about,7,2 December 2014,I liked this movie in places. I think that they got the characters spot on except for April. Mikey was absolutely perfect. The director showed all the traits of Michelangelo from the comics. His voice was spot on and made him lovable and was my favorite character. Although I think the back stories where pretty messed up they fitted the story lines perfectly and kept me on the edge of my seat right through the movie. The main antagonist shredder was done poorly but the costume design was excellent and shredders costume was perfect and was terrifying with all the knives protruding from the armor. Overall a good movie confusing in places but is worthy of a sequel if it is done by Michael Bay again,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Obviously not the most exciting story line at first but its just starting the first one. Plenty of action, comedy and humour. I thought in my opinion that it was great bring on the next one. The characters were all played by very suitable actors and the Characters them selves played the typical personalities that we know. Great Great Great Great !!. The graphics were very good and were not to animated to look more Like a cartoon and not like a film. I think the direction was good and the story line fit well. I think Raphael looked like an absolute tank and was awesome. Leonardo is the leader as always and I love the fact the voice was good old Knoxville himself. Michelangelo was great and humorous as always and Donatello was brilliant and clever just like we all know.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Unfortunately by the end of the film it was too late and I realized I had just wasted nearly two hours of my life and was left feeling a little bit more dead inside.. With annoying voice acting, horrible CG and some of the worst ""acting"" by one particular character the entire movie seemed as though it wanted me to turn it off and throw the disc out the window..

Shredder, and the generic corporate charter were stupefied and dummied down for American context for the flick; if I had written the script; April O'Neill and Master Splinter would have had to team up with Raphael, to find the mutagen, and link it to the Japanese alchemy from the scrolls past in order invoke their evolutionary link to warlords studied through the ninjitstu author's book, to defeat the demons that were mechanized by the foot.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Turtles actually looked wickedWith raph best, Leo and the mikey and donatello looking the least best. But the action scenes and jokes are great. Original ideas.through out the movie. Fox was great for the part. And I like how he changed up the history of the turtles. People need to enjoy this movie as its own and not compare it. It kicks ass. Shredder is a tank with an amazing exo skeleton. The turtles are mutants and it makes sense that they are huge and powerful. Each had their original personalities.no complaints at all except for one of donatellos lines about guns. That was cheese.

People didn't like this movie because..1. Michael Bay - let me start by saying, guess who's name was all over it? Idiots. It's oh so trendy lately to hate on Bay because of his explosive, action packed, cgi'd movies. Get over it, it's fun I watch, clearly, as his films gross well. You knew, with the producer/director/writer combo what this movie was going to entail. Don't go to a sushi joint if you don't like seafood! Douchebags.2. Megan Fox - let me start by.. Oh yeah, same same. Again, trendy. People, I swear, ""Oh I'm so much better than these movies because I look for the deep plot, character development, relationships etc."" ... ""She's not even a good actor, they just cast her for her looks"". Yes, she's sub-par. But she's usually supporting. She's there FOR her looks, they bring something to the screen. She's also usually lightheartedly mocked on-screen for it. Enjoy her for what she is, eye candy. If you want a sense of attachment and understanding for her, you're in the wrong movie! Douchebags.3. Slacking Plot, Writing, Character Development, and Over the top Action - ""Oh I'm so much better than Generation Y because all that pleases them is fast action, and colors, and zooming and swooshing, and lame fun stuff"" Oh Gawwds people, honestly, this is all I think when I read your high and mighty reviews because you saw a Big Budget/Bay/Fox/Cartoon and expected a Shakespearean masterpiece. Douchebags.Quick small (((spoiler)))Extra Bit - ""mehhh, (lifts nose) preposterous film. It shared nothing of the original classics, by gods, the turtles were bulletproof for goodness sake. And the villains used guns. Absurd."" (Heavy sarcasm following) Yes. Crazy that the MUTATED turtles were bulletproof. No, it's not! They're giant mutated turtles that practice martial arts. They can be whatever we need them to be, and because it's 2014, we need them to be bulletproof because guess what?! Our modern bad guys don't carry around freakin swords! So they modernized it. End of (((spoiler)))So. If you were one of the geniuses(sarcasm) that saw this film not expecting the three features I just listed, even considering that every bit of advertising more than summed up these three things, then I'm sorry I'm not sorry that it failed to reach your misguided expectations. ReviewReally deserved a 6/10. It's a pretty good movie. It's a little different from the originals, but they didn't follow the comic books to the detail either. It carries a bit more of a dangerous, grim feeling to it, but there is still some good hearted humor. The turtles are heavily muscled and layered in ""operator gear"" with a badass feeling to them, but you still see a goofy side. Mostly carried by Mikey of course. Don't expect a solid plot line. Or in depth characterization. Or an emotional roller-coaster. It's fun to watch, funny, and pleasing to the eyes.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Initially, I heard the rumors about them being aliens, and since nothing I had read since discarded that idea, I had been wary of watching this movie. Another thing that made me wary was the first image of their faces. It definitely caught me off guard and almost scared me a little. Though, I think that was because I wasn't prepared for it.

First I would like to say I can't be the only one who wanted to punch michalangelo straight in the mouth after 5 minutes of what was a complete flop on adapting his personality. I thought at first listening to him that it was Johna Hill voicing his character, (Johna Hill annoys me so)then comes the huge story changes and plot holes the biggest one... spoilers ahead... being that splinter having been raised by humans in a lab with 4 turtles approx the same age is not only older than the turtles as the original series shows... but also somehow manages to have a somewhat Asian accent having spent no time with Asian people which also brings into question how is their conflict between him and shredder when their is no connection whatsoever. And to put the cherry on top of the crap cake he learns Ninjuitsu from a book... a freaking book and masters it in 10 years. Now granted ninjas and martial arts masters of the old days did learn from scrolls occasionally but they were a visual tool created to accompany a masters training not to learn solely from. And I won't even begin to ask why this movie keeps following april when it's called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and not Token Reporter Eye Candy. all in all this movie is a horrid mistake throughout the only turtles personalities they got closest to being right is Leonardo and Raphael. Mikey was a disappointment. and Donnie was easy to ignore he didn't really strike me or have me pay attention to him",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

I'm not at all familiar with the original comic or even the original movie so cannot speak in relation to those; however as a stand-alone film I was pleasantly surprised, especially with the cinematography. I loved the overall colour (yellow leather jacket that Megan Fox wears throughout the whole film was an extremely smart choice!), bold camera angles, snappy editing and rhythmic action sequences. The storyline is simple - which I'm not complaining about - and that's even better because you just need to sit there and enjoy the cool scenes!Definitely recommended.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
546,Ben_Kelly1138,The Kids Deserve Better.,3,29 August 2015,"I can see how this film came together. A bunch of writers got together in a room and decided to take an IP like the Ninja Turtles, which is already very silly and essentially makes no sense at all, and take it to the next level of stupidity, while at the same time stripping out all of the fun and humor from the source material and replacing it with hulking-rage-filled-turtle- shaped monsters, that play supporting characters in a film about the world's most incompetent news reporter: April O'Neil played by acting sensation Megan Fox. That's right. Make no mistake. The protagonist, the main character, our hero, the person we spend the majority of our time with is April O'Neal. The Turtles don't show up for 20 MINUTES. All I can think of is what this movie must be like for an 8 year old kid seeing this. I think after the first 10 minutes you'd just assume this was just a lame movie about Megan Fox struggling to find her way in the cut throat world of local news, like that Rachel McAdams movie Morning Glory only with Megan Fox and stupid. After that there's a boring speech given by William Fichtner to a bunch of people that makes no sense, and then every child's favorite ... a scene completely in Japanese that requires reading English subtitles! It's amazing. They've literally made a film that's too boring and dark for kids, but too stupid for adults. There's no joy here at all. It's just another BS gritty re-boot that rips off the visual tone of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, while lacking any of the emotion or depth those films possessed. If you're looking for a fun action adventure that actually works for children, you're better off with The Incredibles or The Lego Movie. If you're looking for a great action film in general, you're better off with John Wick or The Raid. Bottom Line: WE ALL DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
547,raccoonavenger,"Film, foam and froth.",3,7 September 2015,"Before anyone can say otherwise, this movie provoked me to think about something I had never given thought to before.Curious about the semantic discussion in the beginning of the film, I decided to research the definitions of 'foam' and 'froth.' Surprisingly, I found that the metaphorical meaning of froth given by Will Arnett's character (Vernon Fenwick) was actually correct:Froth, noun 1. bubbles that form in or on a liquid 2. something that is appealing but that has no serious value or interest. Merriam-Webster DictionaryShockingly, the correction by Megan Fox's character (April O'Neil) does not include this metaphorical meaning:Foam, noun 1. a mass of small bubbles that are formed in or on a liquid 2. a substance that is like a thick liquid made of many small bubbles 3. a soft material that is used to make many productsInterestingly, this is not so much a short-coming of the character as it is an oversight of the script-writer. Indeed, if you wish to draw attention to a semantical nuance, that would otherwise be unnoticed by the vast majority of the audience, please, at the very minimum, do it correctly.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
548,nikan-70473,It's a combination of extravagant action and some serious humor,10,9 September 2015,"I don't know about other people, but if you love this genre, and are a fan of the TMNTs I highly recommend this movie, it blew my mind, the humor is right on spot with their witty jokes. Mikey is absolutely killing it with his phrases and his actions. The action is great, the effects are first class, the movie is definitely worth watching, I've watched it about 5 times so far and it kicks me in the nuts every time, I laugh my ass of. I rated it 10/10 because it has everything I asked for in this type of movie, I was shocked to be honest when I saw them, the high details, the fighting skills, everything. I love it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
549,tsotetsitshepo,Kill the Girl,3,13 September 2015,"Personally like the Turtles they are strong and there costumes are absolutely phenomenal even though people don't like them. But I see them as the only authentic thing in the movie and also the only thing that took time to be created.But as for the Girl who is supposedly the main character i think she needs to be given a common sense or killed in the second movie. That girl is a pain in the lower part of the back. trust me if the second installment is to be hailed as a great movie .That chick must die or become mute,which ever one gets her to shut her trap.Cause seriously her random screaming ain't workings for me.I give this movie a 3.for the Turtles and of course their swag.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
550,noahmac-13671,Rancid,1,22 September 2015,"Oh man, don't waste your time. Megan Fox still hasn't learned how to close her mouth. Where I come from, that's considered rude or a sign of a serious birth defect...definitely not ""hot"". She should lay off the botox too.Poor costumes, the prosthetics looked like they came from toys-r-us. The CG was reasonably miserable, even by 3rd world standards.Why waste what little talent that was in the movie on THIS movie? Given a choice between this and razor blades jammed in my eyes...I'd take the razors and smile.No acting, bad story, even children don't like it.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
551,kneedeepwater,Really enjoyable film,8,14 December 2015,"Whilst clearly not a masterpiece, this film had me smiling and engaged from the off. As a fan of the older turtles films and cartoon I wasn't sure how I'd react to the CGI versions, however it wasn't as difficult to swallow as I feared.Still laughing about the cat playing chopsticks with chopsticks.The action was very watchable which is not something I would say about a comparable film such as transformers.If I were to recommend this film id say it's clearly aimed at the youngsters, however me being a 26 year old male, I'd definitely say there's something there for the slightly older audience.Cried just a tiny bit a couple of times!",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
552,kimura-sensei,I want my 2hrs back...,2,9 August 2014,"Oh good lord... this is extremely bad. This movie is clearly for kids. As long as there's martial art action going on, kids are happy. For the parents... horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible characters. There's not a single redeeming thing in this movie. 2 stars is for the CGI graphics only.I wanted to leave twice in this movie, 30 minutes and 1hr into the movie. I was hoping there was something to salvage or at least let me take a nap, but no, it was pure agony to sit through this boring movie. I wouldn't watch this even if it's free. If you want to watch TMNT, go watch the first live action movie, at least that's tolerable.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
553,christian-75192,One of the stupidest experiences in motion pictures,1,21 September 2016,"I went into this movie expecting some light-hearted entertainment. Unfortunately, this movie is so full of *glaring* stupidity that I could not watch it all the way through. The following will contain spoilers, however they won't spoil this rotten movie. Just don't watch it. ANd don't make your kids watch it if you'd like them to grow up smart...It all started with April O'Neil who is obviously an imbecile and contrary to her aspirations she's well-placed in her job showing her face to the masses but leaving actual journalism to others. Apart from the fact that she just acts like she doesn't know what she's supposed to do (script anyone?), she tries to convince her boss to run a story on a vigilante with ""that's the point, there's nothing!"" – really? Yes, her boss is supposed to shoot her down in the beginning so she has to be the loner investigating on her own, but who could take that seriously? Her next try is even worse: instead of just showing her boss the video she made the night before, she raves on about talking turtles that only she herself has seen... Who wouldn't fire her after that? Then there's the focus on April. It's totally fine that the movie would start with her, seeing as the turtles are to be introduced as ninjas, which means they are usually invisible, and the initial perspective should really be with the normal populace so you can get into the mood. However, her presence is really annoying as early as the second scene with the turtles. The first one was OK, but now that the turtles rather visibly beat up some mooks, we see the woman's face more than half the time, and most of the rest, you just see the mooks flying around.Next up, the villains: they're kind of bland in the beginning, and it just goes downhill from there. Shredder's first appearance mainly consists of him being told that a bunch of batmans on crack just mopped the floor with his mooks. For a powerful man he's rather irritable, angrily ordering their deaths by any means necessary. But then again, maybe he's just an angry man with a short fuse – that actually could happen, so yeah. But when he actually joins the fight, he's not really a ninja master, but more like the carrier suit from ""Aliens"" (or ""Alien 3""?) with some additional mechanic arms mimicking his natural arms and equipped with a bunch of throwable serrated swords?!? What? the? hell? That's not cool, that's just dumb. Let's not forget his ""right hand minion"", Dr Sacks, the rich scientist who wanted to use the substance that created the turtles for an evil plan he had with Shredder. And since he likes to brag, of course he tells the turtles this grand plan, and has it kind of (not really) illustrated by having one of the mooks murdering before their eyes. Their plan actually was pretty simple: poison the whole city and then sell the cure for lots of money... Erm yeah, sounds like the writers tried to copy the plot of ""Batman Begins"" but failed to understand the subtlety in the League of Shadows' objective of actually killing everybody and not saving them for money. And why would Shredder even hatch a plan that just benefits his pawn's bankroll? It's just a very stupid excuse for a plot.There's one major aspect I left out so far: the Turtles themselves. They are the only thing that was not completely botched in this obscenity. The CGI was decent, their characters were mostly well portrayed, and the choreography was nice. Then again, their fighting was more like the Hulk than the Batman, and we all should know which of those is a master ninja. Just because they're green doesn't mean they need to resemble the big green guy who ""SMASH"" everything... In the subway scene, they first toss the mooks around like tennis balls before leaving them tied up in a neat row. That just doesn't mesh. Batman does beat up mooks and leaves them tied up, but he beats them up ninja style and actually needs more than a second to tie up two dozen guys...So all in all, just a stupid movie, in the bad sense. If you don't know the good sense, watch ""Deadpool"" – that's a stupid movie, as well, and it's a hilarious, well-made, movie. Also, I usually don't review movies, but this one is so bad, I felt I had to. Don't watch this, watch ""Deadpool"" for light entertainment or ""Batman Begins"" for ninjas.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
554,mazadmanesh,Michael Bay should get a life sentence,1,17 August 2014,"Can someone please stop Michael Bay raping all my childhood favorite cartoons and comics? Please? I'm begging you.If you like this movie, you're probably a teenager. Thats OK. But if you like this movie and you've been born in the 80's, there is something wrong with you. They should boycott this movie and any Michael Bay movie.I don't even know where to begin. There is so much wrong with this movie. Just watch the classic cartoon and you will understand. Megan Fox in Playboy, yes please. Megan Fox in a movie, please don't.Hopefully this is the last Bay rape, but i'm afraid it's not.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
555,zimmyis,Why would they make this atrocity?,1,12 November 2014,"Why any of that? What is wrong with everybody involved in this production? Why would they do this? The turtles: looked awful. Splinter: looked awful. Shredder: So painfully void of personality it hurt, and he looked just awful. How can a movie lack any redeeming factors when the source material is so much fun. I feel sick in my mouth and mind after watching this. Bay, stop it! The rest of you, NO! Just NO! Bad people, BAD! If I could go back in time I'd punch you all in your creative innards and hope this bile spilt out before making it to the big screen. Why not take the rest of my happy childhood and stamp it into the dirt with your expensive, misguided hobnail boots? I've enjoyed being spat at in the face more than I enjoyed this keg of tripe. A humourless debacle that leaves one feeling stale, hollow, cheated and bilious from beginning to end. I'd rather uppercut a kitten into space than sit through this beige excrement one more time.Not my favourite movie.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

558,violent_guy_k,Make up your own minds! Not all bad.,6,27 October 2014,"I'm no critic. But that means I'm not watching films expecting some great artwork of master craft acting and decade-in-the-making plot lines filled with thought provoking scripting. This is a movie about Teenage Mutant Hero/Ninja Turtles, let's not take it too seriously.As with anything of this nature, reboot or otherwise, the action is often frenetic and energised likely to appeal to children wanting some new heroes to pound the bad guys relentlessly. That's the best bit.The acting is, at best, average with a script that pushes too hard for jokes which have a 50/50 chance at best of getting a laugh. The story is your generic sort, predictable, over-used plot you can see reaching it's over wrought climax with recognisable pace. They've tried to throw in a few ""twists"" and played mildly fast and loose with their source material to make everything as easy to digest for first-timers as possible.The effects were pretty good, CGI was top class, and the new look Turtles grew on me thanks to four pretty well defined personalities akin to the old favourites.Like any non-children watching this, I was familiar with the 90's Live-action films, video games and the earlier animated TV series(1987 originally) which me and my brothers enjoyed on VHS. But I didn't want or expect this film to be emulations of that, or a work of brilliance, I wanted a fun movie about Ninja turtles taking it to Japanese mega-villain Shredder. It was JUST that. Fun movie, good effects, bad acting and a fair swathe of action. I'll be interested to see where they go with this reboot should any sequels emerge.Give it a try, take in the good reviews with the bad. It's worth a rent if not a purchase.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
