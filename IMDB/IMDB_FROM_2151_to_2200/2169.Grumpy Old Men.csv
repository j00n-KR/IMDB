0,MartinHafer,"To me, it was more a sweet slice of life movie instead of a comedy.",7,7 July 2021,"I enjoyed ""Grumpy Old Men"" but was surprised as it seemed less funny than I expected and was more a poignant slice of life film...especially at the end. This is not a complaint...just an observation.The story is about two neighbors, John and Max (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) who seem to hate each other but who also have a long history and a complicated relationship. They act as if they hate each other but over time it's not so clear. During much of the movie, the pair argue over a younger woman (Ann-Margret) who moves onto their block...they each want her and it only stokes their rivalry. See the film to see where all this goes.The best thing about the movie was the acting. Late in the film in particular, the actors (particularly Matthau) show amazing range without even saying something. A real touching story...not to be missed.",Grumpy Old Men
1,bkoganbing,Geezers in love,8,21 October 2012,"After a hiatus of over a decade Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau came gloriously back in parts to suit their senior citizen status in Grumpy Old Men. They may move a little slower, but their comic timing hasn't slowed up one bit.The setting is a small town in Minnesota where these two old neighbors and widowers have this rivalry going back for years. Next to the ice fishing which they and apparently everyone else enjoys during the winter, their favorite pastime is cracking wise and playing jokes to one up the other. One thing that has slowed up is their libidos.But that's about to change when Ann-Margret moves across the street. The sight of a pretty woman right on the block is all these two old geezers need to get into action. As for Ann-Margret she's a free spirit of sorts who's flattered with the attention. Matthau has another friend in high places, his son Kevin Pollak is elected mayor of their town. Lemmon has a daughter played by Darryl Hannah and a grandson and she's married to Christopher McDonald, but they're estranged. The kids like each other and both of their fathers.Lemmon also has tax problems, he owes some big bucks to the IRS and the villain in Grumpy Old Men is tax man, a most officious Buck Henry. The IRS is an agency everyone hates because it's the only place where you really are guilty until proved innocent in the USA. What happens to Lemmon is all too true. I myself could tell you stories of the IRS problems I've had through no fault of my own. I never owed as much as Lemmon did however and all due to an accounting error while Lemmon was filing jointly with his wife when she was still alive over a decade earlier. Some eager beaver auditor at IRS caught it and the interest and penalties compounded have him ready to lose his house.I also have to note the presence of another pair of old geezers in the cast, Ossie Davis and Burgess Meredith. Davis owns a convenience store and in the opinion of Lemmon charges outrageously for bait during the ice fishing season. And Meredith is Lemmon's nonagenarian father who is past the age of caring what anyone thinks of him or his opinions.Grumpy Old Men is a wonderful film for the elderly. Now that I'm at the age of Lemmon's and Matthau's character, I can enjoy this now more than ever. For Geezers of all ages.",Grumpy Old Men
2,SnoopyStyle,legendary duo,7,27 September 2016,"John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are lifelong rivals in Wabasha, Minnesota. Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) is their new neighbor and a new source of rivalry. John is avoiding IRS agent Elliot Snyder (Buck Henry) and his final notice. The guys fought over a girl back in the day whom John later married. John has two children, Brian and Melanie. Brian was killed in Vietnam War. Melanie (Daryl Hannah), separated from husband Mike, has daughter Allie. Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) is running for mayor. Chuck (Ossie Davis) runs the local fishing store. The two rivals and John's father (Burgess Meredith) spend their spare time ice fishing.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau still have it. They continue to have great chemistry and they are fun together. Their characters' rivalry is actually a small problem because it keeps the guys apart. A movie with these men should use every means possible to keep them together on the screen for as long as possible. This may not be the greatest of comedies but it has a couple of laughs and a legendary duo.",Grumpy Old Men
3,Hitchcoc,The Grumpy Old Odd Couple,9,5 January 2017,"We lost a couple of truly gifted comedians with the deaths of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. These two guys were hilarious alone, but put them together, and it was dynamite. They shined brightly in ""The Odd Couple"" and are equally delightful in this one. Throw in the veteran, Burgess Merideth as an even older grumpy old man, and it's even better. Ann-Margret plays the attractive senior woman (we should look so good) that catches the hearts of these old goats. There is so much byplay and competition between them that you can't help yourselves. They keep butting heads as they try to make headway with the lovely lady, and, of course, make fools of themselves. If you want to hang on to the end, see the bit with the three male stars going at it at the conclusion in a verbal joust.",Grumpy Old Men
4,mark.waltz,They ain't buddy buddy.,7,29 January 2020,"Are they really grumpy old men or just two curmudgeon neighbors who need to face the fact that their decades old feud is nothing but a facade. That feud is tested by the arrival of the beautiful redhead Ann-Margret who has just moved across the street in their snowy Minnesota town. It's a reunion for Walter Matthau and Jack Lennon whose lives have crossed for years creating a supposed resentment that has no apparent motive but boredom. Burgess Meredith is hysterically funny as Lemmon's foul mouthed father with an unashamed sexual innuendo in every remark. Lemmon is facing a possible eviction for back taxes and must deal with the determined Buck Henry who seems all too pleased by his assignment of removing Lemmon from his home.Noticing that both Lemmon and Matthau have been eyeing her ever since she arrived, the former kitten with a whip goes out of her way to meet them, adding to their hatred which started due to Matthau's love for Lemmon's late wife. Darryl Hannah plays Lemmon's daughter who's having marital issues while Kevin Pollak is Matthau's son who knows the reason behind the feud which goes back nearly 50 years and who once had a crush on Hannah. Their vengeance against each other is completely childish but very funny, ranging from using the same TV brand remote to keep changing the other's channel, planting fish in the other's car and even moving their fishing huts out to thinning ice.As for Ann-Margret, she plays quite an odd duck, taking a sauna in an outside hut and then rolling around in the snow in pure ecstasy. Basically, she's too good to be true, but funny none the less! In a smaller, touching role, veteran stage actor Ossie Davis plays the wise owner of the bait store who seems amused by their antics but finds them overall pretty insufferable and idiotic. For their apparent feud, Lemmon and Matthau act snarky to each other but are basically inseparable. When it's revealed why they've been feuding, it really comes down to nothing, but aren't most feuds? In lesser hands than the two male stars, this could have been rather irritating because of their antics, but it ends up being quite the crowd pleaser when all is said and done and does open the grounds for a sequel.",Grumpy Old Men
5,classicsoncall,"""Holy moly!""",7,12 April 2014,"Well you're never going to convince me that someone who looks like Ann-Margret is going to wind up marrying a character like John Gustafson. I know, I know, it happens in real life sometimes; it's just that you're not going to convince me of it.But if you like to see a couple of old codgers go at it hammer and tong, then you'll get a kick out of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in this flick. Amicable enemies since childhood, they never let an opportunity for a good zinger go by, but underneath it all you know they have a soft spot for each other. It took that hospital scene to bring it out when Max (Matthau) had to break down and call Gustafson 'friend' in order to see him. Good timing there too, as you had to watch him think about it.By the time this picture was made, I guess you could say Ann-Margret was no spring chicken herself, but she can sure carry her age better than most. I like the way she challenged Gus to seek out new things, a bit of a subliminal message in the picture as a takeaway for anyone watching to stay young at heart. Sadly, most of the principals from the film have passed on (Lemmon, Matthau and Burgess Meredith), but with their movies and comedy as a legacy, they'll keep many a generation young at heart for a long time.",Grumpy Old Men
6,lee_eisenberg,snow excuse,7,28 April 2006,"Sort of reprising their roles from ""The Odd Couple"", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau play a pair of elderly rivals in a small Minnesota town whose mutual hostility gets agitated by the arrival of a younger woman (Ann-Margaret). OK, so this story seems to get used a lot, but ""Grumpy Old Men"" shows - if nothing else - that Lemmon and Matthau still had it, and that Ann-Margaret's pretty hot. Much of the humor comes in Lemmon's and Matthau's pranks against each other.Overall, this movie isn't really anything special, but how can you not like a Lemmon-Matthau comedy? Also starring are Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah, Kevin Pollak, Ossie Davis and Buck Henry. Worth seeing, if only once. The sequel was cute, if absurd.It's weird when you think about it: Lemmon and Matthau co-starred in so many silly comedies, but they also appeared in the dead serious ""JFK"" (although they didn't share any scenes).",Grumpy Old Men
7,jboothmillard,Grumpy Old Men,4,21 May 2008,"From director Donald Petrie (Ri¢hie Ri¢h, Miss Congeniality) this isn't one of the funniest films I've seen, and to be honest I think only the two leading actors make it worth watching. Basically John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are two old guys that are neighbours, and continuously argue and insult each other, and have done so far over 50 years. And when new neighbour Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves in, both men are attracted to her and their bickering only gets worse as they try and get her attention or affection. Also starring Batman's Burgess Meredith as Grandpa Gustafson, Daryl Hannah as Melanie, Kevin Pollak as Jacob Goldman, Ossie Davis as Chuck, Buck Henry as Elliot Snyder and Mike as Christopher McDonald. There are some quite amusing slapstick moments, quite a good happy ending, and some outtakes in the end credits, but I don't think I would watch this a second time. A sequel, Grumpier Old Men, followed in 1995. Okay!",Grumpy Old Men
8,ccthemovieman-1,This Made Me Grumpy,2,28 September 2006,"Old men swearing and acting like stupid teenagers for two hours is funny and good entertainment? I didn't think so, but I guess I was in the minority as a lot of people liked this movie.Personally, I thought it was disgusting and certainly revealed that older classic-era actors like Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are just as profane and weak as modern-day stars, Meredith in particular as he was the worst offender in here.One thing: I can't blame these guys for making fools of themselves over Ann- Margaret. Even in her older age, she's still a very attractive woman.",Grumpy Old Men
9,rmax304823,"Corny, enjoyable comedy",6,13 August 2006,"I wasn't expecting much of this movie -- another rip off of ""The Odd Couple"" -- but my ten-year old kid, an adopted Korean orphan I call Chopsticks, insisted on watching it and I was pleasantly surprised.Matthau and Lemon have hated each other since one stole the other one's girl away. (Both wives are gone now.) They play nasty pranks on one another, relishing the other's frustration and anger. Meanwhile Matthau's son and Lemon's daughter are getting to know one another in a subplot. Also meanwhile a ravishing redhead from liberated California (Anne-Margaret) moves in across the street in this small, snow-bound, Minnesota town, and she falls for Lemon. At Lemon's insistence though she has a brief fling with Matthau before the inevitable ending.They're not really the odd couple here. They're new characters who happen to suffer adimadversions to each other. The gags are quick, fast, and sometimes pretty funny. Burgess Meredith, Lemon's Pop, declaims, ""The first ninety-four years go by REAL fast! Then one day you wake up and realize you're not eighty-one anymore! Mount the woman!"" At one point during an argument, Matthau attacks Lemon with a frozen fish and the two old men (68 and 73, I think) go through all the motions of a carefully choreographed action-movie combat scene -- Matthau pinning down Lemon, Lemon holding the threatening fish at bay as Matthau forces it down slowly towards Lemon's chest, both men puffing and grunting.It shoulda stayed a comedy. But it's tough to make a movie about old age that's consistently funny. Death is always around the corner, and impotence and failing health and financial crises are already here. It's easy enough to make a heart-wrenching movie about it, even with an uplifting ending. (""Umberto D."") This one tempers the comedy by putting all of the deficits of old age on ready display. A friend dies in his sleep. (""Lucky bastard."") Anne-Margaret -- ""Tell me, Gustaffson, when did you last make love?"" Lemon -- ""October 19th -- 1978."" (First used in ""Harry and Tonto."") Thanksgiving and Christmas are captured on screen in all their sentimentality and anguish. Lemon has a heart attack while Nat King Cole is singing ""Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland"" on the soundtrack. Speaking of the soundtrack, the soapy score belongs in a Walt Disney fairy tale from the 1940s. Yes, folks, there are heart-wrenching scenes galore. Uplifting ones too. Lemon and Anne-Margaret making snow angels. All of them done is a cornball manner.""Old age isn't for sissies,"" as Bette Davis is supposed to have said, but this movie is. The funny parts redeem the expectable misfortunes. Here is Burgess Meredith watching Ossie Davis visit Anne-Margaret's house on Thanksgiving -- ""Looks like he's going to play pat the pony"" or something like that. Stick around for the out-takes under the end credits. Looks like they had a good time making this film. It's worth watching too. Thank you, Chop.",Grumpy Old Men
10,moonspinner55,Friendly enough sitcom with shock-laughs,6,26 July 2006,"In a chilly Minnesota ice-fishing town, two lifelong enemies (who live next door to each other) compete for Ariel, the free-spirited new redhead on the block (Ann-Margret, doing her best with an underwritten role). Comic vehicle for Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon isn't strenuous, it breezes right along, but this type of farce, an insult-slinging sitcom, has been patented and packaged along a cinema assembly-line reaching back many years. The plot is constructed (and constricted) by its one-liners, like a foul-mouthed Neil Simon; the grouchy leads play up the old coot business for all it's worth, but they are so cantankerous that it isn't too likely life-loving Ariel would want either of these guys (her rapport with shopkeeper Ossie Davis, though seen at a distance, appears to be much warmer). Still, there are some laughs on occasion, the locations are well-captured, and the smartly-picked supporting cast is winning. **1/2 from ****",Grumpy Old Men
11,edwagreen,Grumpy Old Men ***1/2 We Need More Grumps Like this,9,6 August 2008,"Wonderful film pairing the great Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon as feuding neighbors who really both have so much in common.The feud intensifies with the coming of widowed neighbor-Ann Margret to the neighborhood. Both our old friends go after her.Daryl Hannah is along for the ride. As Lemmon's separated from her husband's father, she portrays an interesting character. Along for the laughs in Lemmon's father, portrayed with great wit by Burgess Meredith.Naturally, we have the crisis situation that brings the two elderly gentlemen together. If you think you're in for a funeral at the end, guess again. It's a great ending to an endearing film. Matthau and Lemmon had such great on screen chemistry together. This film is no exception.",Grumpy Old Men
12,BandSAboutMovies,Grumps,5,26 May 2020,"Before Mark Steven Johnson made Daredevil and Ghost Rider, he wrote this movie. It reunites The Odd Couple team of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, pretty much letting them run the movie as Max Goldman and John Gustafson Jr., two neighbors who have been at war as long as they can remember.Now, the arrival of Ariel Truax (Ann-Margaret) creates an even bigger battle, as her beauty and charm is desired by both men. There's also plenty of great lines for Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's father (he must have had him when he was 17, given their age difference) and the improbable, near science fiction writing as Kevin Pollak somehow scores Daryl Hannah.Buck Henry has a nice turn as an IRS man and hey - Christopher McDonald plays a jerk. I mean, is anybody better at it?This was directed by Donald Petrie, who has sadly infiltrated my DVD player more times than I'd like to claim, thanks to movies like Opportunity Knocks, Mystic Pizza and Miss Congeniality.Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were strongly considered for the leads, which would have made this a very different movie.",Grumpy Old Men
13,michaelRokeefe,A funny look at two men that have been friends forever.,7,27 January 2000,"This movie is a laugh riot. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau play two neighbors that have known each other their whole lives. They have been arguing about anything and everything for the last thirty years. The still vivacious, Ann-Margret moves into the neighborhood and now the fun really begins. Both old grumps try out doing the other in order to get the possible affection of the new comer. Burgess Meredith plays Grandpa and just about single handedly steals the show. Playing cardboard parts are Ossie Davis, Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah. Buck Henry is as always...funny.  You will laugh till your sides hurt. And don't miss the hilarious out takes during the closing credits.",Grumpy Old Men

15,hitchcockthelegend,Do me a favour. Put your lip over your head... and swallow.,7,12 June 2013,"Grumpy Old Men is directed by Donald Petrie and written by Mark Steven Johnson. It stars Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollack, Burgess Meredith, Ossie Davis, Daryl Hannah and Buck Henry. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Johnny E. Jensen.A lifelong feud between two neighbours has been continuing since for ever. Now in the twilight of their lives, things get worse when a new female neighbour moves across the street.A perennially fun viewing experience, one that boasts a wonderfully mature cast having a good time in the process. It would be easy to decry the formula, the trajectory of where it will go, and maybe stand tall and proclaim the writing isn't up to the standard of a Wilder or Simon movie, but that's kind of missing the point. It's a new era of film and the makers of Grumpy Old Men have tailored it to suit impressively the twin talents of Matthau and Lemmon. Both of whom are wonderful, their chemistry set in cement, their timing and reactions to scripting an utter joy. It's not without problems, anyone can see that, especially when the film veers onto the drama path, but the comedy over rides it all to leave a adult friendly holiday movie full of warmth and chuckles. 7/10",Grumpy Old Men
16,writers_reign,Ice Work If You Can Get It,7,17 February 2011,"You'd have to be hard-hearted in the extreme not to respond to this autumnal flowering of two mega talents. You're not so much watching Grumpy Old Men as watching The Fortune Cookie, The Odd Couple, The Front Page and remembering a great screen partnership and a great off-screen friendship. The story is really nothing at all but there's a great warmth radiating from the heart of this film set in a Minnesota winter and revolving around a lifelong love-hate relationship between two widowers who clearly have been through everything - childhood, dating, marriage, child-raising and loss of wives together. It may be unrealistic that love interest Ann Margaret, a good two decades younger than either, would not have a beau or even several beaux in her own age group or even if not would choose either one of these over-the-hill suitors but such is the charm and warmth we don't really care.",Grumpy Old Men
17,view_and_review,Decades Long Battle,7,2 July 2020,"After seeing Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau together for the third time in a movie, I decided to do some quick research to see how many other movies before ""Grumpy Old Men"" they were in together. Per my quick tally they were in:The Fortune Cookie (1966)The Odd Couple (1968)The Front Page (1974)Buddy Buddy (1981)JFK (1991)Which brings us to ""Grumpy Old Men,"" in which they played arch frenemies. What could cause these two septuagenarians to be such bitter yet inseparable enemies? A woman of course. And a woman would again increase their faux disdain for one another. This time the presence of the effervescent and eccentric Ariel Traux (Ann-Margret) would deepen the rift between John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau).They were foes for so long they didn't even realize that they were friends. It wasn't until John suffered a heart attack that Max would even admit that John was his friend.GOM was funny. I particularly enjoyed Burgess Meredith as John Gustafson's 94-year-old father with the dirty mind. He stole every scene he was in. The presence of Daryl Hannah as John's daughter, Melanie, did nothing to enhance the movie. She's a very weak actress IMO who was going to get roles as long as she had a pulse and was young, blond, and pretty.GOM is definitely one of the better movies starring senior citizens. It's up there with ""Cocoon,"" ""Remember,"" and ""R.E.D."" in my book. Does it make my top Christmas movies list? I guess I'd have to make one first.",Grumpy Old Men
18,anaconda-40658,Not a Grumpy Comedy.,9,21 April 2016,"Grumpy Old Men (1993): Dir: Donald Petrie / Cast: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Ossie Davis, Burgess Meredith: Quirky comedy about how age and mentality catches up with oneself. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau plays bickering neighbors whose rivalry goes back several decades. Lemmon is single and has a grown son but he conceals the reality that his house is about to be repossessed after thirty days. Matthau loves to fish and has a grown daughter where a romance is hinted between the two grown children. Central plot regards the arrival of a new neighbor, played with great spunk and energy by Ann- Margret. She arrives rolling about semi-nude in the snow at the bewilderment of our grumpy old men. Eventually she introduces herself to both but thankfully the screenplay avoids turning into a competition for her affections. Other roles are not so broad. Ossie Davis is featured as a shop owner who observes and provides advice when convenient. Burgess Meredith provides a laugh or two as Lemmon's obviously older than life father. Directed by Donald Petrie who previously made Mystic Pizza. It presents a theme of living life despite one's age but it also plays off the need to arrive at forgiveness and coming to the aid of those in need as oppose to cause further damage. In the end these two realize that under those grumpy expressions is a love and respect anxious to surface. Score: 9 ½ / 10",Grumpy Old Men
19,SimonJack,"Wonderful adult comedy of true friendship, old age and more",9,25 January 2016,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made 10 films together from 1961 to 1998. All of them were box office hits, and nine of them starred the two consummate actors in comedies. ""Grumpy Old Men"" is one of the funniest, and with its release on Christmas day of 1993, it makes a good comedy to play over the holidays.This is an adult comedy, mostly because of much of the innuendo that young family members aren't likely to understand. And most adults probably wouldn't want to explain the cause of their laughter, or stop the film to do so. But most adults should find it very funny. It's a good film about true friendship as well, and how it endures even through discord and falling out.Lemmon and Matthau are great as childhood friends long since living as friendly enemies. They're both retired senior citizens and widowers who live next door to one another. They're opposites in their likes and dislikes, manners and behaviors. But they have one thing in common – a passion for fishing. Lemmon is John Gustafson, a retired high school history teacher. Matthau is Max Goldman, a retired TV and appliance repairman. Burgess Meredith was 86 years old when this film was made. He plays John's dad, who is 94 years old. John is trying to get him to watch his health, but he says that at 94 he's not too worried. So, he continues to smoke two packs of unfiltered cigarettes a day, eat bacon for breakfast, lunch and supper, and drink his beer. As I said, it's loaded with humor for adultsAll the cast excel in this film. Ann-Margaret is Ariel Truax, a new object of contention between John and Max. Daryl Hannah is Melanie, John's daughter; and Kevin Pollak is Jacob, Max's son. I have a DVD of this film and bring it out to play each year over the Christmas holidays.",Grumpy Old Men

22,StevePulaski,Misery with company,8,18 November 2013,"Grumpy Old Men focuses on the town of Wabasha, Minnesota, where two bickering elderly residents reside and consistently bicker with one another. They are retired teacher and widower John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and retired repairman and fellow widower Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), whose friendship as children ended when John dated and married Max's crush in high school.Now, such a rivalry reaches critical mass when an attractive eccentric named Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves across the street and steals the eye of both men. Both John and Max are smitten with the woman and try to find ways to earn her friendship and maybe even her hand. However, both men are far past their prime in terms of relationships, but John and Max can put many fighting youngsters to shame with the way they try and get back at one another.Such a film would not be half as memorable or fun if the leads weren't the legendary screen actors Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. The film pulls of its hardest job effortlessly because of them and that job is making both men truly seem like lifelong rivals who have a subtle but present soft-spot for one another. Lemmon and Matthau manage to achieve a shockingly believable relationship in that regard, and their performances mimic the kind that would've been present in early black and white cinema or even the Vaudeville days.Both of their performances require energy that some would assume would be far past their years. But, as usual, Lemmon and Matthau defy the odds and commit to hilarious performances of sweetness, sourness, and true comedic talent. One mustn't forget the talent possessed by Ann-Margret as well, who handles the female character ""stuck in the middle of lunacy"" role to strong effect, especially in the more dramatic scenes. Consider when she gets her lengthy monologue with John about how him and Max need to stop fighting each other. It's a scene of surprising emotional honesty thanks to writer Mark Steven Johnson's refusal to make the monologue too sentimental.Johnson, who would later find some success writing and directing films based on lesser-known superheros, keeps the film heavy on humor and relatively minimal on the inclusion of emotionally manipulative sequences in the film. First and foremost, the film remembers it's a comedy and refuses to compromise its title for frequent and contrived dramatic instances. However, when the drama does roll around, it's handled in a pleasantly modest way (especially towards the end, when the film goes for broke in a sequence that shows humanness to the fullest degree).Grumpy Old Men can easily be criticized for having a plot like a sitcom and rather ordinary direction by Donald Petrie, who refuses to do much with the story visually other than capture the snowy landscape of Wabasha, Minnesota. However, like many comedies with high-profile actors, it may be easy to critique the plot's contrivances, but it's hard to fault the actors for being so committed to a project they inherently fit into well. Lemmon and Matthau captures the soulful energy of bickering neighbors wonderfully and that's worth the price of admission alone.Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, and Kevin Pollak.

23,Smells_Like_Cheese,A very fun and sweet film,7,9 December 2006,"I don't know why, but I recently had Grumpy Old Men stuck in my head, I saw it when I was 8 years old with my grandparents, but I figured that I should watch it again before I would comment on it, since your opinion changes when you grow up. So, I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men and I was excited to see a decent rating on IMDb, and I love Walter Matthau, so this was a film to look forward too. Well, I finished it this morning and I have to say that it had it's good laughs along with a very heart warming story for the holidays.John and Max are two former friends turned enemies and have been feuding for a long time, we don't really know why at the beginning of the film. When they see a new neighbor moving in on the street, a very attractive older woman named Ariel. Now the boys have something new to fight over and are competing for her love. But it almost drives them crazy how much they keep playing tricks on each other and can they realize that it's finally time to grow up and act their ages or will they stay as grumpy old men? This was a very charming and lovely movie that could melt anyone's heart and make them laugh at the same time. I really do miss the comedies like this since a lot of films are more aimed for a younger generation, I may be 21, but I need the grown up comedies just as well as the one's for today, we need a balance, you know?

They are two veteran actors who never lost their touch, and Matthau's death a while back is a real loss.Here, they play - what else - two grumpy old men who also happen to be neighbours (Lemmon as John Gustafson and Matthau as Max Goldman) who have been carrying on a feud all their adult lives which heats up when a beautiful woman (Ann Margaret as Ariel Truax) they're both interested in moves in across the street. You don't really need any more details than that, except to know that this is wonderfully funny stuff.There are a couple of things to note though. Burgess Meredith has a hilarious part (more than a cameo but less than a starring role) as John's sex-obsessed 91 year old father. (Hearing that Ariel has moved in he asks with wide eyes ""Have you mounted her yet?"") And, in all honesty, I have to confess that the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the performances by Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as the children of John and Max respectively. I didn't think either one of them added anything to the movie with their performances, nor did I think their characters were necessary.Still, it's a funny, funny movie. 8/10",Grumpy Old Men
25,theowinthrop,"Our First Visit to Warbisha, Minnesota",8,24 July 2005,"There is a strange graft regarding the Matthau - Lemmon or Lemmon - Matthau ""buddy"" comedies. They start out on high notes with THE FORTUNE COOKIE and THE ODD COUPLE and then make a couple of comedies again with Billy Wilder together (one is Wilder's version of THE FRONT PAGE) which are not well received. They also do a film KOTCH, where Matthau stars in a straight role as a lively octogenarian, and Lemmon directs him (for his only time as a film director). But while they remained close friends Lemmon and Matthau did not seem to consider making any further films together without Billy Wilder. Fans of Crosby and Hope always mourned the failure (before Bing Crosby's death) that plans for a film THE ROAD TO TOMORROW were never completed. Fans of Martin and Lewis always hoped that the supposedly ill feelings between the men would settle and they would do one more film together. This was not the case with Matthau and Lemmon. Both men were such highly capable actors and comedians the public did not need them to resume another joint venture.Then, in the 1990s, they did a large spurt of films together. Two of these, GRUMPY OLD MEN and GRUMPIER OLD MEN, were excellent comedies. Another, THE GRASS HARP, was a straight film in which they shared only one scene together, but was generally well received. Then came OUT TO SEA and THE ODD COUPLE II. The former was a funny film, but lacked the strength of the GRUMPY movies, and the latter was a film with some good moments in it, but it can't stand good comparison with the original THE ODD COUPLE. This is, therefore, the only film comedy partnership which might have faded without any real notice. The revival of it was one that amazed the public in the early 1990s, and helped push the remaining three films into some form of box office success. I think the reason is that, although with Crosby and Hope their individual films in their heyday of the 1930s to 1950s were highly popular, there was a definite different element to their joint ventures: two friends not taking plot, characters, or even Dorothy Lamour too seriously, but just trying to top each others zingers and turn a movie upside. With Lemmon and Matthau, their screen chemistry was quite good, and (judging from the outtakes in GRUMPY OLD MEN) they did not take their films that seriously either, but the stories had to make enough sense for their acting skills to carry scenes where they weren't reacting together.In GRUMPY OLD MEN, look at the scenes with Arial (Ann-Margaret), where there is one on one with John (Lemmon) or Max (Matthau). They are all acting very natural and well together. They behave like regular people interacting. The same with the scenes with Darryl Hannah, or with Kevin Pollak, Ossie Davis, Buck Henry, and Burgess Meredith. There is no false notes among them. In one scene, Ossie Davis (Chuck) has heard what a free spirit Arial is from Lemmon and Matthau. He goes, on Thanksgiving, to visit her - suddenly the two grumps have a rival. They confront him the next day. Davis is not a wooden stick but a very lively actor, and he gives as good as he gets from the two stars. He announces that the experience was like an awakening of youth. Suddenly one feels the presence of Davis' ""Purley Victorious"" just for a moment, but you see it is a natural reaction. Now compare that with Hope and Crosby confronting anyone else in their Road pictures. Or Martin and Lewis in their films (with Laurel & Hardy one hesitates, as Jimmy Finleyson or Charlie Hall or Mae Busch would react naturally). Hope and Crosby / or Martin and Lewis would confront wooden characters who were stooges or villains. Shortly afterward Davis' character dies. Matthau learns of it from Lemmon, and has an argument with Lemmon about not showing proper respect to the dead. Matthau returns to his home, and picks up a cap from Chuck's bait shop. And he starts crying for his dead friend. Nothing like that ever occurs in Hope and Crosby films, or Martin and Lewis films, or the other pure comedy teams.The film is basically about the long standing hurts that mar what is actually a friendship between Lemmon and Matthau going back to their childhoods. The final blow is basically the arrival of Ann-Margaret, and who will she favor as the future second wife of (or in Matthau's case, third wife of). She has an interesting character too, a California free spirit of artistic interests, who teaches literature. Given the stodgy middle age qualities of the two leads (well mirrored in the winter world of snow around the town of Warbisha), she is like fresh breezes of ozone. The other performers are good too, including Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as the children of Lemmon and Matthau who their fathers (for all their mock-feuding) would like to see together, Davis (the first of two films he did with Matthau - the other is I'M NOT RAPPAPORT), Buck Henry as the obnoxious IRS man Snyder, and best of all, the late Burgess Meredith as a sensible, horny 90 year plus father to Lemmon. Meredith was the first of the leads of this film to die, but (fortunately) he lived long enough to help in the sequel, GRUMPIER OLD MEN).",Grumpy Old Men

When coming around to watch it, as it was on t.v. last Saturday, I was surprised just how good I was, and again, a bit guilty, for not seeing it earlier. The casting couldn't of been more perfect from two legendary greats who work so well off each other, and I must admit the story is cute, and there are some rib tickling moments, but I looked at it as a more serious comedy, where it kind of makes old age, something to look forward to. Jack and Walter, childhood friends, as well as rivals are neighbors, their not so amiable dialogue of greeting each other sets off the laughs. Their grumpy traits, are ones you see in real characters, everyday, where I picked up on this. Their years of competing against each other, is worsened by the arrival of a new hottie, Ann Margaret, who does have a soft spot for Jack, where Walter's wide jealousy is something which can only be described as entertaining for the viewer, where he resorts to childish pranks, even before this hot woman came between em'. And how we miss these two greats, in what was here, one of their last score of films. I really liked Kevin Pollock as Matthau's more adult son. Here is a real lighthearted comedy but one with heart, and a moral too, ever so patent. Though I must say, in one way, Ann Margaret, with her ""out there"" love life character, stole the movie. She's a fifty bombshell, who can act too, one of those ultimate scene stealers, in a movie that'll win your heart, especially you oldies. Daryl Hannah again gives a performance that won't win you over, where again, she ruins the film with her presence.",Grumpy Old Men

According to this movie, life is about sex. It's sex that keeps you young, or at least thinking young. The grumpiness is wonderful and funny. It's tit-for-tat as two oldies keep on feuding, sounding as ridiculous as they act. Introduce a woman and things get worse. Two guys fussing and fuming like two little kids, and that's because they're not getting what they crave for - tender loving care from the opposite sex. They roar like bears but they're really teddy bears who need a momma bear to keep them comfy. The movie presents an idealized portrayal of women as being naturally soft and nurturing - and it works! Introducing the sexual factor is not a literary contrivance. It's true. The movie is not making it up. The metaphorical imagery suggested by the two principals is unmistakable. John and Max are lonely men who feel so marginalized and so inadequate that they are projecting their rage onto each other. And they do some nasty things that really hurt. Ariel just adds fuel to the fire as she plays off the two men, making them even agitated. Now the sexual juices are flowing for the first time in years and they can't handle it. They are reliving puberty, but this time it has a tinge of desperation because they are old. If not now, then when? Sex is equated with life; who wins the women is the survivor.

This one started a pattern in the '90s of new comedies starring these two respected actors, such as OUT TO SEA and THE ODD COUPLE II. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the two stars play crotchety neighbors who basically can't stand one another and haven't been able to get along for the many decades in which they've been acquainted. At first I was worried because the first 50 minute half of this movie seemed to offer nothing but showcase the comical pair insulting each other and presenting little else of any substance. But just when it looks like that's the whole story, things luckily came alive and a narrative of sorts takes shape with widow Ann-Margret as a new neighbor who moves next door, giving the two seniors something new to argue over.

This is one of these movies that can't seem to decide what it wants to be - a comedy about two old farts who can't stand each other, or a sentimental story about two estranged childhood chums finally making up with each other. As usual in such cases, it fails at both. There are not enough funny moments to make it a real comedy, and what humor there was was weak and forced, while as a sentimental story it's unconvincing. Particularly grating to me was the personality of the widow (Ann-Margret), who we are supposed to see as ebullient and zany; I found her nosy, shallow, inconsiderate and phony, and couldn't see what the two old guys saw in her. Burgess Meredith provides most of the scant humor in his bit role as Lemmon's 94 year old reprobate father, particularly in the credit outtakes (which, for that matter, are funnier than anything in the movie itself).Has some interest as a documentary on ice-fishing in northern Minnesota, but if it's laughs you want, watch The Odd Couple again.",Grumpy Old Men

My review of this movie, sadly, comes a week after the sudden death of Matthau who was one of our great actors. This movie, as well as its sequel and the other movies he made with great friend Lemmon, will always remind us of this great comedy team that we won't see anymore. ""Grumpy Old Men"" was their best film together. Lemmon plays John Gustafson and Matthau plays Max Goldman, neighbors who have been feuding for over 50 years in the town of Wabasha, Minnesota. Then their hatred for each other starts to intensify when Ann-Margret moves into the neighborhood in the house across the street from them. They both duke it out to see who will win over the charming widow. In the process, they provide lots of laughs throughout. Also adding to the big laughs is the great Burgess Meredith, who's hilarious as Lemmon's sex-obsessed dad, and Ossie Davis has some funny moments as the owner of the bait shop Lemmon and Matthau always stop at. ""Grumpy Old Men"" takes place during the winter time, and boy just by looking at this film, they sure do get alot of snow up there in Minnesota. Lemmon and Matthau had said they got grumpy at times making this movie because of all the snow and the very cold, freezing temperatures.

The thing that got to me in this movie is the way men in their 70s behaved like children, playing tricks on one another and even coming up with some that I have never thought off. This romantic comedy also stared Ann Margret, and her acting was fun to see as I have no recollection of seeing her in any other movie and seeing her here was a nice introduction for me.Grumpy Old Men is directed by Donald Petrie who is the man behind the 1994 movie Ritchie Rich and my worse movie ever in 2003 How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.The movie plot is about two old friends/rivals Max (Walter Matthau) and John (Jack Lemmon), both retired and spend majority of their adult life playing tricks on one another.Things changed in their small town when college professor Ariel Truax (Ann Margret) moved into a house opposite theirs, her happy demeanor and joyful outlook, made her the talk of the town and soon Max and John took a liken into her and their old time feud continued as both tried to get the girl.The movie is fun and funny and was recognized by the American Film Institute, as it got a nomination in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs. The next movie that both were in after this series (i.e. after 1995 Grumpier Old Men) was Out to Sea, which was not well received by critics, but I have seen the movie and I can tell you it is not as bad as critics make it to be, it was funny and delightful.Grumpy Old Men was followed by Grumpier Old Men two years after in 1995, another old female icon Sophia Loren was introduced into the mix of Lemmon and Matthau, whose acting was not as grand as that of Ann Margret if I may say so.

46,roghache,Pervading dirty atmosphere taints tale of feuding old coots,2,18 April 2006,"Mine may be the sole dissenting voice, but I found this a rather pathetic movie. It is basically the story of old geezers (sometimes foul mouthed ones) who argue, insult each other, and talk a lot about sex. It could have been a really cute, hilarious, touching, and sentimental tale but alas, for the most part, it's not. Frankly, I felt as though this film and its sequel were beneath the dignity of its three talented and now, sadly, deceased stars...Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, & Burgess Meredith, especially the amazing Lemmon. The story revolves around two neighbours, John & Gus, who have been feuding since childhood. Their quarrels escalate when an attractive widow, Ariel, moves next door and the pair vie for her affections. I couldn't help asking myself...what woman in her right mind would be attracted to either one of these cranky old idiots? Are there no more likely eligible men in the neighbourhood?The quarrelsome duo are played by those two comedic pros, Jack Lemmon (John) and Walter Matthau (Gus). However, this is not another version of their wonderful old comedy, The Odd Couple. Not much here is all that amusing, clever, or touching, and those instances which are have been ruined (at least for me) by a sort of pervading dirty atmosphere. Ariel is portrayed adequately enough by Ann-Margaret, but it's just not a very compelling role. By far the most obnoxious of all is Burgess Meredith as the dirty talking reprobate, Grandpa Gustafson (John's father). I will kindly refrain from getting nasty here about his role (as I would certainly be inclined to do) as unfortunately this actor has since passed away. Suffice it to say, I find foul mouthed old gaffers neither particularly amusing nor endearing.Yes, there's ice fishing, a few funny pranks, and a touching genuine underlying affection & friendship between this pair of coots, but it's basically a great movie only if you like dirty jokes revolving around old gents. If you do, you'll love the movie...simple as that. Obviously, many would agree as it seems relatively popular and I notice has received a reasonable rating here. They even went on to make a sequel (horrors!) called Grumpier Old Men, which I wisely decided to forgo. Pity I hadn't been smart enough to forgo the original as well. Actually, it was presented as viewing entertainment at someone else's home and I wanted to be polite; otherwise I would certainly have turned it off long before the end.

55,froberts73,from grumpy old reviewer,6,14 January 2011,"I read most of the reviews and, boy, am I in the minority. I found the movie semi-amusing and, for the most part, predictable. You know, two old guys duking it out verbally. There were a couple of hours of insults, back and forth, forth and back. Well delivered, of course, by wonderful vets Matthau, Lemon and Meredith.The major difference between this and similar endeavors is that the script herein was not written by Neil Simon. The individual who penned the lines in this flick would need a 10-foot pole to touch Simon's prose.As a little theater actor of many years, I can say that one of my favorite roles was Oscar in ""The Odd Couple.""

57,Mickey-2,"A conflict that started in childhood, lasted through adult years, and continued to senior years over ???",8,4 July 1999,"""Grumpy Old Men"" featured the pairing of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau for the umteenth time, and the result was a delicious blend of practical jokes, one-line zingers, and even romance for two of Snowy Minnesota's oldest enemies who were childhood friends.Matthau and Lemmon are next door neighbors who share a feud that has been going on longer than any of them can remember.  One day, a new, sexy neighbor played by Ann-Margret moves in the house across from them, and they each seem to take interest in her.  She takes interest in both of them, at first, and then decides on one, leaving the other in a bit of a lurch. However, true friendship from their childhood days finally revives itself, and the movie does end with the two grumps being a bit happier towards each other and life.  A good supporting cast features Burgess Meredith, Ossie Davis, Daryl Hannah, and Kevin Pollak.  Viewers are urged to let the cassette run through the closing credits in order to pick up some raunchy one-liners that were clipped from the film.

I'm from Wiscosnin, where sophisticated people like Spencer Tracy, Pat O'Brien and 'Manny Moore' grew up. I've been to Mayer, outside of Minneapolis, and that's my name. I think I'll buy the town. Now, to the movie: The sons and daughters appear to be more sophisticated than the fathers, so they must be living in Milwaukee.As I look out my front windows, in northeast Wisconsin, in January (yes, I have more than one window) it looks just like Wabesha, but I would bet the film was produced in the Sierra Nevada's, outside of L.A.People who live on the east or west coasts might feel that this film is hokey and typical of the Great Lakes (or, as they call it 'midwestern venue'), but, according to a 'Wall Street 24/7' survey, the 2nd brightest people live in Wiscosnin (2nd to Vermont) and Minnesota is in the top ten. West and east coast people are the citizens who say '...the trip was SO FUN,' used out of grammatical context.Walter and Jack are great impersonating the Great Lakes persona, but I don't think they would have given a 'rat's ass.'

63,compi24,"Review Of ""Grumpy Old Men""",7,14 December 2011,"""Grumpy Old Men"" is a 1993 Donald Petrie film about two feuding old men (Lemmon, Matthau) who step up their game to woo their new neighbor (Ann-Margret). Let me start off by saying that I love both Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon and I have heard of how the two of them are often paired together on film. This is the first film I've seen with the both of them in it and I can tell why they were paired together here. The chemistry between Matthau and Lemmon is really noticeable throughout this film - they really love working with each other. Everyone else's performances were also very well done. The movie was also pretty funny overall, but what surprised me the most was that this film featured some very touching and heartwarming scenes within it. Honestly, I can say that this movie surprised me all together. I thought I was only going to get a 90 minute film of two old men swearing at each other. What I got was that, but with very great acting, subplot development, tonal diversity, and more. ""Grumpy Old Men"" is a film that I watched with a genuine smile on my face.",Grumpy Old Men

They refer to each other as ""Moron"" (Goldman) and ""Putz"" (Gustafson) and play pranks on the other. John puts a fish in Max's back seat causing an awful stench in his friend's car while Max uses his remote to change channels while John is attempting to watch the lottery. The two men embark on a competition to win the affection of an attractive woman, Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret), who moves into the neighborhood and each does his best to win her heart. This movie is very funny, Lemmon and Matthau are one of the movie's best comedic duo and their story is filled with touches that show how both men retain their vitality though they are getting up in age.

68,groatski,A lovely little comedy.,8,5 January 2004,"---Mild Spoiler Alert---Two old widowers who have known each other their entire lives are next-door neighbors in a small town. They spend much of their free time (free time? what else are they doing?) either watching TV, ice fishing, or forever trying to get each other's goat thru an endless series of childish pranks (they address each other as Moron and Putz). This has apparently been going on for many years, much to the chagrin of their adult-aged children.Now enter Ariel, a sexy and alluring artist that buys the house across from them. She's worldly, precocious, entirely sexually uninhibited, and not at all repulsed by the two old coots that watch her with fascination thru their livingroom windows.Suddenly these old geezers feel long-dormant surges of desire, and do their best to woo her in their hopelessly outdated small-town ways (which, much to their amazement, seem to be working), only to come in direct conflict with each other. Their pranks escalate to open warfare, and you learn that this is not the first time they've crossed swords over a woman. Who will win?Another superb performance by cinema's quintessential odd couple. The love-hate relationship between Lemmon and Matthau is just sincere enough to be touching, and just mean-spirited enough to be hilarious. Of special note is Burgess Meredith, Lemmon's chain smoking, dirty minded 94-year-old father who seems to have an unlimited supply of raunchy one-liners. Tragically, all the leading men in this movie have since passed on. A true classic that will stand the test of time.My favorite quote: Lemmon: A woman moved into the old Jefferson house. Meredith: Did you mount her? Lemmon: Dad!!",Grumpy Old Men

Sadly, at this time, all three of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" (Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and Burgess Meredith) have now passed on. But this film will show that some of your best work can come in your golden years.I first saw ""Grumpy Old Men"" against protest.  Though I'd heard of its legacy at being ""SO funny!""-- I rebelled against the idea of seeing two foul old guys yelling at each other.  One night, my parents rented it-- and I happened to be staying at their house that night-- so I popped it in the VCR and watched it.I went to bed in pain that night because my abdomen was sore from laughing so hard.  It took over 3 hours for me to watch the whole movie because I kept rewinding and watching the funniest parts over and over again.
Though the movie stars all VERY-seasoned and excellent actors & actresses-- one tends to forget that... and only sees ""John and Max"" going at it again. It's a fifty-year fight between these two mischievous old bags of hot-air. The movie becomes more exciting as it progresses-- because you get to wonder who's going to strike next and humiliate the other... Gustafson or Goldman?Aside from a wonderful story line and script, there are some very memorable one-liners and quotes from both this and ""Grumpier Old Men"" (the sequel). The soundtrack is sprinkled with wonderful old songs, along with festive polka songs to set the atmosphere for the town of Wabasha, Minnesota-- a small Swedish-settlement in the North.If you've not seen this movie, and you have a great sense of humor-- do yourself the favor of renting ""Grumpy Old Men"".  It's a heart-warming, happy film that leaves you feeling good after seeing it.

Lemmon and Matthau are at their comedic best in this hilarious tug of war concerning two lifelong friends who treat each other as anything but. Yet underneath all the bickering and pranks, the two men have a genuine love for each other.

82,q-76940,Review,10,22 January 2020,"Grumpy old men
Grumpy old men is a comedy that takes place in the early 90s in Wabasha Minnesota. It tells the story of two lifelong friends who live next to each other Max Goldman (Walter Msttues) and John Gustafson. Max and John in the movie play pranks on each other and offton spend their time doing this ice fishing. I've probably watched this movie over one hundred times and it never gets old and I would have to give the movie a positive review.One of the many things they do well in the movie is the characters' dialogue. The two characters are lifelong friends and they act like it when they speak to each other. They always greet each other with an insult or in a rude way which really shows the relationship the two have. And the word choices and phrases they say makes me feel like I'm at my grandparents farm only 10 miles where the lake they filmed part of the film. The movie is almost 30 years old and the phrases and the jokes they play on Each Other are still found on the ice.The one thing I'm not the biggest fan of is the editing. New movies now and days use lots of cuts in action senses. I think that it makes the part of the movie more dramatic. In the little action senses in the movie there were little to none cuts. Some parts are filmed in one angle and the viewer wants the angle to change so we can see a different perspective of the characters and the setting.I think the acting in the film is what makes it a good movie. The main characters are able to act the part of two old Minnesota men. If you haven't seen the movie and don't want to read any spoilers skip this paragraph. One of the best examples of acting in the movie is when John goes to chucks bait shop to see it has been locked. He does from saying chuck you idiot you forgot to unlock the door in a joking happy way to very depressed when he walked up to the front and saw a police officer. When he asked the police officer what's wrong he's informed that his friend had passed away. During this Part they focus on his facial expressions and he goes from happy to confused to sad about the news in a few seconds.The music sound track of the movie is looked over and isn't bad but isn't very good in the movie. I think that they wanted people to focus on the dialogue and acting of the movie and not the soundtrack. I think that this adds to the good acting and being able to focus on it.After watching the movie, I think it is a good movie. But only for some people how enjoy crude humor. And people who can understand their lifestyle in Minnesota. But there is some predictable parts of the movie but overall I would recommend it.",Grumpy Old Men

So many titles today can't offer basic principles in comedy, drama and just plain fun. I don't think this is a spoiler but this film doesn't have any blood, psychological pressure or disturbing family secrets. What it does offer is a dosage of wholesome, well rounded goodness that will have anyone longing for purity watching this for their fix years to come. I probably would not have given such a high mark in the 90's (who knows) but today its a crystal clear breath of fresh air.. I loved this film and the actors all seem to be having a great time on the set.. In short this is a movie that can be picked up and put down with a good feeling afterwords.",Grumpy Old Men

86,xflrocks,"The Actors are Mortal, The Comedy Eternal",10,14 July 2002,"The opening credits in this film roll to the tune of ""Heat Wave"", and it was during a recent heat wave that I dusted off my well-worn copy of ""Grumpy Old Men"" and settled in to once again watch the first of four movies that made up the ""second coming"" of the Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau team.  To those who have not yet seen the movie, (yes, there may be a few) it was set (and filmed) in snowy Minnesota, which give the film an authentic small town feel that the talented set designers of Hollywood would be hard pressed to duplicate.  From the stars' first lines in the film (""'Morning ****head"", ""Hello moron"") we know what to expect, and the movie doesn't disappoint us. The verbal sparring between Max and John continues non-stop through 100+ laugh filled minutes.  Both the plot and the ending are not quite believable, but who really cares? For those who want reality, there are many depressing films out there, not to mention the news- papers and CNN. I have never read if all the cast members were the first choices for the parts, but every one of the cast fits their roles perfectly.  Ann-Margret has evolved from her dancing, grinding ""sexpot"" image in the 60's to a wonderful, natural actress. Burgess Meredith....what can I say?  He's perfect as John's father, a crusty, lovable old man.  The interplay between Jack and Burgess is so easy, and why not?  Who better to play a 94 year old than the 80+ year old Meredith. While Burgess is lovable, Daryl Hannah is lovely. As John's daughter Melanie, I have never seen her look more beautiful and heart-melting as she does in this picture.  Ozzie Davis, Kevin Pollak, and Buck Henry round out the cast, and bring their many talents to the picture. While much has been written about the comedy, very little is said about the realistic side of  ""Grumpy Old Men"".  There are a few fleeting scenes that reveal the heartache and loneliness of growing old.  And John's dealings with the I.R.S. in the movie, while hilarious, points out what can happen when the machine-like IRS process starts to roll over an individual not caring about the human-real life side of the situation. The only ""downer"" for me in again watching this movie is the knowlege that the string is over.  Walter and Jack and Burgess are gone.  I can't watch this movie without feeling just a tinge of sorrow.  When most actors their age pass on, we feel sorrow, and then watch their classics from decades ago.  With Walter and Jack the best was yet to come. I have read elsewhere that scripts were in the works for ""Grumpy Old Men 3""  and ""Odd Couple 3"".  Who knows how many more successful films this brilliant team could have made together.  I doubt if the formula for their success would have grown stale, because both Walter and Jack no longer acted....their roles where just an extension of themselves.Whether it be Grumpy or Grumpier Old Men, ""Odd Couple II"", or ""Out to Sea"" we were as much visiting with old friends as we were watching a movie.  Old friends get more endearing with age, and we would have never tired of new visits from them, no matter what the role. Burgess, Jack, and Walter.....wherever you are...thanks for the laughs you've given us over the years.  You made us feel good, which is the best epitaph anyone could wish for.",Grumpy Old Men
