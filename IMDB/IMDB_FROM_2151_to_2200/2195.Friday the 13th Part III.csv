0,TheLittleSongbird,"Lots of blood, not enough terror",5,7 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. Liked the first two 'Friday the 13th' films, despite not exactly considering them great, had a very mixed view on this. 'Friday the 13th Part III' leaves a lot to be desired but is it a terrible film? No. It does contain a lot of the faults that the first two films did and makes more without having enough of what made them work. The music score is still eerie and there are a couple of clever death scenes and unsettling moments. There are two halfway decent performances, a quite endearing Dana Kimmell who is also the most expressive of the actors and thankfully creepy Richard Brooker.It's also interesting for being the first film to introduce Jason's famous look. 'Friday the 13th Part III' doesn't have too crude visually, actually having some grit and professionalism. However, the rest of the acting is mostly awful and strains to even strain mediocre at best. Their characters are dim-witted stereotypes that the film tries to develop not so successfully at times through scenes that don't go very far. The script is cheesy and simplistic and the 3D effects were pointless and generally cheap-looking, even for the 80s.Story is not much better, with lots of camp and not enough suspense. The deaths generally are not as creative, there is too much padding and the ending is just weird and not in a good way.Overall, far from bad but far from good too. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th Part III
1,Leofwine_draca,So bad it's good 3D slasher fun,6,19 July 2016,"It just goes to show that you can't keep a good man down as Jason returns in the 3rd film in the Friday the 13th series (in as many years!). This is definitely an improvement over the previous instalment, containing as it does a lot more cheesy gore, silly situations, a more menacing bad guy and lots of amusing bad stuff in general. In fact, this is probably the high (or low) point of '80s slasher cheesiness, and fans should immediately seek it out.It's not a good film by any means, but it's a lot of fun to watch. Sure, it's very repetitive and the stalk and slash antics get tiring very quickly (there are still another six - or seven? - parts in the series to go!) but the strict formula works for me. There's no time for pointless characterisation, this film gets down to the murder and (fake-looking) gore very quickly which I like to see. There's no need to worry about the plot or people involved, being as they are a typical clichéd bunch of '80s teenagers (including the pre-requisite hippies, fat joker guy, and sex-hungry couples). Only some REALLY bad acting, especially in the case of some of the female screamers, awful!Things start getting funny when a 'fearsome' biker gang venture into a derelict barn only to fall foul of Jason and his trusty pitchfork. One girl gets it through the neck, another guy gets it through the stomach and another non-entity (left over from the blaxploitation years) is just beaten repeatedly. Soon after this Jason picks up his trademark hockey mask for the first time, which I have to admit does make him look extremely creepy - especially when he indulges in a bit of stalking, after Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN. Then the gore really kicks off when a young girl in blinding red attire gets a flare shot into her eyeball (ouch), somebody gets a knife shoved up through their chest from underneath while lying down (Jason obviously improved of his mother's handling of Kevin Bacon in the first instalment) and a hand is hacked off.Added hilarity comes from the fact that this was originally filmed in 3D, so every opportunity is taken to have things flying out at you from the screen, from the opening titles, to a snake, to a flare, to a broom handle (!), an eyeball, and a yo-yo. It really reminds you of the ball-player in 1953's classic HOUSE OF WAX. In the end, the resourceful heroine manages to stab Jason a few times, break his neck and put an axe in his skull to stop him (all in a day's work)... but is he really dead? I think not.What becomes apparent when watching is just how much the makers of this film loved the first Friday, because they rip it off at every opportunity. From a Crazy Ralph clone muttering warnings, you'll have a definite sense of déjà vu. Even the rushed and silly dream ending, where the sole survivor sleeps in a boat before having terrible hallucinations, is a direct take from the ending of the first film. Except this time there's an unexplained female corpse, presumably Mrs Voorhees with a reattached head, coming up out of the water. Overall, this is a really bad film but conversely one which is extremely enjoyable to watch. Check it out if you're a slasher fan.",Friday the 13th Part III
2,SnoopyStyle,cheese fest for good and bad in 3DDDDDDDD,4,15 October 2013,"This starts with Ginny surviving Jason in the previous movie. College student Chris Higgins and her friends spend a weekend at her old family home at Higgins Haven on Crystal Lake. Jason had just killed the storekeeper and his wife. Next, he turns on the group of young friends. This time, he uses his iconic hockey mask for the first time.This is done in that hokey 80's 3D where they throw things and hold things close to the camera. In this one, they actually used a yo-yo in one of the most cheesiest effects. It is cheesetastic. Something is always out of focus. The bigger problem is the really weak acting from the cast of nobodies. I don't care about any of them and I don't care about their deaths. The dialog is horrible. Cheesy dialog is only good for one liners. It is really difficult to endure the rambling for a full 90 minutes. It doesn't help that the ruffians look like Village People rejects. The whole thing is a joke. Sometimes it's a funny joke but mostly it's boring.",Friday the 13th Part III
3,claudio_carvalho,The Same Formula Repeated for the Third Time,5,28 December 2003,"A group of couples goes to an isolated camp area to spend some days. One by one is killed by Jason. The same formula of the original movie and Part 2 is repeated. The basic difference in this one is the presence of Jason, showed many times with his traditional mask or with his deformed face.  My vote is five.",Friday the 13th Part III
4,kosmasp,Jason arrives,7,5 November 2020,"The real Birth of Jason? Almost like what WWE is doing promoting their stuff, every other Jason claims a first for them. The very first Jason in movie number one (more a side note, but still, right?), the stunt man who wasn't Jason throughout movie number two, but was the real killer and now the first Jason to sport the Hockey mask. What a trademark - wearking a face that imitates a general Hockey mask these days, I did get comments from other people asking about Jason. It makes sense, it is iconic, I thought of it too.But this won't happen right at the start. Actually like the second movie, we get ""treated"" to another what happened before, as in the last minutes of the second Friday 13th movie. It was way too long since I saw this or the other ones for that matter (not counting Freddy vs Jason and the remake/reimagination) ... so I don't remember if they kept going with that in Part 4 or any other of the movies. Which I will be watching in the near future. Let's see what happens there ... in the meanwhile I had ""fun"" with this, even though I did not watch it in 3D ... interesting gimmick. You can see in the scenes where they deliberately did things to give the audience something to ""play"" with.A lot of humor but also life lessons (the boy who cried wolf ... although guess the second time around, he wasn't even able to cry anymore ... not enough at least) ... still it is a slasher and it tries to top the movie before with original killings. That's what a slasher does, right? And again not far removed from the original movie - which is a kind thing to say.",Friday the 13th Part III
5,gavin6942,Nature Trail to...,5,23 April 2007,"Jason Voorhees just keeps on coming, this time tracking down some hippies, their friends and a motorcycle gang. Everyone needs a break from camp counselors, I suppose. Otherwise it's pretty much the same thing here... hack and slash.Part three picks up the day after part two, and Ginny Field (falsely identified as the sole survivor) does not appear other than in footage from the previously film (and sadly, has not returned to the series yet). The rest of the cast is all-new.This film doesn't really offer anything the first two lacked. The gore gets slightly better here, and there is a noteworthy scene involving a harpoon gun. The character of Shelly is somewhat interesting, but not enough to carry the film. Lastly, this film features not one but two men using a toilet. And don't worry, this isn't the last time we see such sights.Director Steve Miner returns, and this time tries a gimmick: filming the movie in 3-D. Most of us will never see the film in 3-D as was intended, but you can still tell from many scenes where the good parts are: a yo-yo, a snake, and many other objects that come at your face.Not much else goes on here. The music slightly improves, especially during the opening credits. But more kids getting killed and another long flashback in the beginning recounting what happened in part two (with a little retconning done). So, really no reason to see this one. It bridges the gap between parts two and four, but only slightly. Personally, in my opinion, the series doesn't really pick up until part four.",Friday the 13th Part III
6,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th Part III,3,21 November 2009,"From director Steve Miner (Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Lake Placid), this second sequel gave the iconic killer his two most famous traits, and if you're lucky you can see it in 3D. The previous film saw supposedly drowned but living killer Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) looking dead, but he did survive and still wants revenge for the death of his mother Pamela (Betsy Palmer). A new bunch of dumb teenagers are renting the house Higgins Haven belonging to the family of Chris (Dana Kimmell) near the area of Camp Crystal Lake to party and camp out. Soon enough Jason shows up in new clothes (including a green jacket), and after killing the guy carrying the hockey mask, he dons this, and goes on to kill some of the others. In the end, after seeing him hang, Jason eventually looks dead on the floor with an axe in his head, and survivor Chris is taken away for being mental, but Jason will return. Also starring Paul Kratka as Rick, Tracie Savage as Debbie, Jeffrey Rogers as Andy, Catherine Parks as Vera, Larry Zerner as Shelly, David Katims as Chuck and Rachel Howard as Chili. There were some alright moments in 3D with objects and body parts coming at you, Jason gaining his iconic hockey mask and the gruesome deaths are worthwhile enough, but it was a slightly disappointing film, all in all a not very good horror. Adequate!",Friday the 13th Part III
7,Tweekums,Jason gets his hockey mask,7,19 December 2018,"Set shortly after the events of Part Two, Jason in still in the area and another group of young people are about to get slaughtered. This time rather than camp councillors it is just a group of friends staying in a farmhouse in the foods not far from Crystal Lake. Once there they begin to settle in and two of them quickly cross paths with a small group of bikers who follow them back to the farm... and 'meet' Jason in the barn. It isn't long before he begins picking off the unexpecting young people.This instalment to the series doesn't start to well... the opening scene is just the closing scene of the previous film; if you've recently seen part two the first chapter of the DVD can be skipped. Once the story gets underway it is solid enough; a couple of shopkeepers are murdered before the main cast are introduced. It quickly becomes apparent that one of them has a slightly warped sense of humour and another had encountered Jason before. Once there we get a few false scares and some laughs. Once the murders start the killings are fairly inventive, without Jason resorting to using things that wouldn't be found on a farm. The fact that this was originally in 3D is pretty obvious with lots of objects pointing out of the screen for no plot-demanded reason; it might have looked okay in the cinema but watching now on DVD it is just a distraction. Overall I'd say this was a solid addition to the series; fans should really enjoy it, especially when Jason gets his famous hockey mask.",Friday the 13th Part III
8,BA_Harrison,Mass murder in 3D!,7,11 December 2008,"When 3-D enjoyed a brief revival in the early 80s, it wasn't at all surprising to see the third chapter in the Friday the 13th series hopping on the bandwagon to 'add a new dimension in terror' (as the film's poster proudly boasted). With Part 2's competent director Steve Miner returning to offer more effective frights and gore, whilst taking every opportunity to thrust assorted objects, weapons, and body parts right into the audience's lap, the result was a fun entry that starts off as a semi-comic piece of silliness packed with stereotypical characters and genre clichés, but ultimately ends up in full-on scary horror mode.After a brief recap of events from the second film, Part 3 starts proper as a group of teenage friends set off for a break at a cabin located near Crystal Lake, the scene of not one, but two horrific massacres! This fact doesn't seem to bother the kids, who proceed to make out, play pranks, smoke dope, and generally behave in a manner guaranteed to make them ideal victim material for legendary deformed killer Jason Vorhees (Richard Brooker).As in the previous two films, the number of teens is gradually whittled down until only one girl remains to fight back: Chris (Dana Kimmell), the pretty survivor of an attack by Jason several years earlier.Although this entry in the series is less serious in tone than the previous films, offering very cheesy dialogue, dumb plot development, and some silly death scenes, it is still a very enjoyable film: there's plenty of killings, a fair bit of gore (although some of the deaths were trimmed in order to avoid an 'X' rating), a shower scene featuring a hot 80s chick, and several effective jump scares. Oh, and let's not forget that this film is also the one where Jason first dons his hockey mask!Even when watched without the benefit of the added third dimension, the film is a total hoot, with the moments designed to make the most of the 3-D technology often resulting in hilarity rather than horror: gratuitous 'in your face' shots include a yo-yo going up and down, a snake lunging at the camera, falling books, popcorn popping up in the air, a harpoon flying towards a victim, a pitchfork handle poking at the viewer, and best of all, an eyeball shooting from a crushed head.",Friday the 13th Part III
9,Quinoa1984,Not too bad,5,8 October 2000,"I find this film to be my second fav besides part 8, and 1 maybe.  Here, Jason returns, no ptato sack, but still undead, and hunting down teens who oppose him (but not directly).  First film to gain a hockey mask, courtesy of a stupid teen, and that applies gross things (I nearly spewed when Jason crushed the eyeball out of the guys socket, uggh).  Entertaining to the masses, unless you have a hatred for these slasher films. B+",Friday the 13th Part III
10,BandSAboutMovies,"Well, at least it's in 3D",5,13 April 2018,"With Amy Steel uninterested in returning to the series, the filmmakers had to reboot and figure out what made Jason tick. And that ticking was a hockey mask - three movies into the series. The original plan was that Ginny would be confined to a psychiatric hospital and he would track her down, then murder the staff and other patients at the hospital. If this sounds kind of like Halloween 2 to you, well surprise. This is not a movie series known for its originality.He starts the film killing a store owner and his wife just for clothes. Then, he goes after the friends of Chris Higgins: Debbie (Tracie Savage, who played the younger Lizzie in the awesome made-for-TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden), Andy, Shelley, Vera (Catherine Parks, Weekend at Bernie's), Rick, Chuck and Chili. They run afoul of bikers Ali, Fox and Loco, who follow them back to their vacation home.Jason starts killing quick, but he's already mentally scarred Chris, as she survived an attack from him two years ago. This has left her with serious trauma and an inability to enjoy intimacy (which, come to think of it, comes in handy in these movies).Jason takes the mask from the dead body of prankster Shelley and it's on, with speargun bolts to the eye, heads chopped in half with machetes, knives through chests, electrocutions, hot pokers impaling stoners and even someone's skull getting crushed by Jason's supernaturally powerful hands.Of course, it ends up with Final Girl Chris against Jason, who she kills by hitting him in the head with an ax before falling asleep on a canoe and having a nightmare of Jason killing her. It's OK. Don't worry. We see that all is right in the world and the killer's body is at the bottom of the lake.Here's some trivia: To prevent the film's plot being leaked (I could tell you the plot in less than a sentence, so this seems like bs), the production used the David Bowie song ""Crystal Japan"" as the title of the movie. They'd use Bowie songs as working titles during several of the other films.There is a ton of footage that was cut from the film so that it didn't get an X rating. And there's an alternate ending where Chris dreams that Jason decapitates her. None of these things make this a better movie.",Friday the 13th Part III
11,Coventry,Jason develops his personality...,5,5 December 2003,"****SMALL SPOILERS, maybe ****Woooooooooooow, this movie has the most highly original and intelligent plot that I've ever seen !!! It's about a group of young, horny teenagers who go spend a vacation near Crystal Lake and they all get slaughtered one by one by a horrifying murderer !! Isn't that the most inspired horror idea you've ever heard ? Pardon my sarcasm...I shouldn't be too harsh when reviewing a Friday the 13th sequel. Obviously because this entire series never intended to win any important awards. Friday the 13th is a money-making franchise and, as long as the story contains a few nasty and inventive killings, the audience is happy. So why should I be any different. I enjoyed ALL Fridays up till a certain level and I even think this third installment is a huge improvement over the second one. I might even say it slightly surpasses the original.
Part 3 was directed by the same person who brought us episode 2. Steve Miner obviously learnt a few techniques in the time between his two efforts. I watched Friday the 13th part 2 only a couple of weeks ago and I already don't remember anything about it. I just know it was slow and boring with no killings worth remembering. And that's in fact the only thing that counts when making a slasher !! Memorable killings ! In that point of view, Friday the 13th part 3 is far more superior. Jason becomes a bit more creative when he's wasting the lives of his young victims and ... even more importantly... he develops his personality and own style that he'll continue to use for the rest of ""career"". In this movie, he becomes the slow moving brute with the typical hockey-mask. Let's just say he got that mask as a gift from one of his preys. Furthermore, there's not much more to tell. Except for a few weird details. ""Crazy Ralph"" from the first two movies is being replaced by an even bigger weirdo, although his appearance is rather short. It also seems like Jason once left a survivor behind ( this sequence is explained through a flashback )...that was hard  to believe for me. And - last but not least - : even though this movie was shot in the early 80's, one of the leading characters is an authentic hippie !! Friday the 13th part 3 ranks pretty high when all the separate episodes are compared with each other, in my opinion. Plus, I think it's a pretty important movie for the series. Along with episode 6 ( which remains my personal favorite ) this movie was responsible for making Jason Vorhees the immense horror icon that he is. A must for the fans.",Friday the 13th Part III
12,michaelRokeefe,They'll never know what happened,5,25 November 2019,This franchise continues at what sacrifice? Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) needs time to recover from his wounds and where but the woods near Crystal Lake. A carefree summer will become a cat-and-mouse experience for a group of naive teens that have partying on their minds. They get Jason's full wrath and he doesn't want to play; he wants to kill. The legacy of Crystal Lake soon becomes obvious as the body count rises. Feel free to get scared and have some fun.,Friday the 13th Part III
13,Theo Robertson,"Sequels , Sequels , Sequels , That`s All You Guys Think About",4,15 June 2003,"Why on earth did film makers in the early 80s decide to make films in 3D ? It`s a worthless gimmick that died out in the 1950s when cinema audiences realised they looked completely stupid wearing the sort of specs Larry Fishburne later wore in DEATH WISH 2 . On top of that 3D films are always badly directed in an unnatural manner with objects poking through the screen. FRIDAY THE I3TH 3D gimmick isn`t as intrusive as JAWS 3 but that doesn`t stop it from being a poor movie . Strangely its failures aren`t down to the 3D but down to its script which involves nothing we haven`t seen before . A bunch of teenagers get stalked by an axe wielding madman , gee now where did I see that plot ? To be fair to the screenwriter he does change the formula slightly by adding a couple of hash heads and a trio of multi ethnic bikers to the list of potential victims but this is the third film in a franchise that didn`t need any sequels .Note to directors : If you`re going to direct a movie in 3D with a woman in a shower can you ensure she`s filmed from the waist up facing the camera otherwise it`s a waste of time filming in 3D",Friday the 13th Part III
14,Hey_Sweden,Creates the definitive look for a slasher icon.,8,13 April 2012,"The makers of ""Friday the 13th Part III"" sure had the right idea when it came down to creating a gimmick for this third entry in the series. What better feature to use than 3-D, which experienced something of a resurgence in the early 1980s? This leads to some pretty ingenious and memorable gags, and it doesn't matter if we can clearly see the strings manipulating the objects coming towards the camera, it's really all part of the fun, in this sequel which is more about the 3-D effects and excellent use of widescreen than graphic violence.The formula was really becoming like a well worn pair of shoes by this point, in a script (co-written by Martin Kitrosser, script supervisor on the first two movies) with a standard set-up of unknowing young folk hoping to have a good time in a remote cabin but instead falling prey to the maniacal Jason Voorhees.One will note just how unknowing these horny fools are: they truly have no idea who this killer is; the name Jason is never even uttered here. He uses a variety of implements and methods - spear, head crushing, electrocution, the standard slashings and stabbings with his trusty machete, and as played by Richard Brooker, is a very stealthy and creepy character here, possessing that relentless Terminator like quality that we know and love so well. Harry Manfredini's score is highly enjoyable as always, and even gets a funky disco style reinvention during the opening and ending credits. In terms of the acting, it may very well be (mostly) amateur night at the movies, but that doesn't mean the characters and performances aren't at least entertaining. Standing out are trouble making bikers Ali (Nick Savage), Fox (Gloria Charles), and Loco (Kevin O'Brien) - definitely a priceless trio, Tommy Chong lookalike stoner Chuck (David Katims), and lovable, pathetic Shelly (the engaging Larry Zerner), the man who will go down in history as having provided Jason with the hockey mask that was to become part of the iconography of the horror genre. The lovely Dana Kimmell is an appealing ""final girl"".Steve Miner, the man with the distinction of having helmed two F13 series sequels, Part 2 and this one, does a capable job; the movies' pacing is just fine, and its great moments are always timed well, with a healthy nod to the first film in terms of shots near the end, a healthy amount of humour, and a cracking finale with some wonderful chasing going on.The sentimental favourite in the franchise for this viewer (it was the first entry I saw), it remains great fun upon repeat viewings.Eight out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part III
15,preppy-3,The series trudges on...,3,23 July 2006,"Chris (Dana Kimmell) and a bunch of her idiotic friends decide to have a peaceful weekend on a beautiful lodge on Camp Crystal Lake. Naturally Jason (for no reason) starts to attack them.OK--I LOVE horror films but I don't like films that treat the audience like a bunch of idiots and are lacking in logic. This film does both. The characters are all stereotypes--the ""funny"" guy, the slutty couple, the stoned ones, the good girl (always the one who survives). The dialogue is truly horrible and you want all these idiots dead QUICKLY! It starts off with a DISCO version of the theme song!!!! You think it can't get worse but it does. A white trash couple is introduced, killed...and never referred to again (?????). Kimmell is given a back story (she was attacked by Jason years earlier) but it goes nowhere. When people are killed in this film no one hears a thing...although they're all staying the same house. The gore is fun and the deaths are inventive but that's only a small part of the film. It all leads up to an ending that makes NO sense and is a direct steal from Part 1.There are some good things here--Paul Kratka is very good as Rick and I like Vera (Catherine Parks) too. Kimmell is beautiful but pretty terrible as an actress until the end when Jason goes after her. There is one GREAT effect when a man's head is crushed and his eyeball pops out (looks great in 3-D). There is a nice touch of showing somebody reading Fangoria magazine. Also this is the first movie where Jason wears his now trademark goalie mask. That's about it.I originally saw it in 3-D in 1982. It was fantastic! They kept throwing 3-D effects at you so often you didn't have time to realize how pointless the story is and how stupid the characters are. In 3-D this is lots of fun--in 2-D it's a boring mess. I give it a 3.For anyone who cares the body count has been upped in this movie--there are 11 killings --- 6 guys, 5 girls. I really wonder why people keep calling these films misogynistic when more guys are killed than women. And it's ALWAYS a woman who lives in the end.",Friday the 13th Part III
16,poolandrews,Standard Friday the 13th sequel...,7,20 December 2006,"Friday the 13th Part III starts the day after the events of Friday the 13th part 2 (1981) as seven friends drive to a farm called Higgins Haven situated not far from Crystal Lake. Once there Chrissy (Dana Kimmell) becomes reacquainted with her boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) who is also staying with them. However there is someone else there, someone uninvited who wants to gatecrash the party, it's the homicidal maniac Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) who intends to carry on his killing spree...Directed by Steve Miner Friday the 13th Part III is pretty much the same as any other Friday the 13th film which in itself isn't a particularly bad thing as I rather like the series. Any 80's slasher fan worth their salt will know what to expect from the script by Martin Kitrosser & Carol Watson, a group of teenagers gathered in an isolated location being killed off one-by-one until only one survives & in that respect Friday the 13th Part III doesn't disappoint. So why do I like this? Well I like Jason as a film character, he's probably my favourite horror killer, the character's are slightly better than usual with OK back-stories, it moves along at a nice pace, there's a decent body-count & the murders are pretty cool although it's a shame they had to suffer at the hands, or should that be scissors, of the censors... There isn't really much else to say other than if your looking for a slasher film that ticks all the right boxes as far as the slasher sub genre goes then you could do a lot worse than Friday the 13th Part III that's for sure. This is also the first time that Jason wears the now infamous hockey mask although he takes until about halfway through he film to do so.Director Miner does OK although the big point of interest as far as Friday the 13th part III goes is that it was originally shot in 3D & it is to date the only Friday the 13th film to be shot in the full 2.35:1 aspect widescreen ratio, so make sure you pick up that DVD version of it! Obviously the 3D effect is lost when viewed today although I thought it was quite fun to spot all the scenes where the 3D gimmick would have been used, from washing line posts shoved into the audiences face to juggling fruit, from a yo-yo to a chained fist shooting out of the screen & then there's the kills which use it as well like when Jason shoots a harpoon into someones eye, when he sticks a pitchfork trough someones throat & a strange bit when he crushes someones head & their eyeball pops out! While the kills have obviously been trimmed there's still some decent gore, someone is cut in half with a machete, someone is impaled on a hot poker, there's a slashed throat, someone has a meat clever stuck in their chest, there's knitting needles in the back of peoples heads, there's a knife stuck through a girls back which ends up coming out of her breast & someone has their hand cut off.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Friday the 13th Part III is well made & is certainly a lot better than most of the straight-to-video horror film crap that's been released lately. A special mention goes to the absolutely awful opening & closing credits theme music which is hideously bad! Thankfully the music used during the film itself is more fitting. The acting was alright, the girls are suitably good looking & that's what counts in films like this.Friday the 13th Part III is admittedly just another slasher in a limited & overcrowded sub genre but the Friday the 13th series is my favourite horror film franchise & I actually like all of them, anyway it's not for everyone but Friday the 13th fans like myself will lap it up. If your a slasher/horror fan the this is a must, anyone else would probably find little here to impress.",Friday the 13th Part III
17,Bunuel1976,"Friday THE 13TH PART III (Steve Miner, 1982) *1/2",2,22 October 2006,"This one's only marginally superior to PART 2 - and that's mainly due to its extensive use of the 3-D effect; other than that, the situation is as before: numerous obnoxious teenagers (including a couple of dope-smokers and an obese prankster) go to camp and are stalked - for no reason - by Jason (a motorcycle gang whom the campers fall foul of also end up among the victims). At least, we get a couple of inventive deaths (accentuated by 3-D): the harpoon through the eye and the squashed head - the latter leading to a hilarious moment as an eye spurts out at the camera! The first fifteen minutes of the film are actually wasted on yet another reprise of the climax from the previous entry - followed by an endless and irrelevant murder set-piece! This film also answered a question I had put up in my review of its predecessor, in connection with Jason's mask. Despite my obvious Iack of enthusiasm for this type of film, I went ahead and rented the next two installments in the Friday saga - and should be gradually rounding off the whole series by Halloween.

18,utgard14,"""We don't accept no food stamps.""",6,10 April 2014,"Jason's back and this time he's got his trademark hockey mask that he would wear for the rest of the series. A pretty routine Friday sequel outside of that. Still entertaining though. This one doesn't have Jason killing camp counselors but he does find some other twenty-somethings to kill. He also wastes a multiethnic biker trio. Dana Kimmell is a pretty but bland 'final girl.' Tracie Savage brings the sexy this time. There's an annoying fat guy named Shelly, played by Larry Zerner, who I hated. I was counting the minutes until he was dead. The music score for this one has some nice funky '80s beats. It was filmed in 3D so there's lots of scenes where things are shoved in your face. Like when a crazy old man awkwardly thrusts an eyeball at the camera. Yes, I said an eyeball. The worst is when a guy plays with a yo-yo and we get a rather irritating point-of-view for that one. I'm sure audiences in 1982 were thrilled. My favorite scene is when two characters go to a gas station and are told by the rude cashier ""we don't accept no food stamps."" Classic.",Friday the 13th Part III

Some have said it was as good as the first, or even that it was the best version, but I really thought it was lame.You knew the first two were going to get it, just as you knew the motorcycle gang was stupid for going into the barn because we saw him at the door earlier.I think part of it was the characters. I never could care enough about them even to wish them evil.I have to admit that the spear-gun, poker, and hammock kills were really good. Probably the best of the lot. How come the good kills were reserved for the women? Well, the popping eyeball wasn't a woman.The only thing that saved the movie and caused me to give it a watch recommendation was the ending when only Chris (Dana Kimmell) was left.",Friday the 13th Part III
20,Boba_Fett1138,More of the same again but the characters are fun.,6,29 October 2009,"Basically when you put this movie against the first and the second movie, this movie is really more of the same and it doesn't offer much new or surprising story-wise. The movie again gets set at an abandoned camp in which a couple of youngster are being killed one by one by Jason, who for the first time puts on his hockey mask.What makes the movie still good and enjoyable to watch at all times are its characters. The characters make the movie somewhat light and bearable and the movie obviously doesn't take itself as seriously as the previous two installments did.As you can expect from a movie of its kind, the movie is being filled with some graphic deaths, that are nice to watch for the fans of horror and gore but of course aren't all very surprising anymore.What I didn't really liked about this movie was the portrayal of Jason. It shows that you can not just put any actor under the mask to make his character threatening and scary. Also his look differs so much from the first two movies that it becomes quite distracting. They probably did this to avoid confusion with the Halloween movies, in which the killer has a sort of similar look and hockey mask. Jason in this movie never works out as a scary or threatening character, perhaps also because he gets featured, full frontal, in too many sequences. In the first movie there still was mystery and suspense because you never actually got to see the killer until the end. The second movie already abandoned this but it still knew to create and threatening, dangerous, murderer, that above all also had a good look, even though he was wearing a ridicules sack over his head.It's more of the same, only in 3D this time. A watchable sequel but also one you can easily do without ever seeing.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th Part III
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Best of the first three?,6,18 January 2011,"A new batch of counselors... oh, wait, no... well, someone should tell the people who wrote the text on the back of the cover of this. It's just a random group of young people(the girls chosen for their ability to scream) who go to the woods where Jason(who is now wearing the hockey mask, and who we see more of in this(though he is still built up, we return to the stalking kind of approach here... we do also get daft call-backs to the original), especially near the end, and yet he remains frightening... great performance by the stunt guy) hangs out, and, well, he's territorial, I guess(he also isn't standing on tradition... this takes place on Saturday the 14th and Sunday the 15th, directly after the second ended). The characters still aren't developed(except for the obnoxious Shelly, who pulls pranks to not be ignored and is somewhat sympathetic), if there are a few that you might remember, such as the deliciously stereotypical, look-at-what-they're-wearing, was-that-ever-fashion 80's gang. It's clear from early on who the lead is, and it works out fine... we somewhat get to know her. There are a couple of creative, memorable deaths, the atmosphere leading up to them(in spite of excessive fake-outs) means we get a chance to be scared out of our minds from it(and it isn't gratuitous the way it is today... well, at least not as much), and it tends to work. This has a good opening and excellent ending, but the middle portion is also effective enough. It's the most fun of these three, that's for sure, the one I could most see myself re-watching. We again get the climax of the film prior to this one, at the beginning of this(and they're really not even cutting it anew, they're just showing it again). This does really deliver and go by pretty smoothly. When this was released, it came out in 3D... I can't comment on how well-done it was, if I can say that they certainly make a lot of effort to shove things into our faces every chance they get(a few are nifty). The humor remains poor. This doesn't have a lot of sexuality and only obscured nudity. There is a moderate amount of bloody violence and gore in this. The DVD comes with a decent theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any and all fans of slasher flicks. 6/10",Friday the 13th Part III
22,view_and_review,Diminishing Returns,4,8 July 2019,"Just like part two began with the conclusion to part one so as to get everyone up to speed, part three began with the conclusion of part two. Jason was hacked with a machete that went so deep it's a wonder his arm wasn't hanging off. No bother, it's just a flesh wound for Jason.Part three was definitely worse. The acting was worse and even some of the kills were worse. Well, one kill was anyway. He squeezed the dude's head until his eyes popped out. Come on, really? I know Jason is strong but that's ridiculous.But seriously, by now why is anyone even going anywhere near Crystal Lake? I wouldn't even go near Hope, New Jersey. It's clear that Jason is very territorial and he guards his territory violently--especially if you are young.So, as I said, this part was worse than the first two. First, they introduced three guaranteed kills: Fox, Loco, and Ali. They were part of a motorcycle gang and they were thugs. Thuggery equals death nine times out of ten and they were no exception. I thought it just cheapened the whole thing. There was no reason to introduce them into the Friday the 13th movies, they didn't fit at all. Their deaths were assured the moment they were on screen.Second, the acting, as I mentioned, was poor. Not that the acting was good in parts one and two but they went to the C list for these actors.Third, there was the absurd kill. Not only did he squeeze his head until he killed him, he also threw this grown man clear through a window like he was rag doll.And fourth, how many times are the cops going to miss this guy? OK, it was his mom the first time. But the second time it was him and he got away. This time it was him and they literally left the crime scene with his body lying there. There was no forensics team, no investigators, no coroners, nothing. Dead bodies everywhere and they swooped up the surviving girl like they were taking her from an abusive home. ""No need to investigate further we'll just get you a restraining order.""The only redemption of this movie was that Jason got his famed hockey mask. I think the hockey mask may be the source of his power--then again, he was unkillable before it too. The hockey mask certainly didn't help him get the last girl. That last girl is always the trickiest and the hardest to kill. I think Jason should just let the last girl get away and avoid the pain that comes with trying to kill her.",Friday the 13th Part III

Quite a lot of wandering around behind people, being menacing while they can;t see you, goes on.Some of the 3D is very attractive.Unfortunately, the movie is marred by a tendency for contriving situations where objects can be thrust at the camera.

24,evanston_dad,Adding 3-D Doesn't Help,1,14 March 2006,"If possible, the third installment in the hit hack-up derby is even worse than the first film, which is really saying something. The entire ""Friday the 13th"" series is like a ten-car pile-up for me: I know I should avert my eyes, but something compels me to stare. These movies are an insult to my intelligence, yet I keep coming back for more, mostly because I remember these from being a kid and so they have a nostalgic tug to them.At least this one is the most 80s of the series...it's like a slasher version of ""Roller Boogie."" We get punk motorcycle gang members with puffy hair and chains...one of them looks suspiciously like Debbie Allen. We also get a groovy disco space-agey them playing over the opening credits, announcing that the series has officially accepted its place as pure camp. Jason dons his trademark hockey mask for the first time, and proceeds to do quickly away with another batch of teens, who for their pure lack of anything intelligent to do or say deserve to die, if for no other reason.The 3-D effects are a riot in this--especially when you watch the film in 2-D and can realize just how far out of their way the film makers went to work 3-D into the film. Some of the effects were inventive: Jason shoots an arrow into a girl's eye, and the arrow comes right at the screen; he squeezes a guy's head until his eye comes squiggling out toward the camera. But I have to assume that some of the other 3-D effects, like an overhead shot of exploding popcorn (Oh my God, it's coming right at us!) were less than terrifying to experience.Jason outdoes himself with the body count this time around--whole scenes exist for the purpose of introducing someone he can poke, prod or skewer. Is he working on commission? Grade: F-",Friday the 13th Part III
25,Uriah43,A Familiar Plot Shown in 3D,5,4 December 2015,"This movie essentially begins with a group of young men and women who decide to ignore the warnings and spend some time in the woods at Camp Crystal Lake. Also involved are three motorcycle punks who are upset with them after a confrontation at a local convenience store and want to get even in the worst possible way. What none of them realize is that Jason is still alive and well-and waiting for them. Now, if this plot seems slightly familiar then it's because it is the third time it has been used and like Jason the producers simply brush it off and begin again. However, what makes this movie somewhat unique is that it was filmed in 3-D in order to enhance the effect at local theaters. Unfortunately, what the movie producers may not have counted on was that this movie was released during the height of the VCR craze and as a result audiences were just as likely to see this movie on a television screen than anywhere else. As a result, some of the special effects geared for 3-D may have fallen a little flat. Another interesting fact about this movie is that it is the first time that Jason dons his iconic hockey mask as previously he used a burlap bag over his head similar to the psychopath in ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"". In any case, even though the plot followed the standard path of the Friday the 13th films preceding it, it still managed-along with the ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series-to attract huge audiences and rake in millions of dollars during the decade of the 80's. That being the case, who can argue with success? Yet despite everything just mentioned there really isn't that much here, in my mind, that separates this movie from countless other slasher films of this type. And it hasn't aged well. Accordingly, I rate it as about average.",Friday the 13th Part III
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Flawed but still enjoyable sequel,8,27 September 2012,"Hoping a trip to her old campground will ease her troubled life, a group of friends arrive at Crystal Lake for a weekend of fun only to find the homicidal Jason still lurking around and must try to get away before they're all killed.This one managed to be one of the more enjoyable sequels in the series, though there are still some flaws to it. One of the better aspects here is the exceptionally high body count which generates plenty of gory, blood-soaked goodness during it's time with a rather wide assortment of weaponry, delivering with the bloody goods impaling people on staffs, knifes, and many other sharp objects as to be expected during a film as this. There's even an all-time favorite in the infamous handstand kill, which is part of the charm with unique and fantastic kills, as all the killings are great to a degree and is pretty chilling. As well, the film manages to get plenty of fun in its traditional slasher moments as there's a ton of incredibly suspenseful moments in this, from the barnyard massacre of the biker group as the group continually reaches another level to find one of their members killed unexpectedly, to the different stalking tactics against the friends in the house. Those are incredibly fun, with the lakeside ambush, the attack on the post-coital couple upstairs hallway and then taking out the remaining group as the last couple arrives and then parts of the final chase throughout here, which is a highlight effort of grand style here. it's lengthy, gets in numerous close encounters and provides the kind of high-quality stalking, chasing, close-encounters and battling that runs through the house, out into the woods and back into the barn for one of the best parts here, though in the end this segment also highlights part of the film's problems. The fact that, what should be the biggest sequence is instead merely presented as a tired retread of the other two in the manner of knocking him down then failing to press the advantage in order to hide and do it all over again, which makes this one of the lesser examples of the style. Also problematic is the 3D effects here are just plain ludicrous, with the examples coming across as just stupid as the tactic itself geared toward finding the stupidest possible examples to accomplish the feat as possible, getting yo-yos, popping popcorn, flung wallets, juggled fruit and more flung towards the camera that has no bearing on the plot and they all stick out quite obviously. The last problem here is the film's pacing, which is off and quite drags at places as the beginning is endlessly overlong with the massacred couple who are completely unworthy of being focused upon for way too long, the meeting-the-friends is too short and is over too quickly, while the middle section is bogged down with the irritating ploy of her trying to get her past out only to constantly force herself not to then try again and repeat the process. Once we finally get the flashback, which was an important part of the movie, was handled very weirdly as instead of the usual flashback where the character narrates over the action that is happening on screen, we see a silhouette of her face over the action, completely blurring the scene which reveals itself to make no sense in the grand scheme of things, leaving it utterly tiring quite quickly.

Set right after Part II ended, this sequel shows that Jason is unsurprisingly still alive, and determined to kill even more teenagers who hadn't yet heard the news about the recent murders, which is deeply unfortunate for them, as they become the latest victims in the ongoing massacres.Little to differentiate this from Part II(Steve Miner returned to direct) except the 3-D F/X, which will mean little if watched on TV, unless you have the deluxe DVD edition which includes the glasses.

The rest of the film is basically a rehash of the first one but with the added effect of 3-D.I had more fun with this in 2-D, because its hilarious to see characters and object blatantly point at the screen for no good reason.Other than that, we have the same rag tag group of friends who want to party and then some, and Jason stalking the camp to kill them in increasingly silly ways.It's not a bad film by any means, it's one of the better movies of the franchise, just nothing spectacular.",Friday the 13th Part III

This is the movie where Jason first puts on the hockey mask he is known.  Shot as a 3-D movie some parts get a bit annoying as people shove things toward the camera for no reason, but you get used to it.  I would have loved to have seen this one in the theater.  Is it a bit lame you ask? Sure is, but this one is fun to watch as long as you don't take it to seriously.  Some pretty good kills in this one as well.  Is it a masterpiece...most definitely not!

30,Wuchakk,"Entertaining, but adds a campy vibe to the series",5,31 July 2014,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer—who increasingly becomes an infernal monster—just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduces a campy element with ""Part III"", which pretty much plagues the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Still, this is the main detriment of ""Part III"", released in 1982. The opening credits song tips the viewer off that this isn't a wholly serious horror film (like the first two), which is compounded when a couple of the protagonists meet some sinister bikers at a convenience store in the boonies, which takes place about 25 minutes into the story. These hoodlums are too cartoony to take serious and so it's hard to take the horror of the story serious as well. This doesn't mean it's not an entertaining installment, just that it's my least favorite.Another noticeable difference between ""Part III"" and the two previous films is that, although the story takes place in the area of Crystal Lake, the film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Melody Ranch (where the barn is located). The geography is obviously dryer, but this won't make much of an impact on most viewers and, besides, it is a nice change of pace from the first two movies.As usual, the film features a nice assortment of young women – three white girls, a Hispanic and a black woman, the latter being the biker chick, Fox. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the main protagonist, Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is probably it, followed by the stoner chick, Chili. Debbie and Vera are also on hand.Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but—with the exception of the 2009 reboot—I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE: ""Part III"" is another entertaining segment in the series and it's notable for switching the filming locations to dry Southern California, not to mention Jason is bigger and more imposing than in ""Part II"" and he finally acquires his iconic hockey mask, but ""Part III"" is my least favorite of the franchise due to the overt goofy elements.The film runs 95 minutes.GRADE: C+",Friday the 13th Part III
31,trashgang,the iconic episode,5,17 January 2011,"After all these years I'm going back into the Friday the 13th franchise and I'm still surprised how boring they can be sometimes. Part 2 was so slow so I hoped for a better episode. Again it picks up were part 2 left with a flashback, just some scene's taken from part 2. Luckily, this time it only clocks in at 7 minutes. But part 3 has two special things. It is available as 3D on the Deluxe Edition and I must say, it worked out fine. Sometimes the 3D doesn't match and you see some faults but overall it is a nice feature, for example the famous speer coming at you really works. Another thing that became iconic is just the fact when the movie is exactly 60 minutes going on, Jason appears with the hockey mask. Sadly it takes again way too long before things really happens and the, I call it remake of the ending of part 1 does makes it feel a bit shitty. Also here for the first time Jason has some supernatural power by squeezing a head with his bare hands. So far the three parts aren't that bad but there are much better flicks and less known out in the slasher era.",Friday the 13th Part III
32,mm-39,This is a fun movie.,6,7 August 2001,"Well, having nothing better to do and renting the whole video store out, I went to the horror section, to desperately rented a video I did not see before.  It caught my eye, because of the 3-D edge to it, I told my wife what the hell lets rent it, its gotta be better that badly dubbed Italian film Zombi.  Anyways, I always wanted to see a 3D film, and when this came out with other 3D films in the early 80's my dad didn't take me to any of them , because the fad ended faster then it began. I tried to envision the 3D as I watched it in 2D, and this film probably was alot freakier in 3D, with the effects of yo-yo's, juggling, flaming cole pokers, spear guns, eye poppings, pitch forks, and flying pop corn.  The opening credits would have been great on 3D too.  My dad said they got the yo-yo idea from Vincent Price's House of Wax.  Not to drag on, I found this movie much better then the first.  One the budget is much higher, and two the film does not take it self to seriously.  This is a date movie, with alot of cheese in it, they made this film with alot of shock in a humorous way.  It had a great post disco  theme music, and gags like, (remember this is before safty seals, and after watching this I am happy they put them on products.)  a store owner who eats and drinks out of containers before resealing them.  He eats some of his fish food while feeding the fish, and finds out it has poo in it.  The prankster who does stupied trick, to keep you guessing if its the real killer.  The pot heads who act like Jim off Taxi. The plot here is not that scary, Jason does not talk, there is no motive, etc, he just walk around and kills. (well I work at the post office and people do motiveless stupid things all the time, but thats besides the point)  Motives help horror films, and the acting is better then the first, but the actors don't have mush room to play with the script.

I know when it comes to the 3-D movies, we are hitting into a major flop territory, but in my opinion I thought this was a fun movie. I wish I had the glasses though, I just loved how weird it looked. Jason is back and he's bigger and badder than ever. Finally, he has his hockey mask that at least I was waiting for. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Friday the 13th Part III delivers when it comes to the bad acting, silly sex scenes, and just all in all the bad behavior that leads to the horny teenager's demise. I'm still trying to see what is the big fuss over Jason, but he truly brings in a cool story and plenty of gore.Leaving off where the second movie ended, Ginny and Paul escaping, Jason kills off two people and finds his hockey mask that makes him oh-so-menacing looking. A group of horny teenagers just decide to go on a trip, that trip happens to be at Camp Crystal Lake and they have no idea what is in store for them when Jason sees all the bad behavior. Not only that, but he's coming at them in 3-D! This is a slasher not to be messed with.Friday the 13th Part III is over all a cool sequel, I would say that this is worthy enough for the series. But as always it's overly cheesy, but I'd say it's cool enough to watch in the dark. Just get the 3-D glasses, for me, it was cheesy to see things coming at me but not. Jason delivers some cool death scenes, my favorite is the store owner's, it's fun and suspenseful. Is Friday the 13th Part III the best I've seen yet?

37,thesar-2,"""Be a man, man.""",4,15 January 2009,"""Be a man, man."" I can't really dog 'Friday the 13th Part III' for the terribly and possibly unintentionally humorous dialogue, especially when they're talking to themselves (2x: ""Where's this (blood) coming from?"") Or the stereotypically bad actors playing stereotypically bad characters. Or the completely overlong and pointless death of a couple you actually wanted to die in the opening. These are just trademarked  or soon to be  'Friday' clichés. But I can rip on the hideously bad idea of the 3-D (and hilariously awful and annoying props when initiating the 3-D ""magic"") when that's generally a gimmick to bring people back to a dead series. This series was just beginning (not that they knew there would be another eight additional films to feature Jason Voorhees) and already had a cult following  hence the fact that one new 'Friday' movie was released each year (or less.) And people complain about the recent 'Saw' films that have severely trumped Jason's box office year after year. This all being said, this was the first 'Friday' movie I saw as a kid. I remember getting our first VCR and taping this off of network TV  edited out scenes I wouldn't be able to see until years later  and falling in love with the Jason myth. I had no idea the audience wasn't privileged to see the psycho up to this point, so I took for granted we can finally see the killer Jason (for about 1/3 of the film, but still) and that this is one where he finally dons the hockey mask.

It's pretty much the same as every other movie in the series – a group of seemingly brainless kids goes into the woods only to be slaughtered by an unseen killer. How original! But in fairness, it's actually no better or worse than the other films in the series. Even with the plot limitations, there are some scenes in Friday the 13th Part III that I enjoy: Jason finding his hockey mask, a ""dead"" Jason pulling himself up to get the rope off his neck, and everyone going to the barn to die are favorite moments for me. The last point – everyone going to the barn to die – is actually something of a joke between my wife and I. At one point or another in the movie, it seems that every single brain dead character makes a trip, whether purposeful or not, to the barn where Jason just happens to be hiding. It's utterly ridiculous, but fun nonetheless.Friday the 13th Part III was released during something of a 3-D craze in the early 80s. I can remember seeing this movie, the re-release of the 3-D 1953 House of Wax, and Jaws 3-D in the theaters. There are some scenes in Friday the 13th Part III that may seem pointless today that were amazing in 3-D. The best example in my mind is the spear-gun scene. Watching today, it's nothing special. But in 3-D, it blew me away.",Friday the 13th Part III
39,gridoon,Alternately dull and repellent.,4,8 November 1999,"This third entry looks cheap, lacks suspense and has only a few gory, often repellent murders to interrupt the long stretches of general boredom. It's not as corny as the original, but it's extremely repetitive - just one slashing after another - and the ending, in which Jason constantly ""dies"" and then comes back to life reminded me of some cartoon heroes I like. At least the acting IS decent...",Friday the 13th Part III
40,lost-in-limbo,"Jason, teens, bikers and the barn of dooooom.",6,11 July 2006,"More teens head out to a farmhouse at Crystal Lake, unknowingly to them there were some brutal murders committed by a madman within the campsite area just the day before. And there's no exception to the trend here, as Jason gets around to picking off the group and he also encounters some bikers along the way, while hiding about in a barn. If you want to hear something original and professional, well that ain't going to happen on this instalment so don't hang around. But I guess you'll know what you're getting yourself into, anyway. So, what we got here is Jason in 3-D land, but most likely you won't get to see it in 3-D, which makes the gimmick very tacky and flat with its constant prodding. The yo-yo madness takes the cake! Actually, it would've been tacky anyhow but still definitely way more fun. Part 3 is my favourite flick in the rancid series, which wasn't always the case, but with repeat viewings it has really grown on me. I find it enjoyably clunky, despite it having some very nihilistic and unforgettable slaughters. But how can you go past the infamous trademark that bestows itself on Jason, to help him become an icon figure in the horror genre. You can thank the practical joker, Shelly for the noteworthy hockey mask. Although, I found the sack over-the-head in part 2, to be far more creepier. Larry Zerner, who played Shelly (the boy who cried wolf), provided some humour and the script adds a few dabs of irony. The acting is surprisingly decent, and the dim teens are quite likable. The beautiful Dana Kimmell in the heroine role, as Chris, makes an impressionable mark. Uh, now what is hard to shake off, are the ""badass"" bikers these guys you don't want to mess with um, actually that's not quite the case. They're pathetically hopeless and very laughable punks! The jolly teens are your typical kind of sinners that are there to get the chop in quick concession. Most of them don't put up much of fight and are blind-sided. Richard Brooker as Jason is more human and gives the villain a lanky, but still quite towering figure of brute strength. The generic story is a smörgåsbord of clichés, lacking continuity, unexplored details (like Jason's connection with the heroine) and has only a singular objective on mind - ""watch the bodies pile up, courtesy of Jason"".Steve Miner's direction won't set the word alight with such conventional methods, but it's able and he adds an organic rawness to the feel of the film (that only the earlier features seem to have). While, there might little suspense, some drawn-out moments and plenty of false build-ups, but the isolated backdrop still injects an silently eerie air to proceedings and Henry Manfredini's chillingly sneaky theme score hasn't lost any of it's infectious nerve. One thing that ran through my mind was the alluring attraction of that barn. Is there some sort of message lurking there for its important attachment to the story with people popping in and out and simply staring at it in amazement?An entertaining, cheesy romp, if somewhat quite standard entry to the series.",Friday the 13th Part III
41,Robert_duder,The Bodies continue to pile in the phenomenal Horror Series,7,18 August 2011,"Friday the 13th, the entire franchise, is a lot of things. For one it is absolutely an acquired taste. I mean the first several instalments which I am watching in order are essentially the same. Friday the 13th features more of a story and a background to set up the series, the second instalment literally is just a pile up of bodies and now Friday the 13th Part 3 features a new group of youngsters who fall victim to the one and only Jason Voorhees. Basically to enjoy these films and truly become a fan of them you have to enjoy the lore they create, and enjoy them coming up with new and fantastic ways for Jason to cut his terror through a new group of campers or some variation. This instalment is most important because it gives Jason two of his most iconic features. One if of course the Hockey Mask that is synonymous with him, and the large gash on the forehead of the mask. Friday the 13th is about nudity, blood, teenagers, and Jason and Part 3 doesn't disappoint. Is it brilliant? No. It's the same formula as part two only the cast is a little better and the deaths are amped up. The attempt at a back story in this case is a young woman who had met up with Jason years ago in the woods. She returns to the farm with her friends to try and get over that memory.Because Friday films usually have such a large and varied cast I am only going to call out the performances that are main characters or characters that do actually stand out. Dana Kimmell is our scream queen this time around. She plays Chris, the heroine who saw Jason years ago and is faced with him again. She does as well as any previous or future scream queens in the series. She isn't particularly stand out but does well. Paul Kratka plays her estranged boyfriend Rick. He is monotone and not the greatest actor but fits her decently well. Larry Zerner is Shelly, who is a legend in Friday lore because it is his mask that Jason takes which lasts the rest of the entire series to date. Zerner is probably the most entertaining and probably the best performer in the film. Jeffrey Rogers is also decent as one of the victims, Andy whose death is pretty unique and tailored to a particular talent Rogers has of walking on his hands. Richard Brooker takes up the role of Jason and does a good job of carrying on the character from Steve Dash in part 2. I don't think Jason really reaches his stride until Kane Hodder took over the character.One of the interesting points about Friday the 13th Part 3 is the fact that it was shown in 3D. The DVD copy I have of this film does actually have a 3D version and two pairs of the old red and white cyan glasses. I started watching it in 3D because there are definitely some cool aspects of 3D in it but it became annoying in the first half hour wearing the paper glasses. Still they were ahead of their time and actually made the 3D work. Steve Miner returned to helm the third instalment which is always good to keep consistency in check. Miner knows what people want to see and not to mess with what works. To some this film and the previous ones would seem atrocious, silly, predictable but to true slasher/horror fans this is what makes us tick. Good vs Evil, a killer that can't be stopped, ridiculous over the top kills, and a campy silly good time. The series continues! 7/10",Friday the 13th Part III
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Recycles the same old plot but with less connection to the mythos; luckily, it has the best finale of all the 'Friday's thus-far.",5,13 April 2018,"'Friday The 13th Part III (1982)' recycles the same plot seen in the prior two titles almost verbatim, except this time it's even less connected to the 'Camp Crystal Lake' mythos than before, with Jason just coincidentally coming across a bunch of holidaying teenagers and killing them all for no clear reason... in 3D. It is actually pretty boring for most of the run-time, which is dedicated to trying to make you care for the hilariously unlikable and underdeveloped characters - not to mention delivering an absurd amount of false jump scares. These false frights even continue when Jason - who is bigger in stature and generally more menacing, even if his movements are still a little oafish and his unmasked mug is hard to take seriously (it's certainly not scary, by any stretch) - starts his inevitable killing spree. This is actually allowed a little more breathing room here than in the second part but still doesn't reach the nastiness of the original, but luckily the final confrontation saves this piece from being a total waste of time as it's perhaps the best segment of all three films so far, with the central character actually using her wits and legitimate weaponry to damage her persistent pursuer a decent amount. It's genuinely tense and exciting, for the most part, and a great note on which to end. 5/10",Friday the 13th Part III

Now (and wait for it) you have part III, where a bunch of horny teenagers are in the woods being stalked and killed. I can't wait to see what part IV has to offer! So, is it any good? Well... if you liked the first two it is, as it's basically the same movie (again). However, if you didn't like the first couple then this one won't win over any new fans. It's not violent enough to compete with today's slasher offerings, so it might seem a little tame to today's youth.At least Jason finally dons his infamous hockey mask, making him look more like the killer we're eventually going to love (well, recognise anyway).",Friday the 13th Part III

The gimmicky camera shots may have looked cool when audiences actually saw this movie in 3D, but in 2D they're cheesy and distracting.

The cinema was packed, the screening sold out and the audience absolutely loved it. Every scare worked, the 3D effects leaped right off the screen and lovingly poked us in the eye and when the film was over it got the longest applause I've ever seen a film get. For those pretentious cynics who think that the Friday the 13th films are not great then there's nothing like a 350+ audience to prove you wrong.Since this film was in 'polarised' 3D (see-thru glasses instead of a red-blue blur)then it's not possible to transfer the effect to DVD. Besides, nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with Jason's face 10-feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you.

48,ironhorse_iv,Jason's back for a turd. A one-dimensional 3D horror of a film.,5,13 November 2015,"Friday the 13th is one of the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, nevertheless, it's Friday the 13th Part III, where it become very crystal clear that the film series to starting to get stupid. Directed by Steve Miner, and originally release in 3-D, Friday the 13th Part III is the first movie to feature the antagonist Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) with his iconic signature hockey mask, which has since become a trademark of both the character and franchise as a whole. As a direct sequel to 1980's Friday the 13th & 1981's Friday the 13th Part 2, the first part of the film follows the aftermath of the massacres at Camp Crystal Lake, very loosely. We see a recap of the last minutes of the previous film through archive footage. However, it doesn't really fit well, with the rest of this film, since that part wasn't shot in 3D. Other glaring factors is that none of the previous cast, return for this film. Not even, Amy Steel as Ginny Field, who surprising, was never even kill by Jason. I guess, they didn't want to do the Ginny at psychiatric hospital route, since 1981's Halloween 2 kinda did it first. Instead, the movie focus on a new batch of teenagers lead by Chrissy Higgins (Dana Kimmell) in a new location, Higgins Haven trying to have some vacation time, before the new school year on surprising Sunday, the 15th, not Friday the 13th. I wasn't impressed with any of the actors acting here. It was a bit jarring to see, mid 30s somethings, trying to act like teens. Not only that; unlike the other film, where most of the supporting characters were likable. Most of them in this movie, weren't likable! They were all, highly obnoxious! First off, you got Rick (Paul Kraka) whom loves, surprising and forcing sex on supposedly rape victims. Then you got the over-the-top Cheech & Chong rip-off, stoner, Charles 'Chuck"" Garth (David Katims) who looks like, he has step into the wrong set! Then you got the cheesy Michael Jackson's 'BAD' looking motorcycle gang that really had, no purpose in the film, just to serve as filler. Then you got the guy, Andy Beltrami (Jeffery Rodgers) and his pregnant girlfriend, Debbie Klein (Tracie Savage) whom gimmick was it, to walk on his hands. Then you got Debbie, whom I really don't know, why they had to try to kill her and unborn child. I guess, the producers really hated, teen pregnancies. Then you got the really horrible character, Shelly Finkelstein (Larry Zerner), whom I didn't like him, at all! He really ruins the film for me. Does he have mental problems or something!? Who does mean pranks like that!? Are you sure, this movie wasn't made as a comedy, because they all, look like a joke! The only person, besides Chrissy that was somewhat decent was Vera Sanchez (Catherine Parks) who had an eye on things. Honestly, for the most part, I wanted all of them to die, quick. It's a bad sign, if you cheer for the bad guy, more than the good guys. Anyways, the movie is full of silly 3-D gimmicks. We get to see, a number of mundane 3-D effects from Yo-Yo being tossed at us to juggling tricks. It seemed like they were really stretching, when coming up with ideas on how to use the 3-D in this film. Still, there were a number of really cool shots that was worth seeing, such as the harpoon gun or pitchfork scene. Still, some of the deaths in the film were edited in order to avoid an ""X"" rating, and you really can tell, where the cuts ends. The film also contains an infamous alternate ending in which the lead character Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is decapitated by Jason at the conclusion. Though this sequence has never been commercially released, stills of it can be seen. Still, the ending, they did choose, was very lackluster, with all the fake-outs dream sequences. Despite all the blood and gore, this movie lacks the suspense, compare to the previous two. I really didn't find, the movie to be, that scary. After all, the movie has a funky disco soundtrack by Harry Manfredini that sounds like a Halloween dance-off party and lots of nudity that give anybody, a chubby. When first released, the film was intended to end the series as a trilogy. However unlike its sequel Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984) and the later film, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993), Friday the 13th Part III did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. Overall: it's one of the films, you have to watch at least once, if you into the 1980's horror genre. Just don't think too much about it when watching. It's just one of those films you watch if you want cheap thrills, nothing more.",Friday the 13th Part III

Why do people enjoy watching teenagers senselessly being butchered?Steve Miner is back in the director's chair. 'Friday the 13th Part 3' pretty much offers the same we've seen in the previous films. Only here, Jason starts wearing the hockey mask that made this villain so recognizable. (In the first film, Jason's mom was the killer, in the second Jason wore a sack over his head). Jason actually takes the mask from one of his victims, a ""jerk"" named Shelly (played by Larry Zerner). We're at a camp again and there's plenty of horny teens.This movie is loaded with way too many false scares, and bland characters. They are here simply for the kill. There is no substance whatsoever. There's therefore very little to say about this movie; it's just slicing and dicing. And come to think of it, they don't even mention Friday the 13th in these movies.

52,tomgillespie2002,Offers nothing new but an easy way to spend 90 minutes,3,3 April 2012,"Carrying on the Friday the 13th tradition, Part III is yet another re- run of the events of the first film, only using different actors and character names. The action picks up just a day after Part 2, with Jason surviving the attack and fleeing to a nearby lakeside resort called Higgins Haven. Amongst the group of naive machete-bait is heroine Chris (Dana Kimmell), obligatory horny couple Debbie (Tracie Savage) and Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), annoying and self-loathing prankster Shelley (Larry Zerner), and hippy stoner couple Chuck (David Katims) and Chili (Rachel Howard). Some little one-dimensional character building later, Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) is soon hacking them up in various entertaining ways.After the blandness of the first two Friday the 13th movies, I was expecting more of the same here, which I indeed got (it even replaces Crazy Ralph with a demented religious fanatic they meet on the road). There's precious little in ways of scares, originality or surprises, but it does have a couple of decent deaths that don't seem to suffer given Tom Savini's absence. The most memorable being someone being hacked clean in half whilst hand-standing. The third entry into the long franchise is better remembered for being the film that introduced Jason's hockey mask, which is now a well-recognised piece of pop culture. I was never expecting anything great here, and while it is formulaic, predictable, and often very dull, it's still an easy 90 minutes of slasher entertainment.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Friday the 13th Part III

54,BaronBl00d,Keeping Up the Expectations!,3,17 April 2005,"Steve Miner directs a cast of nobodies in Jason's third epic outing. The film opens with a scene of a previous victim being chased by Jason wearing his sackcloth over his head. We have a brief flashback sequence with Betsy Palmer as the disembodied Mrs. Vorhees and then cut to the present as a van full of teens, soon to be the cattle for Jason's slaughterhouse by the lake, drive into the woods where a girl was once attacked by Jason but survived. She has let two years pass and feels compelled to make herself stay at this cabin - even though the body of the murderer Jason was never found! This movie is just as futile and pathetic as its previous sources, but, because it thinks it is doing something innovative with 3D special effects, it is all the more laborious to sit through. Those special effects - we get juggling fruit, a yo-yo, a spear, a pitchfork(both ends), a fake snake head, an eyeball out of socket and one in, and several other cheap ways of utilizing this once-thought dead art form - the 3D method. The cast is nothing great in any way. No one really is an actor. Cliché characters are in vogue though in this third installment: the older (and I mean MUCH older) boyfriend of the girl driven away two years ago, the two potheads smoking and sleeping all the time, the trio of bad youths out to settle a score, and, my favourite, the fat, unappealing kid who ""acts"" like he is dead with blood and an ax in his head just to get the attention he so desperately craves. The murders are robotic, and there is no real compassion or feeling to be generated toward any - ANY - of the characters. It is so very sad that a movie like this, a sequel to a barely superior film, could help keep the sequels churning out. This film should have ended it all. It really sucks!

56,Fella_shibby,Amazing n uproarious 3D eyeball horror scene but too much of time gaps between kills.,5,16 May 2020,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently.
Terrible screenplay n wots the obsession with the barn.
Wot happened to the woods.
Again 6 mins r spent in showing the flashbacks of the previous installment.
The film directly picks up aft the events of the previous one.
The first murder takes place aft 15 mins n that too aft creating unnecessary hide n seek kinda tension.
Then again the film bores us for another 30 mins before the kills.
It has some lovely locations n settings.
There r no good chicks, the lead actor is Powers Boothe lookalike who gets his skull crushed.It has the same cliche wher the final girl injures the assailant not once bt twice, but rather than killing him off completely, she runs away. Wait, the third time she really makes the effort to kill him.
Towards the end, a hooligan who luckily survived earlier, enters the scene jus to get hacked to pieces.
Okay this is the part wher he gets his iconic hockey mask n it has two good kills n both of the eyeballs. Check out the lol 3D eyeball pop out scene. (Drag me to Hell n Evil Dead comes to mind).
The screenplay sucks big time. The lead actres narrates her story which doesn't connect the dots cos Jason never takes hostages or victims, he simply butchers em.
This part too doesn't have Savini as the effects guy but his name crops up in the Fangoria mag one character reads before her death.",Friday the 13th Part III

This time Jason leaves Camp Crystal Lake and heads to an unknown destiny, which later turns to be ""Higgins Haven"". On his way to the haven Jason murders Harold and Edna (the owners / attendants) of a rural K-Mart like store. This time Jason's unlucky victims include Chris Higgins (owner of the haven), Rick, Chuck, Chilli, Shelly, Debbie, Andy, Vera, and a gang of motorcycle bikers: Ali, Fox, Loco. Highlights of the movie: Jason and the bikers, Chris revealing to Rick about her previous encounter with Jason (not knowing it was him), Chuck watching Jason thinking it's a hallucination, Andy's death, and of course , Jason getting his trademark mask; and at last but not least the great funky groovy opening theme. This tune added some humor to the tension felt towards the beginning of the carnage.""Friday 3"" came in the right moment when the slasher genre was at it's peak. After the box office success of part 2, this sequel was a coming on. This movie has plenty of gore, suspense, and some good scare scenes.The acting is regular, the best performance comes from Dana Kimmell.Jason looks menacing, big, and surely very angry. Richard Brooker portrayed Jason in a good way, he knows how to act violent and looks like he's blood thirsty. This time the teens aren't as smart as in the previous film, still I liked some of them. Shelly was a good character, although he was annoying you felt sorry for him at the end. Rick was an unlikeable character, he seemed tough but in the end he couldn't even fight Jason. Debbie's pregnancy was overlooked, I guess that Jason didn't know he killed an unborn. What the heck, even if he knew about it he would still kill Debbie. Andy's death is by far the best in the movie, and one of the best s in the series. Chuck and Chilli (who aren't exactly teens) had potential, but in a 90 minute slasher movie you can't get much character development. The gang situation was unnecessary, I mean there was a lot of hype about a possible confrontation between these guys and Jason. The ending of the movie is great! The chasing scene is the best in the series (even better than part 2's). Jason seemed angry and desperate to kill Chris, who wasn't by no means braver than Ginny but still manged to give some fight to Jason. Unmasked Jason looked frightening, specially if you consider that Jason's unmasked look from part 2 wasn't that creepy at all. Unlike the Jason from part 2 this Jason seems to be invincible, the producers probably wanted to create a Jason that would impose respect, and create fear among the other characters.Miner's direction is still good. This is where part III didn't improve from the 2nd. movie. Miner's job in part 2 is magnificent, probably the best (apart from part VI) in the series. Still, Miner shows his talent in creating a scary, and dark setting.""Friday the 13th part III:3D"" is a good horror movie, the 3rd. installment in the series is worth a rental for horror fans and if you are a die hard of the series -like me- then you should buy it even IF it isn't the uncut version on DVD. I'm sure that this movie is more effective in the fear factor if you watch it on 3-D. Sadly, it isn't available in that format.Give a try to this flick even if you're not a Friday the 13th fan, it's surely a great slasher flick. Not the best in the series but delivers some good scares, gore, a cool theme, and a hockey masked Jason!.4/10 8/10 in the Friday the 13th scale.",Friday the 13th Part III
59,Anonymous_Maxine,What's this about 3D?,4,30 January 2004,"So I've heard that this is the Friday the 13th installment that was released in 3D. I wish I could have seen it in that version, because it would probably have made it a lot more interesting. I imagine the makers decided to add that little bit of cinematic trickery to create another surge of interest in the series, which really hasn't done anything new by the time the second sequel came out to add on to the original idea. I've been going back and re-watching all the old classics, I'm working on the Nightmare on Elm Streets and the Friday the 13th films right now, and in comparison it's amazing how much more callous and brutal the Friday the 13th films are, while the Nightmare on Elm Street films, while equally campy, I tend to find much more entertaining and well-made (not that that's saying much.).Watch, for example, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, and then watch just about any Friday the 13th movie, and you can see what I mean right away. The Elm Street films are peppered with low-brow and goofy (although quite often effective, even when it's not really meant to be funny) comic relief, butthe Friday the 13th films (especially part 3, I've noticed so far) are little more than strings of scenes of teenagers doing teenage things at Camp Crystal Lake and getting brutally murdered by the relentless Jason Voorhees.
Friday the 13th Part 3 concerns yet another crowd of idiot teens who go out to Camp Crystal Lake, bypass yet another ominous warning from a crazy old man along the way, and proceed to engage in a lot of the exact same antics that we saw in the first two movies. There's the addition here of a hopelessly geeky kid with them who have an annoying habit of faking his own bloody death in order to scare all the girls (after which he wonders why none of them like him), but at least providing the only bit of mystery in the entire film. As I watched the movie, my roommates and I were betting on whether he would get killed, then someone wouldn't believe him and then get killed themselves, or if someone else would get killed, he would think they were trying to get revenge for his bad jokes, and then he would get killed for real. Kind of sad when the only thing that it really interesting in a movie like this is in what order the teens will get killed.That strikes me as a definite sign that the movies are starting to lose their thrill (either because of the 20 years between the film's release and now or because each sequel really does nothing new). I wonder if the 3D element really did add that extra needed bit of excitement. One thing that was really funny was the motorcycle gang. These people were awesome. Seriously. On their way to the Lake, the kids stop at a store to get some junk food essentials, and are confronted by what I assume was supposed to be a hardened gang of bikers. These people were HILARIOUS. After harassing the kids in the store, the geeky kid accidentally backs the VW Bug into their motorcycles, knocking them over. The lead biker responds by calmly walking up to the car, smiling brightly at him, and then smashing the windshield and the driver's side window. Angered beyond ability to just leave, the kid decides to circle around and run over the bikes head-on, which he succeeds in doing because the aforementioned biker couldn't KICKSTART his motorcycle in time. Maybe had the poor biker realized that street bikes don't kickstart but are started with a key and an ignition button, he would have been able to save his pimp ride. He and his friends might even have avoided their fate as pointless fodder for Jason to slice and dice later in the movie. Ah well.So there was certainly no shortage of comic relief, and I really don't think it matters that the comedy in these movies wasn't originally meant to be comedy. At least they're still entertaining. The thing that really drags the movie down is that it is literally nothing more than a flimsy clothesline of a plot that is punctuated by gruesome killings of idiot teenagers. There's only so many movies that you can make about a lot of kids who decide to do something dangerous by going out to the haunted lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees and then not realize that he's really there killing them all one by one until only one is left, and even then she hits him with a shovel or stabs him in the thigh and then starts clawing at locked doors, not thinking to maybe make a little more certain that Jason's not going to get back up. You would think that at least ONE of these last victims would realize that the best time to get the best of Jason is when he's lying unconscious at her feet. But no.The second sequel of the Friday the 13th saga is little more than a rehash of the old Camp Crystal Lake legend, and given the proliferation of sequels that followed, hopefully something new comes up later. Given the final scene, I would really like to see a character in a later movie throw out some jokes about Jason's mom. Can you imagine? How cool would it be to see some bonehead teenager laughing his head off around the campfire or something as all of his friends look at him in horror because Jason is approaching him from behind with a gigantic butcher knife as the kid says, `Hey Jason, yo momma's so ugly, she won't even come out of the lake! HAW HAW HAW!!!'",Friday the 13th Part III
60,gwnightscream,Not Bad!,5,4 April 2012,"Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka and Larry Zerner star in this 1982 horror sequel. This picks up where the last film ended with Jason Voorhees killing a married couple. Soon, Chris (Kimmell) and her friends stay at a cabin near Crystal Lake. Chris not only runs into her ex-boyfriend, Rick (Kratka), but she and her friends deal with their practical joking friend, Shelly (Zerner) and 3 biker bullies. That's the least of their problems when they become hunted by Jason (Richard Brooker). Chris reveals to Rick that she was attacked 2 years before by a deformed man turning out to be Jason. After her friends and the bikers are killed, Chris becomes the only survivor who meets Jason face to face since she was first attacked. This sequel isn't bad and was originally shot in 3-D.

When part three was released on video it had three things against, 1.) No 3D, 2.) No widescreen and 3.) no gore. By now the film-makers should have been hip to the fact that all the blood and gore would have been chopped out of the movie, they wern't. So, when the film went to video all you saw was an altered film with gimmicky 3D effects that couldn't be seen. No 3D and no gore make a horrible movie.

62,jadavix,More of the same,5,12 April 2019,"""Friday the 13th Part III"" is only notable for, if anything, being the first movie in which Jason wears his iconic hockey mask, which must be the most famous mask ever worn by a bad guy in a horror flick.I read something online about how the filmmakers tried to prevent the plot of the movie from being 'leaked'. Why did they bother? The plot is exactly the same as the prior two movies in the series, which had the exact same plot as pretty much every other slasher: young people go to a remote location and get bumped off one by one until only the ""final girl"" remains. Even those who haven't seen a slasher before know the plot.This has all the same problems of its two predecessors: no interesting or memorable characters, no one to root for, not much in the way of plot or interesting dialogue, and when the 'hero' finally emerges (the 'final girl') it could have been any of the others, just as well.One thing the movie has over its direct predecessor is a return to decent gore effects, including a harpoon through the eye socket, and a scene where Jason supposedly crushes a guy's skull until his eye pops out.Jason might have the mask, but he's not too scary or imposing in this one. The guy who played him was apparently an acrobat-turned-stuntman. They needed a lumberjack-turned-linebacker.",Friday the 13th Part III

Here we get to see a lot of his hideous face (he's now lost his long hair from part 2 and is now completely bold), plus he gains the iconic hockey mask courtesy of one of his victims, the obligatory joker. There is some humour added to the story here but overall it's still pretty dark. The gore level has been upped again with some of the best kills of the series, all in glorious 3D. This effect is employed effectively throughout the film & helps make it one of the best Fridays. Probably my second personal Friday after the first movie.",Friday the 13th Part III
64,kevin_robbins,Very fun and this movie has so many great kill scenes and nostalgic moments for fans of the franchise,7,12 May 2021,"Friday the 13th 3D (1982) I recently watched from my personal collection and takes place immediately after Part 2. Jason retreats to recover from his wounds from Part 2 just in time for some new campers and bikers to arrive near camp blood. Jason isn't going to give up the opportunity to continue to expand his body count, wounded or not. This movie is directed by Steve Miner (Warlock and Halloween H20) and stars Catherine Parks (Weekend at Bernies), Kevin O'Brien (Warlock), Paul Kratka (The Bone Garden), Cheri Maugans (Dallas) and Gloria Charles (National Lampoons Vacation). The storyline for this installment in the series actually transitions nicely from the second film and has great 3D elements (even while watching it in 2D) because it was recorded from the beginning with every intention of being in 3D. The kill scenes are very good and we get to see Jason in his hockey mask for the first time as well. My only complaint is this is the first film in the series that transitioned from being recorded at a lake on the east coast to a Hollywood set and the lake, especially at the end, looks more like a river than a lake (literally the last season of the movie it looks like she can jump out of the canoe and walk to either side of the river). Overall, very fun and this movie has so many great kill scenes and nostalgic moments for fans of the franchise. I'd score it a fun 6.5/10.",Friday the 13th Part III

As this Friday 13th movie don't expect the acting to be great.The 3D in this movie was spot on (Unlike The Final Destination 3D was poor but My Bloodly Valertine remake had great 3D but poor on the plot wise) Friday 13th part 3 outstanding on plot and the 3D effects.I going give this movie 9 out 10",Friday the 13th Part III

Characterization has improved from the pitiful showing in Part 2, but that's close to the textbook definition of a backhanded compliment. We still endure some painfully awkward social interactions and idiotic decisions from the cast, and linger too long in their dry, boring daylight scenes. The series has moved past the camp counselor-as-victim model, though it doesn't seem to make much of a difference: these generic teenagers don't behave much differently. Jason continues to be omnipresent, basically signifying a transition point between every scene. Time to move our perspective into the bedroom? Well, let's just cram a shadowy figure or heavy work boot into the end of the preceding shot. Don't forget the trademarked stalking/heavy breathing melody. His problems with closing the deal also persist: the guy is downright psychic for the first dozen kills, but when the number of survivors drops to one or two, all of a sudden he can't get out of his own way. Sloppy and poorly made, like many of the era's horror movies, but also oddly charming for many of the same reasons.",Friday the 13th Part III

68,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Boy, are you dumb!""",8,13 October 2017,"I have slightly mixed feelings on this third movie because in comparison to the previous two, the tone is decidedly lighter and watered-down somewhere and it doesn't feel as dark or grim. For every suspenseful moment there's something frivolous and goofy waiting just around the corner, for one thing that kooky intro music is horribly cheesy and so not Friday the 13th, there's no spookiness to it. It's a real earworm too, it makes me want to do the funky shoulder Thriller-type dance move every time I hear it! How serious can you possibly take a horror movie though when it's crawling with off-putting and unappealing characters like from the get go the world's most unhappy couple at the beginning, the middle-aged stoners(wrong movie!), the confused biker gang, the retard who's only character trait was that he occasionally liked to walk on his hands, and of course poor doomed chubby misunderstood prankster Shelly with his ridiculous hair whiny voice and stupid rubbery sad clown face. The one good thing about Shelly is that he introduces the iconic mask to the franchise. It's so amazing how much of a genuine little pop culture horror phenomenon was made in that humble mask. By and large those kinds of white hockey masks are now associated with horror/Jason, and that's all because of this movie! When Jason puts it on it's like his image and persona are complete, it's like his symbol, a skull of death, and is the only face he really needs... That said though, there are other incarnations of Jason I like better than this one, he's a bit too lanky and apelike, I don't like his hump. And some of his body language is a bit too casual, the guy almost looks bored at points! The big creepy barn of certain doom that Jason hangs out in for most of the movie is the first thing that always pops into my mind about it.. I really hate the 3D, it's so obnoxious the way it's shoved right in your face every two minutes and for me it only hinders the enjoyment of the movie rather than doing it any favours. It might not have been so annoying if they'd only used it during the death scenes, but what they did mostly opt to use it for was just stupid. It's so obvious that the main effort of this flick was put into all that s**t rather than attempts at developing the story or characters a bit more. They should have tried harder to make the movie more interesting instead of mainly relying on such a pointless throwaway gimmick.. It still made it's money though! Dana Kimmell as Chris the survivor girl is okay, she's perfectly nice and pretty but she doesn't have the character of the two heroines that preceded her, and for the most part she's pretty indistinguishable from the rest of her friends. She is very good at the end though when she's facing Jason, she was effective at getting all worked up and appearing like she was starting to lose it. I find the whole closing sequence where she's been driven to madness by the fear and screams and giggles to herself as she's ushered into the police car after imagining Jason leering out at her from the window with his hideous face and then coming out to get her, genuinely chilling. The movie does end on a good strong note. Friday the 13th Part III is a fairly unremarkable movie and slasher overall, I don't think I'd give it the time of day if it didn't happen to be a Jason movie. It's funny how after a time a horror movie villain's appeal can become so strong that it can overshadow the very movies that made him in he first place, exact same thing with Freddy! For me it's not one of the best offerings in the series but like most of them it is awesome and ridiculous in equal measure and is just a fun bloody ride that makes for some classic rainy night slasher viewing.

This time he's targeting some teenagers who are spending the weekend in a summerhouse near Camp Crystal Lake, like he does in almost every sequel that follows this one.I will say that I haven't seen this movie in it's original 3-D format, I saw it on DVD, so I'm guessing it was much better in 3-D than it is in 2-D. I enjoyed ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" better than ""Part 3"". This film does have some slightly suspenseful moments, and the acting is downright awful, which really doesn't matter because this is a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel. But still, this one didn't work for me.When I see these movies I don't expect top notch acting. Also some of the killings have horrible effects jobs and they look worse than fake. It has the horror elements in there, but it still isn't nearly as good as Part 2. I think the best thing about this movie is that it was the first of all of the sequels to introduce the infamous ""hockey mask"", which is now iconic.

I think I liked this one better than part 2, and I for sure liked it better than the first film. The characters were good enough for this type of film, Ginny was a good survivor and star, and I also really liked Rick's character too. Some of the kills were kinda creative, and they weren't like overly disturbing because of how old this is. There are really only two simple things I want in these movies. One: characters that I don't hate, ones I can like enough to watch. Two: when things get going, try to keep my attention and don't be super cliché and dumb.

73,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th Part III (1982) 3D Version *** ; 2D Version **1/2,7,6 February 2013,"I was thinking how I would approach reviewing this next installment in the ever-continuing Jason Voorhees series. I decided to base my feelings on the very first screening I ever had of the film, way back in 1982 upon its initial theatrical release -- when it was on a big wide screen and in full-blown 3D. I think it rises above its limitations considerably when viewed as it was intended, although most viewers reading this will probably not have had that original theater experience. I would shave off half a star when watching the standard flat 2D version, as the gimmicky third dimensional effects are really the main star of the movie. There's not much in the way of story, of course ... another group of young people head off on a weekend getaway where they encounter the deranged psychopath Jason. The main girl is a cutie named Chris (Dana Kimmell) who is trying to work out some emotional problems while all her friends are engrossed in the usual weed-smoking and bed- hopping. The lack of a real involved plot here is not a detriment because most F13 fans such as myself only require our man Jason to be doing his thing by dealing unprovoked death in a variety of creative ways. The death scenes here are especially fun in 3D, and they include such gory treats as: a guy walking on his hands getting split in half, a spear gun being shot straight out at the audience and into a chick's eye, and a crushed head's eyeball shooting forward. The action really picks up during the exciting climax, which is the best part of the film and worth waiting for. *** out of **** (3D Version) **1/2 out of **** (2D Version)",Friday the 13th Part III
74,Witchfinder-General-666,Jason Sports a Hockey Mask For the First Time,4,12 June 2009,"***SPOILERS*** Personally, I've always thought of the ""Friday the 13th"" series as overrated among many of my fellow Horror fans. There is no doubt that the series is influential, and that every Horror lover should at least see some of the films, but, as far as I am concerned, they are in no way essential, and I must say that, when re-watching the entire series recently after some years, my most prevalent feeling was that of boredom. This third entry to the series is slightly better than Part 2, and yet I couldn't say that the film has anything particularly interesting about it. The most memorable aspect about ""Friday the 13th Part III"" (1982) is probably that villainous Jason sports his trademark hockey mask for the first time in this one. Other than that, the film is basically a repetition of the same formula: Horny teenage idiots getting butchered by a masked killer, namely Jason Voorhees. That's it. How imaginative. The killings are gorier and more stylish than in Part 2 (which was obviously tamed down due to the controversy over Part 1), and I also hated the teenagers in this one slightly less (except for the idiot named Shelly). For whatever reason, a constantly pot-smoking couple of 30-something Hippies is also traveling with the teens. Then again, Jason's motives are even more obscure than in Part 2, as his victims in this film are neither working, nor even staying at Camp Crystal Lake. Seems like he just took a shine in butchering teenagers, no matter what their occupation is. My favorite character in the film was a crazy old guy with a long beard carrying a severed eyeball. Crystal lake looks completely different than in the previous parts. The lake looks smaller in this one, the ambiance looks more southern, and there's less forest, which is a minus in my book. As always, there's a sole survivor of Jason's massacre in this one. In the end she dreams of Mrs. Voorhees coming out of the lake and grabbing her, as Jason did in the end of the first part. This is utterly idiotic, as she doesn't know who Jason is, and therefore couldn't possibly have any idea about his mother. Overall, ""Friday the 13th"" is another silly and utterly unoriginal entry to this generally overrated series, but I cannot claim that it isn't enjoyable on a certain level. However, if you want to watch a ""Friday the 13th"" film, it hardly matters which one, as they're basically all the same.",Friday the 13th Part III
75,aidanratesmovies,"A forgettable, silly sequel",4,25 June 2020,"Even though the film can be incredibly messy at times, and very silly at others, I would never call Friday the 13th Part III a horrible film, what I would call it though, is a largely unnecessary one. Again the film starts out with the ending from the previous film before it, which feels both incredibly pointless, and a waste of time- in fact I actually fast forwarded through the scene until I got to the opening credits. One of the strengths this sequel does have going for it however, is that it is not boring. To clarify its not terrible scary either, but is consistently entertaining enough to the point of some satisfaction. The acting is quite mediocre, with the characters again simply seeming like props for the film rather than true people. The script tries to give some of the characters a story, but muttles them up to the point of any true impact, and simply bears the question, why did they try if they didn't even intend to go through with it? The 3D antics in this film are absolutely ridiculous, incredibly obvious, and very forced- easily my least favorite part of the film. The atmosphere and tone are creepy, although not as heavily focused this time around, and the cinematography also feels a bit more stale. In the end, Friday the 13th Part III proves to only be memorable for its grand dedication to its 3D material, despite many watchers today not being able to find the actual 3D version of the film to watch. Besides this silly trait, the film is quite forgettable, messy, and though it is entertaining enough, it is hardly enough to be a satisfying experience to watch.My Rating: 4.2/10.",Friday the 13th Part III

There was more money to be made. The opening credits to this movie is a short film in itself. It runs over 10 minutes and brings the audience up to date with what has happened in Part 1 and Part 2. Although it was a little too long, it works as PART 3 begins where Part 2 ended. Just like the endings of the first 2 films, the ending of PART 3 is just as good. While the 3D is corny and very retro for someone in the early 80's, it worked for the cinema version.

77,Jonny_Numb,this sequel fails on just about every level,2,17 September 2003,"While the first two ""Friday the 13th"" films were nothing more than a manipulative recycling of the scare tactics of ""Psycho,"" ""Halloween,"" and even Mario Bava's ""Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" they were at least able to utilize a brisk pace which kept the audience's interest, even at times adding a dash of inspiration to the proceedings (the reverse ""Psycho"" angle from the first film; the use of the sweater in the second), in addition to a not-bad grasp of how to build atmosphere and suspense.  Well, this third entry fails on just about every level--it's actually pretty amazing to watch for its sheer badness.  Let's bring another bunch of particularly bad actors to yet another camp where that kooky Jason is still hanging around!  Let's count on awful 3D effects to cover the non-existent plot, the lack of suspense, and the inept pacing!  Yes, this stinker was released to theaters in 3-D, that tried-and-true gimmick used by makers of B-movies in the 1950's to spark interest in what was usually an inferior product.  Part 3 is no exception--after a somewhat spooky opening, it devolves into a pointless, poorly-acted, and awfully dull slasher flick, with makeup effects that are rough and often laughable (be sure to hold back your chuckles during the 'unmasking' scene).  Even more laughable is the fact that TWO writers are credited for this rubbish, one of which I'm determined just picked out stuff to be thrust at the screen for the 3D process.  The lead actress is one of the dumbest heroines I've had the displeasure to put up with since watching ""Bloody Moon.""  And Jason himself, once he dons the now-famous hockey mask, seems to go from a clever, cunning killer to a bumbling idiot in no time flat.  Actually, that's all prospective viewers of this tripe need to know (the debut of 'the mask') before picking something else off the video shelf.2/10",Friday the 13th Part III
78,a_chinn,"Best of the first three films, but that's a pretty low bar.",4,28 May 2017,"This films starts off with the climax of the second film, where Jason Voorhees apparently didn't die, but lives again to kill more campers at Camp Crystal Lake. This entry seems to be more competently made than prior entries, but overall the film is still pretty uninteresting and nothing but an excuse for Jason to kill a bunch of co-eds, this time in 3-D, so there are lots of straight-at-the-camera stabbings, impaling, popcorn popping, and balls being juggled that all looks pretty stupid when you watch it in 2-D. There are some attempts at suspense and scares that work better than the prior two films, but that's a pretty low bar. However, I did enjoy the fair amount of 80s nostalgia in the film, from vans with luxurious interior carpets, to Velcro wallets, to the fashions and hairdos. This film also seemed to be when the series started proper, with this film being the first one where Jason wears the hockey mask (Jason wasn't the killer of the first film and he wore a gunny sack in the second film). Still, if you want 80s slasher films, even though this series solidified the formula, there were quite a few knockoffs that did it much better, like ""Halloween,"" ""Torso,"" or even something like ""Sleepaway Camp.""",Friday the 13th Part III
79,mrdonleone,"no sun, no sex? yes there is sex, but no nudity",6,10 April 2009,"I am gong to try to show that part 3 is not a very scary part of the series.it must be very cool to see this movie in 3D. anyway, it was fun to watch it on a normal DVD too. but I was a bit disappointed, because Jason wasn't as creepy as I remembered he was in Friday the 13th part 3. but hey, don't forget that the first time I saw it, I was only 9 years old or something. in the world of a 9 year old, everything is creepy.but the story remains cool, just the way I remembered it. even better, because now I understand a lot of things better. like sex, for instance. if you're looking for nudity, however, this film ain't gonna please you. yes, there is somebody naked, and yes, that's a woman. so far so good, but the director doesn't show anything. you're watching her taking a shower, but you do not get to see a thing. that's stupid. why would you tingle the senses of your audience with a shower without showing anything? beside of that, the characters are cool and well performed and with good background information.but what's this with Jason? is he killed? did he got away? and what's that corpse of him we see at the end? did he get away, but die anyway? what a stupid way to end a horror movie like that. now I will have to wait until tomorrow to see part 4.conclusion: part 3 has got much drama, less horror (that's my opinion).",Friday the 13th Part III
80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid 3rd Installment to the Series,8,15 January 2020,"Picking up where the last one left off, this third installment to the franchise continues Jason Voorhees was left for dead. The official synopsis is having revived from his wound, Jason takes refuge at a cabin near Crystal Lake. As a group of co-eds arrive for their vacation, he continues his killing spree.There are a couple of things that really need to be pointed out to start this review off. The first is that this one was filmed in 3D. Now I'm not the biggest fan of 3D and I do feel that this film tries to do a lot of cheesy things with it. This doesn't ruin the film, but this is something that really stuck out to me. The other thing and the more importantly is that this is the film where Jason (Richard Booker) gets his iconic hockey mask. I know there are a lot of rumors as to who came up with this and why. Regardless, it is great that he finally gets his iconic look.As I kind of alluded to above, this film picks up what feels like the next day or recently after what happened in part 2. It shows us the scenes to fill us in before Jason attacks a couple that run a little roadside store. I do have to give this film credit in that they hide his face until he gets his mask. This was something that I felt was pretty cool as they get quite creative actually. It is also solild that he is hiding out at this cabin until the people show up and then he primarily hides out in their barn to avoid detection. One problem I had with continuity is that he was 'killed' in the previous film with taking a blow to the shoulder. We get nothing of that wound outside of the opening shot and I wasn't a fan of that.Something I will give this film credit for is the teens that show up. They all aren't fleshed out, but they do well in introducing us to the final girl Chris (Dana Kimmell). Her back-story was interesting to me in that this fills in a little bit of Jason's as well where she had a run-in with him a couple of years ago. She has had trouble returning to this cabin since then. I do have a slight issue with the what they're saying Jason tried to do, as it doesn't really fit his back-story. Also joining her is Debbie (Tracie Savage) who is pregnant, but I don't really see why that was introduced as it goes no where. Her boyfriend Andy (Jeffrey Rogers) as well as Shelly (Larry Zerner) who is a jokester that no one finds funny and his blind date Vera (Catherine Parks) all joining them on this trip. They also meet Rick (Paul Kratka) who is dating Chris. To round it out is a stoner couple as well. Shelly gets fleshed out and I'm not a fan of this character overall, as a lot of what happens is his fault.I do feel that the film is paced and edited well. The film has a running time around an hour and half. To me it really gets into pretty quickly. There's only a lull to introduce these characters before we get what we came here for, to see Jason start picking them off. I don't mind how the film ends. It brings a similar jump-scare to end it, but I didn't mind that.The acting for the film is fine. I think that Booker was a good Jason. His look was fitting, but I do have an issue that the wound from the previous film isn't in this one. I thought Kimmell was fleshed out and made a good final girl. Zerner's character is annoying, but that's what they were going for. I have to commend him how it was played. The rest of the cast really isn't fleshed out, but they are still likeable characters. I thought all of the women were easy on the eyes and makes for an enjoyed experience. I do have to call out Kratka's character. He is quite pushy with Kimmell and it comes off a little creepy. I do think part of that was the time the film was made, but I didn't care for him.As for the effects of the film, I do have a little bit of issue here. I think the deaths that we see are good. The blood was also solid. My problem isn't with the effects of the film, but with the censors. This film doesn't seem to be as heavily cut like the previous one, but enough for I wanted to see more with some of the kills. That is really my only complaint in this department.The score of the film was good. Harry Manfredi came back to do this score. I thought it was interesting that he went a little bit more electronic with this one, but I dug it. We do get more a classical score during the film's more tense moments and it definitely helps to build the tension.Now with that said, this film isn't my favorite in the series, but I think it is good. This one is iconic in that Jason gets it masked. It also picks up where the last one left off. My only issue goes back to the wound received in the previous film. I thought this one does good in introducing the characters enough where I care what happens to them. I think that Kimmell is a good final girl. Booker played a solid Jason. I do have a slight issue with the back-story, as I don't know if that necessarily fits the Jason Voorhees lore though. The editing and the pacing were both solid. Effects were cut from the film, so I can't hold that against it too much. I do think the ones we see are good though. The score was good in my opinion and helped what the film needed. As I said, this one does some good things and if you like the series, this is a must see. I feel this is a good film.",Friday the 13th Part III
81,Samiam3,Doesn't work anymore,5,12 June 2009,"Needless to say, the plot of Part III is another clone of Sean Cunningham's movie, but by now you may not care. I feel personally that three times around with the same story is one too many. It is starting to get gimmicky, and it is no longer scary. Even worse, Part III is frequently laughable. Whether it is Jason getting his hands stuck in a car window, or a blatant rip-off of 'Psycho', you cannot help but occasionally chuckle at Steve Miner's sloppy film making (no wonder he was not hired for part iv). Even the idea about how Jason gets the hockey mask is ridiculous and random. I'm guessing that Miner was probably in a store one day, saw a rack of those masks, and thought to himself, gee these things look scary, wouldn't it be great if we could integrate this into the movie. It's the little things in life (and film) that cause the big problems. Friday the 13th part III is the ideal movie to prove this point. It's not terrible, but it won't work for anyone other than die hard fans with little plastic masks and machetes.",Friday the 13th Part III
82,lastliberal-853-253708,How come you never scream when we have sex?,6,14 October 2013,"For some reason I could never really get into this film. Some have said it was as good as the first, or even that it was the best version, but I just didn't agree.I think part of it was the characters. I never could care enough about them even to wish them evil. I have to admit that the spear-gun, poker, and hammock kills were really good. Probably the best of the lot. How come the good kills were reserved for the women? Well, the popping eyeball wasn't a woman. So much for the gore. How about the nudity. Julianna Guill was great in Friday the 13th; Kirsten Baker let it all hang out in Part II, and Debi Sue Voorhees was extremely hot in Part V. In Part III, we have just Tracie Savage showing off. Pretty weak in comparison to the others.Well, I liked the ending anyway.",Friday the 13th Part III
83,ctomvelu1,Jason stumbles,5,27 October 2009,"Even without seeing it in 3D, it is evident Part 3 was shot for 3D exploitation purposes. Things, such as Jason's grubby hands and various weapons, are constantly flying at the camera. It was probably fun to watch this second sequel in 3D, although it is is one of the dullest Jason flicks in the series. Jason at the very least is finally sporting a hockey mask, but the actor playing Jason clearly was given no sharper directions than to chase after various teens and kill them. He even appears to stumble once or twice. It must be the mask. This is definitely not Kane Hodder's Jason, which had real presence. Plot-wise, there is no plot. Just poor stumbling Jason chasing after and mowing down a bunch of nitwit kids. To be fair, the supernatural, unkillable, Frankenstein-like Jason will not make his appearance for another sequel or two. But this Jason looks like a punk. After all, a slip of a girl ends up besting him. Still, any Jason flick is better than all of the HALLOWEEN sequels strung together.",Friday the 13th Part III
84,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"It's beginning to not make sense anymore,....",4,13 March 2015,"Like many franchise starters back in the 1980s, most of them always seemed to find a home in the horror genre. The 1980s were a big time for theaters to capitalize on the slasher craze that was going on at the time. The best known being Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Michael Myers and of course Jason Vorhees. All of which these particularly iconic characters had significant entrances respectively. Yet it seems as if so far they all managed to decrease in quality as their subsequent sequels were put into production. Of course not every entry was the same, but at some point the facts in the story began to either contradict itself or totally deny its previous installment. Why haven't these famous production studios paid attention to their competitions' mistakes? Of course, the reason is to make money but really?Like many other third movies to a series, most people end up seeing the flaws and begin to know that the series has run its course. Then again, Part III to this series serves an even more mixed bag than Part II but without being extremely frustrating to watch. The story for this new opening takes place two days after the last movie by showing the aftermath of Part II (interesting how it already contradicts itself by taking place on Sunday the 15th). Here, the audience is introduced to another new set of stock camp characters. Leading the group is Chris (Dana Kimmel) a girl who's trying to confront her fear of returning to the camp (not Crystal Lake) where she had a frightening encounter with Jason. Aside from this particular reason, there isn't much a plot besides this. The writing provided by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson obviously did not think that much of a story was needed. Sadly, more is required though. A good question is what was Jason doing when he ran into Chris? Not explained.Kitrosser and Watson also included two other characters in the group who sounded like they were going to be developed but weren't. These two characters belong to Larry Zerner as Shelly and Catherine Parks as Vera. At the beginning they were supposed to be hitched and do try to get to know each other, but their arc is so short the audience cannot establish an attachment to them. The rest of the characters are the typical bunch seen before. You have the two that are just joining so they can run off and have sex, then there are the drug addicts and even a punk biker gang. It doesn't get more 80s than that. Another gaping issue in the story is the transformation of Jason Vorhees and his newly unexplained powers. In a matter of days, we went to what was a young teen looking for revenge to what is a massive hulking monster (played by Richard Brooker)? How'd he get so large? Also the fact that he is now depicted as a superhuman brings into question how he attained these abilities. Where is that ""writing"" you guys are credited for?Even more embarrassing is that director Steve Miner, who directed Part II didn't see a need to do anything differently either. The other two factors that do not work are its cinematography and the point of being a horror film. The cinematography provided by Gerald Feil is just another repetition of prior DPs' work to the last two films. There are lots of POV shots, perhaps too many. The way Feil tried to get 3D shots was somewhat okay but also looked forced too. Lastly, the film just isn't scary anymore. There were so many false jump scares and the amount of times somebody asked ""who's there?"" became more obnoxious than creepy. There are only a few areas that work to this film's credit. The biggest note is the same for every viewer - we all learn where Jason got his mask. Since that is the thing everyone associates him with, that is important.Of all the ""protagonists"", Dana Kimmel as the main lead is again the only character to really stand out. This reason stands alone because she has a connection (although weak) with Jason. Another good aspect are the kills which run between already used but also new. Like previous films, the kills are gruesome and would surely hurt if it happened to you. However, just the fact that it's Jason as a massive force the impact of each murder feels that much stronger. This doesn't let him get away with the mistakes in continuity. The final aspect to the movie that continues to work in its favor as best as it can be is composer Harry Manfredini's score. For the most of the composition, Manfredini keeps the tone and atmosphere the same with minor alterations. The biggest difference is in the main title which substitute strings for synth keyboard. This is the only subtle change though. It's not adding any layers of thoughtful writing to its ongoing series of entries and this is where it begins to not make any sense. The writers completely ignored Jason's backstory and hardly develop its main cast. Instead, a flimsy coincidence is thrown in just to have a reason for Jason to appear. The only components that try to help this mess of an installment are the revealing of Jason's final form, the music and somewhat creative kills. It's slightly worse than Part II.",Friday the 13th Part III
85,justin-fencsak,This movie is pretty darn good.,10,13 September 2019,"A killer disco theme at the beginning and the end, plus the intro of Jason's iconic hockey mask. It's also the first movie in the franchise to be shot in scope as opposed to the first two which were shot in flat ratio and also the only one to be shot in 3d, not the current 3d but the red and blue 3d that was part of the 1980's fad that was revived for a short time and ended with Starchaser.",Friday the 13th Part III
86,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Slow going, but it picks up in the third act",7,3 September 2004,"This is almost a carbon copy of part two: another bunch of campers go to a farm house near Camp Crystal Lake, on Sunday the 15th, where they're mostly done in by an unseen killer (who is never once mentioned by name) - one of them acts and even looks like the hero character from part two. The group almost runs over a bad attempt to replace ""Crazy Ralph"" from parts I and II, perhaps they should have. One of this bunch is a practical joke playing goofball who wears a hockey mask right before getting killed, and Jason, needing a replacement for his burlap sack from part two, decides to try it on, and gets his hockey mask for the first time here in this movie. And for the second Friday the 13th movie in a row, there is VW bug used throughout. The climax, which rips off both Friday the 13th parts one and two, is good, as our heroine axes Jason in his head, but the film goes on for two scenes too long, with a ridiculous deus ex machina (involving a biker who was shown getting hacked to bits coming back to life to intervene in Jason's attack on the girl) followed by an equally weird encounter with Jason's mother. The real attraction to this one was probably the 3D effects, but the 3D effects aren't really that good. They basically amount to nothing more than people pointing at the camera, handing cigarettes towards the camera etc. It's obvious that they didn't have any new ideas with this one, so they just basically remade the second film, only with a more light hearted tone throughout. This has probably the most likable characters in the series, even this film's Cheech and Chong clones weren't that bad, and again, for the most part, the ending is good, too. Part III isn't as intense as the first two were, and doesn't have the darker tone of the first two, but it's still a worthwhile.",Friday the 13th Part III
87,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Into the third dimension! ""Friday the 13th Part III"" is cheeky, cheesy fun, especially with its amusing use (and often misuse) of 3D!",7,11 August 2016,"If my reviews for the previous two ""Friday the 13th"" films seemed overly critical, it's mainly because I know how much fun the franchise can be at its high points and I firmly do believe that those first two films are among the lesser-entries of the series. They're important for starting and building up the mythos. And they are definitely notable in the world of horror. But still... they can just never quite measure up to the insane meta-fun of ""Jason Lives."" Or the dopey thrills of ""Freddy VS Jason.""But ""Friday the 13th Part III""? (Also sometimes known as ""Friday the 13th 3D"") This is one of the good ones!Director Steve Miner returns to captain the ship once again this time around, as Jason survives his devastating injury seen at the end of Part 2 and returns to Crystal Lake to hunt down a new group of friends who have arrived to vacation for the weekend. The blood flows red, limbs are sliced away, skulls are smashed into oblivion... now in glorious, dated 1980's 3D!Oh, and the cherry on the top? Jason finally gets his trademark hockey-mask! Huzzah! (Which ain't spoiling anything, trust me.)Part of the great joy of this film is the obvious giddiness of the production. The pacing is quick, there's a lot more attention placed on humor and jokes, the gore is ramped up and director Miner revels in the new ways that the 3D imagery can augment the image on- screen. It's just so charming to see what is obviously a director having a blast exploiting the technology available to him as much as he can. Miner seems like a kid in a candy shot behind the camera in this entry.And on the 3D. It's oh-so-gimmicky to the point of being absolutely delicious. It's used so much that it becomes frankly hilarious, with every-other-shot throwing something right in your face. While this may sound frustrating, when placed in the context of the 1980's, it does have a very endearing nostalgic quality. It's a wonderful little time-capsule of what was ""cool"" and ""hip"" back in the day, and the fun memories it brings up add even more to the charm-factor that the movie oozes all too often. (And yes, I did say a horror movie about a psycho undead-killer is charming. Because it is. Very much so.)The script is also pretty darned swell this time, and it is easily and by far the best-written entry of the series until the wonderfully self-aware Part VI. The pacing is near-perfect. There's a lot of really good elements and through-lines that run the course of the film and give it a very solid foundation. And it boasts the best- written characters... perhaps of the whole franchise. You know you did a good job writing a generic slasher movie when the obvious annoying jokester character Shelly (Larry Zerner) actually manages to make you root for him when he ""defeats"" a group of biker- bullies... and then tugs at your heart-strings a bit when we see him crestfallen after learning his crush might not like him the way he likes her.All this praise being said, it's not a perfect film. The first act is a bit slow to start with a few too many gags that feel contrary to the later portions of the film. Some of the effects are cheesy to the point of taking you out of the film. (I'll just say keep an ""eye out"" for one particularly bad gore-gag.) And while it is entertaining, I could definitely see some audience members being turned off by the constant ""3D comin' at ya!"" shots.But all in all, I think ""Friday the 13th Part III"" is one of the better entries in the franchise. It's the first one to really embrace the idea of being horror-as-entertainment instead of just horror-as-horror. And it's a great little dose of 80's cheese.I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part III
88,m-47826,3D sequel curse...,1,14 July 2020,"Studios were just trying too hard. Very few movies worked in that format. And as it was 3D, it had to have more of everything, even when it made the script lack of substance. In this movie's case, it was just a pretext to have a Friday the 13th in 3D, before the appeal wears off. And all I got from it, was how everything else was overlooked or simply botched, to release the movie as soon as possible. It is bad. Agreed, some serious issues are somehow addressed (?). Only the lack of quality, makes this prospect pointless and ineffective. I'm not a big fan of this franchise. And don't really see why, so many sequels were made out of it. But this one, is proof movies should always be thought out properly, and not made to « make money ».",Friday the 13th Part III
89,rivertam26,Fun and trashy,7,8 March 2020,"There's so much I love about this movie. It's definitely a step up from the last. The setup is the same as Jason targets a new group of druggie, horny teens but this time in 3D. The kills are great. The eye popping scene is the best and the effort put into the 3D effects is really impressive and goofy. From the get go I absolutely loved the disco theme. The acting is pretty bad but in a fun campy way. The final girl is mostly useless but hilarious as she faces Jason down. I love the bikers and the movie is overly entertaining and highly successful mostly because it's not aiming very high.

90,Analog_Devotee,9/10 -- HIGHLY UNDERRATED AMONG THE HORROR COMMUNITY AND EVEN DIEHARD F13 FANS.,9,11 June 2021,"There was definitely a period of time when this was my most rewatched film of the Friday the 13ths, and possibly my favorite. This flick isn't just underrated as far as slashers go -- even some seemingly diehard fans of the franchise will throw shade on this gem.Sorry, but I don't share your sentiment.This flick is an absolute blast from start to finish. This was when things were beginning to become a little goofy; slashers were embracing the cheese and using it to their advantage. (Some of them, anyway, and this flick was one of the early adopters.)I rank this at #3 in my ranking list of the franchise behind Parts 4 and 6. Yeah, I even put it above the original and the first sequel. I think Part 2 is definitely near-peak suspense slasher, but I can't help it, Part 3 here is just so much fun. Jason gets his iconic mask, Shelley acts like a nut, and the teens all feel much more unique (which would be a taste of things to come in Part 4, where we get our best set of teens in the entire franchise).Even the 3D holds up, in my opinion. It looks dated? Speak for yourself. To me, it looks like icing on top of an already delicious cake.I still pop this one in all the time, and I've yet to see the same film all the negative reviewers see. I just see a good time.",Friday the 13th Part III

The cast is the least inspiring I've seen so far, even if Shelly's pranks and how that eventually works out, is good fun. The leather gang is hilarious in a bad way (or perhaps good, I'm still undecided), the love interest for Dana Kimmell's character is a boring log, and the girls are pretty, but lack character. The opening with the quarreling couple feels out of place. The setting is not a summer camp, but a farm, and rather disappointing.

92,capkronos,A slight improvement over Part 2,6,24 February 2004,"Some well directed shock scenes, intentional humor and likeable characters make this an improvement over the previous one and, yeah, more people die real good. This one starts with clips from Part 2 (featuring Amy Steel) to let viewers know that Jason (Richard Brooker) is still alive. Then eight people (not camp counselors) travel via van to Camp Crystal Lake, encounter a bum who warns them in vain and end up eating a bag of pot when the cops pull up behind them. When they get to their cabin, some punks harass them and Jason shows up to kill everyone. And that's all she wrote, though at least the heroine (Dana Kimmell) has a little more common sense than usual and fights Jason with a knife, axe, log and shovel. Cast is mediocre at best...Supposedly, the 3-D theater effects were among the best ever created, with harpoon, pitchfork, knife, sewing needle, fire poker and, yes even a yo-yo, thrusting at the viewer.

Shelly accidentally has a run-in with a biker gang, who will soon face Jason's wrath. Some of the kills were pretty cool, but some are pretty corny because it was filmed in 3D.

95,Maciste_Brother,Stultifyingly Awful!,1,1 June 2001,"The ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" films have never been mistaken as quality film-making but even so the first two Friday films, as derivative as they were, were at least okay. Passably competent. Not so with ""FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 : 3D""! This ""film"" is so amateurish it's stunning. The acting from everyone is cringe worthy. Okay, the acting in the other two first FRIDAYS wasn't stellar too but in FT13P3, they spend loads of time on the actors acting and everyone is painfully bad. Imagine Soap Opera level of acting but 10 times worse! Yep, it's that bad. Coupled with the nails-to-the-board dialogue, having to watch these losers for what seems to be an eternity is akin to torture. Dana Kimmell wins the award of most expressions in a single scene: she's inquisitive, introspective, contemplative, sad, happy, giddy, sassy, sexy, in love, plucky, shocked, terrified in one 60 second stretch of film! Image having to watch her for 90 minutes. Another truly annoying thing about her is she often talks to herself (""I don't know what kind of games you guys are playing but I don't like it"", she says with a pout). The flashback scene alone is worthy of the ""worst acted scene ever"" award. And to make things even more dreadful (as if the latter wasn't enough), Kimmell is peppered with an endless series of false scares, something like 15 or 20 false scares! And that doesn't include the other false scares the other characters are subjected to. And when Kimmell screams, and she screams a lot, she sometimes sounds like she's having an orgasm. The mind boggles!Like all slashers epics, the characters are just types: the cute and perky virgin (Kimmell), the horny young hunk, the pot smoking hippie, the fat nerd who likes to play pranks. And most annoying of all, the Mae West like sexy broad (she looks like Jennifer Aniston) who talks with a low voice and always dispenses ""witty"" repartee (""Was it you, me or the hammock?""). BTW, she's also pregnant, making her the first pregnant ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" victim to be skewered by Jason. Nice, huh?The subplot of the biker gang is just padding (and more stupid victims for Jason to butcher). The scene at the store where the two youngsters meets the three gang members is terrible. The disco version of the ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" theme playing in the background doesn't help. Where's Jason when you REALLY need him? Quick, kill them now, not later! One of the actors playing a biker looks like Scott Thompson. It's hilarious.This is supposed to be a horror flick and yet it's not scary for one second. A bored looking Jason dispenses his victims with all the enthusiasm of a janitor duly killing cockroaches infesting his sector. Watching Jason repeatedly killing these ""types"" is excruciatingly dull. It's anti-horror. It doesn't elicit shock, horror or even suspense. It's as compelling as watching someone working on a factory line and with quotas to fill. There are only two good ""money shots"" in FT13P3, the one where the guy walks on his hands gets chopped between the legs and the scene where the ""hispanic"" girl gets a harpoon in the eye. Even without the 3D, these scenes are effective. But the rest is a total waste of time! Many of the killings don't even make any sense and the multiple ""surprise"" ending is pure schlock.""FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3"" is so bad, without even realizing it, it's a true post-modern creation. Every scene is so clichéd or badly acted or derivative or choreographed workman-like to nth degree that one can easily take the whole film apart like a puzzle and rearrange the order of the scenes, extend them, loop them, or simply let them stand on their own and it wouldn't make any difference. Some scenes are pure minimalism with nothing but a character calling out another character's name for several minutes (Andy... Andy...Andy?). And because FT13P3 was originally shot in 3D, many scenes start or end with or are simply about objects being propelled at the audience (wow a yo-yo!), making for pointless moments. And the look of the film, grainy and really ugly and plastic throughout (most likely due to the type of lighting needed for the 3D effect) only makes the whole thing even more fantastically bad.",Friday the 13th Part III
96,gedikreverdi,He finally finds his iconic hockey mask,8,12 October 2021,"I extremely enjoyed this sequel! The characters were really likable especially Shelly the prankster. The kill count is also pretty high. He slashed the three biker gang at the barn, Shelley and his date Vera,the lovers on the hammock upstairs, the pothead couple and Chris the final girl and her boyfriend Rick. Jason squeezes his head until his eyes came out and it was so iconic. And he threw his body thru the window and I think this is one of the scenes that I happened to see when I was a kid and was kinda traumatized. Chris the final girl hanged him at the pulley system in front of the barn and the jumpscare at this moment was so impressive. And then she hit him with an axe in the head and it got stuck in his skull. And that legendary scene at the end of the first scene re-enacted with probably Jason's mother coming out of the lake and attacking Chris on the boat.",Friday the 13th Part III
97,baumer,Trivia question: what is the name of the guy that Jason gets the mask from?,9,25 June 1999,"There are very few horror films that are like Halloween ( the first one ) and Nightmare on Elm Street ( the first one ). That is, horror films that not only scare, but have a good story and great direction. Steve Miner is obviously not in the same league as Carpenter and Craven, but what he does manage to do is make an effective sequel that is much scarier than the first and next to the final chapter, it is the best and scariest among all the Fridays.This film is laughable in parts, especially in terms of continuity with some of the stories that are told by Chris, but having said that, Steve Miner makes a very atmospheric and very tense film.The film starts off the day after part two ended. We know Jason is still alive because he kills two disgusting people at the beginning that at least establishes Miner's style to come for the rest of the movie. The false scares, the open doors with no one there, the strange noises, the missing props that the character knows she had just a few seconds ago. The beginning is very well done. But again, the continuity and stupidity of movie characters is at all an all time high here. ( A quick example: Harold is about 5'6, rotund and clumsy. His wife calls out his name when she sees a well built figure standing behind her sheets at night. This figure is at least 6 feet or more in height and he looks squared, not pear shaped like her husband Harold. Plus, on the television is the news about the massacre the night before saying that the killer has not been caught. DUUUHHH!! Should this not click into her brain that who she is seeing may be Jason? )But what is excellent about this film are some of the same elements that made Halloween good. And that is the use of foreground for false scares. There are numerous times when the camera scans the for-ground and you are so sure that Jason is going to show up, and then he doesn't until whammo, someone loses an eye or their life. It is very effective. There are also numerous shots of Jason in the background waiting for his next victim to turn around to see him. And when we see him standing behind one stoner guy, his pure size really makes him menacing. And that mask....How he gets the mask is one of the great trivia questions in Friday the 13th folklore.Steve Miner did a masterful job of directing and why he decided to hand the reins over to Joseph Zito for the final chapter is a mysteryAs Fridays go, this is one that you can't go wrong with. It also has ( I believe ) one of the five most gruesome and painful deaths in the series. Watch for Andy walking on his hands, it will make you cringe for quite a while.Edit: The new remastered edition in 3-D is worth seeing. I found the 3-D to be entertaining in some parts and lacklustre in others, but there is some added footage in the deluxe edition. You get to see more of Fox hanging from the barn and in a truly jaw dropping moment, you get to see all of Andy, chopped up after he gets split in two walking on his hands. In the original version, you just see a glimpse of him as his blood drips onto the magazine, but now, you see his blood, his legs severed, and much more. I would say this alone makes the purchase worth it.Answer to the question: Shelly",Friday the 13th Part III

99,mentalcritic,"1D story, 1D characters, 1D acting... yeah, you can almost call it 3D!",1,19 September 2004,"I guess if you add the singular dimension for the story, characters, and acting, you get three dimensions. Aside from being (quite surprisingly) skilfully photographed in Arri's three-dimensional process, the film has very little to recommend it. Indeed, aside from the unconventional manner in which Jason X was processed, this marks the only episode in the franchise where the photography wasn't strictly by the numbers. No other FT13 director has even attempted to use the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and it is quite a surprise to see it used so effectively here.The 3D effects, to give the makers some credit, actually work well. Not in the sense that they enhance the story, but at least to the extent of giving the audience something to be entertained by. The shots of arrows, eyeballs, or yo-yos flying out of the screen are well-realized here. The wide angles, while nothing that the likes of Clint Eastwood or Sergio Leone would be impressed by, still give the film a dynamic missing from its predecessors or successors.Unfortunately, skilled photography and well-realized special effects are not enough to save a film by themselves. Without at least a good story, any film is doomed, and aside from the recent tenth installment, a good story and the FT13 franchise are mutually exclusive. The story content in this episode could have been easily written on a single leaf of A4 paper. Somehow, you have to give a director credit for being able to make ninety-four minutes of feature film out of something so patently uninteresting. Okay, eighty-seven minutes if you discount the stuff that was recycled from the previous film.The acting, as is always the case in an FT13 film, is largely reflective of the script. In other words, you'll find more interesting or convincing performances in your average grade school play. You know a film is garbage when the most memorable performance involves a man sitting on a toilet. Then again, the sound effects and dialogue involved tend to deliver a summary of the film that few other scenes can. Every bit of dialogue here is truly abominable. It seems a trademark of FT13 directors that they cannot even make a conversation about a day's work feel vaguely natural.The characters are probably the worst feature of any FT13 film, but this is an exceptional example. Try to name one unique aspect of the characters shown in this film, and you'll soon see what I mean. If there has ever been a film more reliant on stereotypes to fill character space, I have yet to see it. Probably the funniest characters in the whole film are the biker gang, and they're hardly distinguishable from the rest of the largely white-hat cast.Two stand-out features of this film, widescreen 3D photography aside, are the truly riotous disco music during the opening credits, and this being the episode in which Jason acquires the signature hockey mask. I have to say, however, that with the hilarious break-dancing motif of the opening theme, it would have suited the style a lot better if Jason had held onto the cloth bag.Not surprisingly, I gave the third FT13 film a one out of ten. They were obviously expecting that simple 3D effects would make the film. While this is supposedly the most profitable 3D film ever made (which is nothing to brag about considering how much most others have grossed), history will otherwise not remember this particular 3D film in kind terms.",Friday the 13th Part III

ARGH!-). It's just the same formula of the two previous films but in a cringe direction. The 3D element was not explored the way it could've been. At least we have some much more elaborate deaths and Jason's iconic mask.",Friday the 13th Part III
101,ODDBear,Disappointing sequel,4,18 June 2005,"Jason kills a bunch of teenagers who come to Crystal Lake. This time, one girl has already faced the monster, and she must face him again. Couldn't stay away, could she?First of all I must say that I'm a big fan of the series. The original is a classic of the genre but the sequels are hit or miss. Director Steve Miner, who did a good job on part 2, struggles a bit this time around. No doubt the fact that this film was shot with 3-D in mind helps to hinder the film's look. The extreme closeups probably looked swell in theatres back in '82 but now look kinda hokey.Pacing is rather off, as well. While Parts 1 and 2 had mostly pointless middle sections, the one here goes by rather painfully. Perhaps the fault lies mostly with the characters, here they're not interesting at all. Potentially funny moments are wasted, like the two junkies who look like they're going to provide some comedy relief but don't. The actors are way below average this time around as well. Dana Kimmell (who reportedly had some influence in downsizing the film's gore) looks pretty enough but her acting talents are mostly confined to screaming a lot. At least she does that well. Paul Kratka has to be a huge contender for the worst actor in the series, his performance is bad beyond words. I bet most people are cheering Jason on when he's crushing his skull. All others are pretty bad as well, the two junkies seem to fare best. And those bikers...pretty lame.One other thing, not really the film's fault, but rather those blasted MPAA pruners; It's drastically cut and it hurts the film badly. You can clearly see some sloppy editing at the time when some gore seems to be coming and it's terribly annoying (but this is mostly evident in the British cut of the film).But not all is bad. Once Jason gets going the film comes to life and Miner manages to extract a decent amount of suspense. The cinematography looks good in a widescreen version and it makes quite a bit of difference. Plus it's here that Jason dons the fine mask.Now, if only they'd release an unrated version of this film and maybe in it's full 3-D incarnation I'd be a happy camper.",Friday the 13th Part III

More teens, Jason in a hockey mask armed with various weapons, you connect the dots. This entry emerges as one of the duller entries, there are moments of inspired gore, such as the Head in the fridge but basically this is genre formula done without much attempt to make it suspenseful or even fun bad. Friday The 13th Part 3 did open in 3D which I missed out on and although I highly doubt that the 3D would make this entry any good it certainly must have been more watchable then it is on video. This time the action takes place in a barn and a couple of bikers show up unfortunately though this just makes for tedious going. I hated this movie.* out of 4-(Bad)",Friday the 13th Part III

But no, then the series would be over and no more franchise rights.  Oh well....""Friday the 13th Part 3"" sallies forth with more kids going out towards the lake, wandering about at night in the woods, in the water, partially dressed, basically asking for it.  Then Jason shows up and....You've seen the other movies, do the math.By the way, this version also happens to be in 3D (where available in your area.  Don't delay!), so you can see yo-yos spinning at you, flying spears, eyeballs, axe handles, pitchforks and so on.

Well, it's easier like that, should a new hulking guy take over the role next time.  What forthright thinking!  I'm in shock!It even ends on a quasi-parallel of the first ""Friday the 13th"" (How?

104,TOMASBBloodhound,3D gimmick isn't enough to save this one,5,8 December 2003,"Nobody can tell Steve Miner that he doesn't know how to direct a scary movie. After his success with part 2 of this series, this film goes down as a disappointment, however. Miner's name appears in the credits of some truly great horror classics going all the way back to Last House On the Left among others. The 3D concept of this film seems to have clouded his typically stellar vision, though.Jason is back, and this time he is bigger, stronger, and more resourceful than he has been up to this point. He trades in his overalls and gunny sack from part 2, and ushers in the era of the khaki pants, green work shirt, and of course the hockey mask for this one. Plenty of youngsters (and a threesome of bikers) get wasted with various implement tools, and even a spear gun. This film has all that you'd think it would need to be good, except something is missing.The acting is so wooden it's unbelievable. The film isn't as suspenseful as you would hope it to be, until the typical ""last female standing vs killer"" sequence where it picks up quite a bit. Jason gets the crap beat out of him as he tries to track the pretty brunette down. The conclusion is murky, just like in part 2, and it clearly left things wide open for further sequels (as intended).The main reason the film comes up short is the fact that you cannot view it in 3D on your home screen. I'm sure it looked cool in the theater, but those days are two decades past. Steve Miner's work now looks forced as he had to spend so much time setting up shots that would look good in 3D, that he didn't really have time to make the film very scary.Oh, well. It's not like this is the worst film of the series. It's just not up to par with Miner's prior effort which was excellent.5 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound p.s.: There are some extraordinarily beautiful women in this film!!",Friday the 13th Part III

In ""Friday the 13th, Part III"", more teens die, and the endless bloodshed of Jason Voorhees continues as he avenges his mothers death. This is the one where Jason wears his famous hockey mask for the first time, after he kills the previous owner and steals it of course. In the story, some bikers come into conflict with the teens that are staying at this old barn for the weekend. While there sabotaging the teens equipment, Jason enters and kills them, almost all of them. To know who he left alive, you will just have to watch it, won't you. If you do watch the movie, it is best to start at the beginning with the original ""Friday the 13th"". And the next installment is gorier, and is not ""The Final Chapter"".

106,ivo-cobra8,Surprisingly a really good an awesome sequel classic,10,24 September 2017,"Friday the 13th Part III: 3D is surprisingly a really good movie it is not a bad slasher it is a great movie like I thought it was. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my second favorite film in the franchise. This movie is the most scariest of all of them. The first time I watch it as a kid I was scared to death of the film. The first time and the second time around I hated it but now surprisingly watching third time around I enjoy it. The 3D thing was really a bad idea but the plot and the story was really good and I like the cast. This was the second sequel that it was directed by Steve Miner. I have fun with it and I have enjoy it I love this movie to death and it come closer to my heart. It is now my third favorite Friday the 13th film and it was really hard to decide because I like almost all of them except 2 films I hated but the rest 10 films I liked a lot. Dana Kimmell as Chris Higgins the final girl and the heroine was a bad-ass and really beautiful and the cutest girl actually she was little better then Amy Steel in Part 2 tough I love Amy Steel. Richard Brooker did really great as Jason Voorhees, R.I.P. he is really missed and he really did a great performance. The movie has also a biker gang in here in which Jason kills them one by one. Nick Savage was good as the leader Ali he was knocked by Jason, but on the end of the film he saved Chris from Jason, in which Jason cuts his hand. We had a good kills good death scenes and I really think in my opinion it is better then Part 2. Many fans has stated that this film copy's Part I and II, I disagree with that that is not true! It is a true sequel to part 1 and 2 and it strictly loyally follows the formula from first movie. I love the boat scene on the end in which Pamela Voorhees attacks Chris and run her over the boat on the lake, that scene was fantastic. Yes it was similar scene from the first movie in which young Jason jumps over and run over Alice on the lake this is just the opposite of the film I loved that.I love that Jason Voorhees dons his iconic hockey mask for the first time and I know the movie doesn't show Jason putting ice hockey mask on his head. But we see Shelly (Larry Zerner) with a harpoon spear gun in his hands and ice hockey mask then in next scenes we see Shelly going to the barn and later we find Shelly with a slashed neck that's how Jason got his mask he take it from Shelly. The final showdown between the heroine--one Chris (Danna Kimmell) of the cutest and most likable in the whole series and Jason (Richard Brooker)--it is excellent and great well done executed. Chris slams an axe in Jason's head right in the mask that's scene blow me away.I love also the actors beside Danna Kimmell and Richard Brooker in here that did really a well done job as the supporting cast: Catherine Parks, Larry Zerner they were great couple. Gloria Charles, Paul Kratka, Cheri Maugans, Kevin O'Brien and Nick Savage I love this cast in here. I love the atmosphere in this movie it is more windy and no it is not set in the summer it is set in autumn it feels more autumn time. Dana Kimmell is a tough sexy girl and she doesn't get scared of Jason she kicked his ass twice and I have enjoyed this movie I love it. The music score and 3D effect were a little cheese in my opinion but the movie surprisingly I loved it and it is a classic movie to me! Allan A. Apone did a great special make effects for Jason and I like some of the kills and the eyed balls also this movie does not have so much sex scenes unlike part 2 has but it is way better then Part 2. R.I.P. Richard Brooker, Gloria Charles, Steve Susskind, Perla Walter and David Wiley you are all missed. Score: 10/10 get's my score Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval it is my second favorite film in the franchise and it did not failed me I love it to death. To me is a classic sequel I love 80's horror movies and this one is really a suspenseful good movie.",Friday the 13th Part III
107,eminkl,"Sloppy and poorly made, like many of the era's horror movies, but also oddly charming for many of the same reasons",5,18 April 2020,"Continued Crystal Lake bloodletting, now with 100% more hockey mask. Characterization has improved from the pitiful showing in Part 2, but that's close to the textbook definition of a backhanded compliment. We still endure some painfully awkward social interactions and idiotic decisions from the cast, and linger too long in their dry, boring daylight scenes. The series has moved past the camp counselor-as-victim model, though it doesn't seem to make much of a difference: these generic teenagers don't behave much differently. Jason continues to be omnipresent, basically signifying a transition point between every scene. Time to move our perspective into the bedroom? Well, let's just cram a shadowy figure or heavy work boot into the end of the preceding shot. Don't forget the trademarked stalking/heavy breathing melody. His problems with closing the deal also persist: the guy is downright psychic for the first dozen kills, but when the number of survivors drops to one or two, all of a sudden he can't get out of his own way. Sloppy and poorly made, like many of the era's horror movies, but also oddly charming for many of the same reasons.",Friday the 13th Part III
108,fernandoschiavi,"Redundant and without much to add, this is the weakest film in the series so far, which in just three films already manages to exhaust the formula",6,6 September 2021,"Again betting on that serial touch, the plot starts by reminding us of the climax of the previous film, but this time it has no connection with the events of this new film - so I imagine the producers put it there simply to fill in the duration, let the viewers settle into their seats and buy their popcorn. Part III finally takes us out of the camp to put us.... In a country house, which will house a new group of teenagers who arrive there for a peaceful vacation. Of course, it doesn't take long for the body count to begin once assassin Jason Voorhees (played here by Richard Brooker) starts his kill.Jason begins his killing by a couple who are watching the news about the slaughter on TV. The masked man's revenge had already taken place, after all, he had already killed the girl who cut off his mother's head. But here, Jason, no longer cares about that and becomes a killing machine, eliminating anyone who crosses his path. In this third part, a group of young people decide to go to the country house of one of their friends, which is, obviously, on the outskirts of the crystal lake. The film takes a long time to come into gear, it spends a long time showing the relationship of the group of friends, all with the old stereotypes: a couple who only thinks about sex, one of stoners, the housewife traumatized by a previous encounter with Jason and her boyfriend; the ugly chubby one, who makes jokes without grace to draw attention, as well as the girl who would be his company, but ignores him. There is still room for a gang of bikers, who enter the plot only to die at Jason's hands. The justification for so many irregularities in this sequence is the same as so many others involving films made in a hurry to earn more, among other arguments.This part is explicitly a repetition of the structure of the previous ones. This time, the screenwriting duo Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson even try to work and develop their characters, offering some dramatic arcs, like Chris (Dana Kimmell), final girl once she has a reasonably good scene about a traumatic event involving her country. Similarly, we follow the subplot of Shelly (Larry Zerner), playing the typical chubby boy with low self-esteem who tries to win over a cute classmate. On paper, this would work acceptably, but the entire cast is uniformly lousy.Here, the suspense is on one side and the plot descends into violence. Towards his 50 minutes of projection, Jason appears again and starts attacking, starting with the biker gang - the deaths start soft, off-screen - then with the young people who were in the house. Among the good scenes, one can point out the death of the boy who loved to walk around planting a banana tree, having his end in a meeting with Jason in the hallway. There is also the scene where the killer first appears wearing the famous hockey mask and hits the victim in the eye with a harpoon. About the mask, it should be noted that it became his trademark during the films that would follow. And as it could not be missing in the series, in the end there is a survivor to face the immortal killer, stabbing him, hanging him until finally giving him an ax in the head, leaving a mark that would be seen in other productions. Today is no longer a surprise, but the filmmakers insisted on leaving the audience with a question: did Jason really die, or would he come back to continue his killing?There is no new exploration or expansion of Jason Voorhees mythology, and Pamela Voorhees doesn't even appear here (if we ignore that pointless jump scare in the last scene), but Part III is famous for being the first movie in the series where Jason earns his iconic hockey mask. In what could only be a happy accident, during a lighting test it was decided that Jason would need to cover his face in this new movie, and one of the team members had a bag full of hockey supplies, including a Detroit Red Wings mask. The rest is history, as we well know. The mask ended up becoming the great symbol of the series, and even though this new movie is irregular, it is still exciting to see the killer appearing with his face covered for the first time.After the kill sequences (which involve a guy ""torn in half"" by Jason while walking upside down, or another guy who has one of his eyes popping out of his socket with Jason pressing down on his head), we have the girl final showdown. Chris and Jason. The final duel takes place in the barn, where Jason is hanged, but survives to be killed shortly thereafter with an ax blow to the head from Chris. Indeed, this is one of the tensest scenes and the climax of the film. In the end, like the survivor of the first film, Chris escapes by boat across the lake and sleeps until dawn. Upon waking up, she sees the mask less assassin running towards the lake to attack her, when out of nowhere comes out of the water... Jason's mother! This part of the movie is quite confusing, as soon after we see Chris with the police, Jason's body in the barn, still with the mask and ax on his head, making it clear that it was a hallucination. But then why use Jason's mom in this scene if she didn't appear during the movie? And wasn't her head separated from her body in the previous movie? Is this scene just an homage to the original movie? The purpose was not clear, and the film ends anyway.In terms of direction, we have Steve Miner abandoning several of Cunningham's ways and moving towards something more traditional. The camera leaves in POV, enters the infamous jump scare, exacerbated by the intense soundtrack by Harry Manfredini - who happily abandons Bernard Herrmann's sucking chords for Psycho, and uses the original theme of the first film well to create suspense. But what strikes the most, negatively, is that this movie was released in 3D during its release time, so we have a lot of laughable framing where some character takes an object towards the camera, especially when Jason approaches to stab someone.The director takes the opportunity to honor the first film in several scenes. In one of them, she repeats the modus operandi Jason's mother used against Kevin Bacon, hiding behind the bed and cutting a knife through the victim's chest. Like Mother like son. To further refer to the makeup talent, he made the victim, shortly before dying, to be reading a Fangoria, in an article about Tom Savini, the makeup master. Another tribute takes place in the last scene, when, instead of young Jason jumping over the survivor in the lake, here who jumps out of the water is the corpse of Pamela Voorhees.The film manages to create good tension moments, gives us characters we can easily care about, and is the genesis of the most famous hockey mask in the world. But its greatest merit is perhaps to answer the question at the beginning of this text. Jason is scary not because of any outstanding quality, but because he is the incarnation of death. Every appearance of the character, every close-up on the mask, every camera takes in which he appears gives us the certainty that someone is going to die. Jason, in this movie, is still not the extremely powerful zombie he has become in the last few films in the franchise. His appearance is more human and no less disturbing. A psychopath, a child frail in an adult's body, a cold and bloodthirsty killer. There is no purpose in his actions, and that is what is frightening.As far as aspects of film language are concerned, Friday the 13th Part 3 is more of the same. The set design that evokes isolation and fear has already become commonplace in this third episode. Harry Manfredini's soundtrack has been better. The opening music is, to say the least, unpleasant and bizarre. Framing and camera movement are not part of the concern of those involved in the film, given that the focus is on killing in the most creative way in each sequence. Allan A. Apone's makeup doesn't disappoint, but it's well below expectations compared to Tom Savini's exceptional work on the first film. The script is the great villain. How to accept gross continuity problems like Jason's physiognomy, played by the competent Richard Brooker? For a plot that starts the day after the second film, the producers should have been more concerned with these small details. The hands, nails, hair, in short, the whole concept of the character is very far away and makes everything very absurd.With more interesting deaths than the previous chapter, the ending is quite satisfying, as well as being much more tense, because the location is smaller and more claustrophobic - it takes place in the barn, and it's not just a chase into the woods. It is interesting to note that this chapter is, in general, one of the least appreciated by many fans of the series or horror movies in general. Friday the 13th - Part 3 is the franchise's first downfall. Redundant and without much to add, this is the weakest film in the series so far, which in just three films already manages to exhaust the formula. However, the encouragement is that Jason Voorhees was for the first time complete, gaining his iconic look and embracing the film style that would finally come to fruition.",Friday the 13th Part III

The plot setting is not the Crystal Lake camp anymore but the surroundings, also in the countryside and in the woods of course (in spite of not being in the camp the setting is very similar). The characters, the suspense, the soundtrack, the deaths and even the clichés are pretty much the same. I would mention two deaths: the one in the lake when JASON shot a girl in the eye with an arrow, and when he slice a guy which was standing with his feet up in two.

Before that, it looks, feels and acts way too much alike the two predecessors, and there's few things to enjoy except three local hoodlums who gets mixed up with farming. The kills are occasionally homaging the first film, but gladly we get a couple of memorable blood-sprouts; the aforementioned harpoon-kill (arguably the finest in the series so far) and country boy getting his head smashed before being thrown through a window. Friday the 13th Part 3 is arguably the best so far, solely because Jason puts on the famous mask and starts fumbling and jumbling through the forest.",Friday the 13th Part III
111,acidburn-10,Brainless popcorn fun with the iconic hockey mask,9,7 July 2015,"This was actually the 4th Friday movie I ever saw as a kid, my local video shop had part 1, 2 and 8, but didn't have any more. A friend of mine had this on video and I was so desperate to own it that I bought it off him for £13 quid out of my pocket money and never looked back. I just loved it and even though I was already a fan of the series, seeing Jason get his infamous hockey mask for the first time just made me smile and just watched it over and over again.Well where do I start, for all those familiar with 1 and 2, then this one will come as no surprise and has all the right ingredients that makes this series work and viewing it again as a grown up, I do view it differently that I used to, I still love it though, even though it's not quite as perfect as I remember it. Firstly the 3D elements just too gimmicky and not used to full effect, and were just a blatant attempt for money grabbing and everything else like story and character development took a back seat. But some of the kill shots were pretty cool.The opening disco music scene which gets a lot of complaints, but personally I love it and justs adds to the cheese factor. But there a few small elements that don't work like the flashback to where Chris got attacked, just seemed muddled and not fully explored and was just thrown in to add more to the thin plot and just felt unnecessary. Then there's the dream sequence ending which just felt rushed and after some research I found out that it was just filmed because they couldn't go with the original intended downbeat ending where the survivor has her head chopped off, which would have been cool, but sadly didn't happen.But the positive aspects like I already said the iconic hockey mask was a genius touch to the proceedings and the death scenes are really cool we getting the eye popping scene which was awesome, spear gun in the eye and a guy chopped in half while doing a handstand was again brilliant. Even though the acting was quite to the level of the first 2 there were still some pretty decent performances. Larry Zerner who plays Shelly is one of the more developed and lovable characters in the franchise, Dana Kimmell plays one of the best final girls in the series, she proves more than a match for Jason, the 80's punks were hit and miss, plus the stoner characters just seemed to be there for the body count, but Richard Brooker who plays Jason definitely stands out as one of the best, bringing a hulking menacing, but human vibe to the character.All in all Friday The 13th Part 3 definitely ranks one of the best in the franchise, just don't expect any substance, it's just brainless popcorn fun with some cool killings.",Friday the 13th Part III
112,Darkside-Reviewer,Beware the barn!,5,10 July 2020,"Friday the 13th part 3 continues the killing spree of Jason Voorhees who in this movie is cemented as the franchises killer and would become an icon in the horror/slasher movie genre. In this movie Jason obtains his famous hockey mask that would become so synonymous with the Jason Voorhees character and the Friday the 13th franchise making Friday the 13th part 3 one of the most important and memorable movies in the franchise.The story if you can call it that is pretty simple the movie shows a repeat of the ending of the previous Friday the 13th movie (part 2) showing that Jason survived his wounds. Then Jason returns to kill more horny, pot smoking teenagers in some new twisted and fun ways.Friday the 13th part 3 was originally a 3D theatrical release which was pretty ambitious for a horror/slasher movie made in the 1980s and was probably pretty enjoyable in 3D for those who got to see the movie on the big screen in 1982. The 2D version of the movie is the version most audiences are familiar with but you can watch the movie in 3D on the DVD and Blu Ray releases of the movie but you would need a pair of red/blue 3D glasses and a vomit bag handy due to the terribly dated blurry 3D effects that on a modern day TV make your screen look like you accidentally sat on your remote and accidentally turned the colour setting on your TV to vomit green and bright red.One of the worst things about watching this movie is because the movie was originally filmed to be in 3D all the ""special effects"" for the 3D are still in the movie but with no 3D so there a lot of scenes of things jumping out towards the camera or things being held close to the camera lens for example one scene in the movie has a fake snake jump out at the screen and you can see the fake rubber snake and the string it's attached too it's hard to take a horror/slasher movie seriously after seeing a man run away in terror from rubber snake I was still laughing at the crappy effects when he was eventually killed five minutes later.There are still some enjoyable things about this Friday the 13th such as one the characters named Shelly who is probably one the most likable characters in the franchise and there are some pretty memorable kills some are remembered for there bad special effects and some are just awsome and bloody.Friday the 13th part 3 is certainly worth watching if your a fan of classic horror/slasher movies that are filled with cheesy dialogue, sex, pot and bloody murder.",Friday the 13th Part III

Chris unfortunately has bad memories from two years ago about encountering a strange disfigured man who attacked her but she survived as she has returned back to the cabin to get rid of the bad memories, now the maniac is out for blood including her's.A gory and entertaining entry of the classic F13 saga! this is the movie that finally gave Jason Voorhees his trademark hockey mask that re-established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 did a great directing job on this excellent installment with shocks, gore, some laughs and decent acting.

Again, we have a sex crazed couple, the boyfriend who likes to walk on his hands, more than his knees. Then we a red headed, movie freak/aspiring actor who likes masks to hide his plain features, and their female friend, Chris, returning to the scene of the crime, haunted by her recollections of the never dying Jason Voorhees. Chris meets her old boyfriend Derek, back up at the lake who tries to get her through this tough time. And then we have the slashings and the mutations by our lovable Jason, and this includes a middle aged couple at the start, running a market, the woman actress apparently used to date David Caruso at one stage. Yeah, believe it. We also have three bikers who our teen loving spirits clash with, but like all the others, all these three of course meet their demise. I loved the two hippies, Chuck and Chilli, that rode with our teenies, they were probably the only saving grace. I loved it especially when they smoked up their van.

As we get accustomed to the setting and the characters, the killing starts.This is the sequel which introduced 3D into the series.

The only thing different in this one is that he finally gets the Hockey Mask in this film. Although, I would imagine this was awesome to see in a 3-D viewing.  Before seeing this film, and the previous two, I had always thought that the Hockey Mask was something that had been with the series since the beginning.  I was completely shocked to learn that he didn't acquire the hockey mask until the 3rd installment.  All in all, it was just another Jason-slasher film.  Unless your just curious (as I was) what this film is about, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it.  And even if you are interested, go see the previous two films first.  If you do somehow make it to the 3rd installment of this series, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Friday the 13th Part III
120,raypdaley182,"Again, awful",1,13 October 2007,"As before this starts where the previous film ended but not quite exactly. The start here differs to allow you to see ""Jason"" (sorry, he died as a child in the 1st movie so this isn't him) as still alive.The newscaster tells us 8 bodies were found (I only counted 7 murders that I could remember from my review of pt 2), as they were saying the assistant was the only person to live (so they forgot about the boss and the guy who was left at the bar and the dog).1st dead is a totally innocent shopkeeper, closely followed by his wife (I assume, we never see her killed). Now this is clearly the next day so this is no longer Friday the 13th. It's now Saturday the 14th. So no need for ""Jason"" to go killing as it's not the anniversary of his death.Now we have a new bunch of people (mainly stoners) going to a place called Higgens Haven and if they say where this is in relation to Crystal Lake then I never heard them.After pissing off 3 bikers in the local town, they soon reappear stealing gas from the truck of the campers. the biker girl is killed next (in the barn, unseen by us) along with her 2 male cronies. The girl whose family owns the cabin finally tells us she was attacked by this unknown terrible looking man (we're supposed to assume it's ""Jason""), although she says he caught her and was dragging her away and she ""blacked out"" but she's still alive? Not Jason's M.O. at all that, is it?.Frizzy haired Joker Shelley is next to be attacked (off camera in the barn we assume) and this is how ""Jason"" acquires his now infamous hockey mask and he kills the snooty woman with a harpoon next. The couple who were left in the house having sex are the next victims to die, 1st the boy and the girl is killed in the hammock.When the power goes out, the stoner guy goes to check and gets electrocuted for his troubles by Hockeymask. Shelley shows up to try and warn stoner girl only to be ignored and die in the doorway from his slit throat. She is impaled with a red hot poker.Rick gets his neck broken leaving only the girl whose family who owns the cabin left alive out of the group. She discovers one of her friends dead in the bath and finds a dead biker in a tree. Ricks body is thrown into the cabin through a window, she discovers yet another dead friend in her airing cupboard.She stabs Hockeymask in his hand and knee (he cries out in pain both times so is NOT superhuman). For someone recently stabbed in the knee, Hockeymask walks down the stairs with NO hint of any injury.When she finally tries the truck we all know it's going nowhere as the biker gang siphoned all the fuel in the day time before they all died. The bridge breaking a plank was an obvious thing to happen as they'd taken great pains to show us the loose planks when they 1st drove across it earlier that day.When Hockeymask is hung from the barn that should have killed him. I totally agree with her ""You can't be alive"" statement (the drop on the rope would have broken his neck) and the pointless reveal of his face was to allow her to remember the face of her old attacker from the woods 2 years ago.The black biker turns out to have not been dead but is killed very quickly (while she makes NO attempt to escape, why?). Hitting Hockeymask in the head with an Axe also would have killed him.The scene of her escaping on the canoe is supposed to remind us of the original movie and it's fake scare (we are now in Sunday the 14th, by the way) and the various non-scares of her hitting the log, being spooked by a duck landing then seeing the very alive and injured ""Jason"" without the mask screams this a dream. Especially when she's dragged into the water by dead Mrs Voorhees (who has a head, despite being decapitated in the original) and it dissolves to the cops talking like the other 2 movies did.The final shot of ""Jason"" shows him looking bloodied with stabbed knee, hand and Axe still in his head looking very dead indeed and unlikely to be rising for any sequel.",Friday the 13th Part III

It's a notch below the first two films, but it's still an effective slasher picture. This ""Friday the 13th"" movie is best known as the one where Jason wears the hockey mask for the first time. Another group of kids plan to have a great weekend at a cabin in the woods, but they pick the wrong place to have it: Camp Crystal Lake. Jason comes in and does his usual... well, you know. This film was shot in 3D when it was first released. I never got a chance to see this movie in the theater, but I can imagine it was a blast for those who did. But on the basis of watching this on video, it's entertaining and scary. But it started to get a little tiresome. One thing that really offended me about ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" was all the drug use. It was totally unnecessary.

The deaths are also much more imaginative than on previous chapters, some of them great.However, even if the suspense created is close to the levels we have seen on Part 2, the levels of tension never reach the same patamar. It's a bit repetitive, and not as exciting as the previous 2 films. There is also a totally unecessary subplot and some guys are clearly asking to die, being a relief when that finally happens. We also have a pretty but not so interesting final girl (especially compared to Ginny).I would say that this is a cool and interesting effort, not a terrible sequel, but a bit lazy on it's plot and approach.",Friday the 13th Part III

Friday the 13th Part III isn't a lot different than the others. You've got your painfully obvious overacting, the plot points that are copy-and-pasted from the previous two films, and you've got your events that are a little too convenient to be believable.
But this one stands out more to me in my mind than the previous two. This one was a little more fun, perhaps. We get to see the origins of the iconic Jason mask and we get some pretty decent kills. It's easy to tell that the series has either been getting increasingly better special effects people or Paramount was willing to front more money to make everything look better because, although every bit as cheesy and convenient as the two before it, the kills are a little slicker in this film. They look more realistic.

More bad acting and not much plot, but for some reason this series is strangely fun to rewatch. Jason evolves here, finally putting on the hockey mask, and displaying what seems like superhuman strength in some scenes. And yet in others he can barely take down a door with an axe.

The 3D effects are really cool on a VR headset 'huge screen cinema'. One of the best of the eighties 3D horror films.

There were the bikers: Ali (Nick Savage), Loco (Kevin O'Brien) and Fox (Gloria Charles). Also, crazy Ralph seems to have pulled an Elvis, there is another person just like him.

Also, the store owner in the beginning, Harold (Steve Susskind) was pretty funny despite his angry wife Edna (Cheri Maugans).

132,Gafke,The Hockey Mask Is Here!,6,14 January 2006,"I liked this sequel. Yes, it's stupid, but it's a guilty pleasure thing. A van load of stupid twentysomethings head up to Crystal Lake for the weekend for no other purpose than to smoke pot and screw each other cross eyed. Among them are the painfully unattractive Shelly who enjoys immature practical jokes, a newly pregnant girl, a hippie couple who are constantly ensconced in a cloud of pot smoke and the emotionally damaged Chris, who loves Crystal Lake but has terrible memories of it. It seems that, some time ago, Chris was attacked in the woods by a man with a terribly deformed face. During the attack she passed out and woke up the next morning, safe in her own bed at home. She is not entirely convinced that it was all a dream, and so decides that a weekend at her former haven may just be what she needs to deal with the past. Unfortunately, it was not a dream, as all of us already knew. The man who attacked her was Jason Voorhees, and no sooner do the kids settle in and start partying and screwing than he shows up, ready for some post-coital killings. First to go is an obnoxious trio of motorcycle thugs who harassed our heroes. Then Jason gets right down to what he does best - stabbing, skewering, bisecting and impaling anyone who is stupid enough to wander off alone and wait for him to approach.Still, I liked this movie. Jason finally gets to don his signature hockey mask in this one, and I love the ending, when the rotted remains of Mother Voorhees rise from the lake in a nod to the first films shock ending. I'm still not sure how Mother Voorhees got her head back on, but who cares? This isn't a movie you're supposed to think about too much. I also love Jason's unmasked face in this one. A friend of mine succinctly pointed out the fact that he looks like the banjo player from Deliverance all grown up. A scene at films end when his deranged piggy face appears in a window is actually rather shocking. Dana Kimmel does as good a job as she can with the character of Chris, although Chris is not given a whole hell of a lot to do other than scream, act like a whiny wimp and run. Yeah, this movie is stupid, but its harmless fun. It's not as bad as some of the sequels that followed it, believe me.",Friday the 13th Part III

Friday the 13th Part III sticks with the continuity of the first two films but also has to add the long unneeded setup that highlights the ending of the last film. Within ten to fifteen minutes of watching the new characters and hearing the dialogue, its obvious that the route the writers took was a more comic, campier style that wasn't present in Part II. The biggest problem however with Part III is the characters, the biker gang was really shoehorned for little reason but to die and there are a handful of annoying characters, especially David Katims's role.

This movie has a creepy feel to it like the first film. Jason is always watching, always contemplating, but it's not boring like in Part II. The characters in this movie are more humorous than in the previous films, and it makes it more enjoyable to watch. The death scenes in this movie aren't really that bad, except for one involving eyes popping out of a guy's head.The story is better in this movie, and of course, Jason gets his hockey mask. Some of the actors in this movie aren't that bad either. However, when you get right down to it, this is a stupid slasher film. The film makers decided to make it in 3D, and it was kind of goofy watching it on a normal screen.

136,bh_tafe3,One of the weaker Friday Movies,4,7 December 2008,"There is very little to recommend this rather lacklustre third outing in the Friday the 13th series.The first five minutes takes us over the events at the end of the second movie, explaining that Jason was not in fact killed, but only maimed at the end of the second movie.Jason takes out a couple of store owners outside Crystal Lake and makes his way to a cottage shack and barn where a group of teenagers are staying for the weekend, slaughtering all but one of them, and also eliminating three bikies who try to burn down the barn he is hiding in.Our heroine in this story is Chris, who was raped, or at least assaulted, by Jason years before. She triumphs in the film's final showdown, but has a bad dream where she is dragged underwater by Mrs Vorhees and goes crazy anyway.The effects in this are poor, worse than the first two. It takes a bit away from a movie when a person supposedly gets knifed in the eye and it is obviously a knife sticking out of a rubber mask.The only reason this movie gets a higher rating than it deserves off me is because this is the film where Jason picks up the hockey mask that would define his character from then on. But even that is an anticlimax.Tame sex scenes and mild nudity further drag down what is a wholly unsatisfying entry in the Friday series.",Friday the 13th Part III
137,rlcsljo,A typical schlock 3D horror film,5,30 December 2000,"I may be prejudiced, when I saw this film in 3D in the theater, the projection was horrible--you could see the three-D, but it was horribly mis-registered.  A complaint to the manager seemed to indicate that was the way the print arrived.  Anyway, like most children with a new toy, the director was more interested in playing with it and exploring its possibilities, rather than weaving a good story.  The effects were not quite as gory as ""Andy Warhol's"" frankenstein, but competent.  If you cant see this in three-D, forget it.",Friday the 13th Part III
138,buckikris,A Dimension Like No Other In The Friday The 13th Franchise,8,23 October 2015,"Friday the 13th part 3 starts off where part 2 left off. Then the beginning credits role in 3-D. The main feature begins showing small store owners Harold(Steve Susskind), and Edna(Cheri Maugans) becoming Jason's first victims. When Chris(Dana Kimmell, Chuck(David Katims), Andy (Jeff Rogers), Debbie(Tracie Savage), and Shelly( Larry Zerner) travel to Chris' uncle's cabin 4 the weekend. As they pass by the store it brings back scary memories for Chris. On the way there they pick up Shelly's date, Vera( Catherine Park's). All seems to be going well as they approach the cabin. Once there Chris meets here boyfriend, Rick( Paul Kratka). While there Chris get's spooked, she starts to see things and becomes a little unnerved. Little does the group of friends know that Jason is back and the killing spree begins again. I liked this movie and it being in 3-D helped a little. The plot is good considering, and this is the first of the series where Jason sports the hockey mask. I wasn't familiar with the cast at all except for Tracie Savage. I only know Savage because she was a newscaster in Dayton, Ohio when I was growing up. This movie brings it, especially when Chris tells her story to Paul about her 1st encounter with Jason. The Lake scene at the end was a added surprise also, it will make some jump. It still makes my skin crawl, but not like the ending in the 1st one. This is not a bad sequel at all, in fact I prefer Part 3 over the Final Chapter. The 3-D effects are good; but they are nothing compared to today's 3-D magic. A great film that will still make you think twice about the joy's of camping :D.Kris L. CocKayne",Friday the 13th Part III

However this time there is the added gimmick of 3D. The first two films were bad enough with their poor writing, crappy dialogue, cheap scares, rampant nudity & lacklustre direction. Part 3 would have to be the worst entry in the first generation of ""Friday"" films (Parts 1, 2, 3 & Final Chapter are first generation, A New Beginning, Jason Lives, The New Blood & Jason Takes Manhattan are second generation & Jason Goes To Hell & Jason X are third generation). The 3D gimmick is the main reason this film sucks hard. Every few minutes the film flogs an object into the camera. So far we have snakes, poles, baseball bats, mice, TV antennas, joints & a biker's fist wrapped in a chain. The unintentionally funny highlight is when Jason squeezes a victim's head, causing his eyeball to pop into the screen (by the way, it's impossible for an eyeball to pop that way) & into your face.",Friday the 13th Part III
140,squeezebox,The Best of the Series (especially in 3-D),7,28 January 2003,"In keeping with the 3-D boom of the early 80's, the Friday THE 13TH franchise unleashed its own 3-D sequel (before JAWS 3-D or AMITYVILLE 3-D). It's the best of the series, 3-D or not, largely due to lead actress Dana Kimmel being such a pain. Apparently she was on some soap opera at the time, and was therefore something of a ""name,"" so when she was approached about starring in a F13 movie, she laid down a couple of conditions: no explicit sex, no excessive violence. The studio complied and told the filmmakers (led by director Steve Miner) to tone down the skin and gore. Miner chose instead to go for shocks and suspense, and was surprisingly successful, especially if you got a chance to see it in 3-D. A group of friends (one of whom had survived an earlier attack by Jason) ventures to the woods of Crystal Lake where Jason is alive and well and still slaughtering anyone who happens to cross his path. After disposing of an obnoxious couple of shopkeepers and a biker gang, Jason dispatches the vacationers one by one, in some creatively grisly ways (a crochet needle is driven through a woman's neck and comes out her mouth, a boy is cut in half vertically, a girl is impaled with a hot poker, a boy's head is crushed until his eyeball pops out), until he finally has a showdown with his previous escapee, resulting in his first being hanged, then being axed in the head. This movie utilizes its 3-D gimmick to its fullest effect, never passing up an opportunity to shove something in our face(including a yo-yo, a rattlesnake, a harpoon gun, a pitchfork, juggling apples, and the aforementioned eyeball popping), and makes full use of its scope aspect ratio. It's much more stylishly shot and edited than the previous two, and plays out as a decent thriller even when viewed ""flat"" on TV. Other points of interest include the debut of the infamous hockey mask, a rather bizarre nightmare appearance by Mrs. Voorhees (decomposed and worm-ridden) and the opening and closing disco theme! Despite the fact that there is no implication whatsoever that Jason is still alive at the end of this one (which was actually intended to be the final entry in the series), Paramount carried on with five more sequels, until New Line Cinema acquired the rights and unleashed JASON GOES TO HELL and JASON X. Also known as Friday THE 13TH PART 3-D.",Friday the 13th Part III

All of those elements make Friday The 13th Part III one of best and most memorable films in the series.Taking place after the events in Part 2,Friday The 13th Part III has Jason(Richard Booker)who after surviving the events in Part 2 is on the loose and stalking another group of campers that includes Chris(Dana Kimmel)and her friends which will lead to terror,fright and a high body count.Friday The 13th Part III is a fantastic sequel and one of the better films in the Friday The 13th franchise that was another box office hit for the series and is the only Friday The 13th series to be filmed in 3-D which put the Friday The 13th series into pop culture status. Friday The 13th Part III doesn't give viewers anything new in the series and gives fans all of the familiar elements that are in Friday The 13th series:the young campers,a high body count,blood,gore and last but certainly not least seeing everyone's favorite Summer Camp killer Jason Voorhees doing what he does best for 90 minutes offering fans another marathon of slaying and we as the viewers are entertained and having fun. The kills in Part III are well done and creative and what really adds to the kills is the 3-D effect which makes it seem like your feeling the kills yourself. The blood and gore is also in great effect here because we see human limbs coming off as well a wonderful eyeball gag(you'll see)that is one of most memorable scenes. The atmosphere and look of Part III is one of best in the series especially during the night time scenes which are dark and mysterious and makes the some of the scenes more suspenseful and creepy whether Jason is in the scene or not. The atmosphere also adds to the chase scenes towards the end of the film which is one of the best chase scenes in the entire series and will keep you on the edge of your seat. And what about the main characters in Part III? Some of them are a combination of being interesting and forgettable because let's face characters and depth have never been the Friday The 13th franchises strongest suite because Everyone knows that the main attraction of this series is Jason Voorhees. Jason in Part III is in top form here in this film and is at his creepiest,hiding in the shadows,killing his victims in a vicious fashion in the best way that he knows how like the silent killer that he is stalking and hunting his prey like a shark in the water ready eat it victims and unleash his brutality. Perhaps the most famous scene in the film and in my opinion one of the best scenes in Horror movie history is the introduction of Jason's famous Hockey mask which made Jason not just a Horror icon or a Slasher movie icon but a movie icon in general. Where as Freddy Kruger has the finger claws,red and green sweater and fedora hat and Michael Myers has the white mask and butcher's knife The Hockey mask(along with the machete)helped define Jason and gave the character a symbol that makes Jason Voorhees unforgettable. The ending of Friday The 13th Part III is great and filled with intensity,suspense and surprises that will leave excited and fearful. A terrific ending.The cast is good. Richard Booker is excellent and memorable as Jason Voorhees,with Booker being creepy and intense. RIP Mr. Booker,you were one of the best Jason's. Dana Kimmel is wonderful as Chris,a the main heroine. Paul Krafta does a fine job as Rick,Chris' boyfriend. Tracie Savage and Jeffrey Rogers are good as Debbie and Andy,a couple. Catherine Parks is memorable as Vera,a friend of Chris'. Larry Zerner is funny as Shelly,a practical joker who has a crush on Vera. David Katims and Rachel Howard are Humorous as Chuck and Chili,an older couple. Nick Savage(Ali),Gloria Charles(Fox)and Kevin O'Brian(Loco)are fun and interesting as a Motorcycle gang.The direction by Joseph Zito is great,with Zito giving the movie a dark and moody atmosphere while giving the film a nice pace. Fine direction,Zito.The score by Harry Manfredini is another wonderful,suspenseful and intense score that adds to the film. Great score,Manfredini. I also like the opening Disco theme song that goes with the movie.The Special and Practical Make-up effects are fantastic,well-done and add to the movie. Great Special effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films or the Friday The 13th franchise,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th Part III,a terrific,entertaining sequel that is one of the best films in the series. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Friday the 13th Part III

144,Rendanlovell,3D!,3,20 July 2020,"Starts well enough with it's generic teens heading to a farm house vacation home. But it quickly turns into an awful Friday the 13th movie as soon as they get there. One thing that I did enjoy in this was the chessy style though. Early 3D always has a hilarious charm to it. They took everything they could jam against the camera and did. It definitely doesn't have the effect it was intended too but I still liked watching Jason shoot things directly at the camera. Adds a little style to quite possibly the most monotonous of the series so far. With part 2 and now 3 these movies seem content in stripping away, little by little, the only good aspects of the original. Again, that film is trash but there's a grittiness to appreciate and an interesting setting. There's simply nothing to this one. Much like the other two, this has utterly zero story. A handful of trite characters go to a place and they slowly get picked off. There's at least the tiniest amount of character given to them but so little it's almost not worth mentioning. There's a stoner couple, a guy that can do a handstand, an insecure fat kid, and even a hunk guy. I think the biggest reason I dislike these Friday movies so much is because there hardly ever seems like an escalating threat. Jason just kills people until someone gets away. He's like a ghost, coming and going as he pleases with little rules holding him to reality. Which, I suppose is fine if there was something introduced that could slow or stop him. I liked that a character tried to manipulate him using his mommy issues in the second one, but that's the only thing that is ever done to stop him aside from just stabbing him. He's like the Zenomorph in Alien. An unstoppable force for our characters to fight against. The problem with these movies is that you don't care for the people nor do the characters ever take steps to stop the threat. Mainly because half the time spent in these films is with false scares and pointless side characters getting killed. It would be like watching Tremors but the tremors do nothing the whole time and kill at random. It's just not that interesting. Also, this the only Friday movie that's letterboxed through the first 4 and I dont know why.",Friday the 13th Part III

There isn't much reason given but Jason (Richard Brooker) kills a middle age couple at their store than heads back to camp Crystal Lake. A fresh new crop of teenagers have shown up to have sex and die. Part 3 Boasted some great 3-D effects at the theater and just recently on DVD. Returning Director Steve Miner uses the 3-D well and many of the deaths are very inventive using this gimmick. The cast is likable and Harry Manfredini's score is solid once again. This is the chapter when Jason gets his iconic hockey mask. His first kill wearing the mask is a classic as he harpoons a character in the eye. The story is by-the-numbers, like all the films in this series, so it comes down to the death scenes and this chapter has some great ones. One character has his head crushed and his eyeballs pop out of his head into the 3-D laps of the audience. One of the most violent deaths of the entire series happens to a character named Andy (Jeffrey Rogers). Andy is walking down a hallway on his hands and runs straight into Jason who brings the machete down and it just destroys his body. The end chase sequence between final girl Chris (Kimmell) and Jason happens in a barn and it has good suspense and some hair raising moments. In the end, Part 3 certainly doesn't deliver anything special, but delivers on what fans of this series expects.",Friday the 13th Part III

It did not kill any of the previous characters like Part 2 did. I know they are haters for this film, it is campy, cartoonish and lame to some people. I enjoy the film, it goes to the basics, it has good death kills. It has Jason Voorhees dons his iconic hockey mask for the first time in the franchise. The final showdown between the heroine--one of the cutest and most likeable in the whole series--is oustanding. I love this movie to death, it is my fifth favorite ""Friday the 13th"" film in the franchise.The 3D image was a bad idea it just blurs the image and dosen't gave a proper aspect to the film. There's a lot going for this movie. Steve miner who previously directed Part 2 I say he directed well this film in the 80's. I don't mind where the film takes place it is in Higgins Heaven on a barn I do not mind it. It is a bad-ass slasher film that has balls to the walls.I know people will ask why is not The Final Chapter my favorite why i love Jason Lives or The New Blood or this one better, it is because my opinion changes all the time and I love this film. Mine love for this film will never change I am huge fan of this movie. I love the ascpet of this film, how they filmed it, love the characters to death, I love that in this movie they are biker gangs in it. I love the death kills, the practical FX effects: a harpoone in the head, or eye ball of a guy. Great creepy slasher effects. A biker gets a tool fork in his stomach, really creppy effect of a slashed kill. A guy get his neck slashed.Richard Brooker is one of my favorite actors who played Jason Voorhees he at least gave 100% of him self. He wasn't goofy in my opinion like some people are saying. He did his own stunts unlike Warrington Gillette who couldn't make his own stunts and he wined like an manchild he is! I really love the direction of Jason that, he is bald not like he was clumsy farmer idiot in Part 2. Richard Brooker R.I.P. I have nothing but respect thowards the actor.I love the characters: Chris, Vera, Shelly - (I love the guy he was the one that gave Jason his iconic hockey mask.), Rick, Chilly, Fox, Ali, Loco, Debbie and Andy.Chris Higgins is my favorite final girl and a bad-ass tough heroine. She was so sexy beatiful hot babe. The soul survivor who fought back against Jason. She did not had any help like Ginny did - (what a dissapointment). Dana Kimmell is excellent in my opinion her best performence ever! She is great gal I love her to death. Love the last showdown between Chris and Jason, she hit Jason with an axe in his hockey mask.I love the opening sequence we meet Harold and Edna in the store in which jason steals their cloths and than kills them both. Martin Becker did a good effects in my opinion. Gloria Charles as Fox was sexy hot babe, I love her in this movie. Debbie was also hot sexy girl, Chilli was sexy and hot. A lot of hot girls are in this movie. I love Vera so much in here. Catherine Parks was outsanding as girl that was killed by Jason, I felt bad for her. I love the scene in which Chriss and Debbie are talking about Shelley playing a prank on them, I love how they filmed that scene.R.I.P. Richard Brooker, Gloria Charles, Steve Susskind and David Wiley these actors are missed but not forgotten.Friday the 13th Part III is my fifth favorite ""Friday the 13th"" film in the franchise some scens were filmed in Santa Clarita, California, USA and Melody Ranch - 24715 Oak Creek Avenue, Newhall, California, USA that was in the barn.

As a slasher movie, it's so bad it's awesome.",2,6 January 2015,"Rating: 1/5 So Bad it's Good Rating: 5/5I have a hard time deciding if ""Friday the 13th part 3"" is better than ""Part 2"", or if this third installment is the worst chapter yet. The story is completely non-existent this time, with characters placed at the Crystal Lake Campground just so they can be slaughtered. There's barely a reason for them to be gathered in the location except for the fact that Part 2 made a lot of money. It's largely without any genuine scares but at least the characters present are entertaining, so their deaths have a greater emotional impact (which is good). The saving grace of this slasher film is the 3D. It's the cheesiest, most shoehorned, stereotypically bad 3D you will ever see, and that bumps the movie into ""So Bad It's Good"" territory faster than a machete through a horny teenager. You get yo-yos, juggling, geysers of blood, eyeballs and more coming towards the screen thanks to those cheap cardboard glasses, and the credits are so ridiculously over-the-top you can't help but be entertained. As a horror film, it's completely inept but as a fun movie that just happens to star a lot of dead teenagers and a maniac with a thirst for blood, there's a lot of entertainment to be had. Just make sure you watch it in 3D (or pretend that you do) so you can come up with some witty comments to make your friends laugh. There's a lot of entertainment to be had at the expense of ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" so if you're a fan of the series (which is not a serious of good horror movies, it's just bad gory fun) this will be quite entertaining.

Jason Voorhees has again risen from certain death, ready to slash his way through a new group of innocent teens. And although it introduces that horror landmark known as Jason's goalie mask, Friday THE 13TH PART III is pretty average fare.Even three entries into an 11-film (and counting) series, the plot is no shocker. One, show Jason pulling another Lazarus. Two, introduce a group of semi-likable, horny teens looking for a good time in nature. Three, bring Jason and an assortment of blood-spilling weaponry to the teens. And four, allow the last one or two survivors to do in Mr. Voorhees yet again. I don't want to sound cynical, because I have a special place in my heart for these films. But like it or not, they certainly don't deviate much from a set formula.Among Jason's targets this time out are a couple of potheads, a burly man running a general store in the middle of nowhere, and an evil biker chick and her two henchmen. Director Steve Miner did inject some new life, even a chill or two, but unlike several of his predecessors, didn't go far enough. Despite an enthusiastic young cast of unknowns, it could have really used a bolt of energy to liven up the slow spots. To be fair, however, viewers today are not seeing the film as it was originally intended -- in 3-D.Though it's one of the weaker films in the series, Friday THE 13TH PART III is sure to please fans of low-budget 1980s horror.

150,geminiredblue,Or Should That Be 3-D out of 10?!,3,13 September 2011,"The concept of 3-D has been around since the 50s, at least in movies. Although many credit Thomas Edison's THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY as the first attempt. By and large, 3-D is usually a sign of filmmaker desperation. They know that their work is a bomb, so they decide to use 3-D in hopes of jazzing it up. Mind you, there are some good ones: the Vincent Price flick HOUSE OF WAX being at the top of my list. But for every good one, there are ten bad ones: JAWS 3-D and the MY BLOODY VALENTINE remake, anyone? Fascinating, every thirty years or so, there seems to be a renewed craze in 3-D. First, there was the 50s. Then the 80s. And now in the early 2000s. Deep in the heart of 1982, the Friday the 13th franchise was starting to flourish. Of the original four FT13 movies, this one is my least favorite. Don't think I didn't like it. If nothing else, this movie should be noted as the one where Jason adopted his hockey mask! The movie opens with five minutes of padding, I mean, footage from Part II, another sign of filmmaker desperation in fact. And then for the next ten minutes, it drags through one of the slowest openings in slasher history. We're introduced to a disgusting middle-aged couple who bicker and argue. At this point, I wanted to turn into Jason and hack them up myself. In terms of 3-D, we get an occasional object thrown or held towards the camera. But take out those shots and the movie is still a piece of well-made crap. In terms of favorite characters, mine is the fat dork named Shelly. If only they had fleshed his character out more! And what is the deal with the two aging hippies, or the mixed-race biker gang of three? For early 80s entertainment, watch this for laughs with a group of your funniest friends!

Unfortunately for them, the infamous hockey mask-clad, axe-wielding maniac, Jason, has other plans for them. This 3rd entry in the Friday the 13th series is goofy and dumb, but nevertheless an entertaining slasher flick. While the film may have been a lot more effective in 3D during it's original release, on DVD the imagesincluding characters putting object in the viewer's face, yo-yos being lowered into the camera, snakes striking and, silliest of all, a guy's eye being popped out of his deadare laughable, but in a fun sort of way. The characters are clichéd but fairly likable, there's some alright gore and the film has an overall decent sense of humor, something that is desperately needed to make generic slasher flicks work. In the end this was one of the more enjoyable entries in the Friday series, by no means a masterpiece but enjoyable enough for a brainless slasher flick.Director Steve Miner has since gone on to direct the 1986 horror/comedy House and the 1999 killer crocodile flick Lake Placid. None of his horror efforts have been especially great, though he clearly realizes that the main objective of a horror film is to entertain and as a result his films are never boring or sloppily made. 5/10.",Friday the 13th Part III
152,happyendingrocks,"If Jason didn't get around to killing Shelly, I would have done it myself",5,14 October 2009,"This third installment in the hit-or-miss Friday The 13th franchise is uniformly lousy by almost any standards. But the old-school aesthetic it shares with the first four Friday films offers it an air of nostalgia that at least makes the film a fun ride. Alhough, the less said about the quasi-disco opening theme, the better. (Naturally, I had to track down a vinyl copy of the soundtrack). Working very hard against any opportunity for this movie to distinguish itself in the series is the assortment of bodies on Jason's smörgåsbord, who are far and away the most ridiculous group of future victims to grace not only a F13 film, but perhaps any slasher film ever made. Even if you can deal with a pair of potheads who appear to be twice as old as anyone else in the group, and who offer un-needed and un-funny stoner humor throughout the kill-fest, you still have to contend with Fox, Loco, and Ali, the lamest and least intimidating biker gang to ever set foot on a movie screen. The film is notable for being the entry in which we see Jason don his iconic hockey mask for the first time. Unfortunately, said mask is inadvertently provided to him by a cloying d-bag named Shelly, perhaps the most infamous character in the Friday franchise. Shelly spends the majority of the film instigating ""funny"" pranks like sneaking up behind people and stabbing them with rubber knives, and faking his own death, and his witty apex comes late in the film when he dons a hockey mask and sets out to impress the girl he likes by trying to pull her into the water, then lunging out and attacking her with a spear-gun. A brilliant strategy, this. Nothing steals a girl's heart like pretending you're going to kill her.In a franchise that demands we accept the unacceptable, Shelly is the most problematic wild card. You see, I can suspend my disbelief and play along with the idea that Jason can be chopped, stabbed, maimed, hung, etc. and recover from his wounds unscathed. I can force myself to ignore the logistical improbabilities of Jason's ability to stage corpses in such a manner that they fall from a tree at the precise moment our heroine is standing by the tree. I can even begrudgingly concede that it's remotely possible for a killer to operate in a self-contained area with an identical modus operandi for several films and still not elicit any suspicion or vigilance from law enforcement. What I can NOT accept is that a character as unlikeable and annoying as Shelly could not only find and maintain a group of friends who endure his insufferably lame antics, but that anyone would invite him along on a road trip that would necessitate being stuck in the middle of nowhere with him for an entire weekend. That, ladies and gentlemen, is just too hard to swallow.I have yet to mention the 3-D gimmick, which was sort of negated until very recently, when this chapter was finally issued on DVD in its original form. The effects aren't really all that spectacular, despite the fact that the film-makers latched onto any opportunity they could to throw snakes, eyeballs, yo-yos, and pitchforks at the screen. These jump effects are far too clunky to have any impact, even with the 3-D process employed. However, the 3-D presentation offers some improvement, since on the film's original two-dimensional home video release, these scenes just looked stupid. Surprisingly, the more subtle dimensional effects are far more impressive, such as rows of clotheslines blowing in the wind as Jason lurks behind them, and the final haunting shot of the seemingly tranquil lake. Since there aren't a lot of 3-D films available on DVD, this tactic certainly offers an experience that makes the film worth checking out despite its glaring flaws.One particularly mean-spirited aspect of the film that gets glossed over is the revelation that one of our characters is pregnant. Perhaps the film-makers didn't think that this disposable piece of character development was all that important, but the idea of Jason butchering a pregnant woman is inherently worse than him killing a score of obnoxious teens. It also confuses things when you're trying to tally up the body count here. Do we count the fetus as a victim, or is there some sort of asterisk designation involved? The ending is particularly dicey, attempting to recapture the classic final ""boo"" of the original Friday The 13th by having Mrs. Voorhees leap out of the lake and pull lone survivor Chris into the water. There are a couple of possibilities to make sense of how this improbable scenario could have happened. One is, quite simply, Mrs. Voorhees leaped out the lake and pulled lone survivor Chris into the water, although that fails to explain how Pamela's severed head moved from the shrine Jason adorned with it and reattached itself to her decapitated body. The other possibility is that Chris was merely dreaming this happened, or that it was a hallucination borne from her traumatized mind. Only problem there is that Chris has no idea who Jason is, let alone who Mrs. Voorhees is, and she has no knowledge of the legend of Crystal Lake. Can you hallucinate being attacked by someone you don't even know exists? This is never explained, and those who took the reigns for future installments wisely left this twist in the dust. Although, the final scene when we see Chris completely paralyzed with madness brought on by her ordeal is a nifty little fade to black.The series would eventually get much worse than this, but Part 3 is not even remotely a high point in the Friday franchise. Recommended for completists and those interested in the 3-D aspect, but this is assuredly the worst of the classic and otherwise solid original Friday quartet.",Friday the 13th Part III
153,ryan-10075,"""Hey, cut that out! That's not funny!""",7,23 April 2020,"When this film was released there was a bit of a 3D craze. Other films that I know of that were released in 3D around the time of this ones release as well were JAWS 3-D and AMITYVILLE 3-D. This one was miles better than either of those entries that had essentially already run its course in storytelling. Not that FRIDAY THE 13TH is exactly dripping with great storytelling, but this is where Jason Vorhees finally gets his iconic mask and takes off running. Unfortunately, I have never seen this in 3D, but on TV some of the effects don't exactly work the greatest. Some would have been cool to see in 3D.A group of friends are off to Higgins' Haven for a weekend of fun owned by Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell). Problem is Jason isn't dead yet and starts knocking victims off one by one. About as basic of an idea as you can get, but it is all about the continuation and building of a horror icon. Not to mention that this really is one of the more fun FRIDAY THE 13THs in the series.Not that this is flawless though. The acting really is the pits and some of the worst in the series. One performance though that I think is rock-solid though is Richard Brooker as Jason. I find him much more creepy and intimidating than what we got in part 2. I love the scene involving his first appearance with the hockey mask. It also involves a harpoon gun and a nice kill. Another thing I did not like and it happened in part 2 as well is the unneeded intro that is just the ending of part 2. To me it really wastes the potential of a great opening and build-up.Harry Manfredini returns again to score the music. It is changed here quite drastically for the theme. Personally, I think it is awesome, unexpected and kind of goofy. Not scary, but the classic FRIDAY THE 13TH score is played through out the movie to assist with that.One character that I have heard some people in fact hate is Shelly played by Larry Zerner. Personally, I don't even come close to hating him, but he is sort of in the mould of Ned from the original in that he is a bad prankster. He goes way too far for a joke like all the time.Directed by Steve Miner who also did part 2. Nice to see that things were a little different this time out and not a 100% retread of part 2. So if you enjoyed part 2, you have to tune in to part 3. There is enough here to really enjoy the movie, just don't think about it too much.",Friday the 13th Part III
154,Toronto85,Friday the 13th Part III,8,16 March 2011,"Friday the 13th part 3 continues with the story of Jason's killing spree throughout the area of Crystal Lake. Picking up right where we left off in part 2, Jason continues his slaughter at a small store where he murders the couple living there. We soon meet a group of teenagers, led by Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell), who are going out to the lake for some summer fun. Jason meanwhile is hiding out in the Higgins barn watching the teens every move. Eventually some members of a biker gang decide to check out the barn when Jason strikes. He also gets his infamous hockey mask in this sequel which has become a trademark for the horror genre. Many of the teens are murdered, and it's up to Chris to battle the evil madman.Part three was originally presented in 3-D back in 1982. I would have loved to see it in the theatre, watching on your TV screen doesn't do it justice. This part was a very good addition to the series. It carried on a continuous story of Jason stalking residents of Crystal Lake over a period of a few days. Having Part 3 take place the day after Amy Steel's Ginny battle Jason in part 2 was pretty cool. Jason Vorhees looks different in this one than he did in the second one. Potato sack and hockey mask aside, his face was very different. His face/head were shaved and he looked inhuman. In the second Friday, he looked like some backwoods grizzly type man. In Part 3, he looks like a mutation of some kind.Dana Kimmell is amazing. That's all I can say. I loved her portrayal of Chris Higgins and her battle and chase scenes with Jason were the best of the series next to Amy Steel's in part 2. And one cannot overlook that this is the movie where Jason gets his legendary hockey mask thanks to Shelley and his assortment of costumes/makeup he brings on the trip. The ending is a little odd, but most of the time in Friday films, the endings make little sense.One of the better Friday film's completed with a (very) low budget.8/10",Friday the 13th Part III
155,CMRKeyboadist,A Bit Goofy,8,11 August 2006,"Friday the 13th part 3 is another important part of the series. If your not familiar with the series then you should know that this is the one in which Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. For the first half of the movie you don't see anything above his chest. Though this one is an important part of the series, it is not quite as good as the other first four in the series. That's not to take away from the fun of the movie as this one has some extremely memorable moments.The story starts right where part 2 left off. Ginny (only surviver of part 2) is getting taken to the hospital thus ending her tale. The police start a search for the killer and have no trace. Of course, Jason starts killing immediately. Now we introduce the teen characters to be slaughtered. They seem to be on vacation and decide to stay at an old barn house. A perfect place for a massacre.Pretty standard for a slasher movie. Some of the ups for this movie are the gore scenes and the fact that this movie was released in the theaters in 3-d. I was a bit to young to see this one in the theaters but I can imagine it would have been a lot of fun. The few scenes of gore are side splitting hilarious. A scene where a guy walking upside down is almost to funny as Jason makes short work of him and the scene where Jason decides to crush this poor saps head is probably the funniest moment in all of the Jason films.The downs for the movie are only very few. I am sure that seeing this in 3-d was completely awesome but it seeing without the 3-d effect is kind of sad because most of the movie has things that jump out at the screen and what not. Without the 3-d effect it just looks incredibly goofy. Also, the opening music that plays with the credits is just so eighties. I like the eighties but man, stick with the original theme. At least they didn't change the rest of the music as we here the original score for most of the movie.This is a must see for the fan of the Friday the 13th series. A whole lot of slaughtering fun. 8/10",Friday the 13th Part III
156,varghesejunior,Ahh...just the same concept,5,2 February 2013,"This seems to be the common thing in FTT movies - the concept is same! There are only minor differences in each sequel.In part 3, Chris and Rick , survivors of FTT Part 2, decide on go on another camp in the woods, not taking seriously the fact that Jason may be still there waiting for victims.In this, along with the regular wayward camp goers, a few others are included in the victim list. Apart from that, it;s basically the same as any FTT.Concept? Same old thing. Thrills? Nothing that will thrill or scare even a child. Effects?Not many and none scary. Music? Same old thing. Vulgarity? Like any other FTT film.And why I watched? Coz I like horror!",Friday the 13th Part III
157,kingofdanerds,Obnoxious 3D stuff and just overall really generic,4,22 January 2021,"Friday the 13th Part II was yet another financial success and so the next year, Friday the 13th Part III was released and in 3D as well. Friday the 13th Part III was intended to be the final film in the franchise and obviously that was not the case. Released in 1982, Friday the 13th Part III was another huge financial success and at the time was the highest grossing sequel in the franchise unitl Freddy vs. Jason in 2003. Again, critics hated this film but audiences love it and is once again a fan favorite. The film was intended to have Amy Steel return but she did not want to so we have a whole new cast. Steve Miner returns as director for this film and is the only film director to have directed more than one Friday the 13th film.It is the day after the events of the previous film and we have a new group of sexed and drugged up people as they are going to their friend's cabin for the weekend. But they do not release that Jason is still lurking around.....Yes, I will give this film credit for giving Jason his iconic hockey mask. Which is strange because I think that a majority of people give this film way too much praise and it seems that it is because of the hockey mask. Which, sure, is a good look for Jason. But I think there is more to look at with this film than just the hockey mask. With that being said, I do like the look of Jason despite the continuity errors. His more intimidating than in the previous film and that would be due to his physical stature. The kills are better......that is on paper. Sure, the MPAA did a lot of cutting once again, but even still, the effects on these kills are not really that great. You would think that on a bigger budget, you would have some better effects. The kills themselves are alright but most are pretty generic with nothing too new being done with the kills. The 3D effects are very obnoxious. There are three ways to watch this film. Watching this film in 2D (which is what I ususally watch this film in). Anaglyph 3D (which is the most common 3D version and for my recent viewing I decided to try it out). Finally, the original 3D (which was what was released in theaters and has been given a DVD treatment and sadly, I have not seen this version). The 2D version is obnoxious to watch and the anaglyph 3D is worse considering that I have to wear the red and blue glasses and when a 3D shot happens, my vision doubles and the effect is not very satisfying. Most of these pop out shots are not even scary and mostly are used in shots with random objects. I WANT KNIFES AND BLOOD FLYING OUT AT ME NOT YO YOS AND POPCORN. I think the 3D idea is interesting but this film just makes it feel like a dumb gimmick. Aside from the 3D camera work, the rest of this film looks rather nice even if they use lighting WAY too much in this film. When the film does use the natural light, it does feel nice and atmospheric. With that all out of the way, I might as well address the music. I am aware there are people who really dig the disco funk music in this film. But to me, it feels really out of place. Obviously the plot is very simple, to the point that it is the simplest of the movies so far. Instead of counselors, they are just friends going out for a weekend. The film is faster paced than the previous two films which I am fine with. The climax is done really well here and is loads of fun to watch if I can look past all of the generic bullcrap. When the ending comes around, the film loses me because they do not do anything original for the ending and instead just does the ending from the first film. The characters are not as interesting at all and the acting is really poor. I honestly do not care for any of these characters other than Shelly because why not? He is the most developed character in this whole film. The final girl in this film is obvious from the very beginning only because she gets too much focus. But I still do not care for her as I did with the previous final girl. There are some biker characters in this film that are rather minor but they are very pointless and could have been removed and nothing would have been missed.Friday the 13th Part III is an overall generic slasher film. Where it does do well, it does extremely well and it can be lots of fun to watch. But much of this film is bogged down by characters, acting, and that gimmicky 3D bullcrap.",Friday the 13th Part III
158,Casey-52,Third installment is the worst so far,9,24 August 2000,"After a mediocre first installment followed by a kick-ass sequel, FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 is the worst so far. How could it not be? Little character development, stupidity beyond belief, bad acting, horrible dialogue, and an almost completely unlikable group of teens create one of the worst horror sequels in my history of viewing.The overacting Dana Kimmell is Chris, a whiny bitch who has survived a ""near-death experience"" at a lake (is it Crystal Lake? we're never told) and ventures back for a vacation with a group of her friends, all horribly acted and for the most part, unlikable. The superman killer, Jason, who has survived from PART 2, somehow crawled away and has now decided to wreck the kids' vacation. Lots of false scares created by Shelley the joker (who I couldn't wait to see slaughtered), some T&A, unintentional humor (""It's you! You can't be alive!""), dialogue worthy of an Ed Wood movie (but worse), and great gory deaths are what make up the 90 minutes. The trick ending rips off PART 1, by the way. Also are some great camera tricks utilized for the 3-D theatrical release that look like they would have worked quite well. Now if only Paramount released this on DVD in 3-D......In the long run, PART 3 contains some great splashy gore effects (speargun to the eye, firepoker through the stomach, cutting a handstander in half, squishing a head with bare hands, knife through the chest), but little else worth recommending to a serious horror film fan. Still, it will remain a staple at teen horror parties for years to come along with its previous (better) and later (worse) installments.",Friday the 13th Part III
159,RhapsodyReviews,"Not a Great Film, Didn't Need 3D.",5,6 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th Part III' is an American slasher film directed by Steve Miner. It is the third installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. The film marks the debut of Voorhees wearing his signature hockey mask, which has become a trademark of both the character and the franchise, as well as an icon in American cinema and the horror genre in general.
Set immediately after the events of 'Friday the 13th Part 2', the plot follows a teenage girl and her friends at a house on Crystal Lake, where a wounded Jason Voorhees has taken refuge.
If you have read my reviews for the previous two 'Friday the 13th' movies, I'm sure you can guess what I'm going to have to ay about this one. The acting in all three of these films are the exact same. No actor stands out in any of them and they could have been replaced by one another and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
While this movie is still fun and we get to see Jason go on killing everybody in his sight, the film loses points for the use of 3D. It really didn't need to be done and seemed like a copout. The actor who plays Jason in this film does a good job being creepy and is actually a big guy. I liked him a lot better than Warrington Gillette who plays Jason in the second film. I believe this movie did 3D before it's time, and it didn't pull it off in the right ways as it's done today. You can tell that some scenes were shot as if it was supposed to be in 3D, but when you're just watching it as a regular movie it really takes you out of it. The movie would have been twice as better if it didn't have the 3D element.
Overall, even if you are a fan of these movies you can skip this one and I believe you will have a better time just watching the first two.

160,DustinRahksi,My second favourite in the series.,5,10 February 2013,"As i've said already, I enjoy the first four films the best, after that it got ridiculous. Why do I enjoy this film, well it has a certain atmosphere or mood that draws me in. The first time I watched this film once I bought the 3D Blu-ray I didn't notice all the 3D elements they put in. Now that I watched it again, I made a game of paying attention to how many things come towards the screen, it was pretty amusing. You get everything from sticks, yo-yo's, eyeballs, even more sticks, and fruit. Yes they juggle fruit towards the screen. The kills were satisfying with out be to over done, the best one is when a guy is doing a hand stand and gets cut in half. There's a part where a girl is looking through a Fangoria magazine, and we see Tom Savini, then my favourite when they show Godzilla, I thought that was a nice touch. Of course this film has the mandatory shower scene, why does almost every horror movie have one, even if it last's 10 seconds they got to put it in. I wish they would have explained on what happened to Chris in the woods, then again I don't even want to think about it. This film is a very entertaining and is worth buying the 3D edition.",Friday the 13th Part III
161,FKDZ,Jason is the only good part about this movie.,4,22 August 2020,"So I'm watching all F13th movies in order for the first time ever. And I went into this with pretty decent expectations because Part II was definitely the best movie so far. And I was hoping that upward trend would continue. But sadly not.This movie is just downright sloppy. From moments where you can spot the camera crew in reflections, to bad audio cuts. Sloppy editing and just awful writing and acting. I can't think of one character that I liked in this movie. The lead: Chris is the only actress that somewhat gives a decent performance.Part II lacked so much of the charm of the first and second movie. The teenagers just all go their own way, there's no chemistry. The few jokes that are there fall flat, and that is mostly due to the character Shelly who gives probably the worst performance of the whole movie. Seemingly able to only have one emotion which is ''slightly awkward smile''.The biker subplot is just downright weird and made just to get a few kills in that are ultimately unsatisfying. This leads me onto my main point really.Most of the kills are repeats from the first and second movie which makes me think this Part II was just *another* remake of the first one. Like they downright copied some of the kills, you could see that as a homage...but its only been 2 years since the first. That's just lazy. And in general the kills were mostly funny due to the sloppy effects (for the 3D effect) like the eye popping out. So I was never tense or scared in this movie.BUT, the highlight of this movie is Jason, I think they nailed his demeanor and look here. The mask and his face under it is great. Terrifying and intimidating and I look forward to seeing this continue to be used in future movies. He was a bit too clumsy and dumb at times, even though we know he can be smart by the traps he's setting up and how he's started to fool around with his victims (guy on the toilet).So for Jason, It's worth a quick watch. But I don't think I'd ever rewatch this movie.4/10 , sloppy all around the board.",Friday the 13th Part III
162,Beyondtherain,"The darkest one in the series, cannibalism, pregnant ladies, rape?",8,2 May 2020,"After part 2, a huge deformed man returns to camp and gets a Hockey Mask... And killing begins. Jason is downright creepy in this film. A real scary sequel.",Friday the 13th Part III
163,NerdBat,Bit less professional...,4,25 February 2018,"I just don't understand how after this many run ins with Jason, no one seems to realize that stabbing him in the leg will not render him helpless. It's the same thing over and over, the character stabs Jason, knocks him out, whatever, but never actually stops to think ""Well it didn't work the last 754839587 times so maybe this time he's still alive"". It's infuriating. I did like the addition of the criminal biker gang that gets involved, even if the black guy suddenly appearing in the barn later on in the film seemed to be a big lipped alligator moment. (No pun intended). Overall it was a relatively decent film, better than the first, but I would say not as good as the second. Finally however it does seem Jason has finally picked up his trademark hockey mask. That was a good turning point I guess. Well, guess it's time to watch the final chapter now.",Friday the 13th Part III
164,ryangilmer007,"""The Real Mask"" and Friday's in general",7,7 May 2000,"OK, I realise the mask part in my Part 2 comment could have been confusing because the sack used in part 2 is not the mask we all know and love, but alas, part 2's mask is gone and the real slaying begins...Onto the usual stuff-->This film is old, there are a never ending string of sequels (including a new one where Jason is in space), this one is not even the original or even the original sequel, the video version does not even have the 3D effects, and the series really should have ended with part 4, (but...) aside from those facts, the original ""Jason with 'hockey' mask"" Friday is still an interesting idea with a few good scares (probably a couple more than the original 2 of the series mainly because of the music and some comedy), lots of gore, nude...etc... This movie and the series pales in comparision to the Halloween and Nightmare movies, simply because all of the Friday movies seem to be the same (and hence all of these comments seem to be the same, with minor differences, get the irony?--> love that irony). Anyway, The story-line does not transition from movie to movie with ease. True, this one along with the others in Parts 1-4 had transitions, but 1-4 use flashback scenes (not cinematic). Then 5-9 skipped the transitions and instead used flashback scenes to connect to Jason's grave or pre-original movie (part fives flashback does not even make sense) and with minor exceptions the later movies do not have (major) related story lines (even Jason (and his mother) disappears, in the 5th (in reality) and 9th (basically) ones, and he is the main guy).Anyway, this is one of the best in the series (top 5 anyway) because 1- it was the first to give Jason the ""Real""/hockey mask 2- it has juiced up music.  3- it even starts out by mind-bending the viewer (if you saw part 2, the beginning of this is not totally expected).  4- it is in 3D. 5- It even had Steve Minor (Friday director) in a cameo/newscaster role (thus it does have something to set it apart from the rest).In general, While none of the Friday's are terrible (5 and 9 probably being the worst), none of them are tense or suspensful or anything more than the routine slashing and killing. Part 3-D has juiced up music, but the same story. Part 8 has a new story twist, but no new music,etc... The better ones in the series add something (like strip monopoly, or Jason with mask, or Jason with 'hockey'/""real"" mask, or 3D, or a claustrophobic environment of a boat), but none of them seem to put it all together in one film.As horror goes, better than average, a good series, but not one of the greats.In general nothing special.Rating wise, three is better than the usual and it may be the best.However,  the 3D version would probably put it over the edge/tie with a latter in the series.",Friday the 13th Part III

It just ruins great films like these.My 4th fav Friday the 13th film, this one holds a lot of suspense. I believe this to be one of the more scarier Friday the 13th films for many reasons. One Jason strikes back the day after, two he's more deformed than ever, and 3 he finally gets his Hockey Mask from Shelly!? Anyway moving on, after the teens supposedly killed Jason in the 2nd Friday, 24 hours later, Jason seems to return to the camp grounds to continue his bloody hacking of horny, sex feasted, druggie teens. Some teens decide to go to the camp for campy fun. Jason then comes back with more haunting and hellish kills.Now I know some people have got a problem with the plot and are wondering why Steve Miner set Friday III 24 hours after Friday II. To be honest, shouldn't it be called Saturday the 14th. Oh well, in a way I do find that kinda creepy that he just stalks people 24 hours.There are some other things that might make people laugh and some silly scenes are displayed but oh well, it's a Jason film. And definitely one of his better ones. At times I did find the plot a bit wasted but oh well, it's not a major flaw.To be honest this was suspenseful. And like Friday's 1, 2, 4 & 6.

166,TheRadiobox,Copy + paste + 3D = Part 3,2,29 July 2020,"Friday the 13th Part 3 was once again directed by Steve Miner, written by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson, and stars Dana Kimmel, Paul Kratka, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers, Catherine Parks, Larry Zerner, David Katims, Rachel Howard, and Richard Brooker. It follows Jason Voorhees shortly after the events of Part 2 as he guess what? Kills more people. What a far-flung concept.Plotting is dismal, as is expected for a movie of the Friday franchise. After the murders near the new campsite, Jason Voorhees (Brooker) continues his killing spree, this time on a new group of people; including Christine, Rick, Debbie, Andy, Shelly, Vera, Chuck, and Chili (Kimmel, Kratka, Savage, Rogers, Parks, Zerner, Katims, and Howard). On their way to their retreat, Shelly gets into an argument with some bikers and knocks their bikes down. Later, the bikers try to burn down the barn that Shelly and his girlfriend Vera are in while Jason happens to be there. After this, Jason continues his series of murders, and the survivors must fight back; this time in 3D. WOAAAAAAHHH!Characters are pretty much the same as the last two movies, having the same archetypes and similar lack of depth, likability, and empathy. Christine is the only potentially interesting character, although her backstory is inconsistent with the timeline of events of the Friday series. She was assaulted by Jason Voorhees some years prior, leaving her with difficulties in intimate relationships, although she says this happened two years ago. Nothing happened two years ago, the events of Part 1 were five years ago, and Part 2 was the day prior to this movie. Way to go continuity guy. Everyone else is a stock character with nothing to them. Rick is Christine's generic boyfriend, Debbie and Andy are a couple, Shelly is a prankster, Vera exists, and Chuck and Chili are stoners. Woohoo. Do I even need to mention that most of the acting is bad?Scares once again do not exist. Since the characters are basically non-existent and barely acted, there is absolutely no reason to care about what happens to them. Since the movie is a typical slasher-horror, there is no tension, you know what is going to happen. Even though tension could still exist despite a predictable plot, it never materializes, leaving the audience to essentially stare at the exact same movie as the last one. Music is still relied on like a crutch to a cripple, it is overbearing when a kill is about to come; effectively removing the last potential ounce of terror from a script, characters, and plot of a movie that already had nothing to work with. It is a horrible end result. But this time it is in 3D. AWIFHAGANDJWOWOWOWOWOWOW!Technically the movie is on the weaker end. Clearly the most effort went into the kills, of which only a handful are decent looking, which makes the ones in the first look masterful. Lighting is pathetic, everything lit like a school play. I guess that makes sense given the crew behind the production but it hardly excuses the mess that is this movie. The music is better than the first, and Jason is a more intimidating villain with an actual presence instead of being merely a POV shot until the end of the movie. Sound design for the kills is odd as well, none of them feel particularly gruesome, which takes even more away from them. The 3D looks terrible, which should surprise precisely zero people.See how I copied and pasted most of my review of Part 2 onto this one? That is the single most accurate description of this movie that I could possibly give you. But in case I didn't mention it, this one WAS IN 3D. WOOOOOOOAAAAAH!25/100",Friday the 13th Part III

I'm guessing they got snickers in the theaters too when the movie came out!It's all routine otherwise, with the one last character left at the end against Jason (that ain't much of a spoiler!). The ending does work, but you have to get through an hour of silliness to get to it. I thought that ""Part II"" was the best installment of the series, personally.It's funny that make-up legend Tom Savini is shown in a magazine article, but the more-feeble-this-time makeup effects are by others. Instead of having Savini getting a homage, better to have had him working on the film!Plus, all the 3-D silliness leaves a fair amount of the film kind of hazy image wise, even with the High-Definition transfer showing on EPIX.p.s.

This is the third chapter in the iconic horror/slasher Friday the 13th mega franchise. It is a direct sequel to part II although features no characters beyond Jason himself from previous films. This is the only film of the franchise to be shown in 3D and it certainly shows. This is the height of 3D at its most gimmicky and every other scene has something obviously poking out at the audience trying to attain that obvious effect. In most cases it is laughably bad or just plain cheesy. Once again a band of young people gather at Crystal Lake to have some good old fashioned teenage fun, but one by one they start falling in gruesome style to the maniacal killer Jason. All of the characters here are silly archetypes and do not go much beyond superficial tropes. They even have three people show up as some sort of motorcycle gain to add some menace and give Jason more people to kill. They look like 'Purple Rain' rejects. Their aesthetic does not age well. About the only good thing in this film is that they finally stumble across giving Jason his hockey mask which is probably one of the most identifiable horror props in movie history. Jason is singularly connected with this specific mask and it remains that way to this day.
The final girl here has a back story where she once got assaulted by a monstrous looking individual, but no one believed her and she is still traumatized by that. Not surprising, when she is finally confronting Jason he reveals his face to her which reveals that he was the guy who attacked her all those years ago. Well she gets the last laugh as final girls are apt to do by supposedly killing him... not so spoiler alert. As we know these days Jason is not one to stay deceased for long, but he is deceased at least for the remainder of the film. The girl has some disturbing visions that mainly serve as callbacks to the other films.
This was a pretty significant box office success at the time, but really is quite a horrible film. The acting is bad and nothing about the script or direction is inspired. It relies way to heavily on 3D technology as a gimmick and the film is saturated with that gimmick. No character development exists at all so we don't care at all for these people. It is so silly and laughable that nothing here is menacing or scary and even the gory aspects are simply eye rolling. There is little to nothing positive about this film. I really think the only thing is discovering the iconic hockey mask. The rest of this movie is a dumpster fire.

172,tom_koopa,"Not that good sadly, but has a few highlights",5,30 November 2009,"Friday the 13th part III isn't really a good entry in the series. I liked it's two prequels more. Why? Part III doesn't really deliver anything new. There are a few nice, little scenes that do work, but for the most part the movie consists of awful acting, boring characters and a weak story.About the only good thing in the film is Jason, who evolves even more since his last picture. He gets his trademark ice hockey mask in this movie too.So if you are a fan of Jason, go watch it; but there aren't really any other reasons to watch this.5 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th Part III
173,shaun98,More of the same,4,2 October 2002,"*some spoilers*The third ""Friday"" film is pretty standard as slasher movies go. It's just like the previous entries; plotless and often tedious, but with fairly entertaining climaxes. I have to admit the ending made me jump once, and the next-to-last scene actually managed to grip me. However, up till then, I kept getting impatient, waiting for things to get going. After dispatching that white-trash couple, Jason doesn't even kill any of these young people till the movie is nearly half-over. In the interim, we have to put up with that awful motorcycle gang, which is a subplot introduced merely to provide Jason with more fresh bodies; at least they get killed off before annoying us too much. Still, the deaths themselves aren't too bad. Best of the lot: the part with the spear-gun.This is the very first film where Jason wears his now-legendary hockey mask, since revered as one of the icons of horror. It is interesting to note that the infamous killer is still more or less human at this point in the series. Towards the end, he is stabbed, and actually shrieks in pain. It's a far cry from the nearly invulnerable ""undead"" Jason who would haunt the later sequels. It even strongly implies that he has raped the heroine in the recent past. While few have cared to ponder his sexuality, it is certainly plausible that part of his rage stems from repressing his basic urges.""Friday the 13th, Part 3"" arguably has the best-looking heroine in the bunch, played by Dana Kimmell. At this point, it is very well-known that she had requested that the producers cut down on all the violent and sexual material in the script. If that is the case, one wonders why she agreed to appear in the film at all. Didn't she know that it's a slasher movie, and that people would expect graphic violence? Still, she does an okay job, at least for this type of movie. The young characters are at least more sympathetic than their counterparts in subsequent sequels. I was amused by the presence of an aging hippie, obviously a homage to Cheech and Chong.Looking at some of the shots, it's clear that the film was originally intended to be viewed in 3-D. I am aware that some midnight theaters still show it in this format. I suppose it plays better that way, but it's still a gimmick that obscures the fact that otherwise it's just an ordinary slasher that doesn't carry the series in any new or unexpected direction. And is it just me, or do all cheesy 1980's horror sequels have to have flashbacks? Is this a law or something? Most of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies had them. Even ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" did. Surely there must be a better way to carry the plots forward?*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",Friday the 13th Part III

176,chucknorrisfacts,One of the better sequels...,4,14 October 2007,"""Friday the 13th Part III"" is the film in which Jason finally gets his trademark hockey mask, and thus creating a horror movie icon. The movie was made with 3D film, which I guess is sort of a throwback to the old 1950s movies of yesteryear. The effects are still evident even if you aren't wearing those cheesy 3D glasses, when you see such items as arrows and popcorn make their way at the screen.Overall, the film is a definite improvement over the first two films in the series. If you're looking for something different plot wise, you won't find it here. All the ""Friday the 13th"" movies are basically the same, you've seen one and you've seen them all. However, they are still worth watching if only to say you've seen 'em.Will Jason ever die? Probably not, at least not until the grosses go down. Then they'll just remake 'em all from the beginning. Rent it if you want, it is certainly one of the better sequels in the series, but that's not saying much.",Friday the 13th Part III
177,ihateeverymovieisee,See What It Feels Like To Be Psychic,1,4 August 2003,"OK. I honestly don't see why they didn't stop making these movies here. The stereotypical characters add a somewhat comedic appeal to the film, but other than that, the movie is utterly ridiculous. I would suggest this film to people who are curious to understand the attachment Jason has with that hockey mask of his. Even though this film is in 3D, it isn't worth the watch. It could have been made into virtual reality and still been stupid. The story is way too predictable. If you want to see what it feels like to be psychic- watch this! You'll know everything that's going to happen before it does. This movie is that poorly done! Also the characters are so underdeveloped that you don't really care if they end up living or dying. This movie is bad, but much better than the ones that follow it until part 8. Either way, watch it if you must, but you won't be missing out if you don't see it.

178,jed-estes,A Way to Live 3,10,8 August 2006,"Three films in as many years. Wow Paramount was rushing these at a break-neck speed. This one however rushed is better than part two. This film is the one that gave Jason his hockey mask and put him into the nightmares of children for decades to come. Dana Kimbell does a great job in this film as Chris the new last girl. She even gives Jason something to remember by, with the famous Ax Cut wound to the head she inflicts on Jason giving him a chip on his mask that is still there today even though he has changed out masks no less than three times sine then. Richard Broker as Jason does a fine job in all the murder scenes and the walk he does rules. He does not run like the last guy. Richard is third only to Kane Hodder who is number one and Ted White who is number 2. Thats good for there having been seven guys to play the role. Now as for Steve Miner, I don't know how he did it. It's certainly a fluke because this is the only good film the man has ever directed. This film being in 3-D takes something away from the DVD edition, but in the theater I'm sure it was something to relish. I pray to Jesus and Paramount Studios that someday they will release this thing uncut, with the alternate endings and in 3-D AMEN LORD STUDIO HEAD!!!",Friday the 13th Part III

At least in this one he is still a human (later parts he seems like an alien) he has strength to commit great murders in a variety of ways unlike Michael myers (Butcher knife) Jason is back to his old habits at Crystal Lake killing any counsillours who dare to step on to his area. Of course like all Friday the 13th's there is blood and gore and of course an essential for horror movies sex, and the post sex killings. He still has a motive in this one unlike the later one which are just made so they could slice and dice a few teenagers and have sex. Watch this one, the best of the lot!!",Friday the 13th Part III

Steve Miner once again directed and did a great job once again. the final 20 minutes of the film are so classic, Dana Kimmell beats the hell out of Jason, she knocks a bookshelf on him, stabs him in the leg and arm, it's him over the head with a log, hits him with a shovel, hangs him, then finally puts an axe in his head. i give the movie 8/10. and most of the reason for the 8 is for Dana Kimmell who was just so great, and the movie is good for some scares. check this one out you'll be happy with the outcome. oh yeah and when Jason's mother pulls her into the lake at the end, that was a dream part since MRS.

Wrong. Instead of counselors this time, we are treated to a motley crue gang of partiers who have nothing on their minds except sex, alcohol and drugs. This is where the slasher film started applying more cardboard cutout actors/actresses and then letting them drop like flies to the maniacal Jason. Although there are flaws, I enjoyed this installment very much, the campiness and corny actors/actresses made it a fun watch. The inclusion of Jason's notable hockey mask is in this film. I suggest, if you can find it, purchasing the 3-D format DVD released by Paramount recently. It is a treat to watch this film the way it was supposed to be watched in the first place, I feel slasher fans have been cheated by being given the 2-D version for so many years. You can tell by watching in 3-D how dependent Director Steve Miner was on getting shots that created a lot of 'depth' to the picture so that the 3-D spectacles we wear would enhance those shots when we watch them. Honestly, this film was made to be watched in 3-D and 3-D only. I really feel that if paramount sold this film to the public only in its 3-D version in the first place, then the rating this film already receives (which I think is poor) would be quite a bit higher than what it is rated as. 10 out of 10.

I wonder what he looks like these days. I really wish I could have seen this movie in 3d but since this movie was made in 1982 I wasn't even close enough to be allowed to see this movie.  It is never the same when watching it on tape compared to the big screen.  I mean you can't really tell much where the 3d parts are anymore. I see a few now and then.  Maybe it's because I have really bad eye site for a 27 year old.  Who knows?  This isn't that bad of a movie really.  It could have been better but this WAS made in the 80's people and didn't have the technology back then.  It's about some kids going to a house a friend owns.  She supposedly survived Jason's attack (which makes you wonder why she wasn't in a previous Friday movie) and is really jumpy about returning.  She thinks she sees Jason and doors move by themselves,which would really freak me out. Two of the friends go to town and have a little run in with a motorcycle gang. Shelly runs over their motorcycle and drives away.  Later in the movie the bikers came up to the cabin (just wondering how they knew where they were staying at) and sucked the gasoline out of the van.

Jason looks a lot bigger in this sequel and since he gets the hockey mask for the first time, he looked really funny with the mask and big bald head.The 3-D effects were fun, I like a previous poster on this forum, saw it recently with cardboard glasses in a theater where everyone in attendance were cracking up the whole 96 minutes.  But since the film was projected so tiny, taking up only a quarter of the screen, it should have been like 3 bucks instead of 8.50.  I saw both The Terminator and Rocky in re-release and only paid 3 bucks a ticket.The acting in this one like most Friday the 13th's is pretty bad.  I know horror films don't need A-list Hollywood actors, but they should of found people with some talent.  The gore was acceptable, though we've all seen better.Some people say this is the highest grossing 3-D film, but it made 36 million, while Jaws 3-D made around 41-42 million.On an 80's horror film level, Friday the 13th Part 3 is high up on the charts.",Friday the 13th Part III

A much scarier Jason than the sack-head from Part 2. How he gets it you'll have to watch and see for yourself...OK, Part 3 starts off showing the last scene from Part 2 to get us caught back up on the action. From that we are introduced to a couple who own a small store that is built in with their house. Also it appears that the woman owns the man as well, as she is very cranky and complaining about him. We kind of feel sorry for the guy, but we want Jason to shut that B***h up! Well, we know what happens to story-filling actors, so let's move on to the naive teens down on the farm...Horrible acting here. This is what sets this film back from Part 2. I wanted to like the characters, but the only two I really could say that I liked was Shelly and Chris. And it wasn't really their acting (because like I said, the acting was pitiful), but I liked the characters. Shelly was the curly-headed guy that played all the horrible jokes that everyone else seemed to hate (but I liked them). And of course Chris was our heroine. Another thing the film fails to do is catch us up on what happened to Chris when her parents found her. We basically had to fill in our own thoughts there. She was attacked by a man in the woods. Well, yeah...Jason obviously, and that becomes apparent when she sees his face again near the end of the movie and says, ""It's you! It can't be! You're dead!"" ...or something like that. One scene I found funny was when Chris was hiding in the closet upstairs, and after Jason chopped at the door with an ax, she came at him with the knife slashing and stabbing him in the leg...Jason grunted and moaned! The biker gang could have been a nice touch if they would have been used a little differently. But then again, story-filling actors play story-filling roles... And Rick the hick, I wanted him dead from the moment his character was introduced! Oh, and the scene near the end with Mrs. Voorhees coming out of the water, IMO, was either just a dream Chris was having, or it was to pay homage to the original Friday the 13th when Jason did the same thing at the end of it.All in all, this is one of the weaker films in the series thanks to some horrific acting and bad characters. The only true bright spot was Jason getting his mask. I would have liked to give it a higher rating than 5 out of 10, but the acting was just that damn bad...",Friday the 13th Part III

I was loving it and than this swanky music takes over the credits with 3d visuals. Arrrrggg I knew the best was behind even though we have a bevy of beautiful brunettes on tap and some of the best innovative kills of the entire series.

197,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,The Iconic Hockey Mask - Friday the 13th Part III Review,9,13 March 2020,"It's Friday the 13th! It has become a tradition to watch one of these every Friday the 13th, and after checking out the first two, part 3 was the next one on the list. Let me just quickly tell you my thoughts of the first two: Part 1 had some good kills and a terrifying killer, but the characters where lacking. Part 2 I did not like the first time, but the second time I had a blast watching it. Now let's move on to part 3.I really enjoyed Jason in this film, and I thought the connection between him and the ""Final Girl"" made for a more tense final act. Kills/Practical effects where impressive, and there were moments of suspense as well. Sure the film is a bit slow the first 50 minutes or so, but I still enjoyed it. My only real problem with the film is some of the characters. The final girl I think stands out since she can outsmart Jason in situations, but no other character stood out that much. Somewhere just there to get killed, and one quite annoying character only existed in the film so that we could have like 2 surprising moments and give Jason the hockey mask. I can't go in to this character though since I could give away some plot points.In summary, my only real problem with this film was most characters, but then again, characters in slasher films are rarely anything to write home about. If you decide to watch this one, you will probably have a good time. It's my personal favorite out of the original 3 films. 7/10 from me.",Friday the 13th Part III
198,influxtwo,Genre classic,7,3 October 2021,"The first 2 whether ironic or not, are genre classics; and this third film is pure horror fun. It's wacky, bombastic, and suspenseful. Great score as usual with this series. And a good lead actress and ensemble. This is a campy, pun intended, classic madman slasher, icon realized and revealed. Totally a camp classic. What more can I say. The series was able to go from spooky and suspenseful, to an all out crazy train. And it's no wonder this series is as enjoyed as it is. You either appreciate this series or you don't. It is a genre classic.",Friday the 13th Part III
199,Jesse-45,Horay for Jason!,10,6 September 1999,"A new group of teenagers have come to Jason's wilderness. Higgins Haven is the setting for my favorite Friday The 13th movie. There are many reasons for Part III, being my favorite. It has the most atmospheric of the series, is one of the reasons. The movie, also has some of the best death scenes and the most colorful characters of the series. Jason gets his hockey mask for the first time, of course.I love all of the Fridays, but the first four are the best. The stories are very close together in the first four. Making them great sequelizations. However after Part IV, the stories are not as close together. But the later ones are very entertaining. Part VIII, is my favorite of the later Fridays. Still, if it were up to me, I'd somehow bring Jason back as his classic figure in the first four. The first four, seem to be Jason's goldest years. James Robinson was actually going to bring this classic image of Jason back. As well as bringing back Freddy as he was in his early movies, for Freddy Vs. Jason. But Robinson was fired. Part III is the best!",Friday the 13th Part III
200,ChrisTreborn,"Jason-Entry 2: ""80's Horror Thrillers SUCKS even in 3 Dimensioned !""",1,26 May 2005,"I like horror movies but I hate 80's slasher thrillers.Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D (Spoilers******) Director Steve Miner who directed the revisited F13th second part returns once again to tell the continuing story of Jason Voorhees, this time the third installment of Friday Franchise in a new way, with 3 Dimension.For those People who came late, the original film tells the story of a psychotic woman Pamela Voorhees who lost her child Jason in the Crystal Lake camp. She eliminates a group of teenagers who have come to reopen the camp, but in the end she dies. Then in the second chapter her son comes back as a grownup (masked) man taking revenge for his mother. (In my view since sequels II-III-IV occurs on same continuing periods, they can closely consider as F13th SECOND PART TRILOGIES!).This sequel starts from where the previous film left off, continuing from same day of the last movie, Jason wakes up from the machete stabbing then walks towards for the next mission. With a body count of 12 and some chilling 3D promoting camera works with very excellent unexpected scary moments, this sequel features a different tone on Friday franchise.Scripted by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson, did their best for extending Jason's image as a horror icon. The killings, the camera pans, and the situations they wrote for the screen were good but the problem comes from the story narration. There are lots of boring moments, stupid dialogues, and silly cheap suspense we have to go through for getting some thrilling scenes. Or did they aped those 80's usual suspense tricks.Soul of the movie is provided by Harry Manfredini, in this chapter he done a nice job for creating tensions especially in those chasing scenes. Editing by George Hively was not good but O.K when it comes to 3D setting views.And as for the second chance of Jason, the man behind the mask, Richard Brooker did a great tremendous work. His effort to play Jason by keeping that character as the same maniac, but adding an unexpected scary element was just outstanding. Having an historical importance, in this movie Jason first time wore the now-familiar hockey mask.Richard Brooker was the first one to appear in the most appreciated outfit of Jason. He was good on that mask, and also in unmask scenes. Last moments while he appears with his own JASON face, totally AWESOME! Brooker was the first one who added the Scarier element to the HORROR ICON Jason.Overall it's a great movie if you can bear with some uneasy boring moments. The last 30 minutes have the best moments, especially Chris (Dana Kimmel) boat scene seeing Jason in the window was the greatest moments in this movie! But anyway I can't take it's typical 80's boring suspense works so ""I give this movie 1 out of 10"".Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D = Scarier this time, but Sucking, same time.",Friday the 13th Part III

I found it to be fairly fast paced with some good characters and some very good death sequences too!!! Jason finally gets his trademark hockey mask in this one, and it makes him look even more mean as he goes on his killing spree! This certainly isn't the best film of the series but it's a good effort and should please most horror fans, and should certainly please fans of the Friday 13th series. 6/10 for this one.",Friday the 13th Part III
203,GluStick,I don't know why they bothered.,1,9 October 1999,"This, of course, sucks. I don't know why Paramount would give the ok for this sequel to two other movies that were stupid anyway. Jason is more of the same in this gory slasher. Maybe if they made these movies without putting in much of what we've already seen than it might have been better. Maybe there is a reason why it sucks: third time is NOT a charm. We didn't have much fun with Halloween III: Season of the Witch or Alien3 or Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. Why does the third movie in a horror series suck? I don't know and probably never will. The plot has Jason still killing kids who just want to have sex, take drugs, and listen to rock 'n roll. What's so wrong with that? The 3D stuff would have been cool to see, though. Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D: F",Friday the 13th Part III
204,changingshades,How could anyone find this scary,2,17 July 2001,"I just saw this movie at a special showing and I did get to see this in 3D. This movie is quite bad. I mean really really bad. It is still not as bad as Manos and Hudson Hawk, but is still quite bad.  This movie tries to use the 3D effect but mostly its just cheesy. I mean it only used the effect ten times to any effect through out the movie and one of them was someone putting up laundry. Don't get me wrong a couple of times it worked great.  The Harpoon was excellent if not still quite cheesy.  Watching this movie with people that know how bad is was great, but I have to review this movie based on its artistic merits, which it had none. I'd give the experience a 9 because it was funnier than anything the Wayans have ever attempted but I give the movie a 2",Friday the 13th Part III
205,pleiades10,Weak entry in the series,4,15 August 2000,"This sequel isn't much better than the myriad of Friday the 13th imitators that were clogging up theatres and cable TV by this time in the early 80's.The story is only slightly different, the killer this time is terrorizing teenagers staying at a residence near the fabled Camp Crystal Lake. The filmmakers don't even try to hide the killer's identity, and as a result, there is very little suspense in this film.The movie was shown in the theatres as a 3-D movie, and certain scenes do still have a 3-D-ish quality to them, even when viewed on a standard television. These scenes range from somewhat effective (the harpoon...), to goofy and frivolous (the popcorn, the laundry line pole).The ending though, still has me scratching my head after all these years. Not to give anything away, but one of the last scenes in the original Friday the 13th is recreated, just with a different ghoul... Cool effect, but completely unexplainable given the plot of the earlier films.",Friday the 13th Part III
206,jhigginbotham151,It could have been better.,6,11 May 2014,"This was a really great entry in the series. Jasons got his famous mask, all the characters are pretty likable and enjoyable to watch, and kills are all really creative and the blood and gore is on full display. But it could have been better.The writing really makes the acting seem total garbage here, its not, trust me that it isn't. The acting isn't grade A level stuff but for the Friday series its pretty good but some of the Dialogue is just utter trash, like a monkey tried to write what he hears humans say, I don't think Brando could have made some of the lines sound natural.The 3D is also a pain in the ass. In 3D it gets irritating after about half an hour or so, and in 2D its utterly pointless and makes the film look really crappy, just a crap load of stuff from rakes, eyeballs, yo- yos, all of the above really being shoved into the camera. Makes you wish 3D was never invented really.The final is good old fashioned horror fun. Bodies being found all over the place, killer getting ever closer and the final 2 minutes or so are really disturbing. An unmasked Jason banging at the window is actually terrifying which considering this is the same character that went to space (in Jason X) thats surprising. Overall, could have been better but as it stands, its still a good entry in a mixed franchise.",Friday the 13th Part III
207,phoenixyk1,A good movie - But now the story was beginning to break...,6,28 September 2014,"Despite the name of the film... It actually takes place the next day which makes sense... It is generally more of the same as parts 1 and 2, so no real surprises.Jason does get more inventive with weapons in this one which is nice to see - And you also begin to get an idea of just how powerful he is even without a blade to use.Obviously, this film was born in the heyday of the first attempts at 3D - I will not insult it by discussing that too much... It is so obvious that areas where they desperately wanted you to go ""WOW IT LIKE ITS COMING OUT OF THE SCREEN AT ME!!!"" and that is a major NO NO!!!! Even now this just screws up but thankfully newer directors have figure this out and have learnt to use 3D to much better effect...But hell, this was an early effort and we had no real idea...With that said, there are moments which I dare to say the Director/ Producers never intended 3D effects as such where if you are viewing in 3D - IT WORKS BRILLIANTLY! While far from the strongest of the films so far... It has great scary moments and keeps to its tried and tested formula.",Friday the 13th Part III
208,The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan,Jason Vorrhees in 3-D!.........Yeah.,5,9 July 2010,"Friday the 13th Part III-3D is not bad. Sure if you get the 2-D DVD you will find that there are a bunch of things coming out at you. But there's no 3-D so nothing truly is coming out at you, but luckily there is a 3-D DVD that got released last year, that comes with 2 pairs of glasses. Needless to say the 3-D does not work to well, unless you are standing far enough away. (To bad they could not use the Real-D 3-D glasses) This movie was released during the 1980's 3-D craze. When 3-D was a cheap gimmick instead of an expensive gimmick. No that we have all of that out of the way let's get on to the actual film. The acting is corny, and all the characters (except for Jason) are pretty forgettable. No one really sticks out except for the slasher himself. Next is the plot. It's an okay plot. but unfortunately does not stick out in the series. The only thing memorable about this film is that this is where Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. He would have this for the rest of the series. The effects in this movie are good, for the most part. So in the end, this is an okay slasher film so check it out if you want.",Friday the 13th Part III
209,latherzap,Cool theme music,3,7 August 2003,"While Friday the 13th films all pretty much suck on some level, part three is slightly more entertaining than most. I give it a 4 out of 10.Forget scares, 'cause there isn't much of that to be found. What you do get is a pretty efficient demonstration of horror cliches.  I found it amusing how cardboard the characters were.  One scene features two guys juggling. Two other scenes feature a character walking on his hands. You get the feeling the director asked all the actors what ""tricks"" they could do, in a desperate attempt to make the characters more interesting. Two of the characters are the stereotypical stoners. One girl is deemed pregnant in a conversation near the beginning- this info sorta distinguishes her from the other women, but the subject is never dealt with again.  We are also treated to two scenes of somebody using a toilet, just another time-filling substitute for actual dialogue.   As lame as the characters are written, I don't think the actors are all that bad. Except for Dana Kimmell's sweater-wearin' boyfriend. His acting is very flat. He sucks, but that's what makes him cool.    The unironic script also treats us to two different characters in two scenes saying the same thing (""Where's this coming from?"") for different reasons (blood from a body above, water dripping from the floor above). And perhaps the most awkward line is when a girl,speaking of a past run-in with Jason, says ""he had a knife... and he attacked me with it!"".  It's not a hilarious movie, but is funny at times. If you first saw it as a little kid in the '80s, ""nostalgia"" can be your ready-made excuse for watching it now.  But anybody else watching this has some serious explaining to do.",Friday the 13th Part III
210,arturopanduro,Three-dimensional Jason!,6,17 February 2003,"The last of the scary ones, ""Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D"" is one of the best in the series. The plot does have some holes in it and sometimes the acting leaves a lot to be desired, but the interesting component of the film is its use of 3-D. Don't let the 3-D aspect fool you into thinking the movie is bad (as in ""Jaws 3-D"" & ""Amityville 3-D""). The film is great; as far as these type of slasher flicks go. Highly recommended.",Friday the 13th Part III
211,Cole_Early,This is where it starts to narrow down.,8,25 June 2007,"The Jason saga starts to decline here, but we can't ignore the significance of the first time that Jason acquires his hockey mask. It seems that now, Jason has gotten himself his official stalker/slasher mask. That's too bad- I, personally, liked the whole bag-over-the-face mask thing that he wore in Part 2, but oh well.After this one, nothing really changes, but, hey, it can't really hurt to see them all. This one's pretty good, and it still contains all of the great and famous bloody gore, sex, suspense, and rage of Jason.The thing about it, though... eh... the characters aren't all that lovable. They're all cocky, arrogant snobs, ('cept maybe two of them), that think that they're of higher importance than any one else in the world. Ah well. Stalk 'em n' slash 'em!",Friday the 13th Part III
212,nuhc,My favorite Friday the 13th,4,30 October 2007,"Just caught this on TV last night, since it's close to Halloween. This is my favorite Friday the 13th movie probably because it's the first one I ever saw. It's got the standard morality tale (young kids go away for a weekend of sex & drugs & get killed because of it) and this is the sequel in which the hockey mask first appears, giving Jason his scary persona for the rest of the movies.The movie was filmed in 3D, and it sort of works on the small screen, but must have been a blast to see in the theater. The part where Jason is squeezing Rick's head and his eye pops out must have looked really cool in 3D.That being said, I can really only give this movie 4 stars since, after all, it IS a Friday the 13th movie. The plot is the same as almost all the sequels: Group of young kids shows up at Crystal lake, Jason shows up & starts killing people, young heroine survives to kill Jason in the end, only to have him brought back to life in the next sequel. The acting, while OK for a Friday the 13th movie, would be sub-par in any other. Some of the special effects are obvious, such as when the girl gets hit in the eye with the spear fired from the spear gun, you can tell she's wearing makeup over her eye. But all in all, it's a fun movie if you keep in mind it's just a Friday the 13th movie.",Friday the 13th Part III
213,theskylabadventure,Jason's Big Rip Off,3,7 January 2008,"Let's be honest. No one with a modicum of common sense would approach a movie like this and expect it be any good, in the strictest sense of the word. There are, however, at least two things which one expects to see in a cheesy slasher flick. The first is some serious gore, the second is boobies. Unlike most of the films in the Friday 13th series, this pathetic entry fails to deliver the goods on both counts.The plot is hilarious. It seems that, in spite of the savage murders that occurred at Camp Crystal Lake both last year and the year before (as well as the murders fifteen years earlier), yet another group of unsuspecting and apparently mindless teenagers go to the camp for a bit of fun and frivolity. In a huge twist, Jason returns from the dead - again - and starts killing them.As always, the first seven minutes of the film is just a replay of the last seven minutes of Part 2. One can't help but think that they were trying desperately to bump up the lousy running time, and they still couldn't make it to 90 minutes. If you think that's a rip off, keep watching.The only interesting thing about this film is that this is where Jason pioneered the iconic ""killer in a hockey mask"" look, having opted for a hessian sack over his head in the second instalment of the series. This is mildly diverting for about 30 seconds but is a long way from saving this turkey.The murders are all pretty tame here compared to the first two movies. Most of the violence happens off screen as the scenes all cut away just as the blade (or weapon of choice) is about to hit. We get to see the bodies afterwards, but there's nothing even remotely shocking about most of the shots here. The one exception is a body sliced almost in half (from the groin up), delicately balanced on a roof support beam. Personally, I couldn't help thinking what a lot of effort it must have been for Jason to lift the body up there and balance it just right, but by this point I was seriously bored.The real tragedy of this schlock-fest is that, despite the presence of some fairly hot (in an 80s way) teenage girls, none of them get their baps out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is a flagrant violation of horror movie etiquette not to mention the fact that we had all come to expect some boob from this series as if by right! Ultimately, for me, this proved to be the last straw.This is a movie for die hard Jason fans only as it is easily the weakest in the series. If you've seen any of the Friday 13th, you'll know just how great a compliment that is.",Friday the 13th Part III
214,helencmm,My favourite installment so far.,8,24 August 2019,"I really enjoyed watching this film. Almost all the time happens the first film of a franchise to be the best, and many times I also had this opinion, but in this case I don't agree at all.This film had everything that I'm seeking for a slasher film. The flow of the plot is good, we have more sympathetic characters here, thing which I found very surprising. The protagonist (final girl) is way better than the one of the original film, because of the most important reason: SHE COULD ACT! I hate when they pick actors with no talent at all. Hopefully we don't have this problem here.One thing that I didn't liked the acting skills of a specific actress. The good thing is that she is not the protagonist. I talk about the one that plays Chili. In the first film I didn't liked at all the acting of the actress who was playing Alice. She was really annoying. In this chapter, we talk about a very bad acting of her, but hilarious too.The kills were pretty good I can say, not frightening at all. It's less gory than the first two chapters. Maybe they tried to get rid of the MPAA thing. So the gore is minimal (we mostly see the aftermath), there are many fake and real jump scares, and of course the music score is there.I really liked one of the last scenes where Jason smiles. I'm not going to say something more, except that it was very creepy.One of the last scenes contain a reference to the first film. Unnecessary in my opinion.The only thing that I didn't liked, is something that I hate generally in slasher films. Specifically, I talk about the fact that all the characters when they're attacked, NEVER fight for their lives, except of the final girl, of course. It's a cliché that must stop.Overall, I think it's one of the best (if not the best) film of the series, although I heard many negative reviews, but it's just my opinion. I generally recommend this franchise, it's a good classic.",Friday the 13th Part III

Other than that its just more campers getting slaughtered in gory and effective results. I still enjoyed this entry even though it was not as good as part 1 or 2. The only thing I didn't like is that Part 3 was originally released in 3D and the video version isn't, so some of the 3D gimmicks and kills look absurd. This sequel will still please fans.",Friday the 13th Part III
216,lonchaney20,"""I have warned thee!""",7,15 May 2010,"Not as good as number 2 but definitely more fun. This was the first of the series not only to have the hockey mask but also to feature a hulking Jason (rather than the average guy he was in number 2...well, sort of average....). Also, since Ralph from the previous films is dead, they had some random bum lying in the middle of the road as the Doomsayer. He's hilarious not only because his scene starts off innocently enough, but also because he doesn't have any other scenes and because (for some unexplained reason) he carries around a disembodied eye. I really wish this guy would've been in one of the sequels, but I guess he just didn't have the same impact on viewers that crazy Ralph did. Also, like number 2, this attempts to ape the final scare from the first film. But the results are, to put it lightly, moronic. Besides the nutty homeless guy, the only character I really like in this one is Shelly. He's the token nerd who's significant for two reasons. One, he's hilarious. His incessant and gruesome practical jokes (possibly ripped from Pete Walker's ""proto-slasher"" The Flesh and Blood Show) annoy his friends so much that I'm surprised they still talk to him. Two, his character is the one who brings along the hockey mask that Jason goes on to wear in all the sequels! So this is indeed a very important character. The others annoy me to no end. Dana Kimmell as Chris is one of the worst heroines in Friday history. Every word out of her mouth sounds so snotty that I'd swear she can't even help it. Her boyfriend, played by Paul Kratka, is as dumb as a bag of rocks. I'm willing to forgive him only because he has the coolest, most eye-popping death scene in the movie. Come to think of it, I also kind of liked the couple from the beginning of the movie, but they don't last too long. Steve Miner returns from the excellent Friday the 13th Part II, but his work here isn't quite as great. The frame is filled out nicely, and there's a number of moody tracking shots, but it falls victim to the film the movie around the 3D gimmick rather than manipulate the 3D gimmick to suit the movie. Still, there's a number of great moments. I love the first scene of Jason in his mask - the wide shots of him approaching the girl are very creepy, especially with that moody Manfredini score in the background.I was very excited to see this one in 3D, but sadly the DVD suffers from a sort of ""double vision"" effect, rendering the 3D almost worthless.

I may be ranting and raving but, would I do it about just anything?  I special ordered it just to see it for a second time!  The effects are great and the plotline is even better.

Basically the film is the same as any other entry, nothing new or exciting to offer, some of the acting is ok some is outwardly horrible.

219,Duzniak38,Jason Bursts Out Of Your Screen!,10,2 August 2006,"Friday the 13th Part III is lots of fun and also quite scary and gory at the same time. It's 3D appeal is very hard to find nowadays, as the DVD comes in a standard grainy 2D version. So look forward to many items jumping to the edge of your screen, but never quite out of it. Friday the 13th Part III is a very good movie; the music is fantastically creepy yet upbeat at the same time. The colours are very nice in this film, which shows a horror movie can have nice glowing colours without needing dark rooms to scare the audience. The acting varies, Dana Kimmell as Chris is one of the most appealing and convincing heroines throughout the Friday the 13th series, and she pulls off a very genuinely terrified young woman, being terrorised by Jason Voorhees. Jason Voorhees is also appealingly upgraded in this movie. He is big, sturdy, muscular and menacing; he is a big hulk of horror on two legs. And the legend also gains his infamous hockey mask in this movie. The characters are also very fun in the instalment. Some are humorous and make us feel sympathetic when they are killed off. Some are serious and are easily relatable to, so we also feel pity for them as well. There is also the annoying jester who we come to feel sorry for, and the rejecting bitch who gets her comeuppance. The locations in this movie are really picturesque and fits the Friday the 13th feel very well; a cosy, warm cabin snuggled up deep in the woods. The script is also upgraded as well. Humour and small jokes are inserted here and there, for relief and also to make us feel warm and closer to the characters. The gore is quite well handled in this movie; gruesome in parts and much more inventive in this film. It is enjoyable, however is much more appealing when the popcorn, eyeballs and yo-yo's are flying out of the screen. There are also background stories and flashbacks weaved into the main story, about Chris' past, which tries to give the movie more depth. This is quite unnecessary, but it still works well, and it doesn't bring the movie down in any way. It actually gives a reason as to why these teenagers are visiting these cabins. The ending has it's trademark surprise scare, so look out for that. This third movie in the series is an absolute pleasure.",Friday the 13th Part III

I'm not going to provide a synopsis since most other reviewers have and its easy to find but instead I will go over what this movie succeeds and fails at. First the movie succeeds in the atmosphere, thats something almost every film in the series does masterfully, next I actually liked the biker gang and found it interesting to include in the films. Next i of course enjoy Jason finally getting his iconic hockey mask. Finally some of the make up is good. The movie fails at a few things as well. First a lot of the characters aren't as likeable as in other films. There are a few goofy kills as well, main example the head crush, look it up it's not a spoiler just bad special effect. Also the film has the flashback introduction which is my least favorite part of these films. Overall would recommend especially if you like the series.",Friday the 13th Part III

I know a lot of people seem to like to complain about the acting, the acting in this film is not very good, not disgraceful, but  when you watch any of the Friday the 13th's or any movie, the focus should be on the plot and the story that follows. If it scares and you don't get bored with it, then its a good film. This film was not bad really, but the predictably is really what made me not like it so much. The film was scary, but they practically rehashed the whole first movie. I really wish I could have seen it in it in 3-D, because if you watch it on video, you can find the 3-D scenes, they look great, but you only get the 2-D effect. I give this movie 4.5 out of 10. Its not nearly as bad as Friday The 13th: (5) The New Beginning (1985)",Friday the 13th Part III
222,HOPSQUIAT,The opening credit alone are awesome!,7,10 September 2020,"I will preface this by saying that most of the movies in the Friday the 13th series are pretty much the same movie with slight changes. This movie does stand out though. The movie can be actually scary at times and this is Jason's first time rocking the iconic mask and he is great in the movie.Jason is scary and he looks menacing. His face reveal still makes me feel uncomfortable. He is really going off in this movie. This is one of the best Jason performances there was. This man was leaping out the way to avoid being hit by a truck. Jason was still agile I guess. He must have been training or something.You have to remember it came out a long time ago and the 3d can be cheesy at times especially watching the movie in its 2d format. Characters are just throwing stuff to the camera and dropping yoyos on the camera. Its pretty funny. Still its a fun 80s movie. No need to explain the plot, its nothing really new.The ending is pretty much the same as the first movie, BUT WITH A TWIST. It makes no sense. I guess its a dream or something...who knows.Its one of the best Friday sequels. Its 80s cheesy goodness. The soundtrack is groovy.",Friday the 13th Part III

224,bramb600,The 3D Ruined it,5,15 June 2009,"Despite giving the movie a bad review, it can still be watched just to laugh at how absurd it is.Now this movie happens to be in 3D and that really screws up the movie. The actors, who are terrible in the by the way, are constantly pointing their fingers and objects towards the camera in the hopes to amaze people with some 3D technology but they just end up giving you a massive headache. Totally cheesy too, but you have to laugh when someone does this which puts the movie in the so bad it's good category.The kills are actually pretty good, especially with the guy walking on his hands but they're just ruined by the fact that they're still pointing things at the camera as they die.However, I love how this movie shows the origin of the hockey mask which became the classic look of this murderer. The problem is that the mask looks very cheap looking and Jason pretty much looks like a normal guy of average height. He really should be taller and larger, because he didn't look scary at all.",Friday the 13th Part III
225,sn319,More Padding Than a Kotex Commercial,4,10 December 2014,"This movie is 95 minutes long. Cut six minutes out of that for recap (because this is a series that has a story so involving, you need a recap, let alone a recap longer than one given the season finale of an involved TV series) leaving us with 89 minutes. Cut about three minutes of that for the end credits. 86. Then cut the ten minute opening sequence of two shop owners who are killed by Jason and have nothing to do with the movie. So this is 76 minutes. Then you can cut any variety of bits and pieces out and you're left with a very bare bones film.A bunch of random teens get together to go to camp and get systematically murdered by Jason. The back of the box likes to tell me they are all camp counselors, the victims of Jason's attacks, but nowhere in the movie does it say. It seems that the revenge killing that was the driving force of the previous films has been replaced with killing for the heck of it.Despite the fact the plot is paper thin, the characters stale stereotypes (a jock, a loser, eighties bikers, potheads), and the movie is so padded out you could skip half of it, it still improves the series in a few ways. First of all, gone is the ""The cameraman's gonna kill you"" directing of the other two. I prefer to see the killer doing his stuff and rather than keep the killer behind the camera, we see him, making it a lot more exciting. Also, the gore is much better with a couple of ultra-ridiculous deaths rather than the boring ones of the previous two films.That said, the formula is getting stale. The ending of the woman surviving and going insane has gotten extremely boring. They could at least try to do a different ending. Instead, we're given a padded piece of crap that is, once again, a terrible movie overall but so bad it's good. Easy to riff, hard to take seriously.",Friday the 13th Part III

The acting is in this way good on of them is Dana Kimmell which acts very well.It is very beautiful nature and environment.

228,Horror_Metal,A terrific entry to the awesome Friday the 13th series!,10,4 October 2013,"Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) is a deformed maniac who lives at Camp Crystal Lake, where he kills anyone who happens to be there. Jason supposedly drowned as a young boy several years earlier but he keeps coming back somehow and can't seem to be stopped. After the survivor of his last massacre is taken away to the hospital, some new camp counselors arrive. These counselors include Chris (Dana Kimmell), Rick (Paul Kratka), Debbie (Tracy Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), and the goofy prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner). As soon as they arrive, the young counselors engage in having sex, drinking, and smoking pot. Jason isn't about to let them go about their fun in his territory, so he ditches the potato sack that he used to wear on his head in favor of a hockey mask (stolen from Shelly) and begins brutally killing the teens one by one! Chris has a history with Jason and encountered him years before. Will she have what it takes to face the evil man from her past?The Friday the 13th series has to be the greatest horror franchise of all time simply because, in my opinion at least, none of the entries are absolutely terrible (well, except Jason X). Sure some of them aren't as good as others but compared to most horror sagas, pretty much every installment here is great or at least very entertaining. Part 3 is no exception, and features some of the greatest moments of the whole series. This is where Jason first obtains his iconic hockey mask that he wears throughout the rest of his movies. That mask has since become one of the most recognized items in horror history! The characters in this film are some of the best of the whole series as well, with the prank loving jokester Shelly being a favorite of mine. Richard Brooker is a great Jason and in my opinion a huge improvement over Steve Dash, who played Mr. Voorhees in the previous film. If you were only going to watch five Friday the 13th films, definitely make this one of them as it is a spectacular entry to the series!",Friday the 13th Part III
229,ShadySovereign,Jason's causing chaos once again!,7,11 March 2006,"I remember first viewing this ""Friday the 13th"" sequel on videotape, and in the beginning I thought it was stupid. But now, after seeing it again on DVD, I have changed my mind about the movie. It isn't that bad.The film starts with a recap of the last scene from Part 2, where Jason is seen getting up after he is assumed dead. Then the movie begins, with a funky and upbeat 80's background song starting the film. Right after the song ends, Jason begins his killing spree, starting with two unsuspecting store owners, and then moving on to unsuspecting teens at a small farm area...The thing I like about this movie is the fact that Jason first gets his trademark hockey mask in this movie. The mask is a big improvement over the sack from part 2, and makes Jason look much scarier.Another good thing about this movie is Dana Kimmell. Although her lines & dialog in the film are somewhat cheesy at some points, her character is very convincing as the teen heroine. And whenever she's frightened, she screams the cutest scream ever. I loved how she screamed in the film; she was cute and funny at the same time! A bad part of the movie is the fact that the rest of the characters are unlikable. The teens are generally stupid and naive, and the biker gang are very mean-spirited. Those characters are so unlikable that you will really want Jason to kill them all.Another bad thing: Some viewers might be disappointed that they cannot see the film in its actual 3D format. I myself would have liked to see the movie's 3D effects.Overall, Dana Kimmell and Jason save the movie from being bad. You have to hear Dana's screams to know how cute she is. And you must watch this movie in order to know how Jason gets his hockey mask.I give this movie a 7/10.",Friday the 13th Part III
230,Fortressofdoors,The nosedive starts here,6,10 July 2019,"I've watched all of the Friday movies multiple times, for years, ever since seeing the first one back in theaters in 1980. Re-watching them again recently for the umpteenth time now and I just wanted to chime in. In my opinion, and I'm sure many others, this is the one that starts the downward spiral into silliness. The badly over acted backwoods couple at the beginning, the ridiculous Hollywood version of what a group of bikers would be like, the cliche stoner couple that act like no other stoners that you would ever meet in your entire life, to the the pure and utter annoyance that is Shelly. Too much emphasis put into trying to make something jump (strings and all) out of the screen for the 3D effect instead of looking for a natural place to put it. The dialogue, for what it is, is just the friggin worst. What do you get for sitting through this mess? A Pamela Voorhees corpse with her head reattached somehow, leaping out of the water to completely rip off the ending of the first film. At least this one has some of the best looking cast members in the series. Lets not forget that no one in the production of the Friday movies even knows why Jason would even be alive in the first place. It's not completely bad, because some of the other films are even worse than this one (new beginning, jason takes manhattan, jason goes to hell). I have a love/hate relationship with any of the films past part 1, but here I am, many years later still watching them, so that has to stand for something I guess.",Friday the 13th Part III
231,jwtrox08706,Mediocre and predictable,5,14 April 2007,"I wasn't expecting a masterpiece when I decided to watch this film and my expectations were, for the most part, met precisely. The opening sequence (excluding the ending from Friday the 13th: Part II which was put in there originally to remind people in the theaters of what happened last time since the movie hadn't been released on VHS) is slow and builds tension. It was the best part of the whole movie. It was then that I thought...""hey, maybe this movie isn't going to be so bad after all."" The tension buildup was agonizing. I knew the couple was going to buy it...it was a question of when. From there, it seemed the movie just lost the road and came down the embankment. The only somewhat lovable character that anyone has any sympathy for is Chris...and seeing how she turned out at the end of the movie seemed to make sense after all she'd been through, but since the movie sucked it probably would've been more appropriate to have Chris traumatized but not a babbling laughing lunatic. After the opening sequence, typical slasher/splatter movie format takes over. Semi-likable characters, some with unusual talents or personalities (all the better to kill them with), simply there because they're going to be killed. What was up with Shelly. Did he turn out that way because he was named Shelly? I'd be bitter toward my parents if they had named me Shelly. The homage to Psycho (and I took it as somewhat of an homage to Halloween, too, after all Steve Miner was directing and he went on to direct Halloween H20) where the guy gets killed while going downstairs to get a beer for his girlfriend after having sex with her. The homage to Psycho comes with her in the shower. And what was up with the biker gang, and the big black dude, who was the leader, at the end seemingly coming back to life to get back at Jason right when he's going to kill Chris? That was messed up. And why, when she had the opportunity at the end with the ax, wouldn't Chris just chop Jason's head off!!! I'd gladly do it if I was in her position. If some lunatic comes after me in an attempt to kill me, he'd better hope he gets the job done, that's all I'm saying. Overall...I give it a 5 out of 10 since it, in a few small ways, exceeded my expectations.",Friday the 13th Part III

Better kills. More gore, Chris is my favourite leading lady, Shelley is great. It's the first time Jason wears the iconic ski mask.
The last 15 minutes is also very suspenseful.
This is ranked the 5th best on IMDb but I can't in any way see how this is inferior to the other more celebrated movies in the series.

Of course, I have seen it later apart from the rest of the movies of this series and I think the first one is no doubt the best. But still, part second from part five are totally charming for me, although the last sequels are a bit tiresome.I said I watched Jason X at the cinema some months ago but it is not the same now.Jason is a classical character together with Freddy(they are my favorite ones) but I think they should stop making sequels.

236,moycon,You'll wish everyday was Friday the 13th,10,6 January 2006,"This is one of the best Friday the 13th flicks. It's kinda almost just like the first flick...but not. First off, since Crazy Ralph died, a new bummy guy Able came and took his place, thing is he didn't just tell kids to ""beware"" like Ralph did, he also kept dried out eyeballs to show them why they should beware. So he wasn't as lovable as Crazy Ralph...but he was probably more crazy which is weird in itself because his name was just Able and not Crazy Able, but I digress. The ending is more or less the same in this flick as the first one. In fact the first time we saw it (I was like 13) We were like... What the @$%@ just happened? Who was that? You'd never guess who it is because the person is supposed to have been beheaded...but she's not now. Weird.This movie was also the first time we come to realize that Jason is an animal lover. In fact I'm thinking that the reason he is so mad and kills people isn't because the people want to have sex, but maybe because he saw them mistreat an animal. Like for instance, the first couple to get offed in this flick don't even want to have sex at all, they just want to bitch at each other and poop, but Jason I think kills them because the dude forcibly stops a bunny from eating veggies, and then eats all the fishes food! What a jerk. So that's that. Jason did the right thing and murdered them. If you look at the movie that way. You realize this was a proactive effort to stop animal abuse. What a good message, made better by the fact the movie was filmed in 3-D and had a disco superfly opening theme song. Bom Chicka Wah Wah. Ch Ch Ch Ba Ba Ba. 70's porn got nothing on my man MC Jason. He even lost his Oh so square one eyed sack for the super keen hockey mask. How cool is that? Cool...believe me.If you haven't seen this movie. Do it now.

239,worthythorn24,yadda yadda yadda,5,30 October 2005,"Another year, another Friday the 13th film. 1982's ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" was director Steve Miner's second in the franchise and it was also filmed in 3D. In this edition, we learn that Jason is still on the loose, this time in nearby Higgins Haven. Higgins Haven was a farm owned by the lovely Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) who is there for a weekend of partying with her boyfriend and her stoner friends. Instead, they become more fodder for Jason and his machete. It is in this installment that Jason first dons his now infamous hockey mask.Interestingly enough, this edition actually has *gasp* character development. Turns out, 2 years earlier Chris had been attacked in the woods by Jason and managed to escape. But will she be so lucky again? Or do we even care at this point? It's a good thing I am a fan of the franchise, because if I wasn't I would definitely give this film a lower rating than I have. The acting is abysmal, the dialog is utterly ridiculous and the idea that the entire area is not SWARMING with police officers (the events of Part 2 happened the night before) is ludicrous.The movie's saving grace is the special effects. I felt like they were very well done, especially if you can see them in 3D. If not, then they look fairly humorous. There is also some decent gore and some of Jason's most brutal kills are demonstrated here. Dana Kimmell is never going to win an Academy Award, but my god is she hot :).

However it is the best film ever made when compared to some of the sequels that followed the Final Chapter.The music in this film is the worst in the entire series it sounds more like a seventies porn film than a horror film. The acting ranges from awful to painful and the actress who plays the main character in this film is soooooo grating that Jason should have ignored everyone else and just focused on her - I've seen better acting on Sunset Beach than the campfire seen where she is explaining how she was attacked by Jason at the camp years earlier.To say this movie is set about a day after the events in Friday the 13th Part 2 it seems Jason has changed quite a bit. His look is totally different than it was in the first sequel.While the film is boring for almost its entire running time there are moments within the film every once in a while that keep it watchable.

A lot of the 3D effects do feel sillier when you're watching it in 2D at home, but the rousing last act makes up for a lot of the film's problems.

Jason (now in glorious 3-D) leaves his cabin after his showdown with Ginny and comes to a roadside store where he gains a new set of clothes - and kills the owner and his wife.Meanwhile, Chris and her friends make their way to her family cabin, Higgins Haven. The party includes Chris' boyfriend Rick, the pregnant Debbie and her boyfriend Andy, the bong-toking' Chuck and Chili, Vera, and Shelly, an overweight kid given to gruesome pranks.At a local store, Vera and Shelly are confronted by a trio of bikers and Shelly drives into their motorcycles. The bikers, Ali, Loco and Fox, make their way to Higgins Haven for retribution, where they siphon the gas from the van to burn down the barn. Before that happens, though, they're killed by Jason.That night, while Chris and Rick are off in the woods, Jason slits Shelly's throat and takes his hockey mask. Wearing the mask, he dispatches Vera with a spear gun. In the house, Andy is split in half while walking on his hands and Debbie is stabbed from beneath her hammock. Chuck is killed in the cellar while looking at the fuses, and Chili is impaled with a hot fireplace poker.Returning to an empty cabin, Chris and Rick investigate. When they're separated, Jason kills Rick by crushing his head with his bare hands. Jason throws his body through the window at Chris, who flees in the van. But when it stalls (from being siphoned), Chris has to flee back to the barn on foot for the 3-D showdown. . .Yes The 3D effects for that movie today are crappy but they were probably great for people back then, a sequel just as good the 2nd i recommend this horror flick for all horror fans.",Friday the 13th Part III

I found this to be disappointing, especially since this movie seemed very dull without the 3-D effects. This movie seemed very slow paced with plenty of scenes which would have been awesome in 3-D, but not at all interesting in a flat format.Friday the 13th Part 3 DOES have some very good and violent kills. While the gore effects can't compare to the first film, I really like the pitchfork scenes. Jason does his fair dose of killings in this movie. This movie also has a clausterphoic environment (which makes you wonder why the stupid teenagers never seen Jason... go figure) The claustrophobic effect really helped with the final chase scene (which in my opinion, is the best in the series), and built some atmosphere to the flick.The thing that really annoys me about Part 3 is the annoying, stereotypical characters that aren't developed at all. This has, however, come to be expected from the series. I liked the side story about the small biker gang stalking the kids, except when looking at it in another way, it was just a gimmick used to fill time. The bikers didn't really take away from the movie, but it definitely didn't add to it.Overall, check this movie out, but only for the kills and the ability to understand the later films in the series.",Friday the 13th Part III

Now about Chris's story about Jason trying to whatever he was going to do. Come on. This is garbage.They think trying to add a story to the movie like this would help. NOT AT ALL! So what,we don't even know if ts Jason or not. Why would Jason wander into town and start slaughtering everyone he sees? 3. The acting was terrible. The motorcycle gang was not even necessary to have been put in. The actors barely spoke at all.4. The death scenes. Please, they spent 10 minutes building up the suspense to every single death scene just to past the time. Well, they didn't have anything else to film! All the killing was the most silliest thing.

Another reason to love this part for me is more personal: in this part we can see the classic image of Jason Voorhees finally complete. There's also a lot of minor advantages in contrast with previous sequel: remarkable characters (Shelly!), some interesting details about Jason's past (Chris's memories), and catchy synthpop soundtrack. The killing scenes is also very good. There could be some questions about the weird ending, but I don't think this can ruin the whole movie.

Friday the 13th Part 3 is pared down to the fundamental essentials of the subgenre, and is all the better for it. Because it was originally filmed in 3D, it is blatantly clear that significantly more time was spent on getting the effects right than fleshing out the characters and storyline. In any other genre, this would sink a movie, but not in a slasher film. Friday the 13th Part 3 graciously spares us the hackneyed idea of Jason actually surviving the drowning in the lake and coming back to avenge his mother's death and instead turns him into an anonymous killer. Indeed, Jason's name is never uttered, not even once, during the ENTIRE film (unless you count the archival footage from the previous film tacked onto the beginning). The complete lack of a backstory for Jason thus augmented his frightening mythos and, combined with his acquisition of the trademark hockey mask in this film, put him on the trajectory towards becoming one of the major pop culture icons of the 1980s.Our heroine Dana Kimmell is a terrible actress -- just watch her diorite-encased delivery of the line, ""You go ahead. I'm going to take my bags in the house first and look around."" However, she is strikingly beautiful in that glitzy '80s soap star way, and she manages to hit some nice congenial notes that suit the Final Girl trope well (plus, Amy Steel, the Final Girl from Part 2, is an impossible act to follow). And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Larry Zerner, who, as the portly and piteous practical joker Shelly won the hearts of millions of Friday the 13th fans -- who, incidentally, tend to be rather portly and piteous themselves (okay, don't kill me for this, fanboys -- I really am on your side, I promise).If it wasn't for Amy Steel's stunning performance in Part 2, Friday the 13th Part 3 would easily be the best sequel in this lengthy series. It is condensed slasher goodness with less filling. It is the archetypical Friday film. It is, from what I hear, quite a treat in all its 3D glory. It is genius in its stupidity. It is the best kind of cheese, and goes great with a full-bodied Pinot Noir.",Friday the 13th Part III
250,WandrinStar,Friday the 13th Part III (1982),5,27 February 2012,"50/100. Just when you thought it was safe to go back to Crystal Lake. The first hour of the film is almost a carbon copy of the second. Dana Kimmell does a good job following in the footsteps of other Friday girls Adrienne King and Amy Steel, but unlike the first two films the rest of the cast of teens are annoying. Larry Zerner's character of Shelly in particular is almost unbearable to watch. They try to make the character sympathetic but he just comes off an irritating and nosy mess. Being a Reagan era 3D movie, the film is full of gimmicky moments of characters consistently poking sharp objects at the screen. Viewing in 2D can cause these moments to take away from the serious tone of the film, so watching in the intended 3D is best if possible. And once again Miner shows the last five minutes of the final film which combined with the opening credits, wastes roughly eight minutes. The use of techno music was a mistake, and the surprise dream endings are really starting to get me rolling my eyes. This Friday is famous for being the first to put the old style hockey mask on Jason. The long awaited reveal of Jason strolling down the pier first dawning the mask, as well as other impressive kills heightened by an even more menacing Jason keep an otherwise brush away movie from a lower grade in the mid to high forties. Although the movie isn't that good by any means, the decision to throw on the Hockey masks helped make this movie directly responsible for creating one of Horror's greatest villains as well as inspiring thousands of kids to throw away their Spider-Man costumes, and through on the jumpsuit and mask. Also features the handstand death, one of the more effectively executed kills in the series.",Friday the 13th Part III

It wisely chooses to take place immediately after the events of the 2nd film as Jason sets his sights on yet another group of young people looking for a little fun in a wooden cabin.He gets his infamous hockey mask during this installment, which might explain its appeal to fans of the franchise, but the cast of characters he's chopping through this time are a fairly one dimensional lot and many of them are shrill. The lead, Chris, has her shrill moments as well, but she does put up a good fight during the big finale and Steve Miner does manage to wrangle a few thrills out of that sequence.

The change of atmosphere was good and gives the film a fresher vibe than most of the other entries. The kills are somewhat more over the top than the first two(mostly because of the 3-D effects). The acting ranges from believable to just plain silly. Dana Kimmell is a good sport through most of the movie, but her acting can get corny at times, but then again the script doesn't give her too much to work with. Her last battle with Jason at the end is pretty good, though.The character of Shely is definitely one of the most developed characters in Friday history.

Unforantly, no, it's one of the worst. It's very boring, the charters aren't very likable, and very unmemorable kills. You need to see this in 3D, it has great 3D, and if not you'll be miserable watching a Jaws 3 like movie, a 2D 3D movie. The film is fun, I guess, but not very good. Jason is ugly, he has a huge butt chin and his mask looks like it's made of plastic. The charters are very ugly, escpacily Debby, Shelly, and Chris. Many of the kills are simple, uncreative kills. The only kill I've never heared of is a rake to the chest. All the other kills are overused and simple. It's just boring and bad. It does have some good moments, but not really. The final chase scene is great, but the rest of the movie is boring. Still see it though. 4/10",Friday the 13th Part III
262,mikelepost,"Predictable, moronically stupid, and a TON of fun!",7,15 June 2009,"Franchises that go on forever typically start strong and get worse over time. Not so with Friday the 13th - the first two installments are mediocre slasher films but the series really hit its stride with Parts III and IV (and then hit the nadir with Part V ... then got okay again in part VI ... then dumb again, etc.).In my humble opinion, Part III is the second best of the series right after The Final Chapter. It's a bad film by any stretch, with horrible dialogue and acting, many moments of bad camp and a completely cheesy disco theme. Still, I loved every second of it. Richard Brooker's version of Jason Vorhees as a deformed, murderous hick was by far my favorite - I like it better when Jason is burly like a truck driver and runs around a lot. This is also the film when Jason gets his hockey mask, in a scene that isn't nearly as iconic as you might have guessed. There are some memorably creative / gross kills, and the best damn final chase scene in the entire series. Jason appears without his mask for some of the run time and he's pretty creepy. I even liked the fake / dream ending.This film is horrible cheesy and stupid but it's a really enjoyable guilty pleasure and a pretty solid example of the slasher genre. I'd sooner recommend The Final Chapter but if you like that, give Part 3 a try. Trust me, plot is not the strong suit of the series and you'll miss nothing by watching them out of order.",Friday the 13th Part III
263,charliesamuelhill,A classic!,10,14 April 2019,This was my first ever Friday the 13th experience. My dad rented it from our local video store when I was a little kid. Back then you only chose films by the artwork and 2 or 3 paragraph synopsis on the back with 2 or 3 pictures. Let me say they don't make horror films like this anymore. I love every aspect of this film. From the beginning through to the end. One of the best Friday 13th movies. A childhood classic! You must watch if haven't seen already!,Friday the 13th Part III
264,macnjnc,"One of the best of the series, also the first one where Jason is truly unleashed.",9,7 September 1999,"I am a true horror fan, I absolutely love horror movies and Friday the 13th part 3 is one of my all time favorites. Reading the other viewers comments on this movie was quite interesting, not that my opinion means any more than the next. What you need to understand about the Friday the13th series is this: If you watch this series looking for acting skills and state of the art innovation, this is not the place. Friday the 13th part 3 is classic old school horror. Remember that this movie was made in 1982, that's 17 years ago, so one shouldn't expect the stuff you see now in todays hi tech horror films. No, there's no top notch or even marginal teenage actors, and Steve Miner didn't focus on a reviting, intricate plot, instead his focus was to throw a scare or two at you.This movie has a certain eerie vibe and atmosphere to it, and at the time it was made a lot of people went to see it because it was in 3D. Upon entering the movie at the theater they gave you these cheap 3D glasses, I mean this was mad cool back then, and funny thing was, the glasses actually helped the effects somewhat. Times were different then and morality could be left behind, you watched and laughed at corny humor and fantasized about what it would be like getting a hot babe and got a pretty good scare while you were at it. It was quite neat to look around the theater and see everyone wearing these neon 3D glasses and wiggling and squirming at each killing scene, I mean the theater was packed and you could tell tension was high. I mean you asked yourself "" just how will this guy get hacked""Even at that young age I remembered the first two Friday the 13ths before it. The 1st one was just an introduction and caught people's attention, Part II was a little more scarier due to Jason's deranged mindset. Jason Voorhees is a complete homicidal lunatic there's no doubt about it, this is the last guy you'd want to meet in the woods. In Part III, he is released to menace and slaughter. Part I was a little dull, Part II was better, Part III was terror. Sure the music is corny now but back then it gave the movie a sadistic feel. You always remember the biker gang with Fox, the old man in the middle of the road who warns them of the omen to come holding an eyeball, you wonder what it would be like to make out with a girl in a hammock bed, the weed head couple in the back of the smoked out van, Shelly and his unleashing to Jason the now infamous hockey mask, seeing Jason's hideous face with the hockey mask off, the one guy who could do the quirky, walking hand stand getting totally obliterated with an axe down the crouch (oouch!) The sheer ridiculousness of Jason squeezing poor Ricks head in so hard his eyes popped out, Part III is a classic. What about the black bald headed biker guy who gets his arm chopped off? there was just something about this guy, I mean he epitomizes a guy who should be in a horror movie. You don't watch a horror movie to rate acting, give me a break. You want to see the different characters, you want to see the guy who's a stud with the ladies, the one guy no girl wants to make out with, the guy who DESERVED to be killed. Part III had all of these elements. I feel Steve Miner did an outstanding job with this film. Jason was totally ruthless in this movie and kept on coming at you. Jason's relentless pursuit and chase of the lone survivor Chris was intense. After Jason is hanged and she opens the barn door only to see him standing there was nice scripting by Miner, all of a sudden the black biker who we assumed was dead reappears only to be savagely hacked apart, even as Jason is hacked in the head with an axe he still extends his arms at Chris to suggest her demise is his ultimate goal, unrelenting terror.Opinions certainly vary on this film but it is my favorite of the series. Watching it takes me back in time, a perfect getaway  to the days of old!",Friday the 13th Part III
265,hagg,Richard Brooker is on a par with Kane Hodder for the honours of who the best Jason is.,10,8 July 2002,"Without a doubt, my favorite Friday movie of all time! Richard Brooker is on a par with Kane Hodder for the honours of who the best Jason is. The setting goes away from the camp and settles in a remote region called Higgins Haven, this time it is not only some college kids,including my all time favorite Friday character, Shelly the lovable loser with the world's coolest afro, but some bikers getting in on the action as well. Sadly, i was unable to see this classic on the silver screen in all of its three dimensional glory back in the slasher hayday of 1982, but the Paramount DVD is at least in 2:35 widescreen!

The acting is not as good as it was in the first two, but in this one Jason gets his hockey mask, and that's a moment in movie history that no one will forget.",Friday the 13th Part III
267,andrewbarry6336,The famous Hockey Mask comes to be....,8,22 November 2013,"I will openly admit I watched this when I was only about 7 years old and never revisited it like other films in the series. The reasoning was because I always heard this one was only memorable because of the hockey mask and that was it. I finally decided to watch it the other night and I came away pleasantly surprised at how great it is.I will not spoil the story but will tell you this much, it takes place 24 hours after Part 2 and has a great opening scene. Unfortunately the pacing is quite off in this one compared to the first two and there is a little more back story to our heroine this time around. This means it takes a little time to get to the actual killings but once they start its great to watch. Shelly is also one of my favorite characters in the series because of his humor and of course for what he provides our Jason.I wish I could have seen this in 3-d like it was originally meant to because the kills in this movie are the most brutal yet. Between the harpoon and the handstand kill(which is very sick and pleasing I admit), this movie out did its self and helped set up the rest of the series. I can see why some fans detest this movie but I love it. Even though it loses its scare factor from part 2, Jason actually runs in this movie and jumps off of barns. He is more menacing but is still human and not undead yet. For the people who read my part 2 review and noticed I scored this one slightly lower than part 2 but noticed I said I like this one better there is a simple reason. The kills in this movie are great and its a more fun ride than the previous two. I believe this movie started the series into an attractive ride and focused less on scaring the viewer. But the kills are still just as shocking and as usual you cant help but root for Jason in this movie. So I give this movie a 4 outta 5. Watch it after watching the previous two.",Friday the 13th Part III

You also see why old people shouldn't sleep in the road and play with dead eyeballs; no kids ever want to listen to what old people have to say anyway. Especially if they have a beard like that. There is this one guy with a goldfish named ""Lionel"" who doesn't like his food, so the guy eats it instead. Yuck! Also he has the cutest rabbit ever! I am mostly a rabbit person, so I can tell you that the rabbit in this movie is even cuter than the ones in North, Donnie Darko, or even House of 1000 Corpses! And those were all really cute! Later you see him pooping and drinking whiskey (the guy! Not the rabbit!) I hated to see how his love of rabbits did not even save him from getting killed :( Then Jason kills the teenagers, except for this one girl who either kills him or doesn't. In the beginning, he doesn't have a hockey mask, but then he gets one later. There was a dead rabbit in the road, but probably just a stray, not the cute one from before.",Friday the 13th Part III

I had gone to the theater and saw it upon its release in 3-D (wearing the 3-D glasses and all) and for the life of me I could not find one scary thing about it. The 3-D effects abound in the movie and were not that good to begin with. The worst part of the movie was the character 'Chris' and her ""issues"" she was dealing with (drama!). Plus there was quite a bit of ripped off scenes from the first movie. I also found it amazing how Jasons' appearance changed from the ending from part 2 to part 3. Then to make matters worse I ended up buying it on DVD to go with the first 2 parts...and it looked even WORSE on DVD as far as effects go.I am a true hardcore fan of the original, the second one was just o.k. and in this one, Jason ""allegedly"" dies...(but of course he didn't due to the endless sequels that followed and the sequels just got worse and worse and worse), so to me there are only 3 Friday the 13ths.

271,perttu_hartikainen,One of my favorite Fridays,7,19 September 2008,"Now after Friday the 13th part one and two, we receive part 3-D, which has one of the highest entertainment-levels in the whole series. The killings, stereotypic characters and other events are fun to watch and this is also the first appearance of Jason's classic trademark hockey mask.The movie is placed right after the events of part two; Jason is lying on the floor with a deadly wound on his chest, but he somehow manages to travel to a local grocery store, where he brutally murders two people and gets clean clothes. Shortly after that he arrives to a farm area where - surprise, surprise - a group of teenagers are having a quality vacation. The third massacre is about to begin...Friday the 13th part 3-D has one of my favorite death sequences in the whole series, which are even more creative than in the previous film, for example a harpoon in the eye, machete sliced vertically through a person's whole body, and the classic ""head squeezed until eye pops out"".The characters are obviously ridiculous, at least the ""tough guys"" at a grocery store who eventually end up in the same farm as the teenagers and get killed by Jason for being total dumb asses (pitch fork in the neck, stomach and wrench in the face).In the end Jason gets an axe in his head by the last survivor - who just by coincidence happens to be a female - and dies for real. Or does he? The story continues in part four: The Final Chapter. This chapter was of course stupid when thinking about it as a movie, but when watching it as an every-day-slasher flick, it deserves 7 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th Part III
272,jackbruns29,This isn't a bad movie,7,30 December 2020,"Part three along with part five are usually considered the worst of the Friday franchise. But I will disagree. For one, it's more a collection of two groups who arrive at Crystal lake and not camp counselors who are targeted by Jason. For another, this is the first movie where Jason first dons his infamous hockey mask. Yes. A lot of people who aren't familiar with Friday the 13th always assume he's wearing it from the very start. No. Part three is the first movie where he kills Shelly and takes his mask. So it has at least both going for it.I think what people don't like about part three is the poor 3-D effects. Unfortunately, like anything in Hollywood, fads almost always dominate even for a short period. Jaws 3 anyone? But yeah, we have these weird goofy shots of characters shoving things into the cameras frame, which is really obnoxious and doesn't work.Another problem are the poor special effects. Two in particular are clear wire effects were used. But again, I think that's more of them pushing the whole 3-D gimmick on the audience, and it not working out very well.Overall, this is a solid sequel with a solid ending, and doesn't really deserve some of the vitriol coming its way.",Friday the 13th Part III

275,O.N.,Dreadful,2,14 October 2001,"""Friday the 13th Part 2"", to my surprise, turned out to be a pretty enjoyable piece of schlock. So much so, that I even fronted up to the video shop and hired part 3 hoping for another hilarious Jason rampage. Right now I wish I hadn't.""Friday the 13th Part 3"" is one dreadful film. As soon as you hear the twanging disco music over the opening credits you know you're in for a bad night in front of the box. Picking up straight after Part 2's night of carnage, a group of campers (or something like that) head out into a farm/camp thing in Jason country for some weed-smoking and more sex.The characters this time aren't the typical mob of teenage jocks as per the first 2 Friday's. This time, apart from the teens, we have a college geek, 2 hippies, and a really sad looking bunch of bikies. Sounds promising, but these guys aren't interesting in ths slightest. Annoying is more like it, and I was praying that they'd be mown down pretty quickly, but alas, Jason takes his time to get things going.From here on, things travel along much like the last 2 entries in the series. Campers get randy and are picked off one-by-one in the usual disgusting manner by a (this-time) hockey mask clad Jason Voorhees. Unlike part 2, the death scenes are incredibly boring and come about very suddenly with no tension or buildup (much the same way part 1 did). Not only that, they look incredibly fake. Watch for eyes popping out, arms being hacked off and a harpoon through the head for prime examples of this.Speaking of fake, get a load of the flashback sequence towards the middle of the film. This was meant to be a serious scene, but some of the worst acting you'll ever see turns it into one big joke. I think this was about the only time I laughed (or even smiled) the whole time during this piece of trash. Sure, nobody expects oscar-winning performances from these flicks, but there's got to be better than this.And finally, what is it with the vague endings in this series? Setting up for a sequel is one thing, but did they really have to rehash the same thing as the previous films? Worse still, this time the ending defies logic completely if you've seen part 1 and 2, and if you haven't, you'll be wondering what on earth is going on.This was a big disappointment for me. I hope part 4 reverts back to the gratuitous sex and violence and campy fun which made part 2 very bearable... and please, no more bikies.2/10",Friday the 13th Part III

Many people can't tell one Friday the 13th movie from another and that's always kinda peeved me, so let me start by saying if you're gonna watch any of these you should limit yourself to the first four, of which this is the worst.  But when you consider that there are nine+ of these movies that's not bad at all.Jason is alive in this one, and by that I mean he's not a bullet-proof, maggot-faced zombie who could take on 50 armed guys and not break a sweat. I will always prefer this version of Jason to the latter, because every character actually has a CHANCE of beating him at his own game.  The main character in this one hands him the worst beating yet, and it's always entertaining to watch little Dana Kimmell fight the massive Richard Brooker and win time and time again.  She hits him with a shovel, a log, a knife, books, and an ax, and Jason really seems frustrated at his own inability to catch her.  The murders that lead up to the chase scene are hot-cold, ranging from the awesome handstand death to the very lame electrocute the hippie.So watch F13-3 and see Jason do his thing before he could take 100s of bullets, teleport, possess people and breathe underwater.  When the series granted him these super-powers it basically turned him from a mountain-man psychopath into some sort of alien, and it's a change for the worse.  You'll find that he has more character in these early films, and part 3 has more of the original Jason than any of the other films.  By the end you'll be itching to see what happens next, and you're in for a treat- part 4 is even better!  But stay away from parts 5 through 9 in which Jason basically turns into the Shape from Halloween with a hockey mask.",Friday the 13th Part III
279,hagen-13617,This movie sucks!!!,3,27 July 2019,"They had a good plot, but then they decided to add stoners, a biker gang, and a backstory. Is Mrs. Voorhees back alive with her head attached to her body after being decapitated? If a huge massacre occurred wouldn't there be ambulances, tons of police cars, and news crews not one police car to take the survivor away and leave the bodies of several victims and a killer to sit by themselves?? They had a good plot but they needed to think this through?",Friday the 13th Part III
280,kailonchaboyer,A fun movie with a lot of flaws,6,4 August 2021,Friday the 13th part 3 now you can watch it in 3d or in 2d for this review I watched it on 2d for this review. Friday the 13th part 3 is the beginning of Jasons iconic hockey mask and this was one of the first films to be shot it 3d in the 80's other films would come out like jaws 3d and amityville 3d but those two are bad friday the 13th part 3 is the best out of the 3d horror craze of the 80's now somethings I liked. The kills/gore where very good in this this film a one up from the last two films they show the body more and more gore which is good another thing I like is the music it really creates suspense now for somethings I did not like. First of the fake body props oh my god there bad in ricks death there is no way somebody is going too think that's a real head another thing I did not like was how close it resembles the original this film is basically the same only difference is the kills and one is Jason and the other one is his mother anyway that's the review thanks for reading overall I give this film a 3/5 or a 6/10.,Friday the 13th Part III
281,fritz_fraugman,The Hockey Mask!,7,21 May 2009,"The opening is recaps of Part 2's exciting climax.Viewers are treated to zany music from Harry Manfredini during the intro credits that seems abit out of place for a Friday The 13th film.On the night of the day after Ginny's plight of survival, we have a couple that run a ma and pa mini mart in the general area of the murders. Edna is scalding her procrastinating husband Harold about chores. On the television a fleeting news report authorities are hailing the crime the worst ever in local history and have been combing the area for more bodies since dawn. This sequence involving minor characters is a pleasant mixture of comedy and horror but it is also rather long running nearly ten minutes with a barrage of silly false starts and 3D gimmicks. Edna even sees Jason in the shadows outside but mistakes him for her husband. Easy opportunity victims.Now the central players enter the picture, Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) is driving her van full of friends up to her parent's cabin at Higgins Haven to enjoy the weekend but first they have to pick up Vera a blind date set up with Shelly by his roommate Andy, also in the van is Andy's pregnant girlfriend Deb, and couple of potheads named Chuck and Chili F13's very own Cheech And Chong.They stop outside Vera's home where Shelly's asked to come out to meet his date date but the humorous muffled response from the bowels of the van are ""Bring her to me!"" Chris tells Andy and Deb that they are going up to the cabin to have fun not to mind her that it has been two years since she has been up there. A hint of a terrible experience in her past at the cabin.But Shelly does exit the van and viewers learn he has a obnoxious habit of playing scary pranks on people. Andy chides him to quite doing those things and not to embarrass him. Shelly's answer is ""Could you be yourself if you looked like this?"" hinting at personal issues of condescending self esteem.Back in the van and on the road they pass Edna and Harold 's mini mart watching the medical staff load the couple's bagged bodies up into a EMR vehicle. An ominous atmosphere hangs over the group in the van Deb says encouraging words to Chris. The first of two scary omens.Next omen they nearly run over a sleeping hobo in the road but once wakened by the gang he with a disembodied eyeball removed from his pocket and hung-over fueled rants escalating into warnings ""look upon this omen go back from whence ye came I have warned thee I have warned thee."" The sight of the disembodied eye repulses the gang to scramble back to the van ignoring the old man's gibberish they drive around him.Upon arrival to the cabin Chris' boyfriend Rick surprises her with a playful scare and the group begins to unpack and rooms are determined. Everyone is in cheery moods until Shelly pulls a prank on Chris that ruins it. Vera and Shelley leave for the store in Rick's VW bug.The blind dates are harassed by a trio of motorcycle gangsters Ali, Loco, and Ali's girlfriend Fox at the register in the store and extorted of $20. But Shelley guarantees writ in stone the wrath of the bikers by striking their bikes down with Rick's VW bug making an attempt to flee back to the cabin. ""Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma"" Shots of Jason partially in picture in the foreground spying on the kids from behind barns and through windows foreshadow the coming massacre.This is my second favorite Friday The 13th movie. Livelier characters than the two previous IMHO dull characterless tensionless Fridays with some funny lines, campy moments, and some of the best on screen kills offered in the franchise.Shelly: ""Is that all you two are going to do this weekend? Is smoke dope?"" Chuck: ""Why not man is there a law against it?"" Shelly: There are better things to do with your life!"" Chuck: ""Like what?"" Chili: ""I can't think of anything?"" Also there is a undeniable post traumatic abuction and rape subtext ruling in Chris and Rick 's relationship that the traumatic event of 2 years ago spoken of and the couple's lack of bedroom intimacy is related.The film drops a lot of obvious information, Rick snickers ""cold in here"" when Chris pushes his playful advances away. Another example Rick loading hay bails into the loft of the barn he remarks ""this is sweat of a worker not of a lover"". And again, ""three hours a day to fulfill our needs, one in the morning, two in the evening"". Before she recounts to Rick what exactly happened that day two years ago just moments earlier Rick whines about barriers coming between them all the time suggesting Chris is unusually frigid.And her confession to Rick of the real reason for coming back to the cabin and the woods where she was abducted is ""to prove something to myself, prove I am stronger than I think I am."" Chris and her courage and Shelly and his faults are sympathetic qualities a refreshing change in the slasher genre.By far Richard Brooker is my favorite Jason Voorhees he plays up to the role of a mongoloid mass murderer with brilliant subtleties. He is a pleasure to watch. The climax in the barn (always the dreaded barn) has become iconic among F13 finishes in fact Part V attempts this to much inferior effect.",Friday the 13th Part III
282,freakymidnightshow,Cruel and stupid as always. Do it for the 3D.,6,19 September 2010,"Jason comes back and kill more horny teens just where PT 2 ended. End of the plot. So yes, it's the same stupid premise.O.K, for starters i'm not a big fan of slasher movies, so Friday the 13th movies are only valid for me as a bloody camp waste of time, that sometimes can be entertaining (or boring in the most of the part). But, i enjoy this movie for it's gimmicks. Firts of all, Miner's direction kind of have in some parts a moody atmosphere. Second, there's cool references for horror fans (Savini, Last House on the Left, etc ...) And, as the movie originally was showed, the 3D is very a good gimmick that make you stay; is really fun. Also the main credits - disco music theme sticks with you. Very groovy!So, if you love 3D movies, this is a must and that is the unique reason of why this is more interesting than the others. Still, there is a lot of boring (if quick) gore. The movie beyond of disgust you, makes you giggle when you realized of how stupid it is.So it's stupid but it's 3D gimmick makes you stay with it. The most entertaining of the series. Still pretty stupid and sometimes really cruel.PD:The ski mask comes from this movie.",Friday the 13th Part III
283,YankeeDood,Most Unique of Series,8,11 August 2003,"SPOILERS This installment contains scenes not found in the others. For one, it's the only Friday The 13th presented in 3-D (originally). I was lucky enough to see it in this format (still have the glasses). The effects were outstanding! But it's still a good horror movie without 3-D stuff. The unique qualities continue...Jason dons his famous hockey mask for the first time when he takes it from a Jewish kid after slicing his throat, Jason murders a pregnant woman (in later installments, Jason develops a soft spot for kids), Jason runs in pursuit of his intended victim (in parts 5-10, he only walks), there's a catchy breakdancing tune in the opening/end credits and Jason's mother returns for a cameo- ""What was all that about a lady in the lake?""Plus, the scene where Mr. Voorhees slices a young man in two while walking on his hands is my favorite of all! The acting by Dana Kimmell was admirable too, I feel she was second best after Amy Steel in part 2.Her highest acting point is when she describes the time she first ran into Jason out in the woods and got attacked. Very convincing drama.My favorite suspense scene was when Chris Higgins (Kimmell) opens the barn doors and Jason is hanging on a noose in front of her. When he springs back into life, it's a shocker- ""Can't be alive!""Overall, the movie is a fun ride. Some of the 3-D effects may still surprise you (beware of flying eyeballs).This movie was shot in Saugas,California which is why Camp Crystal Lake appears much smaller than in earlier installments shot in New England.Steve Miner is a talented director and certainly proved he could reach beyond some boundaries in this very different follow up to part 2 (notice how much bigger Jason is).Part 3 is definitely the most unforgettable Friday of the bunch.",Friday the 13th Part III
284,MagJ100,Worse one of all imo....,4,8 October 2021,"The first two had some acting talent but where did they get these guys - the actors are so terrible. I guess because it's 3D they felt it would make up for it, wrong! Watch it if you can. ;)",Friday the 13th Part III
285,Paul_A_C,Well ...,4,24 May 2006,The Friday the 13th film series has become a legendary addition to horror cinema; Jason the famous Hockey masked killer. however he doesn't begin his killing spree until part 2 and only gets his hockey mask in part 3 which by then is just going downhill repeating the same story at the same camp every time just with a different name. In part 3 Jason is still on the loose to continue his camp counsellor killing spree even though this time it's just a bunch of over aged kids staying at a cabin. In part 2 i assume it's taking part on Friday the 13th but by part 3 Jason is just on the loose and kills 2 victims at the beginning who see the events of part 2 on t.v. and then the victims who get killed later see them being placed in body bags; so it cannot be taking part on Friday the 13th. How ever I watch this film loads of times just like part 2 as they do have a strange power to make us watch them but after Jason obtains his mask it's too late the films have just become pure cheese so watching them makes it hard to believe they're such a historic film series.,Friday the 13th Part III
286,damatorudy70,Nightmare.,5,24 February 2002,This film is were the first wrong turn in the series took place.The setting moves from the spooky woods of crystal lake to less scary locations.The first two films use the woods and rain to scare you.What can be more scary than  a madman chasing you with a ax????????Part 3 main trouble is the opening sequence.The store clerks are pitful.This is some of the worst acting I  have seen in these films.Where did they find those two losers???????? You will never see them in a movie again.The teens are okay in the roles of cannon fodder for Jason.The girls get in bed as always in Jason movie.The chase and last half hour are great.,Friday the 13th Part III
287,damatorudy70,Horror,5,27 May 2002,"This is a okay episode.The film is scary in many ways. The constant flashing of sharp objects does get old.I have to comment on the opening business with Harold and Maude store clerking.These two are the WORST actors I have ever seen in my 31 years.They rot.Why is this even included in the film?A better opening would have been showing Jason walking in the woods with the wind howling!!!!!!Further,The flying eyeball is one of the worst effects in the movie.I have frozen it in on vhs and you can see THE WIRE!!!!!!! I reccomend part2 if you want a great scare.
             4.5 OUT OF 10.",Friday the 13th Part III
288,Theshapeo31,I like most of the sequels but I would've been happy of it all ended here as this is the 2nd best Friday The 13th,9,12 August 2012,"Well it's hard going in depth to think of words to say for this review and I really don't want to talk about the story but I can't without doing so.The story of this movie starts off with showing the last 5 minutes of Part 2 with Jenny slamming Jason in the shoulder with his machete knocking him out for a few minutes and then after Jenny & Paul escape we see Jason pull the machete out of his shoulder and crawl away. So after stealing new clothes from a local couple who owns a local store and of course sends his thanks by murdering them. So he then hides in a barn by the lake when our lead girl Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) and her friends come to the lake for the weekend (also I will say she's one of the most attractive lead girls in the series) and one by one her friends are offed by Jason some of which very cool (the character Vera gets a harpoon in the eye & Andy gets a machete in the willy). Then we get to the climax where now its Chris & Jason going 1 on 1 and she actually has the smart idea of leaving however the car doesn't have any gas. Then in the barn she knocks out Jason puts a rope around his neck and hangs him but much to her horror and shock HE'S STILL ALIVE!!!! So then a biker who Jason knocks out tries to get revenge but is immediately killed (which is obviously time to stall for Chris) so after Jason kills the biker Chris takes the opportunity and puts an axe in Jason's head and he's still going for a few seconds before collapsing and seemingly dead. So the. Chris sleeps throughout the night in a boat and has a nightmare that Jason is still alive and comes after her but then she's dragged into the lake by Mrs. Voorhees but then she wakes up and freaks out and the. You question her sanity after that the camera zooms in on Jason's dead body and then an eerie shot of the lake ending the film.Now I said in the title that I'd be happy if the Friday The 13th films ended here (and doing research it really was supposed to end here) and I like the sequels but this should've been Jason's death an axe in the head no way he survives. Also I know about the wide consensus that the original trilogy of Friday The 13th with a human Jason are the best of the series and I somewhat agree with that. I say that because even though I like zombie Jason and a few of the zombie Jason films I prefer human Jason. Human Jason is better because he's more intimidating because he's human, he's one of us and this could be a real case scenario. Also this is my second favorite of the series because here I'd say Jason is either 75/25 or 50/50 because in Part 2 there's no doubt in your mind that Jason his human: he felt pain, he was cunning, and he could be knocked down for the count but however in Friday The 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter he's more of a supernatural human because apparently not even an axe to the head could kill him & he has the strength of 1000 men. But here he's still human but this is where you see he begins to take a more supernatural turn because close to the end he crushes the character Rick's skull forcing an eye to pop out with his bare hands and obviously survive an axe to the head but despite that he still can feel pain and has emotion (as seen when he was limping throughout the last 15-20 minutes of the movie). Anyway this still stands as the Second best Friday The 13th behind Part 2. 4.5/5 Stars.",Friday the 13th Part III
289,stealth_rock,I want it in 3D,4,2 May 2007,"I was quite disappointed with this movie, the killing was utterly predictable and Jason was very weak by his standards set in each proceeding movie. It just didn't do anything for me, if I was watching it before I had seen any others in the series I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more. The most disappointing bit was the ending, the creators obviously got lazy and thought we'll just do what we did in the first one. And there was almost a total lack of female nudity, which was very annoying, A Jason movie can't possibly work without a set of bare breasts/bum from a female actress. The actor that played Jason needed a good shake-up, he just wasn't menacing enough",Friday the 13th Part III
290,k_dizzle_scarface_nizzle,Jason Gets The Hockey Mask In This One!,7,1 April 2005,"This film came out during a time when 3-D made a brief comeback in the early 1980's. The same day after his massacre in Part 2 Jason once again finds his woods invaded by a bunch of dope-smoking, horny teenagers and they once again ignore the warnings of townsfolk. The teens set up shot in a vacation farm owned by the family of one of the teens, Chris. After upsetting some bikers in town earlier, the teens continue partying until Jason crashes it and murders them one by one, while Chris and her man Rick are away. One of Jason's victims, Shelly, provides him with his now-trademark, iconic hockey goalie's mask. When Chris and Rick return, Rick is killed and Chris battles Jason with the brief assistance of one of the bikers from town who came to the farm to get revenge on the teens who upset him earlier. But Jason, like he did to the other two bikers, kills him and Chris, in turn, kills Jason. And like the dream sequence in Part 1, Chris goes insane when she dreams someone has jumped from the lake and brings her underwater. This time, it's not Jason, but a decomposed Pamela Voorhees, with head reattached!",Friday the 13th Part III

292,bb74,A solid slasher horror film that needed to be seen in the movie theater,10,29 March 2021,"Friday the 13th Part 3: 3-D is a solid horror slasher film that needed to be seen in the movie theater during its year of release and in its original 3-D theatrical print in order for one to experience its fullest potential, effects, and terror. If you didn't, you simply missed out.The 3-D effects were innovative and made the kills terrorizing, creepy and scary watching them in the movie theater. I knew watching the previews/trailer to this film on cable television in 1982 shortly before its release that this was going to be a solid horror film and a step up from the first two films and it most certainly was. Steve Miner is a solid director that effectively used elements from John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) to hide Jason in this film and make him look suspenseful, creepy, mysterious, and scary. He also used the ""slow-burn approach"" having hard-core kills coming about one hour into the film.I would rate this film the best and scariest in the Friday the 13th franchise. It probably has the most violent kills of any in the series and is probably the most daring. Its setting is also the most effective at creating a secluded, creepy place for Jason to stalk his victims where they have nowhere near for them to seek assistance. No other film in the franchise can beat watching the violent kills in 3-D and Jason coming at you with his arms extended on the big screen.",Friday the 13th Part III
293,lostanddelirious85,One of more entertaining sequels.,9,10 December 2010,"Obviously, no ""Friday the 13th"" film is going to be Oscar material. You have to judge a film based on what it set out to do, and decide whether it met that goal or not. I don't think it's fair to judge these films by the same criteria as ""The Godfather"" or something.If you go into this movie just expecting to have fun, you won't be disappointed. The story is essentially the same as every other ""Friday"" film, with a minor twist: this time it takes place on a little ranch owned by one of the main characters. Jason, fresh off his killing spree in part 2, makes his way across the countryside to find a new batch of hormonal kids vacationing at Crystal Lake. Of course, this time it looks nothing like the Crystal Lake from the previous two films, seeing as it was filmed on a ranch in California instead of New Jersey, but oh well.The kids are all walking stereotypes--pretty much the only way to give them any characterization in a 90-minute movie that has to dispatch one of them every ten minutes. There's a pair of stoners that look older than the rest of the cast and make you question what they're even doing there, a hefty practical joker, and a couple expecting a baby of all things. But they all manage to be likable enough, and thankfully there is no one irritating enough to make you wish they would die already. There is no ""mean girl"" or ""jerk""; they all seem to be friends, which is nice.Jason gets his hands on the famous hockey mask in this installment, courtesy of one dead joker. The kills are the most creative in the series thus far, obviously taking advantage of the original 3D format this was released in back in 1982: one character's eyeball pops out at the screen in what must have been a pretty cool gag in 3D, an unlucky guy doing a handstand gets split in two, and a harpoon gun is put to deadly use.The highlight of the film is the chase sequence in the final act. The ""Friday"" films are known for some of the most entertaining chase scenes, and this one is no exception. It starts out in a cabin and goes all over the place from there, with Jason pursuing our terrified heroine relentlessly. Jason is actually creepy in this film--some form of degenerate who runs (not walks) after his victims with something approaching excitement. Wait until you see him unmasked later in the film--clearly he is not feeling burdened by his work.This is a perfect movie to put on with friends. It's entertaining, fun, and you'll have a blast watching these goof-balls bite it in interesting ways. You'll laugh at the dialogue, chuckle at some of the acting, and jump at some of the scares. So order a pizza, grab some beer, and just sit back and enjoy.",Friday the 13th Part III
294,filmboy280,"""What would a weekend in the country be without sex?""",8,19 January 2000,"That line from this movie pretty much sums up all slasher movies.  This one is the best of the entire Friday the 13th series, mostly because of the 3D. I just can't get enough of the cheesy 3D shots, especially the pointless scene with the yo-yo.  This one actually develops some of the characters. There's Shelly, the lone prankster.  And of course there's the cute pregnant girl who has sex in a hammock (my favorite scene).  Jason actually seems human in this one.  He grunts when he gets hurt and he gets frustrated when he can't find the person he's after.  The best thing about this moveie is when they meet the person who takes the place of ""Crazy Ralph"" from the previous movies.  He shakes around a human eye (in 3D nonetheless) saying ""I have warned thee"" (I wonder if a pun on the word ""eye"" was intended?)",Friday the 13th Part III

296,bluez24,one of the best -- Jason reaches MATURITY and is MENACING,8,7 January 2006,"I am a big fan of the Friday the 13th movies. Maybe in part it is nostalgia for the 1980s. You have to admire that they created the ""Jason"" character and made some pretty good movies with good suspenseful atmosphere. This one is one of the best of the series.I think the first four are overall the best. The later movies were just too unrealistic (although they did have some interesting scenes). I say that because in the later movies Jason is too ""invincible"" (being brought back to life by lightning in Part 6, e.g.) and they have scenes where Jason walks through woods and yet catches people running. Just too unrealistic. I know it is known that the actor who played Jason in the later movies, Kane Hodder, didn't think Jason should ""run"" since it was beneath the character or something. However, the first four movies are better (ignoring the fact it was Jason's mom in the first one killing people) because Jason is more realistic. It's scarier when Jason is tough and is not easily hurt or killed, but at the same time does not act ""superhuman."" He is scary due to his determination. That is why I think Jason in parts 2, 3 and 4 are the best overall. It just got too over the top in later movies.POSSIBLE spoilers below: This third installment is great, certainly among the best of the series, maybe the best (probably a close tie with part 4, it's hard to say part 3 or 4 are not the best two overall in the series). We have a great heroine, played by Dana Kimmell, Jason first gets his hockey mask, we have unique killings. Richard Brooker does an excellent job playing Jason, the subtle body language he uses to make Jason menacing. Jason is deliberate in this, very focused on his mission of killing people. Plus, compared to part 2, you see a lot more of Jason now. Many of the part 2 scenes were filmed too much in the dark, you don't see much of Jason. Here you have more shots of Jason openly tossing over hay bales in the barn, for example, looking for the main female (Chris), where you get to see more of him from interesting camera angles, his body language, his determination. The sack Jason wore in part 2 was OK, but Jason just looks scarier, more menacing here. Maybe it was due to the hockey mask in this movie, and to Brooker playing Jason well.The final chase sequence is, as others have noted, action packed and suspenseful. The first killing where Jason is actually wearing the hockey mask is memorable, he is deliberate and patient with his weapon of choice (speargun). This is the movie where Jason really develops his own style, and becomes iconic almost in the horror genre.",Friday the 13th Part III
297,nothingbuttchicks,Hey! The vans on fire!,8,9 June 2013,"Friday the 13th Part III in my opinion is the best of the series. Not only does the infamous Jason retrieve his mask from the clutches of a dying doofus named Shelly, but also introduces some rather humorous characters. Shelly, the theater hound who is obsessed with special affects, was born in the wrong decade. If he had lived in today's society he would have been super fly. An 80's nerd is today's hipster. The 80's stereotypical motorcycle gang is pretty legit, as well as their super badass names including Fox, and Chili. A scene I personally like is when a motorcycle hound exits the gas station holding an Olympia beer. Since I've from that area I find that kinda cool. Like all the other episodes in this slasher blood-fest, it centers on some kids who just want to get away and have some good old fashioned sex. Unfortunately for them, the masked murderer named Jason makes that impossible. It's a great addition to the collection and worth watching just for the ""3D"" affects.

Something that may explain why i love this is when it's night time, everyone is doing their own thing, and they are slowly being killed by Jason. When i watch this, i always get creepied out, and it's really scary. This is the scariest Jason movie. So overall, this movie, along with the theme, is just awesome!",Friday the 13th Part III

304,trey333,"Very good, yet I felt they were holding back.",8,14 August 2006,"This is a very good addition to the Friday the 13th series, It may contain some weak acting but otherwise I thought it was a good slasher with a great beginning. As I say in my summary I thought it was holding back with how gory it was, I know the mpaa already cut it so they couldn't have done any more but it left me wanting more. There were some plot holes in this one but nothing to major to ruin the movie. I thought the direction was really good, some chilling camera shots made this movie great, great job Steve Miner!

305,leestallion55,Best sequel to the series and just good old slasher fun!,10,27 September 2006,"I love this film and I love the funky soundtrack that opens and closes the movie, fantastic. Good old slasher fun as when it was at its best late 70's and in this case early 80's. Best sequel by far, pity they did not leave it here and stop milking a good story, but as in everything they do. Anyways if you like the first and second, this is an excellent sequel. I prefer the funky music opening and closing to even the original. Especially the dramatic music at the orginals end, rather have this 3rd installments funky music puts you in the mood for a good old kill everyone in sight movie! and we love that sort of thing, especially in the late 70's and 80's where slasher movies where at its best!",Friday the 13th Part III
306,deepblueseajaws,Part 3 - One Of The Better Ones,7,30 May 2006,"Friday The 13th Part 3 is one of the better sequels in the franchise. The movie features the introduction of Jason Voorhees trademark hockey mask, which is just awesome to see Jason wearing. This movie was back when Jason was human and it's great to see. It was also directed by Steve Miner (Director of part 2 and later on, Halloween H20) who is good in directing this type of movie. The storyline is good, except for the part suggesting Chris was attacked by Jason years earlier. The characters are likable, except for Shelly who is somewhat annoying with all of his jokes. Expect to see some great kills in this movie! The movie is one that i would recommend seeing if you haven't see it yet! The whole story, characters, and death scenes are great to watch!",Friday the 13th Part III

There is no understandable reason why these idiots are getting killed in this movie. I saw this in 3D at the movies back in the early 80s, and the 3D gimmick was the only reason we were there (same for Jaws 3D and Spacehunter 3D). However, if you can find a 3D DVD for the shutter glasses (3D shutter glass system available at http://store.yahoo.com/razor3d/3dvidviewsys1.html), the 3D stuff is pretty fun, and the movie is bad enough to laugh at in that respect.

308,Tom6253,Friday The 13th Peeks At 3,10,5 July 2008,"Part 3 is easily the best installment to date. From the use of Manfredini's music to the forlorn setting, this Friday is one of the more effective entries. It's documented that this film was a rush job. Filmed in about a month (or less). So even though the technical high points of this movie may very well have been by accident this film never the less boasts a lot of creepy positives! The setting alone (obviously not filmed anywhere near the site of 1 or 2) makes for a lot of chills. And Richard Brooker as Jason provides a very menacing presents on screen and with Miner's direction Jason's presents is also felt off screen as well. As the second act begins setting things up for the climax, you can immediately sense doom among the remaining characters. The other Friday movies are pretty good, but this one stands at the top of the heap. Weather or not this was a fluke or the work of creative vision I don't know, but part 3 is number 1.",Friday the 13th Part III
309,allgood_2000,My favorite Friday the 13th installment,8,19 July 2003,"Although this installment was not too original, I thought it stood out from the others.  If you watch the series in order, this is the first time the victims are just vacationing teenagers and not camp counselors.  I also thought the character developement was better than the first two (yes, I know ""character developement"" and ""slasher movies"" aren't birds of a feather, but I though it worked in this particular slasher).  I actually became attached to some of the characters and didn't want them them to die. Most people, however, think the time spent developing characters slowed the pace and made the movie boring.  This was also the first Friday the 13th movie to have it's climax in a barn. I thought the fact that it took place on a ranch was kind of neat, I was getting kind of tired of camp.Most of the death scenes were original, the gore level was average, not a whole lot of suspense (but what do you expect? This is Friday the 13th, not The Sixth Sense), but the characters were really cool.  It had some continuity errors with the previous movies, so I'm deducting one point.  9 out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part III

I personally love this movie, and think it's a must have for all horror fans.  The ending chase scene is very suspenseful, and the movie in general keeps the viewer on edge.  gets a 9.99 / 10 for me.  kB",Friday the 13th Part III
311,brantonanderson-769-870068,The Best of the Friday the 13th Sequels,7,18 February 2015,"Christine returns to Camp Crystal Lake, 2 years after the brutal murders of campers and the survival of her own separate attack. Tagging along are the requisite body count; nymphet, jock, stoner, nerd and way-too-old boyfriend. You know, the disparate people that make up every group of friends. Beginning right where Part 2 left off (how else could we follow the plot without a reset?), Miner attempts to give the series a narrative thread, a concept that goes south quickly with subsequent entries. Shot in 3D for its initial release, Part 3 is far more playful and better directed then the bulk of the Jason films. The 3D forces Miner to play with perspective and composition in more interesting, artful ways than in previous film. This entry also bears the distinction of being the origin of the iconic Jason, the hockey-masked, machete-wielding, disfigured psychopath that has become a permanent figure in horror pop- culture. Stealing a goalie mask from one of his victims, Jason is allowed more room in front of the camera, the series finally finding a really effective way of utilizing his movements on screen, than merely having him stalk around the edges of the frame. Here, Jason hasn't yet become the immortal slasher monster, his movements and reactions far more humanoid. He reacts to pain, limps and verbalizes injury, moves at different speeds (in contrast to his latter singular, lumbering zombie state) and is even given screen time with his face visible and expressive. This makes Miner's Jason the most terrifying of his incarnations, as he appears to occupy the same plain of existence as his victims. Miner takes his time actually developing his victims, and then begins to dispatch them with staccato bursts of violence, rather than prolonged, detailed gore. His most significant directorial decision is to overlay Christine's flashback scene, with her telling the tale presently. This creates a Godardian visual rift in the film, so purely cinematic and bizarre. Employing goofy 3D antics such as popcorn popping, yo-yo's, juggling and harpoons in the eye, Part 3 is by far the best sequel in the entire series (with X being the nadir). Here, Miner attempts to wrap up the Crystal Lake saga in a narratively cohesive manner, long before Jason goes to Hell, or Manhattan, or Space. C+",Friday the 13th Part III
312,ezgi-dalgic,I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKED THIS MOVIE,5,12 January 2021,What I hate in horror movies is when the main character is dumb. And Chris is just unbareably dumb. Her choices made me so mad and even in some parts Jason was dumb. And what was Ricks death scene... Though I was happy that he was dead cause he non stop forced Chris to have sex? it was painful to watch. Only Vera was a good character in this movie. I think 2nd one is my favorite in the sequel. Ithe best part is to see Jason getting his iconic hockey mask I think,Friday the 13th Part III
313,madmedic81,"Who are you? What are you doing? Hey cut that out right now, that's NOT FUNNY!",7,11 February 2009,"SO......everyone's favorite hillbilly bumpkin serial killer finally decides to find some direction in his life....Part 3 (in 3-D....cool little gimmick) isn't that bad....OK, it's not really that GOOD, either, but what do you expect from a shoestring budget? What do we get that we haven't seen before? -We don't have all the cool cabins by the lake where the surviving heroine must dodge every corner from the hydrocephalic killer (that's bad), BUT we have a really creepy farm (complete with barn and outhouse) with a lot of creepy corners of its own (that's good).-We have to suffer through about a minute and a half of crappy disco music as the beginning credits roll (that's bad), but otherwise, Harry Manfredini stomps out a great score for this one (a bit of a rehash of the first two, but the last reel has some GREAT chase music, and that's GOOD).-We don't get a single blond haired girl, be she heroine or victim (that's bad), BUT we DO get three bombshell brunettes and a chunky black haired pothead who either get naked or look good in the clothes they are in (that's good....well, luckily, the pothead chick does NOT take her clothes off....again, very very VERY good).-We get all the same great kills with less gore (that's bad....), BUT...we get them in super cool 3-D (that's GOOD).-For over 26 years, Paramount Pictures would not release a 3-D version of the film in VHS or DVD--making all those gore-free killings pretty much POINTLESS (that's bad), BUT due to high viewer demand, they finally caved to the fans' demands and released it in all its three dimensional glory (that's good....not as good as I'd hoped, but damn it's cool watching Rick's eyeball pop RIGHT out atcha....).-oh, and Jason finally gets his damned hockey mask....that's VERY good! OK, that pretty much sums up the movie.....it ain't at the camp anymore, four chicks and their horny boyfriends go on a vacation of the damned, you get an eyeball, and Jason decides to play Goalie for the first of 10 times.LOL, I'm teasing....well maybe not, but that's pretty much it...The acting, is to say the least, BAD, but there is actually a good humor that runs through the length of the film. You don't get the deeper character development you manage to get out of The Final Chapter and a few of the subsequent films, but you will actually grow to like some of the doomed campers (particularly Shelly and Vera....the film's odd couple.....and you end up pretty dang surprised that Vera bites it, because in all honesty, her character is better developed and more all-around likable than the film's solo survivor, Chris Higgins). There is an interesting side note with a biker gang, a grocery store manager on a crapper, and a ""Crazy Ralph-esquire"" doomsday prophet. Pretty much all of the familiar clichés are here (the weird fat guy, the jock guy, the stoners, the hot chick...OK, several of those), and we even get a strange little back story that really adds nothing to our surviving camper's likability quotient....but DOES add a little bit of tension between Chris and Jason that we have not seen in the series yet (but an idea that Part 8 eventually tries to duplicate....even more poorly than this one does....at least in this one, it's an ORIGINAL idea...).The chase scene is a fairly big stand-out in the movie....it starts with a BANG as Chris finds the first body, and it doesn't let up from there....even if her annoying moaning and screaming gets on your nerves as bad as it did mine, the fight that she puts up with Jason will be appreciated by any horror fan. With the exception of the Final Chapter, this chase scene is the best (and, arguably better, depending on what you like in a good chase scene) of the series. Jason sustains decent damage, but as we all know, Mr Voorhees takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'.....and even though the big scare moment at the very end is TOTALLY ripped off from the original, you just can't help but be creeped out by the way Jason just ""appears"" in that upstairs bedroom window watching Chris in the canoe.OK, there ya have it....not a masterpiece, and in all honesty, barely even worthy of an ""R"" rating (seriously....I've seen some PG-13 flicks with more violence, F-word, and bare breasts than this film), but it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise...in fact, none of the first four are bad at all. DEFINITELY better than the other 3-D gimmick films of the early 80's (ever notice how Jaws 3-D, Amityville 3-D, and this one are all the THIRD pics in their series'?.....hmmm.....maybe Halloween 3 shoulda been in 3-D....but then again, nothing could save that slop....but i digress). If you are new to the franchise, this one is a great little campy movie to see, and if you are a fan, go pick up the new 3-D DVD version!",Friday the 13th Part III
314,jeremynicholsv1,Friday the 13th Part 3D.....A New Dimension In Terror,8,2 April 2015,"My absolute favorite Friday the 13th film is Friday the 13th Part 3D.When Friday the 13th Part 3 starts, we find out that Jason never jumped through the window to attack Ginny in the last film, and that apparently she was the only one that survived, Paul had not. Jason is able to remove the machete from his shoulder and crawl away, moving onto another part of Crystal Lake to find more people to kill.Jason doesn't waste much time finding new victims, and now viewers get an idea of the size of Crystal Lake. Jason moves to another area where his fodder seemingly don't know what's been going on in the area. Even though the setting is still around Crystal Lake, the area has a farm look and feel to it, taking it out of the woods from the first two films and putting things out in the open.Chris, our go-to girl, is taking her friends out to her parents' cabin. She's there to show her friends a good time, and get over a traumatic experience she had there a while ago. On top of that, her old flame is there to spend the weekend with her, giving up a shot to hang with Mary Jo Conrad. Sorry to say Rick, you should have spent the weekend with Mary Jo.We get our usual teenagers here, the pot smokers and practical joker, the sexpots and the serious ones. You could actually point to this movie as having every single teenager cliché in it, before they were clichés. One in particular, the practical joker Shelly, would change the entire face of the franchise, literally. Shelly introduces the world, and Jason, to the fabled hockey mask. A lot of people forget, Jason didn't get the mask until the third film, and boy, did it change the series.By the time the third installment of the franchise came around, the producers had decided to use a gimmick that was making its comeback in the early 80's, 3D. 3D films have existed in some form since 1915, but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film.By the 1950's however, technology had come along well enough that many films used 3D to enjoy plenty of success, and for the most part, the technology worked. However, as with all gimmicks, people got tired of 3D and even though the technology was good, it wasn't perfected. So Hollywood did away with it, and the film industry wouldn't bring it back around until the 1980's.Friday the 13th Part 3 (marketed as Friday the 13th Part 3D) jumped on board the 3D bandwagon but not just for a few scenes in the movie, but rather the entire film. I didn't have the chance to see the film on the big screen, but thanks to HD TVs and the ability to put 3D onto DVDs and Blu Ray, I can get a pretty good idea of what people saw back in the day on the big screen.The deluxe version of the film comes with a 3D copy of the movie and glasses, and I can assure you it does in fact work. Not all of it is perfect however, and some of the effects are quite gimmicky, but there are some things that stick out. There is a depth to the film the entire time, and it looks pretty damn cool. Scenes where trees are blowing in the wind, bugs can be seen flying around, popcorn popping and some other things look great. I mean, it's nothing compared to the 3D movies of today, but you gotta think, 1982 3D technology actually working is pretty damn cool.However, the film really didn't need to be in 3D, and thanks to some of the best shots being centered around 3D, the movie lost a lot of its edge because 2D just doesn't work the same. Some of the kills look really bad in 2D, and that's a shame because I've always found the film to be pretty damn creepy.Steve Miner, who directed part two, did a good job here with the pacing of the film. You get kills every few minutes, plenty of jump scares and of course, Jason finally gets a face. The film uses the creepy vibes from the first two films, and at this point the franchise wasn't completely milked, so the formula works.One of my very few complaints is Jason's appearance from part two to three, and how it changes drastically. In Friday the 13th Part 2, Jason is a small guy with long hair, here he's a big guy who's bald, and yet it's only been a day since part two! I know the reason for the switch to a bigger guy, and I can say that it was actually for the best, but it's an annoying continuity error.Another issue I have with the film is the subplot of Chris being attacked in the woods and coming out to face her fears. We find out the person that attacked her is Jason, and we see this in a flashback sequence. The problem isn't with the idea, the problem is Jason is wearing the same clothes he does in this film, and those clothes he actually gets at the beginning of the movie! Big time error on the filmmakers part.Even with the films issues, the 3D effects that work are cool and Friday 3 brings everything you could want. A little sex, a lot of kills, and Jason finally gets his face. Oh, and a funky opening song to boot.",Friday the 13th Part III

In addition, many conventions are avoided: 1. This is the first of the series to not take place on friday the 13th, 2. The characters are unaware of Jason's identity, and 3. The film is the first (& only?) in the series to be shot in 2.35 to 1 Aspect Ratio, for a true WideScreen feel.Richard Brooker is menacing as Jason, with the best movement, of all the actors to portray the killer.This film is definitely worth a viewing, offering some genuine scares -- 3D, or not.",Friday the 13th Part III

321,prettyoddthings,Perfect party movie.,10,3 April 2011,"My favorite ""Friday the 13th"" film. It's just so darn entertaining, you can't help but love it.No, the acting isn't even approaching Oscar territory, and the story is basically a re-tread of the first two, but so what? The strength of these films is their sensible, straight-forward approach. They're just meant to be fun, and this one certainly is.For those interested in the plot, this time Jason sets his sights on a group of young adults spending the weekend at a friend's cottage, which just happens to be situated on--yes, you guessed it: Crystal Lake.The fun begins almost immediately as we meet two of cinema's quirkiest general store owners who unwittingly fall victim to a very much alive Jason as he vacates the scene of the last entry's bloodbath (and searches for some new clothes).We then pick up with our core group of fun-loving kids who, among other things, enjoy activities such as sex, playing practical jokes, and smoking pot. Despite all of this, they manage to remain surprisingly likable--probably the most approachable cast in the series. I could see myself being friends with these guys.Once Jason makes his way to the ranch, the blood-letting ensues. We even get a fun sequence involving leather-clad bikers who venture onto Jason's land in search of revenge following a grocery store incident with two of the main characters.From start to finish, the film stays entertaining throughout, ending with one of the series' best finales, as Jason chases his unfortunate final victim all over the place, giving us lots of thrills and scares along the way.It's also worth mentioning that this is the first film in which Jason dons the now infamous hockey mask. And let's just say his first on-screen appearance while wearing it is pretty memorable.Originally shot in 3D, the film contains plenty of obvious 3D ""gags"" with things popping out at the screen, lending an even cheesier, entertaining vibe to the entire experience.Ignore the recycled plot and the hammy acting--just have fun with this film--the way it was intended.",Friday the 13th Part III

Jason steels a hockey mask and wears it. then the teens fight throughout the movie.the acting is OK. the plot is the same as all of the movies. it is an older movie in the series but a good one. if you liked the first two movies you will like this.

A bunch of stupid teens decide to spend their weekend at a cabin near Crystal Lake. One of them has a hackneyed back story about being chased by Jason as a younger girl that isn't particularly interesting or memorable but gets the job done.The characters are all annoying and predictable. I couldn't care a less about any of their lives by the end. In fact I only remembered one of their names simply because he was the one who brought the hockey mask to the camp (I believe his name was Shelly). It doesn't help that they are all acted by complete incompetents. After Amy Steel in the second movie the Last Girl in this one really had a lot to live up to but she ultimately failed. I will cut the actors some slack, as there isn't a hell of a lot you can do with a script that god awful.Essentially this movie boils down to an hour and a half of badly scripted, badly acted 80s trash that is only barely scary and will probably bore you to death.Review For Friday Fans:Fewwwwwww. That gets rid of all the ""Actual"" Critique. Now for the fun stuff. The kills were all pretty good with a few that are really kick-ass. Jason is so much cooler in this one than he is in the previous two. THE HOCLEY MASK FINALLY APPEARS.

324,arguseig,Good an bad,5,22 March 2009,"I rate this as an extremely good film for the series since it is the first time Jason donned the mask. I rate it really bad though on the anaglyph transfer. Finally we get a home 3D version of the film released by Paramount. Obviously though Paramount had more than one person working on the transfer since some of the scenes work and some fall flat on their face. Anaglyph (Red-blue) means the images have to be presented side to side. Some of the scenes in the opening of the film are correct but some are obviously transferred into anaglyph in over-under anaglyph which just doesn't work. Also, when you present an anaglyph film you have to increase the contrast on the DVD so people can see an image through a dark filter. That wasn't done here. Instead we get a dark image which is hard enough for the human eye to see. Next gripe is that Paramount used the original over-under negative which shows horrible grain in both the 3d and 2d versions of the film. May as well watch this on an old 8mm projector. Glad to have a 3D release but get people that know what they are doing to transfer the film. Making an over-under film into anaglyph doesn't work because that isn't how people's eyes work. Also, if you are going to call it a delux edition, include a few extras. This DVD doesn't even include a chapter card and no extras at all. Typically Paramount.",Friday the 13th Part III

327,bulldogbill18,Lady in the lake??,7,7 May 2014,"While I did like this movie as a good sequel and it blew away Jaws 3D at the box office in the same year, the ending really made me shake my head. If you notice, the name Jason is not spoken once throughout the movie and Chris refers to him as ""This hideous looking man"" when explaining her story to Rick and ""It's you!"" when Jason pulls off his mask to un-hang himself at the barn. With all this, she doesn't know who he is or his history at all, how then, can she dream up Mrs. Voorhees attacking her in the lake????? It makes zero sense. The rest of movie is fun and scary, the way F13 films should be. Kudos to the Rick's eyeball pop out and Vera's spear to the eye-in 3D, these are great effects. The lesser 3D effects are good with poles, juggling balls, red-hot fireplace pokers and yo yo's coming right at you. The replacement ""Crazy Ralph"", Chili and Chuck were somewhat pathetic but Shelly and the bikers make up for them. The ""We don't accept no food stamps"" and ""Is this your rubber?"" scene along with the white biker's wimpy arms provided some much needed laughs. So, while it is not as good as Parts 2 or 4 and no where near the original, it is a quality Friday worth watching, especially in 3D, so pop on them glasses and enjoy.",Friday the 13th Part III
328,klein_inc,Maybe he just needs a hug and a warm glass of milk,6,18 July 2008,"Part 3 in the series continues along with Jason wreaking havoc on a new group of youngins who apparently don't watch the days news. Jason, miraculously as would become the norm, survived his last encounter with an emboldened young woman to continue on his murderous rampage.A new group of young adults has headed out to Chris' parents cabin for a weekend of fun (the same weekend where Jason had killed the happy campers of part 2). Chris, the star of the film has a troubled history with Crystal lake as that was the scene of where she was attacked by a hideous freak only a few short years ago. Chris has come back in the hopes of putting this drama behind her and starting fresh with her Crystal lake boyfriend Rick. Pre-marital sex ensues, except for pecker head Shelly of course, and Jason slowly stalks them all one by one.The acting has got to be the worst in the series. Fortunately the ladies of the film look a lot prettier than they actually sound. Shelley, the chubby guy with the white man afro is way too needlessly annoying. He runs like a girl, sounds like a girl, but looks like a clown. Poor bastard. I still like the movie though. Quite a lot in fact. But then I like a lot of cheesy movies, and this one's got lots of the stuff. Speaking of cheese, the movie was originally made in 3D, and this becomes painfully obvious when parts of the film, like when Andy plays with his non-sexual yo-yo are strangely out of place. Despite everything though the flick has its moments, like when Jason dons the legendary hockey mask for the first time, or when it gets knocked from his noggin and you get to see his pretty, pretty mug. If you like any of the other Friday movies then I'm sure you'll get some enjoyment out of it. Just go into it expecting an 80s style slasher and I doubt you'd be overly disappointed.",Friday the 13th Part III
329,jweinste-2,Grossly Underrated,8,11 August 2006,"First off, let me just explain that so far, I have only seen the first, second, and last two films of this series other than this one. I saw the original as a kid and recently re-watched it with the second nearly back to back and only after watching this third installment am I actually excited to watch the rest. I found the first two to be simply okay in terms of watching a movie in the year 2006. This movie was great. I rated this movie based on its appeal and enjoyment as a movie-watching experience. I am sad and ashamed to say I wasn't able to enjoy it's 3D features as intended, but they were great nonetheless. This movie is full of hilariously enjoyable 3D gags with or without any glasses or a big screen. Each kill is unique and interesting. Unlike many other horror movies (especially of its era), this movie doesn't spend a torturous amount of time developing character for people you don't care about nor go obnoxiously slow at any given point. If you're looking for another Jason movie, this is obviously an answer. If you enjoy a hearty laugh while watching someone get an object lodged through some twenty-something year old you don't care about, this movie is for you. In fact, I'm not going to bother to comment on story further than to say that I was very much entertained all the way through and if you're interested in this movie for great plot and character development, look elsewhere... look to a doctor because you should know better. Good times had by all. Enjoy.",Friday the 13th Part III
330,gregcattle,Watched this again last night after not having seen it in years. SPOILERS.,7,1 January 2017,"I had decided recently to re-watch all of the Friday the 13th films again because there is a new one coming out this year. Last night I watched number 3 again and I have to say it is just as good as I remember.There is a certain quality in the first few films that slowly dissolved in the later sequels. Jason is back after the events of number 2 and returning to Camp Crystal lake after being away for a little while. The opening scene shows Jason killing 2 shop owners, these are quite nasty killings and it made me jump even though you know whats coming these deaths are still shocking. Fast forwards a few hours and we see a van arriving at Camp Crystal lake. Jason has not come home yet, but you can bet when he does he is not going to like these new visitors. Strange things start to occur and the heroine played by Dana Kimmell knows that something is amiss. As the time goes on, Jason picks off the new counselors one by one and in this Friday the 13th Jason moves around very menacingly, the actor Richard Brooker definitely knew how to use the space around him to the fullest advantage. The rest of the actors were average or below average. I remember a girl in a blue top running up and down stairs very unconvincingly trying to act but it just wasn't coming across well. Overlooking these slight annoyances there is actually a very good slasher film here. The last 20 minutes or so sees Jason and Chris in an exhilarating chase and the ending works really well. I was not expecting his mother to come out of the water! That is something that still made me jump even now and even though I have seen this film years ago that still was a big wow moment. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you do not like this kind of movie then you probably haven't seen the first 2 and you probably wouldn't be reading this review. Make some popcorn, turn out the lights and enjoy! They certainly do not make films like this anymore.",Friday the 13th Part III
331,brock-19,Enjoyed it at the Movies,6,11 September 2002,"I wasn't sure the 3-D effects would allow the movie to remain scary.  Was I wrong.  I saw this movie in 1982 when it originally came out in 3-D.  Yep, they handed us those crazy glasses to wear when we bought tickets.  The 3-D effects were very realistic.  Nothing like having the end of a pitch fork dangling in your face in 3-D.I think after this installment the series wasn't as good.  In my opinion, of the Friday the 13th films parts I, II, & III still remain classics.",Friday the 13th Part III
332,johnboy56m,The best out of all 9,10,30 July 2000,"This movie is an example on how to make a horror movie.I couldnt sleep alone for years after seeing this in 3-D. I just wish they could bring 3-D to video.Nevertheless,part 3 is a classic. Richard Brooker plays the scarriest Jason.Part 3 is in my opinion the best one out of them all.",Friday the 13th Part III
333,escapenear2000,They should have stopped at Pt. 3,7,6 August 2006,"I saw this film years ago with my family at 1 a.m. on HBO and just recently on FX. This film was best as a trilogy. The series completely got ruined with each sequel after sequel after sequel. This pt. 3 makes sense. Jason is finally killed after a climatic showdown and a scary but cheesy hallucination of seeing Jason's mother lunge out of the lake. And then pt. 4??? The man was stabbed in the forehead with an ax!! A ram couldn't survive that. Was Traci Savage (Debbie) hot or what? Yummy! And a real smart a**. I like a girl with a sense of humor. Shelly was an idiot. Retarded if you ask me, although he did triumph when he stood up to Ali by running over his bike with a Volkswagen. Very funny! Anyway, definitely better than the original.",Friday the 13th Part III
334,crzycajun35,"""Friday The 13th Part III"" AWESOME!!!!",10,27 June 2006,"I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the theater in 3-D. This was totally cool! Not as scary as Part 1, but it sure had a lot of action. The film just kept you focused and felt like it was moving with terror and enthusiasm. I like the scenes where you can see the back of Jason watching his victims. And in the beginning when he's behind the barn door you can barely see his face. The camera effects did a superb job.Dana Kimmel was sexy! Richard Brooker did the best in any sequel playing Jason. He was flawless, intimidating and huge! And his face was perfectly scary and evil. In my opinion, they should have ended the saga in Part III. I thought part IV,(the final chapter) was worthless. It was boring and dragged out. The ending was the only action in the film. They should have extended F13 Part III about 15 minutes longer and killed him in a more violent way.The music in this one is almost equivalent to part 1. Awesome!! What I hated about part 4, is that Jason looked totally different. Black Fingernails and a totally different face.Part III his fingernails were clean. You didn't see much of Jason in part 4, and the acting was terrible. There was no spark in part 4. Part 2 was good as well. The first 3 had a plot and suspense to the movie. I give Part I and III an A. Part 2 an A-. Part 4 really ruined the saga.",Friday the 13th Part III

336,azuretiger,Jason gets silly,7,17 July 2020,"This wouldn't have been a bad movie in and of itself, but it kind of ignores the first two both tonally, and in the governing origin of the series iconic character.The first two really set an atmosphere for the series, and although there is nothing wrong with trying new things, the first half of this movie feels like a comedy instead of horror. It almost feels like it's trying to parody itself. It really isn't until the final act that this starts to feel like a horror movie, and by that time you're too taken out of it to be truly terrified of anything. Even a couple of Jason's kills feel comedic.The second movie also sets up Jason's origin in a way that feels like it should inform his behavior. Motive, if you will. Why is Jason killing these people? They're not counselors or people in his territory or in his way. He goes from having a three dimensional background to being a one dimensional boogey man who kills people because that is what slasher villains do.But, hey, he finally get's the iconic look. That's something, right? Not the worst movie, but it is a step down from the second and feels like it was made as a cash grab than any real weight of plot or lore. It's skip worthy unless you really care how he gets the mask.",Friday the 13th Part III
337,upshawdarian,No Purpose Whatsoever,2,13 October 2021,"I gave it a 2 bc we get to see the birth of the hockey mask. But they didn't answer any damn thing. We don't know who, what, when, where..or why. Bad acting even for the 80s. Big let down.",Friday the 13th Part III

339,jcmoviecritic,"This is where the original series should have ended, one of its best sequels",8,2 September 2009,"This sequel was probably even better in 3D, but for the most part, it holds up very well. Jason is shadowed enough for the first half of the movie to avoid diminishing the terror, something today's flicks don't respect. The acting was a little spotty, but this film still has a campy feel. The actors who did the best in this installment were Tracie Savage and Dana Kimmell. Jeffrey Rogers was OK, but the others were pretty bland. What is respectful about 3 is the nudity was there, but minimized and it was more situational, rather than sensationalistic. The only nude actress (Savage) was showering, and we are wondering if Jason is going to butcher her next. It was kind of interesting and iconic the way Andy was walking on his legs, foreshadowing his potential fate. Debbie's death was subtle and terrorizing, as we felt the horror creep up on us as the blood dropped. Chris was pretty determined to take out her assailant, dumping a bookshelf on him, stabbing him in the hand and knee, knocking him over the head with a log, hanging him and eventually axing him. She seemed fairly smart, even going for her vehicle where many of these movies have girls running instead. Unlike almost every sequel filmed, this one didn't involve rain, but another terrorizing weather force, wind. Overall, very good!",Friday the 13th Part III
340,craigjamieson960,the most rubbish piece of crap i have ever saw,1,5 July 2005,"This film is maybe the worst Friday the 13th film ever made. the characters are just the same as the last 2, there is always a geeky guy and there is always some one that no one wants to die. The plot is all over the place and it is poorly written there basically isn't even a plot its just people getting killed i don't know what paramount were thinking when they decided to make this film. when i was watching it i was in hysterics because it was so funny to watch the crappy reactions on the actors faces. If you want a good laugh then this is the film for you because this is the most rubbish piece of crap i have ever saw. i don't recommend you renting this out its only good for watching when there is nothing else on",Friday the 13th Part III

When it came out it in 3D that trend was huge at the time... and although some can say that the ""Pop-outs"" failed to age gracefully, i think you have to take it in context of the time period.

342,oxwhxpze,Solid Early Entry in the Series,7,9 June 2017,"Friday the 13th Part III was supposed to be the last of the series after the first two did surprisingly well. The formula changes slightly, moving from counselors to a group of friends relaxing for a weekend near Crystal Lake. No longer do we have to ask ""Where are the children?"" The movie starts with a recap from the previous film, which is all of the previous film you really need to know to enjoy the movie. It was intended to end the series, so it doesn't cliffhanger you to death. If I'm introducing someone to Friday the 13th, Part II or Part III are my go to flicks. Since it is the movie where Jason gets his iconic hockey mask, it is probably the best entry point for the franchise if you don't want to subject someone to all of the parts before it.",Friday the 13th Part III
343,M_Ator,One question,6,23 August 2020,"I know it doesn't matter in a movie like this, but how could Jason literally split the hand stand guy in half and there not be blood EVERYWHERE for the girlfriend to notice as she left the bathroom and crossed into that hallway back to the bedroom? Just saying. :)",Friday the 13th Part III
344,alex_graven,Valuable only because Jason gets his mask,2,17 May 2018,"I don't know where to begin.The F13 series started out as an indie film about kids being killed in a lakeside campground that reopened many years after a terrible tragedy. It was then followed by a second film that introduced a murderous New Jersey hillbilly who went around stabbing anyone who came near the lake he lives on in an attempt to avenge his dead mother. It was atmospheric and creepy and well made.The first sign that this was going to take a turn for the ""Oh Dear God no"" was that the theme went from Manfredini's lush strings and echoing guitar score to a weird, early 80s electro breakdance number.Within a few minutes you realize that what you're looking at is a paint-by-numbers franchise rerun built on a literal gimmick (3D). No word of a lie, apparently the actors themselves complained that the writers seemed more interested in finding things to do that would look cool coming out of the screen at you than in things like characterization or plot.The scriptwriters did the most obvious stuff to pad the body count, without remotely thinking about things like character, development, plot or sense. I was unaware for example, that there were such a thing as multiracial biker gangs who chose to wear leather vests obscuring their colors - or even ones that care about harassing a lumpy kid and his stressed out 20something girlfriend. Ones not concerned about smashing someone windshield out in broad daylight in front of witnesses but wanting to burn down a barn without anyone noticing. Which is why one of their member would decide to start noisily swinging and cheering off a hay bale block and tackle rope in broad daylight with the residents of the house nearby. But then again the point was to have escapees from the set of ""Beat It"" by Michael Jackson be tough and vengeful enough to chase down a Volkswagen that ran over their bikes, but be Keystone Kops otherwise until it's time to get punked. To add three to a body count.And I realize that every slasher flick has to have the Annoying Guy Who Will Die A Virgin Because He's An Annoying Dork - but they completely scripted ""Shelly"" to be almost nonfunctional as a human being. He makes his move against a girl who's clearly not interested. She finally blows up at him because he's yet again acting like an idiot - having at one point even simulated having been killed with a weapon which lands wrong with the group (dude, not cool, didn't you know the popular girl was attacked in these woods?), which totally rubs EVERYONE the wrong way. How does he respond to her telling him in PLAIN ENGLISH that she's angered and turned off by his behavior? FIVE MINUTES LATER he reaches out of a lake and grabs her ankle carrying a speargun and wearing a hockey mask. It makes sense in terms of having a jump scare, and to have her walk into the forest and providing a mask and weapon for Jason, but it in no way approaches any believable human behavior. ""I'm doing this so you'll like me!"" Dude, she literally told you minutes ago it was doing the exact opposite.Why is Final Girl even there in the first place? Because Jason attacked her years ago (we see him fumbling and crawling around like a goon while she kicks and screams) and she blacked out - but she woke up in her own bed having neither been murdered or raped. And her way of ""getting over"" literally nothing bad happening to her besides a good scare is to return to give the guy a chance at a do-over? Why did she escape alive? Why did he decide to spare her? Why did he go from a fumbling mook to Stone Cold Steve Austin with hardware? Again, it puts her back in the kill zone, but raises more questions and stupid ones at that than it answers.Speaking of Jason, supposedly he's out killing camp counsellors. Why is he wandering almost into town to whack an annoying Jersey couple running the country store? And since this movie literally takes place right after the events of the second, where's his ginger Voivod haircut and beard as seen in the climax of Part II? Why is he spear bald and many pounds heavier? Why did they make no attempt to make him look like the guy from Part II or at least explain the difference in his appearance?Why was there literally no evidence of the damage done to him in the prior film? Why are his clothes so clean? I can understand the Rasputin-like ability to recover from a machete to the clavicle. But to suggest that any human being can survive a 15' drop with a rope around the neck - as well as having the strength to left himself out of the noose one handed.... really? Also, okay, so he's a tank. Why could he not resist a 105lb woman rolling up a window on his hands with a manual hand crank? I get that one's level of badass goes up and down with the needs of the plot, but you have to keep it somewhat believable.Speaking of tanks, a man with enough strength to do a one-handed pull-up chops away at a black biker dude a few times, ensuring he's dead before he walks away. But apparently the same biker dude shows up alive at the end, because plot reasons, without a scratch on him. Is there something in Crystal Lake's water that allows people to regrow limbs and heal brain trauma?It's hard to state emphatically enough how much of a letdown it is to go from a creepy New Jersey location to what is so obviously a set in California, with a soundtrack bookended with dated sounding beat boxes, starring a lump of a bouncer whose motivations who no longer make discernible sense.Gone are people creeping nervously through forests, being stalked by a clever hunter. Gone are the shots where you see a running Jason in the background, causing you to panic. Gone is any idea of mythos, a mother's head surrounded by candles, a revisited camp turned into a charnel house. It's just jiggling breasts, schlocky 3D special effects, base mayhem and brief gore, abandon hope all ye who enter here, it's a money printing machine from now on.If you were wondering where the motorcycles were the bikers supposedly rode in on, they never make any discernible appearance in the film after being a set piece in the ""Motorcycle Dominos"" trope. That's because the franchise picked them up and jumped a shark tank on them.",Friday the 13th Part III
