0,SnoopyStyle,artistic justification,6,7 November 2016,"It's 1917 Storyville, New Orleans. Illiterate willful twelve year old Violet (Brooke Shields)'s mother Hattie (Susan Sarandon) gives birth to a boy. They work in a high class brothel run by drug addict Nell. Ernest J. Bellocq (Keith Carradine) pays to take up residence photographing mostly Hattie. Nell puts Violet's virginity up for auction to her customers. Violet is eager to join the business but the actual act is painful. Violet starts to work as a prostitute. Hattie marries a customer and moves to St. Louis without Violet. After getting a corporal punishment, Violet runs away and moves in with Bellocq starting a sexual relationship.Violet's gleeful willing participation in her own degradation is compelling and infuriating. The most engaging scene is the auction. It is creepy with these entranced old men. That scene should be the climax. The movie cannot get any more creepy although it does try. Bellocq is all too quick to sleep with Violet. The movie meanders in the second half. It's all very sad. Brooke Shields is exceedingly young and the movie fits the definition of child porn. There is definitely some artistic merits but I don't know if it justifies pushing open the envelop.",Pretty Baby
1,Hitchcoc,A Sad Time and Place,8,21 December 2016,"This movie was a showcase for Brooke Shields. Let's face facts. A lot of the people who went to see this had heard about her tender age. I'm sure there were pedophiles in every theater. Shields was a beautiful child and was probably exploited to get her into the movies. The story is that of a young girl who grows up in a brothel. She is being ""held back"" until she turns twelve. Eventually, the place they live becomes off limits to their top clientele. Brooke is simply a part of the family but has had a lifetime of experiences. Is she capable of going back to being just a girl. That's the issue that she faces. This film is lush with images of the south. It is a striking movie, but I did feel a little sick having seen it.",Pretty Baby
2,claudio_carvalho,"One of the Boldest Coming of Age Film, Even Thirty-Four Years Later",8,15 May 2012,"In 1917, in the red light district Storyville, New Orleans, the prostitute Hattie (Susan Sarandon) lives with her twelve year-old daughter Violet (Brooke Shields) in the fancy brothel of Madame Nell (Frances Faye), where she works. The photographer Ernest J. Bellocq (Keith Carradine) has an attraction to Hallie and Violet and he is an habitué of the whorehouse.One day, Madame Nell auctions Violet's virginity and the winner pays the fortune of US$ 400.00 to spend the night with the girl. Then Hattie marries a wealthy client and moves to Saint Louis, leaving Violet in the brothel alone. Violet decides to marry Bellocq and she moves to his house. Until the day that Hattie, who has overcome her past, comes to Bellocq's house with the intention to take Violet with her.""Pretty Baby"" is one of the boldest coming of age film, even thirty-four years after its release date. The story of a very young prostitute, apparently based on a true story, is supported by the beauty of the only promising Brooke Shields, great cast, magnificent cinematography and the talent of Louis Malle that keeps the film in the level of art and never vulgar. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Pretty Baby
3,rmax304823,"Most Friendship is Feigning, Most Loving Mere Folly.",8,5 February 2004,"There are a couple of reasons to see this well-executed movie.One is Brooke Shields in her only believable performance, as a defiant self-absorbed brat who learns not just about sex but about love. She is, of course, dazzlingly beautiful and barely pubescent and it's necessary to get beyond that. Value judgments about whether she should or should not have made this movie aren't really relevant. The movie is too good for that. Throwing up our hands and rolling our eyes is a little like interpreting ""Lolita"" as a simple story about pedophilia. Looked at pragmatically, Shields' playing this role hurt no one. Certainly it didn't hurt her subsequent career, what there was of it. There isn't any way to stop our own feelings of disgust at times, granted. I feel that way about movies like Friday the 13th or Halloween. I'm more disgusted by murder than by sex so I'm clearly warped. Shields packs more talent into her playing here, as Violet, than she did into all of her other movies put together. And it's not a one-note performance either. She develops from a vulgar know-it-all into a creature of real emotion. At the end of the story, her mother is taking her away from the older man she has married. The camera slowly moves in on her trembling face. She's silent but the froufraws in her hair quiver with regret. Malle ends it on a freeze frame of that drop-dead gorgeous, wrenchingly sad face.Malle is another reason this movie is worth while. He was a great story teller, even when the stories were a bit thin, as Polly Platt's is here. His specialite de la maison was the study of a community. He was almost anthropological in his approach. If he doesn't give us the social structure and eidos of a French boarding school, then it's Atlantic City, or a New Orleans whorehouse in 1917. We get to know the milieu pretty well, although we don't see much of the actual city, only the house itself, its back yard paved with coquina crunching under everyone's shoes, the palms and banana plants, the anoles. We get to know the furniture inside the house -- massive heavy things, overstuffed, overdone, overlaced, rose windowed. New Orleans was an odd city, a blend of all sorts of ethnic traditions. There's a bit of hoodoo thrown into the plot. (Madame Livingston addresses her clients as ""M'sieur."") Edgar Degas visited relatives in New Orleans. Now, alas, it's becoming not much more than another big Southern city with the Quarter serving as a kind of theme park. Note too Malle's editing technique. When you expect a shot to disappear, to dissolve or be cut away from, it doesn't always happen. The image lingers, sometimes long beyond our expectations. Keith Carradine balked when Shields is taken away from him, for instance.Much of this beauty (let's call a heart a heart) is made possible by the superb photography of Ingmar Bergman's collaborator, Sven Nyquist. He makes it possible for us to almost feel the heat and the humidity, and the solid mahogany of the bar.The depiction of the cat house is convincingly realistic, the general atmosphere being one of casual jealousy, petulance, nudity, practicality, and mutual support. The women (and the clients) form fleeting friendships. When they leave, it's without any particular ceremony. That's why the love that develops between Carradine and Shields is as shocking as it is. It's the only real commitment shown in the film. There is an abundance of commitment on the part of the people who contributed to this very good film.",Pretty Baby
4,moonspinner55,All style,4,22 January 2001,"At the beginning of Louis Malle's ""Pretty Baby"", there's a tight shot on Brooke Shields' baby face: she's watching something with interest and we hear a woman moaning just in front of her. Since we all know what the film is about, one is to assume the child is watching some sexual act with curiosity. Actually, it's just the opposite. This is writer-director Malle's clever way of laughing at the viewer, saying ""You have the dirty mind, not I."" It's a very smart way to begin the picture, but little else occupied my mind after it got going. Why does Keith Carradine's impatient, somewhat-indifferent photographer take such an interest in this maddeningly dull child? He apparently has a fetish for little girls, but nothing sexual seems to occur between them (except for some nude photography). Carradine--who has one sullen expression to express every emotion--and the inexperienced Shields are a monotonous pair; these characters (along with Brooke's mother, an unblushing Red Light district prostitute played by Susan Sarandon) provide no passion, no emotion. The film is just a stylish painting, posed and rather embalmed. *1/2 from ****",Pretty Baby
5,Quinoa1984,"the kind of film that probably couldn't be made today, at least in how Malle does it",8,21 November 2006,"I wouldn't say that Pretty Baby, directed by Louis Malle, has the overall audacity of the main art-house European-directed sexual trip of the 70s, Last Tango in Paris, but it comes close, very close. It's a scathing, unflinching look at the downtrodden women of a 1920s whorehouse in New Orleans. What's most shocking of all, and what Malle understands about such subject matter, is that the best approach with this material is truthful, and to not be exploitive in the sense of manipulative characters (situations are another thing). There's really not much in way of it going through anything specific in being stylized. If anything, as I recall, Malle's style here is to try and not seem apparent much, if that's possible, with a very controlled sense of pacing and how scenes should move. The implications raised in the picture are the sort that would probably get shot down in flames by the 'Religious Right, though mostly around the Brooke Shields character.To say that it's not perhaps a masterpiece is not off the mark. But it's an important work nonetheless, and one that is really hard to forget or ignore once finished. Shields plays the daughter of a working-prostitute, played by Susan Sarandon with total class and southern finesse with the men, but never too un-wise around her daughter. It's the time of jazz, at least jazz coming into a much greater bloom, and sex and general decadence is right there for the taking in such an environment that the 'pretty baby' of the title resides. She's used to it all though, and Shields plays this character with total bravery- I almost wonder how much she was told of it all, and what she brought as intuition or having to just know the state of mind of her all-too-young character. Malle doesn't keep things totally helpless, as he has a photographer, played by Keith Carradine. He's probably the most level-headed and right-minded of any of the male characters (aside maybe from the band members who just don't take part in any shenanigans). But then comes the problem of morals- Sarandon isn't the one who falls for Carradine, but Shields really. But is it really love, or affection, or just the possibility of leaving he house?The most controversial part of all of this comes down to this really- underage sex, or rather a form of twisted, really non-consensual sex that ends up just skimming the line of bad taste. But it is in bad taste to show subject matter like this? It's a tale of perversion, and how psychology ends up getting right into the cross-hairs of it, so such material should be up on the storyline. What's interesting is to see the 'breaking the virgin' part takes time to unfold, and how it does, and how ugly it all becomes the further it goes along. Shields plays it right though, and her range of emotions for the character is actually stunning, and almost makes Sarandon keep up with what's going on. There's a heap load of nudity overall, including a hot bit with Sarandon and Carradine, but really Malle is after the whole insulated world of this whorehouse, and how being true to oneself ends up clashing with the un-yielding mind-set of those coming in with a wad of bills and a set goal. It skids with being cringe-worthy, and I have a very distinct memory of probably cringing at one point. It's not great, but it's really memorable in the ways that matter. A-",Pretty Baby
6,tavm,A stunning 12-year-old Brooke Shields made a fine impression in Pretty Baby,10,8 July 2010,"This was another grown-up movie I read about as a child and was curious about that I finally got to see. Since this was the one where then 12-year-old Brooke Shields played a girl raised in a brothel where her mom Susan Sarandon worked, I wondered how I'd react to some scenes where Ms. Shields was about to be deflowered by a middle-aged man or some of her nude scenes. While I did occasionally pause at some points before anticipating such sequences, I was only mildly surprised at what was depicted or implied as director Louis Malle handled such material with great restraint. Besides the two players I mentioned, Keith Carradine also should be commended for portraying the house photographer Bellocq as someone who gets very concerned whenever Shields in particular gets treated badly yet can't always control his emotions when she misbehaves. I also liked Antonio Fargas' performance as the house piano man. All those I've just mentioned, as well as the rest of the cast and crew, should be commended for the way they depicted what it must have been like in 1917 in the Storyville section of New Orleans, Louisiana, during that time when the U.S. had just entered the first World War and the morality police were about to close places like the one depicted here. Certainly, since I live about a two-hour drive from where this all took place and was filmed in, it raised my awareness of what things were like there in the early 20th century and makes me want to learn more about it. Anyway, Pretty Baby should not be condemned as child pornography as like I said, there's no erotically explicit scenes of sex and it's not the only thing it's about anyway. And besides, Ms. Shields seems to have done all right by herself considering the subsequent films she made concerning her sexuality...",Pretty Baby
7,preppy-3,Too low key to have much of an impact,6,22 February 2009,"Set in 1917 New Orleans. This is the story of a brothel and the women working there. One of them, Hattie (Susan Sarandon), has a 12 year old girl named Violet (Brooke Shields). Bellocq (Keith Carradine) pays to photograph the women but doesn't have sex with any of them. However he seems strongly attracted to Violet who is being set up to be a prostitute like her mom.This sounds a lot worse than it plays. It was hugely controversial when it came out mostly because Shields was 12 and has nude scenes. The subject matter alone caused outrage but seriously...this film has no impact. It's extremely low key to a ridiculous degree. Everything is done in such a calm laid-back manner that it doesn't seem even remotely exploitive. Considering the subject matter the film is incredibly tame. The only nudity comes from Sarandon and Shields and it's never sexual in context. The film looks great too and it's (purportedly) factual. The low key tone works--but after a while it gets downright boring. EVERYBODY acts low key. I was just hoping somebody would overreact to something. Also the story gets more than a little unbelievable towards the end. The acting is good by Sarandon and the other women. Frances Faye as the head of the house is great and it's always good to see Barbara Steele. However Shields is terrible--but she WAS only 12. Carradine is even worse. Very stiff and wooden. This isn't a bad movie just a dull one. Hard to believe a movie about a 12 year old prostitute could be dull--but it is. It definitely would not be made today. I give it a 6.",Pretty Baby
8,Bunuel1976,"PRETTY BABY (Louis Malle, 1978) ***",7,6 May 2006,"This was Louis Malle's first American movie and another one - like ZAZIE DANS LE METRO (1960), MURMUR OF THE HEART (1972), LACOMBE LUCIEN (1974), BLACK MOON (1975) and AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS (1987) - which dealt with the world of children. It was also a notoriously scandalous film because of child pornography issues (the setting is a New Orleans brothel), which makes it a surprising choice for DVD release in this age of political correctness - although Paramount basically just slapped it onto disc, as it's a no-frills release (with not even a trailer to go with it)! However, despite a notable cast (Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham), the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage. As a matter of fact, Shields became an international superstar with her role in PRETTY BABY - which is similar to the one played by Jodie Foster in TAXI DRIVER (1976). Malle does not shrink from showing its protagonists (especially 12 year-old Shields) in the nude - but it's always tastefully presented, i.e. in a non-exploitative manner. Besides, the film's period reconstruction is impeccable...",Pretty Baby
9,zetes,In reality a very moving picture,9,21 February 2010,"While best known for the controversy it inevitably ignites whenever it's mentioned, this is, in reality, a fantastic film. You have to feel a little sorry for Brooke Shields, as her starring in this essentially screwed her up psychologically something fierce, but she does give her one and only exceptional performance in it as a 12 year old girl living in a New Orleans whorehouse. She is being groomed for a life in the world's oldest profession by a rickety old madame and even her mother (Susan Sarandon). Meanwhile, a bizarre photographer (Keith Carradine) enters this world to take pictures. He's allowed to stick around every day because, I don't know, I suppose they think he might bring them some fame or at least advertisement, and because they assume he's a homosexual and nonthreatening. Over the course of the film, his relationship with Shields blossoms, but you're never really sure what his deal is. Personally, I do think he was a pedophile. While the prostitutes are always trying to turn Shields into a seasoned whore, Carradine is always insisting that she remain a child. Yet he is most certainly interested in a romantic relationship, as well, even while he wants to pretend it's a father/daughter relationship. So, really, I should probably be disgusted with Carradine, but why do I feel so sad when Sarandon shows up at the end, after he and Shields have been married, to take her away? Pretty Baby is an extremely complex film, emotionally, and it's gorgeously directed in a very subtle style by Malle, who might very well be my favorite French director. The final moment of the movie has Shields, about to become an actual little girl for the first time in her life, having her picture taken by her stepfather. The final freeze frame is every bit as perfect as the one that ends Truffaut's The 400 Blows.",Pretty Baby
10,Sylviastel,Disturbingly Realistic!,8,18 September 2013,"Brooke Shields became a household name for her performance as twelve year old Violet, a prostitute's daughter, raised in a New Orleans whorehouse. Susan Sarandon does a terrific job playing her mother, Hattie. Frances Faye is a scene stealer in her final film performance as Nell who owns and operates the whorehouse. Keith Carradine plays a photographer who takes a serious interest in the women and girls as more than objects. Brooke Shields' Violet is the pretty baby who is surrounded by sex and knows nothing else. The scenes in which Violet's innocence, youth, and virginity are exploited by Nell and the others who live there as a suitable way to make a living is disturbing. Violet's virginity is auctioned off as a commodity to the highest bidder is definitely something that would shock film audiences of 1978. Nell says ""there are two things to do in New Orleans on a rainy day and I don't like to play bridge!"" Is a classic film line. Violet's life in New Orleans is tragic and sad but she manages to understand and comprehend her surroundings.",Pretty Baby

12,JamesHitchcock,An Ancient Monument to Seventies Permissiveness,5,31 July 2012,"""Pretty Baby"" is set in 1917 in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans. At one time the city was notorious for legally tolerated prostitution, although this came to an end because of pressure from the Army and Navy following America's entry into World War I, shortly after the events depicted in the film. The main characters are Hattie, a prostitute working in a high-class brothel, her 12-year-old daughter, Violet, and Ernest J. Bellocq, a photographer obsessed with taking photographs of the brothel and its inhabitants. (Bellocq was a real historical individual, Hattie and Violet are fictitious). Bellocq is not just obsessed with photography; he also becomes obsessed with young Violet whom he marries, despite her tender years, after the brothel madam has auctioned off her virginity to the highest bidder.There are some similarities between this film and another controversial seventies film about child prostitution, Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". Both films introduced a young actress who would go on to become a well-known star, Brooke Shields here and Jodie Foster in Scorsese's film, and both girls give quite remarkable performances characterised by a disturbing mixture of innocence and sexual precocity. Foster has become one of the cinema's most accomplished actresses, whereas, in my view at least, Shields has never really risen to the same heights, although she has remained a well-known Hollywood name. Here, however, the young Brooke's performance is marked by a greater emotional depth and immediacy than she has achieved in many of her roles as an adult, and she is certainly the best thing about the film, together with its elegant recreation of the period.Shields apart, however, the acting does not amount to much. In 1978 Susan Sarandon was a young actress on the verge of becoming a major star, but here as Hattie she does not really show much evidence of this. As for Keith Carradine as Bellocq, his mannered and languid acting is just dull. He had been much better the previous year in ""The Duellists"".It is, moreover, not just Carradine's acting that is languid; Louis Malle's direction means that the film itself moves at a stately, almost funereal, pace. It is in nothing like the same class as ""Taxi Driver"", which had a contemporary rather than a period setting. Scorsese's film is notable for its tension, its emotional power, its fine characterisation and its social comment, all of which are lacking here.""Pretty Baby"" may be set in 1917, but it is very much a film of its time, one that today tells you more about the 1970s than it does about the 1910s. In 2012, given modern fears about paedophilia, a film about a twelve-year-old prostitute which included scenes of her naked would be almost as unthinkable as it would have been in the days of the Production Code. In the good old nineteen-seventies, however, there was a widely-held feeling that every film director worthy of the name- certainly every auteur director worthy of the name- was under a solemn duty to break as many taboos as he possibly could, without regard to traditional views of morality or decency, and Malle, who had previously made ""Le Soufflé au Coeur"" about mother-son incest, was clearly an auteur of this stamp. The film was quite controversial at the time, although not nearly as controversial as a film on this subject would be today.With many once-controversial works of art, the conventional modern reaction is to raise one eyebrow and to ask, rhetorically, ""What was all the fuss about?"" With ""Pretty Baby"" a more likely reaction would be to ask, non-rhetorically, ""Why wasn't there more fuss?"" Malle's artistic freedom was defended by many critics who today would be howling for his lynching from the nearest lamp-post. That said, the film is still widely available on DVD and is occasionally shown on television, having acquired something of the status of a historical artifact. Perhaps that is how it deserves to be best-remembered, as an ancient monument to a curious type of seventies permissiveness. It manages to achieve the strange feat of being simultaneously controversial and boring. 5/10",Pretty Baby
13,StrictlyConfidential,"A Sloppy, Scuzzy Mess Of White-Trash Mentality",1,22 April 2020,"(IMO) - 1977's ""Pretty Baby"" was clearly a movie made in very bad taste where its story centers around a 12-year-old girl being auctioned off to the highest bidder (who's desperately wanting to be the one to take away her virginity).Like - Hello!? - Is this sordid, cheap, and sleazy type of scenario really what other viewers consider to be worthwhile entertainment!? - 'Cause, believe me, it sure ain't my idea of that! No way!Set in the year 1917 in New Orleans, Louisiana - ""Pretty Baby"" was directed by French filmmaker, Louis Malle (who I'm sure was banking on this film's controversy in order to draw curios viewers into the theaters). And, I'll bet you that Malle actually believed himself to be creating ""art"" through the production of this truly despicable picture. (Yeah. I'll bet you he so blindly believed just that)",Pretty Baby
14,sol-,My brief review of the film,6,7 February 2006,"A rather interesting, very unusual coming-of-age tale, the film explores ideas such as the effect of one's environment on the way which one views life and normality. Keith Carradine and Susan Sarandon are both are ineffectual, working quite weak characters, but young Brook Shields does a great job in the lead role, fleshing out an excellent character. The film is marred by being overly dark at times and far too leisurely paced - the final half an hour in particular drags. It is a good film, though, and the amounts of nudity are neither in bad taste, nor in excess. Although some of the ideas and events may come off as disturbing, Malle is neither condemning nor condoning, but simply presenting. As a result, we get an interesting view on life that might seem normal to the characters in the film, if not for us.",Pretty Baby
15,tomgillespie2002,A monstrous subject handled with care and beauty by Louis Malle,8,6 July 2011,"Set during the final weeks of legal prostitution in Storyville, New Orleans, the whorehouse ran by the ageing Madame Nell (Frances Faye) is quietly coming to an end. This is unknown to the employees, who are going about their work and earning their money. Ernest Bellocq (Keith Carradine), a real-life photographer who took the famous Storyville prostitute portraits, arrives and takes an special interest in the beautiful Hattie (Susan Sarandon), and her 12-year old daughter Violet (Brooke Shields). Violet is a confident, bratty and adventurous girl who is groomed to be the star attraction at the brothel by Hattie and Madame Nell. As the men queue up for Violet, Bellocq also becomes enamoured with her, and the two start a strange love affair.For such a monstrously ugly subject, Pretty Baby is a strikingly beautiful film. The idea of child prostitution is repulsive but was a very real thing back in the 1917-era (and obviously still exists today under a much more secretive veil). It takes a very brave director to even consider tackling such a subject, and then to do it with such elegance, truth and respect. The both cosy and dank whorehouse pulses with life and realism, to the point where it feels like the film was actually filmed in the time. Minor details such as the peeling paint on the window ledges and the layers of dust on the bookshelves adds an authenticity rarely seen.The film was extremely controversial in its day (and would still be if it was released today) for its full-frontal nudity of a 12-year old Brooke Shields. It is undoubtedly uncomfortable to watch at times, but as hard as it is to say, it is necessary to truly see who she is, and what the men want her for, which makes the whole thing even more horrific and wrong. The scene where she is carried into a room and flaunted as a virgin to rich, cigar-smoking older men who start a bidding war to take her virginity, left me cold. It is a truly powerful scene, and when we later see her naked in her youth, all fragile and undeveloped, it almost made me sick.Shields, who is clearly not the most talented actress in the world, is genuinely brilliant here. Full of natural beauty and swaggering maturity, her character is a complex mixture of the naive, the immature, and the wise-beyond-her-years. She seems more than ready, and eager to start work, and has the natural ability to wrap a man around her little finger. Years growing up in a brothel has seemingly left her unable to feel. And when she begins her relationship with Bellocq, it is unclear if she truly loves him, or she is simply acting to get the life she desires. If you can stomach the taboo subject matter, this is a fascinating film, rich with great acting, complex characters and a smart script, handled with an individuality and grace by the great Louis Malle.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Pretty Baby
16,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,17 August 2020,"It looks like all the other 1 Star reviews are calling it ""Kiddie Porn""... I'm not going to do that. I tend to give art a wide breath when it comes to, well, everything.And with porn, well, I tend to agree with at least Stewart's statement of ""I know it when I see it."" And it's pretty much the case. After all, it's only made to do one thing.... and this doesn't really make you feel the need to do that does it?So I kind of wonder what those reviewers are feeling when they watch this.Honestly, it doesn't even rate as erotica.So.... why one star? Because, honestly, it's boring. It kind of does to New Orleans' red-light district what Reds did to John Reed.... sucked all the excitement out of the story in an effort to make it artistic.It's well acted, but it's weak on plot, weak on story, weak on entertainment.... but, like Reds, it's one of those movies that you have to watch because 41 years after the fact it is still being talked about.But, to be fair, I guess it's hard to make a movie about someone that takes pictures and make it riveting.

17,strong-122-478885,"Scuzzy, Bottom-Of-The-Barrel Mentality",2,12 March 2018,"Yep. When it comes to the likes of 1977's ""Pretty Baby"" - This one is definitely ""the end to the innocence"".As this film's story so gleefully points out - There's nothing like taking away a 12-year-old girl's virginity in order to get her to grow up. Indeed.In this white-trash, whorehouse soap opera - (director) Louis Malle tries so desperately to turn its gutter-level story into a high-class affair. But - IMO - He fails miserably.For all of Pretty Baby's sleaze, tackiness, and insensitivity - It actually makes a laughably lame attempt to redeem itself by tacking on an ending that's straight out of Disney's ""Cinderella"".And, finally - I seriously wonder just how many paedophiles' wishful fantasies have been instantly fuelled by this film's totally slutty, bottom-of-the-barrel, child-prostitution rubbish.",Pretty Baby
18,caspian1978,Image is Everything,6,20 September 2002,"If you look close, you will notice that the direction is pulling you into the story. Louis Malle holds onto the image in front of us until we have taken it all in. When we think there will be a cut soon in the film, we are robbed of this pity. Instead, we are given reality. At first, I thought the movie as going to end at the edge of the river bank during the picnic. It would have been a delightful shock for the movie to end in such a pure and innocent way. However, we are not given this. In fact, Louis Malle once again cheats(tricks)us into this. The next shot in the film shows the newly married couple having breakfast. If you watch closely, again, you will notice the scene comes ever so quick without a dissolve in neither the picture nor the music. A film that will stand the test of time.

19,punishmentpark,"'A virgin, bona fide.' ...",7,31 January 2014,"After seeing Eva Ionesco in Roman Polanski's 'The Tenant', and then digging a little deeper into the facts of her life, I remembered I had the DVD of 'Pretty Baby', which was partly inspired by her story, even if another story (that of photographer E.J. Bellocq and the prostitutes of Storyville, New Orleans) was obviously at least an equally big inspiration. Louis Malle begins the portrayal of this Storyville slowly and with care; we enter a whorehouse and get to know its inhabitants as human beings trying to get by in their day to day. The prostitutes, the pianist, the madam, the bouncer, the customers and... the children. It doesn't matter how careful you'll go about telling a story like this, it wíll have its impact. Then the story proceeds, and young Violet's initiation becomes a fact. Malle finds a balance between telling the facts as straight up as possible and showing a world that is filled with hopes, loves and other human follies and reveries against all odds.The nudity of Brooke Shields feels rather natural, but we all know that sort of thing doesn't fly anymore - and with good reason. The acting is pretty good, especially Keith Carradine's, but Shields' job is truly commendable. The story is just about satisfactory, but it sort of meanders without really digging deep into certain dramatic aspects - maybe that is actually the charm of it.A good 7 out of 10.",Pretty Baby
20,lambiepie-2,It's taken me 20 years to write this!,5,13 November 2003,"I saw this movie for the first time on the Los Angeles based ""Z"" Channel in the early 80's. (Gosh, I miss that channel!!!)(Minor Spoilers)In watching it, my first reaction was saddness...because this told of a story of children who were raised in a brothel. This one particular beautiful daughter of one of the female prostitutes was destined to live a life just as her mother, a prostitute, for the daughter knew of no other life. Her mother did eventually leave the brothel in one of her selfish modes, but left her very young daughter there who experienced life very quickly -- for she saw nothing wrong with that life.20 years later, I look at this movie again on the HBO network and after living some years I gotta tell you, this movie now upsets me to watch. I found it difficult to look at a pre-pubescent Brooke Shields run around naked with grown men, including Keith Carradine, even though this was part of the script and part of the film -- it wasn't meant to be gratitutious or stimulating. But now -- I just wanted to smack her mother for allowing her almost teen daughter to do this. I wanted to smack myself for ever watching it. And ya know what? That IS the point of film.This is what makes this film disturbing and captivating at the same time. The IDEA this occured in our Century makes one furious and that story is being told so we can look back and make sure it never occurs again. But...the realization of SEEING it on film dramatically portrayed by Brooke Sheilds as the daughter, Susan Sarandon as the self-centered, prostitute mother and Keith Carradine as the grown Photographer is what gets to you.
I remember reading where many movie seekers saw this as Louis Malle's ""kiddie porn"" and wanted the film banned. I guess its all in your personal comfort level. But be warned, this is an adult film with very adult subject matter... NOT  a subject or film for many.",Pretty Baby
21,hall895,"Was shocking, is dull",4,6 December 2012,"Upon its release in 1978 Pretty Baby was shocking and controversial. Maybe all the controversy obscured the fact it was not a particularly good film. The film was famous for displaying a naked 12 year-old Brooke Shields. And that does indeed prove to be as uncomfortable to view as you would imagine. Yes, it's a story about child prostitution but that story surely could have been told without putting Shields on such display. And what of that story? Is it a good enough one to hold your interest and make for a compelling, entertaining film? Not really.The film is set in New Orleans in 1917. Life moved a little more slowly back then and Pretty Baby mirrors that. The whole film has a very languid feel to it. The pacing is slow bordering on glacial. The action, such as it is, centers on a brothel. Shields plays Violet, who lives in the house with her prostitute mother Hattie, played by Susan Sarandon. The film establishes the goings-on and routines of the house. Young Violet is not herself a prostitute. Yet. A photographer, Bellocq, shows up to take some portraits of the prostitutes. He also takes an interest in Violet, though certainly not in a sexual way. He actually seems quite asexual, hanging around the brothel constantly but with no interest in partaking in the goods on offer. The time inevitably comes for Violet to start selling herself. Her virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder. She's excited, her mother's excited. Bellocq's not excited, he sees it for the disgusting spectacle that it is. But the deed is done, Violet becomes a full-fledged mini-prostitute and things unsurprisingly unravel from there.There is a potentially interesting, if very uncomfortable, story in here. But the film never really takes off. Right from the beginning it's a film desperately struggling for momentum and it's a struggle it never wins. It's just dull. The dialogue is rather forced and clunky with Sarandon and Keith Carradine, playing Bellocq, forced to spout lines which sound completely unnatural. The most natural, and probably best, performance in the film comes from the young Shields. Discomfiting nudity aside she's the best thing the film had to offer. Of course nobody puts the nudity to the side, that's the first thing people talk about when discussing the film. If it was a good film the Shields controversy would be an unfortunate distraction. As it is, it's not a very good film. The whole thing is just unfortunate.",Pretty Baby
22,bjarias,..almost forty years later it still suffers the same,4,25 August 2015,"Someone had to make the definitive choice for this twelve year old child.. and Hollywood has made lots of these kinds of choices before and since. Take a hundred sets of parents and how many would choose to have their child exploited in such a way. Sure you can say she has gone on to have a somewhat questionable 'career,' but at what cost, to those many having seen this film and pushed their offspring towards a very difficult and dangerous direction. This is not a great film in any meaningful way, and not at all worth the societal cost. There's an obligation for all of us to consider the 'ultimate cost'.. and once we choose to ignore that expense we are subject to whatever messy result comes about.",Pretty Baby
23,grahamsj3,OK flick,7,8 January 2005,"This film certainly caused quite a stir when it was released in 1978. Today, ""stir wise"", it would result in a large yawn. This is the story of a young girl growing up in a brothel in Storyville, New Orleans when the brothels were very popular and just before they were all shut down. The stir was caused by the apparent nudity of the then 13-year old star, Brooke Shields. The film uses an adult body double for her nude scenes. There is a fair number of topless scenes involving the older women, especially Susan Sarandon, who plays Brooke's prostitute mother. It depicts the everyday life in the brothel, showing the prostitutes as just people trying to survive and make a living. There is music, alcohol, cocaine and, of course, sex. The story is OK, the acting OK, the cinematography also OK. Basically nothing in this film is more than OK. I think it's worth a rent, perhaps. I believe that numerous children did grow up in this fashion, being the children of prostitutes. The Storyville brothels were eventually shut down and that is depicted as well.",Pretty Baby
24,sunznc,One of my favorite films!,10,4 March 2009,"Pretty Baby is based on the diaries of a woman named Violet who grew up in the brothels of New Orleans. It is also based on the story of Ernest J. Bellocq, a photographer who worked in the same area.There have been numerous reviews written about the film and it's controversial subject matter. Violet is born into a brothel just like her mother and it is here that she enters into the profession herself.I would just like to say that the film is my favorite because of the atmosphere and the way the film is shot. We are voyeurs here. Watching a small window of time involving the people of this brothel in 1919. The sets and costumes all are perfectly done reminding one of an old oil painting. Muted colors, drapes, carpets, couches and ornate wall dressings all add to the mood of the film and you can't take your eyes off of it.People looking for an action film are not going to enjoy this at all. But if you enjoy thoughtful period pieces you will probably enjoy this despite the subject matter.I've watched it probably 50 times and dig it out once a year to enjoy it.",Pretty Baby
25,bbhlthph,An Exceptional Film!,8,5 July 2009,"This is an exceptional film - not because most of the critics say so, but for me because I cannot think of any other film which left me with a greater feeling of having been temporarily transported to another world in a place and time with which I was totally unfamiliar.Many IMDb users have reviewed and commented on this film and another full review is unnecessary, but bringing out its exceptional nature and encouraging those who have not seen it to do so does require some supplementation. Comments about the nudity in this film not being disturbing come into this category. Today nudity occurs in films for two principal reasons, firstly because it would be natural for the character concerned under the circumstances being depicted by the film, or secondly because it is being used by the director to add a little eye candy intended to increase the visual appeal of the film. In the latter case the viewers personal reaction will govern the response to such eye candy, (typically for example, regardless of whether or not they themselves appreciate it, many viewers feel that this is very inappropriate for younger viewers and all films should provide advance warning when it is present). But where the nudity is an integral part of the story being presented, viewers who wish to see this story should not find it disturbing unless the nude scenes are excessive or gross. Pretty Baby is not such a film, it is one where Louis Malle has minimized his use of nudity - any less and the nature and character of the scenario he has to depict could become distorted. He should be commended on his restraint which may have made it much easier for some viewers to concentrate on the more serious issues raised in the film.When this film was first released the sequence showing the brothel auctioning the virginity of their new girl to the highest bidder raised a lot of eyebrows, and clearly many in the audiences had not appreciated that this practice used to be commonplace. Most viewers found the sequence disturbing, but in Pretty Baby the fact that Violet had been raised to expect this, and was looking forward to it as an important step towards entering adult life, greatly reduced its impact. Another film, French Quarter, which was released the same year as Pretty Baby, was the story of an orphaned girl who had been strictly brought up on a farm, but who had had to take refuge in a city brothel to avoid starvation when her parents died. Those who saw it will remember that it included a similar auction which I for one found much more harrowing to watch as it clearly showed the trauma inflicted on an unprepared and very reluctant young girl, starting of course as she was being stripped and paraded for public exhibition. Any such sequences provide very uncomfortable viewing for most men, who tend to thankfully take refuge in a conviction that they could never occur today.Other scenes showing the exploitation inherent in life as it was lived in Storyville in 1917 were also found to be disturbing by many viewers; and some comments even suggest a widely held conviction that we live in a more moral society today. Before we condemn our forbears we should perhaps examine this conviction in more detail. In Europe and North America we have quite recently moved away from a society where marriages among the upper classes were regarded as primarily intended to enhance social status and generate offspring. Wives frequently did not love their husbands and, although they dutifully provided children, they were often happy for him to exercise his virility with paid companions. Visits to a local brothel, where regular customers could became friendly with all the staff, were condoned or even approved. This often led to a reasonably stable environment for the young women concerned. Today most of us would strongly disapprove of such lifestyles, and would rightly emphasize how far we have progressed by ensuring young people have the opportunity to choose their own lifetime partner; but we still need to be honest about the problems this new lifestyle has created today. There were few Robert Pickton's feeding twenty-six victims to his pigs in Victorian times. Today we frequently encounter police warnings about serial killers; in Victorian times Jack the Ripper was a much more unique character. Too many of today's prostitutes shiver in the rain or snow on street corners throughout long evenings each night, periodically spending an infrequent few uncomfortable minutes in a car - each time at an unknown risk to themself - and are forced afterwards to give almost all their takings to a pimp attached to the local street gang. We need to recognize that many of them would probably regard living in a comfortable and stable brothel, such as that depicted in this film, as akin to heaven on earth.Ultimately this is the powerful message from Pretty Baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the Director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and I do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.",Pretty Baby
26,yossarian100,Nicely photographed period piece,8,29 December 2003,"Beautifully photographed and sumptuous to watch. Brooke Shields, with that famous saucy and spirited personality, is gorgeous. I wasn't bothered by the nudity. I wasn't bothered by the story either and I feel the movie accurately portrayed a different time with a quite different moral tone than the one we live with today. But, hey, stories are just stories. Actually, I think the main reason this movie works is because it comes across as honest, it feels like being in another place and another time, and it's lovely to see.",Pretty Baby
27,RaulFerreiraZem,Pretty baby,7,21 February 2020,"Very cleverly made!This was a film that in many ways was doomed to failure from the initial sketch, for at least two main reasons. The first one is that it is a period film. While that by itself is not a fault or anything like that it more frequently than not means a poor rendition of a time in history because neither the audience nor the people responsible for the making of the film know or are expected to know the specific historical qualities that give the film that extra glow of verossimilitude. The second one is that the topic the film approaches is way too much controversial and it makes it too easy to be either too edgy and therefore exploitative or too prude and make it overtly moralistic.
Luckily Malle manages to avoid all of the traps cited above. Violet's portrait carefully avoids any sort of naturalization as it depicts her as a product of her environment. The racial conflicts implied by the period is also really well (and subtly) approached. One example that proves both points is the whole sequence of her being auctioned and later providing her services for the first time. The way that the camera focuses on Antonio Fargas's face while the governors and senators all bid on her draws a very clear and powerful parallel between the feminine condition and racial slavery. And later when the other woman workers of the brothel come to check on Violet, they found her a bit hurt but with a high morale and even cheerful. While most other film makers would make the whole experience particularly traumatic for her in order to make their point, Malle decides to make it as banal as possible because the clash between what is acceptable in the context of the film and whats acceptable in our living context is so intense that it makes the scene quite a bit more depressing. Not only that but also doing so he refuses Violet any feminine essentialism making the films conflict not the product of one or two bad people but the product of a series of social and economic tensions.",Pretty Baby
28,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,"Ultimately, a damp squib... though a controversial one.",6,20 April 2006,"Pretty Baby started off very well and I immediately thought: This is gonna be a gem! But it seemingly lost steam in the second half, petering out quite disappointingly towards the end. It was as if Louis Malle had been in a bit of a rush to conclude the story. Brooke Shields really was an angelically beautiful child - she seemingly peeked so early! The atmosphere in the brothel scenes was the best thing about the movie, probably helped by the fact that the photographer Bellocq's real photographs were used to get a sense of the time and place and evoke it with authenticity. Viewers particularly touchy to the issue of underage sex beware, as the movie doesn't spare modern sensibilities with the fact that the concept of a girl being too young for sex (if she was deemed sexually attractive) wasn't even an issue for most men in the early 20th century! That said, there are thankfully no explicit scenes - you just know what is happening and painfully squirm in your chair while it does! One qualm I did have with the movie was some of the slightly sloppy costuming: some of the clothes worn here seemed a little earlier than 1917, more like a decade earlier. Furthermore, the way everyone reacted to the pictures Bellocq, the young photographer took of the prostitutes seemed very anachronistic, and made me lose respect for the movie (Bellocq is a figure that actually existed, though the specific story built around him in the movie is fictional). Photography was by 1917 no longer considered a sort of ""magic"", viewed with incredulous wonder (as the characters in the movie react to it). This would have been more historically exact for a story set in, say, 1850 or thereabouts! I found that aspect to be a ridiculous - its makers really should have known better.",Pretty Baby
29,binaryg,A Beautiful and Captivating Pretty Baby,10,18 August 2006,"Pretty Baby, by Louis Malle raises a myriad of questions when viewed almost thirty years after its creation. ""Niggling"" questions about the appropriateness of the film itself, the topic of child prostitution, the use of young actresses and actors, the film's moral detachment, whether is should have been made or could be made again all flitted through my mind as I soaked in the beauty of the images. I was also captivated by the sub themes of race, class, and gender inequity were so subtly and effectively presented. Sven Nykvist's cinematography make it, for me, one of the most beautiful to look at films ever made. I love to see beautifully filmed movies and Pretty Baby is certainly that. Malle filmed it in hot and humid Louisiana and Mississippi but his focus on the visuals and his detachment from the characters and their situations give it a coolness and richness which were able to quiet questions in my mind. I don't think there are or have been many directors capable of making this film and seeing it released. I, for one am grateful Louis Malle was able to do so.I've read comments that Pretty Baby glamorizes child prostitution. That isn't what I experienced while watching it. As beautiful as Pretty Baby is to look at, seeing the twitching faces of the men during the auction of Violet and then their nonchalance and camaraderie in partaking in it made me shudder. What kind of people are these? But I don't mean to ask that question in a judgmental was but with true curiosity. In the end Malle give us a kind of happy ending. Hattie has rejected the prostitution of the whorehouse for the prostitution of marriage and has come and rescued Violet from New Orleans and Storyville. The closing shot gives us a long look at Violet's reaction to the prospect her altered and unknown future. A lot can be projected onto Brooke Shield's face.I remember seeing Pretty Baby back in '78 but I do not recall being particularly shocked. Seeing it now I could feel the nags and the amazement when experiencing Malle's audacity. Those were interesting times and my, how they've/we've changed.!",Pretty Baby
30,vocklabruck,"Not pornographic, but disturbing, still a good film that makes you think.",8,6 November 2006,"I had heard comments saying that this film was child pornography or something. That idea is totally wrong! The nude scenes where Violet (Brooke Shields) appears nude are only a few and pure, there is NO lascivious exhibition or anything similar. So please stop saying this is child pornography because it is not.---MAJOR SPOILERS---Anyway, I must say that most of the content, especially the first half, is disturbing because you can see how cruel was the social environment where the girl was living in. For example, they make her to prepare drugs for the old lady of the house, she is beaten, every woman keeps saying she will be such a beautiful revenue, she is allowed to see nudity and sexual intercourse anytime, and in general they do not handle her as a child, but as a servant and as a potential little whore all the time. The limit of sickness is when the girl's virginity is auctioned. Even her own mom agrees. At this moment you think ""Does someone there has a heart?"" It seems the only person that really loves her is the black pianist and you can see the indignation in his eyes during the auction, but he feels helpless cause he knows he cannot do anything because of his race.But the worst is that most of this abuse is being done with the little girl's consent and her WISH. You just cannot wait to break into the screen, take her and shout ""Wake up, baby, wake up!"" Somehow she realizes that no-one cares about her but on the other hand she wants attention and wants to be handled as an adult, just like all preteens want. Sadly the only way of life she knows to be an adult woman is to be a prostitute. But even though she wants to be an adult it is just like a game for her, because actually she behaves like a kid because she IS a kid. And at the finale is obvious how her innocence is still there when her mom comes back with a new dad for her and wants to take her to a better life, and she says to her husband/photographer ""Can't we all go?""... The finale makes you think ""I hope Violet will have a really better life now"". Since her new dad seems to be a respectable person you would think she will.I enjoyed the film. It is cruel, raw, you have to be prepared to watch this. The bad points is that this film has a slow pace, it is predictable and the actors are not too good, it seems they are reading lines. But I give it 8 out of 10 because the plot is well done also the time scenery/clothing/atmosphere, and specially because it is a controversial theme handled deeply.If someone asks me ""Was Brooke Shields exploited in this movie?"" I have to say of course, she was, not only for the nudes but for the situations she has to go through the film. Even though the nudes in this movie are tame, they are nudes after all and I don't think a girl that age feels comfortable being nude in a cinema production set with 20-30 people around looking at her, not to mention the things she has to say or to do with men in the movie. But what can you do? She was exploited, just like other kids in cinema like Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore, Shirley Temple and the most recent Dakota Fanning.",Pretty Baby

It's that much more disconcerting because all the while you're keenly aware that this isn't based on ""a true story"" but on millions of true stories throughout history, including today, and in every part of the globe.Due to my age I'd never seen 'Pretty Baby' in the theater or, for some reason, read much about it. I was aware of the basic plot but didn't know I'd be seeing quite so much of a naked 12 year-old Brooke Shields. A couple of moments were honestly difficult for me to watch, but I've come to the conclusion that the nudity is absolutely essential to the telling of the story. You *have* to be forced to see exactly what those men were paying for.The brilliance of director Loius Malle's film is that he constantly subverts the audience's desire to be aghast at what we see. The camera finds happy little moments throughout the movie, your mind is left to fill in the ugly realities.

This movie should be famous for nothing.It's a story that fakes its way throughout the entire movie. The movie wants to have a heart - showing a grown man kissing a naked preteen is not showing heart. Or courage. Or entertainment. Besides this movie being extremely distubring, it really is bad. Made in 1978 and set in 1917, I hope it is not an accurate description of the time period, or I would have killed myself if I lived then.
Did this film want to show the horrors of the brothels in World War I? Well, if it did, it did not need to show a naked 12 year old whose mother would do anything to get her famous. Even if Brooke Shields wasn't naked, this movie would still be absolutely unbearable. Shame on HBO for showing this movie more than once in the past week.

35,FrankDamage,"A Film about Lost Innocence, best viewed through ""Innocent Eyes""",8,6 July 2011,"This now infamous film, directed by Louis Malle, is without a doubt one that may shock and disturb many who view it. Even more so now than by the 1978 social standards when it was released. However, those who will not succumb to the possible knee-jerk and reactionary ""puritanical outrage"" that some of the imagery might invoke and can understand how it significantly contributes to the story itself, will come to witness an interesting and beautifully toned glimpse into the final days of legal prostitution within the red light district of pre 1920s New Orleans.A young Brooke Shields delivers a convincing, yet subtle and sincere performance as Violet, the underage prostitute whom the story centers around. Keith Carradine's loose portrayal of famed Louisiana photographer E. J. Bellocq (who was an actual photographer of the time that captured images of the prostitutes in this particular district) was an excellent incorporation into the storyline and adds a certain sense of credibility to the film, in relation to it being set within the particular era.The additional acting talents of Susan Sarandon and Antonio Fargas also do well in bringing this tale, based on the true accounts of a young New Orleans prostitute who worked in the actual Storyville district, to life.It's so authentic in it's ""flavor"" in fact that it won the ""Technical Grand Prize"" at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.This sad and true to life film guides us through not only a more primitive time in American history; one when many children (not only those subject to lives of prostitution) failed to even have the option of any childhood at all, but through the eyes of innocence and all the love and beauty and memories that those eyes found even within what many would only see as the most unforgivable of environments for innocence, or even hope.It's through THOSE eyes one must look to see the true beauty and love that went into the crafting of this historically memorable film.",Pretty Baby
36,MarkCrozier,Will make you nostalgic for the 70s,8,5 August 2021,"For a start, this film could only have been made in the 70s. It would never get off the starting blocks today in these ultra politically-correct times, which should make you wonder about how much actual 'progress' we have made.The truth is it is a fairly tame account of life in a 1920s New Orleans bordello. That said, it is made by one of the greatest directors to have ever lived, Louis Malle, so you will be thoroughly entertained throughout. It also features two fantastic actresses -- Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields. The latter must surely have had one of the most interesting careers in moviedom. I happen to think she's wonderful in this role -- totally unselfconscious and committed. I mean, she's 12 years old, for crying out loud!Brooke is without a doubt one of the most fascinating actresses and of course one of the most beautiful to ever grace the screen. (For more of young Brooke, check out Wanda Nevada, a terrific comedy that was made a year later.) Just consider that in two years from '78-'79 she made this film, 'Wanda Nevada', 'Endless Love' and 'King of the Gypsies'. Before she turned 16 years of age... not too shabby.Apart from that, Pretty Baby is a fascinating look at life in a cathouse but still somewhat romanticized, if you ask me. One imagines the real conditions of these working women's lives was quite a bit more harsh than is shown here. Nevertheless, one is grateful for the moments of lightheartedness as its not meant to be a documentary.If this sort of thing fascinates you take a look at 'House of Tolerance' (2010) which offered a more realistic view of life in a turn of the century whorehouse in Paris.",Pretty Baby

I think it's a terrible tragedy to put a child in a movie like this. I am certain that psychological damage was inflicted on Brooke Shields as a child that had been subject to this kind of abuse. No child male or female should ever be made to undress and perform in a film for adults. Fortunately, laws are in place today forbidding the sexual exploitation of minors. With luck and compassion from the general public, no 13 year old girl will ever be made to perform in this kind of movie again.

38,aci-4,lvoe it,10,18 February 2018,"Again this is one of those movies that one either loves or literally hates it cause of the subject.
The acting was pretty good, seen better tho..
The set is AMAZING !!! Totaly have that vibe of those times, not that i would know how it really was lol .. but it has that thing, just has.
Also in many ways it shows how prostitution ,or as today they love to call it, escorting or sex work ... was so much different, it was more human ,more down to earth , not slutty ,whoresih ,glamour like it is today.
Simply it had CLASS,as the borthels as the prostitutes.
As far as Brooke goes aka Violet, she was amazing, prolly her best movie ever and thats so strange consideting it was done so so long ago, but the way she acted ,her speach, facial expressions, and how she didnt seem botered at all doing and acting a kid prostitute ,is someting to be admired about for sure.
As a matter a fact i bet that if this was remade 10 times with nowadays 12yo actors, non would be able to do such a great job as Brooke did! Not to say that theres no way a movie like this would be ever made in this day and age sadly , and specially not with a real 12yo playing a 12yo whore.
And of course , her beauty ,cuteness ,adds to it as well, shes with out a doubt one of the prettiest child actors EVER ,if not THE.
Of course, there will be people that will play the Virgin Mary here and act like they wanna puke or something , being disgusted by a movie like this and the fact that a 12yo plays a whore, and there are nude scenes of her as well.
Well, if a 20yo would play a 12yo that would look funny as hell ,nor it would be able to bring the reality of it.
Secondly , i dont understand whats the big deal about seing a naked 12yo?? I mean like , you guys dont have kids? You never seen them naked?
You dont know that there are actually nudist families where everyone is naked including the kids and they go out and see 1000 of others and are being seen? 
I just dont get all the freaking out about it ... besides, i challenge everyone with those morals that has a 12yo dau or son , to check their Instagram acc ..just dont get schocked. At the end of the day , on Instagram today , you can find hundreds of young girl models even younger then 10!!! that model , some 12-13yo ,well... almost nude ,some in very very provocative clothing and poses, all done by managing companies with the amen of the parents of course, they have 10s and 100s of thousands of followers, some of the cooments are hey sexy , hey hottie , no one seemz to be bothered by that tho? They all making big $ of it.
Some people even leave comments that would be like, well.. maybe you should wait with those kind of pictures, and then they get bashed by that 13yo saying to those adult persons that they are too convservative lol .. 
So please stop being hypocrites , this was just a movie, yes she was naked yes she played a whore ,key word ,played , yes she was exploited in those times in general , but it was just her! but these models im talking about are REAL ,and there are thousands of them ,yet no one says anything about that?? Maybe cause the same ppl that bash on this movie are too oldish now and they know even have a clue what kind of stuff is out there on social media ,because they dont use that , and when you have a 13yo telling you that you are too conservative ,you must really think twice. Specially if you are from the States, cause you guys freak too much about stuff like this,yet you are all about diversity and acceptance.",Pretty Baby
39,amadeusrye,Interesting But Disturbing,7,2 February 2003,"I think this film does a very good job capturing the period of 1917 New Orleans and shows a different side to early 20th century America.

It tarnishes the story, which is actually quite absorbing.",Pretty Baby
40,mk4,This Movie Is Based On Truth!,8,25 December 2004,"I'd like to point out that this movie is literally based on first hand recollections of a prostitute interviewed in Al Rose's definitive book on the subject: ""Storyville"", published many years ago. Anyone familiar with with the era knows that the photographer, E.J. Bellocq, was a real person who captured on glass plates forever the images of the young prostitutes of Storyville. These photographs are hauntingly beautiful in their own right, and the young Brooke Shields--as well as the beautiful Susan Sarandon--were a masterstroke of Malle to play the parts of mother and daughter prostitutes. The recollections in the book draw upon the actual fact that the mother who related the story actually took part in the deflowering of her daughter in the ""House"" as described, and that they went on to be a ""team"", a very common and desirable commodity in that day. Not mentioned-- but inferred to those who ""read between the lines""-- was that the pony that young Violet casually rides in the backyard of the mansion in the beginning of the movie was actually an animal used to entertain the paying customers in ""the circus"" that certain women performed in ...for the""right price."" Many of the photo sessions depicted in the film are loving recreations of surviving Bellocq prints. The women portraying the ""girls"" in the movie could have been working girls in ""The District"" had they lived back then. Some IMDb readers profess to be shocked by conditions in Storyville back then, but as the book recounts, it was all true, and many of the women actually did enjoy their livelyhood. It was the ""bluenoses"" to the rescue who saved them and the U.S. Navy from themselves, just as they would save the nation from ""drink"" a few years later. Although ragtime and jazz are touched on in the movie, Storyville was directly responsible for the likes of young Louis Armstrong--who ran coal from House to House--picking up the street melodies he heard and playing them on a cornet furnished to him--providentially--by the local orphanage, and for Ferdinand ""Jelly Roll"" Morton, pianist...and pimp...who played in only the best houses and claimed he invented the term ""jazz"" as applied to music after witnessing first hand all that ""jassing-around"" he saw in the bordellos of Storyville! Remarkeably, overlooked altogether is any mention of the composer of the tune ""Pretty Baby,"" Professor Tony Jackson, a key figure of the Storyville saga, who should have been the character portrayed in the film but wasn't, and who was not even mentioned in the credits.As for Bellocq himself not much is known except that he was slightly deformed and not interested in the ladies at all sexually-- the marriage to Violet merely a modern plot device--but he professed his deep fascination and reverence for them, thankfully, in other ways: his portraits. Without them, a poignant record of their lives,and that of The District, would be lost forever. All in all, the film is a wonderful paean to Bellocq, and the women he loved in his own way. I would urge all critics of this movie to seek out a copy of ""Storyville, New Orleans"" by Al Rose, or MOMA's ""E.J. Bellocq: Storyville Portraits."" They will really open yours eyes to what Louis Malle has recreated.",Pretty Baby
41,dudleynomore,Why this really is actually just child porn,1,20 August 2010,"The nudity doesn't ultimately add anything to the story (hence porn) and the nudity in question is of a child (hence child porn). If the movie was exactly the same but the lead actress was older, no one would make the argument that the nudity added anything, because the whole point of it is the added impact it makes thanks to Brooke Shields being twelve. Seems pretty straightforward to me.Giving the film-makers the benefit of the doubt, it seems to assume we're going to have a particular reaction to child nudity, something like ""oh no, how awful it was for children in that situation back then!"" But all the truly unpleasant abuse has to occur off-screen for obvious reasons, so any dramatic impact is toothless. None of the nudity is placed within a context that forces the audience to confront how awful it is, on the contrary it's all supremely tasteful, partly thanks to the whitewashed characterization of the most artificially appealing pedophile in cinema history, Bellocq. And by using real child nudity in an attempt to demonstrate how exploitative of children people were back then, the film ignores its own message.It doesn't help that there effectively is no story. There's almost no focus on what Violet is actually feeling at all, instead there's an alternation between scenes where she acts like a child and scenes where she earns her keep as a prostitute. I got the impression I was supposed to sympathize with the character solely because she was a child in a sh!tty situation, not because the writers gave her interesting traits, or at the very least, conveyed an impression of how she saw the world.We could argue how to define porn, of course, but I don't think that's difficult: it's where the nudity is the point. If this movie hadn't had Brooke Shields naked no one would even remember it, as there's little dramatic content and no plot. The main character has, from beginning to end, no ultimate control over her fate - and regardless of how realistic that is it still makes for a lousy story. If they had made the narrative more character-based, so it hinged on something that Violet could have some influence over, perhaps a story about a child prostitute in this era could have worked... but not like this.1/10, one of the most pathetically misguided art-house exploitation flicks ever.",Pretty Baby
42,jep831,intentionally disturbing,6,1 February 2005,"I think it was a fine piece of film making about a horrific situation. I agree with a previous poster that its understated tone was one of its strengths. The film maker presents a detailed, rounded view of the lifestyle and its effects on a girl who is much too young and much too pretty to have been allowed to ply her trade.One of the ways I judge the strength of a film is the extent to which I wonder ""what happens next?"" after the closing credits. I would say the film succeeded. From the expression on Violet's face in the closing shot, I think she had been so warped by everything she had seen and done that, no matter what, she would never be able to become a normal woman living a normal life. My fear is that whether she went back to prostitution or lived a presumptively respectable life, she would always be ignorant, impulsive, self-centered and someone who used her appearance to manipulate others. After all, she, like everyone else in the world, can only know what she has been taught.",Pretty Baby
43,Dale65,Beautifully made,10,5 July 1999,"Louis Malle is one of the late geniuses of film.  ""Pretty Baby"" is one of his most beautiful achievements.  Telling the story of a lonely photographer's obsession with a precocious twelve-year old prostitute named Violet(Brooke Shields) in New Orleans early in the century.The photographer (Keith Carradine) eventually allows Violet to move in with him, and then marries her.  In a wonderful scene, Carradine buys Violet a baby doll.  She is thrilled, but then asks why he bought her a doll. ""Every child should have a doll"" he replies.  Shields reaction is perfect, she is angered that he still thinks of her as a child, but cannot help but play with the doll in the very next scene.Shields hits all the right notes here.  She goes from sexy and alluring, to childish and innocent with a snobbish pout.  She is charmingly free-spirited from being raised in a brothel, and often appears totally naked in front of strange men many times her age.  Prostitution is all that she knows, and Malle does not shy away from it.This film was largely shunned when it was first released.   It seems, having read some of the other comments here, that the trend continues.  This is a mature film, for mature minds.  See it and enjoy.",Pretty Baby
44,maraudertheslashnymph,Transcends the controversy,9,2 May 2008,"Once you get past the fact of a naked preteen Brooke Shields, Pretty Baby is a well-made film that does an excellent job of evoking a specific time and place, and of developing the unique relationship between a precocious, sometimes bratty twelve-year-old prostitute and the quiet, sometimes temperamental photographer who loves her. The nudity, by the way, does not take place during any love scenes, though at one point there is nudity after one.Brooke Shields's Violet is energetic, talkative, blunt, and friendly. What you see is what you get, not that her character is shallow. She's been raised in a whorehouse by her prostitute mother and takes things in stride that for most people would be traumatic, such as having her virginity auctioned off at the age of twelve and being left at the brothel for a time when her mother leaves to get married. She's an odd mix of child and woman, the sort of girl who wants a grown man to have sex with her but also plays with the doll he gives her. Having spent her entire life around adult sexuality, she's convinced she knows everything about men.However, in the words of Bellocq, the photographer, ""Some men are different."" He arrives at the whorehouse to take pictures of the women employed there and shows much more passion about his need for good light in his photography than about any of them; the madam immediately concludes that he's gay (an ""invert"" or ""cream puff""). For the most part he appears to be asexual, appreciating the beauty of Violet's mother's naked breasts but only because of how well they'll photograph. As he tells the curious Violet, ""I have no time for hate or love,"" and when he falls for her it seems to be a surprise to him. He's the anti-Humbert. He doesn't actively seek out young girls, and if he and Violet end up involved, it's because of her pursual of him.Their relationship is tumultuous yet committed, with tender embraces, screaming fights and tickling kisses. Bellocq's not always very much more mature than Violet, especially if she interferes with his beloved photography. The end of the film is either a tragedy or a relief, depending on your opinion about their romance. Either way, it's emotional.Susan Saradon is good as Violet's mother, and the minor characters, from the drug-addicted madam to the friendly black piano player to the stuck-up German prostitute to the various clients of the brothel, come across as real people. The sets and costumes are gorgeous. There are a couple of flaws - some parts of the film take a few minutes longer than they really need to - but all in all it's a good film that becomes deeper and more complex the more times you see it.",Pretty Baby

I felt that the subject of child prostitution was very well handled, and that (surprisingly enough), Brooke Shield's performance was very textured and real. As outlandish as the whole thing was, Louis Malle really sucked me into that turn of the century red light district world, and thankfully did not bludgeon me over the head with exploitation or heavy handed tragedy.  I'm still not very sure where the moral center of the movie was located, but I think that was Malle's point-- that it's a good idea to question and re-evaluate all taboo subjects to understand why they are taboo in the first place.",Pretty Baby

A lovely young girl of 12 introduced into that sordid world I believe would be more messed up in the head than depicted in this movie. But then again she's a 12 year old and kids are kids even though in one part of the movie she states that she's not a child. A typical preteen comment even in 1917. The impression I got watching the movie was that Violet was living proof that being deflowered does not a woman make anymore than a boy becomes a man the first time he's had sex. Violet certainly didn't act like a woman even when she got ""married."" The ending proves that when she decides to go with mommy. A kid is a Kid is a kid.

However, all the things I've seen it lauded for are in fact sub par - story, script, performances and cinematography. The one thing it has going for it is historical interest - it is a great snapshot of New Orleans in this era, touching on the US navy and its role in supporting, then ultimately wrecking, ""red light"" culture, as well as music, race relations, poverty and prostitution. In this sense it has a Upton Sinclair-like quality, and might be watched only for the purpose of learning about New Orleans. But it falls far short of telling any kind of cinematic story. It feels from beginning to end like a cheap documentary, with no real concept of art or story telling, but only a ""look at how bad this life was"" approach. The movie is constantly interrupted by superfluous scenes that lead nowhere and add nothing, and is laced with moments that the director obviously thought were pregnant with meaning, but are actually just awkwardly long. I was begging for the credits to roll an hour before they did. The movie is sloppy and uninspired from start to finish, which is a shame because turn of the century New Orleans is a story that deserves to be told well.",Pretty Baby

57,netarch,Bravo Louis Malle,8,4 January 2001,Very disturbing reality break. Child prostitution was prevalent in North America well into the early 20th century. This gives a good insight into demise of many children during this period. We were totally devoid of child protection agencies. Although many narrow minded artistically challenged people will label this movie as child pornography it is not. There is no suggestion of condoning or promoting of such. Louis Malle used a combination of shock and graphically disturbing scenes to get his message across. To have censored this movie would have been a throw back to the dark ages for artistic freedom. Although the acting leaves something to be desired it is a must watch for those wanting to see a dramatization of the hopelessness of the lives of children in the early Southern States.,Pretty Baby

59,wolfofthepride,The Facts Which Scare Us,7,17 February 2010,"Of course, this film is controversial, but it is mostly, if not completely, factual. It's the DEEP SOUTH, people. That's classic New Orleans. Catholic whores, whipping, swamps, children in the whorehouses, racism, the accent, the voodoo, the attitude, the sexuality. It's all part of the Deep South in the 20th Century. The only things missing are the crawdads and Mardi Gras. And I can understand the bad reviews, but those of you who do not think this is an excellent film do not understand the era nor the neck of the woods.What I liked about this film is the actuality. There are still actual whores who are 12 or younger. They are in the underbelly of the city, banned from the French Quarter. Of course, the whores portrayed were high-class. They were those one would find on Bourbon Street, although Bourbon's whores are much lower than that now. When Storyville was still running, the Red Light District would promote each slut it had. Even Madame Nell knows to auction off a preteen's virginity is illegal, but it still happened. I'm glad this film was made. Of course, American directors don't have the guts to display this kind of truth. I understand it may not have been necessary to show Shields nude, but if anyone has read the trivia, it states a large number of young girls turned the role down. Her parents obviously knew what was going to happen and still allowed her to participate. It was a role which not every preteen could portray. Shields was extremely mature and played her part very well. I wouldn't say it's pedophilia. There are some who may find pleasure in a twelve- year-old's lady parts, but Bellocq loved her for her innocence. He even asks her to not speak as a whore. It's real. It's what actually happened. It's not what would have happened today, but it is truthful. It was a different time in a different place. For instance, Edgar Allan Poe, one of the greatest American writers in history, married his own cousin. This may be strange today, but back then, it may, repeat may, have been common. In Ancient Egypt, pharaohs married their own sisters before their twentieth birthdays. This made more sense, though: they wanted to keep their bloodline pure, and puberty is the time when the body is ready to conceive and reproduce. Therefore, the teen years were originally meant for marriage. It's not out of pornography that Malle created this film. It's out of truth. It is true. Today, still. The movie showed exactly what all of you who despise this film believe. It took a lot of thought to produce this film. The architecture, the plant life, the community, the underage drinking. From what I've seen and known growing up around the Big Easy, it's all pretty much true. I believe what you dislike is that it actually happened. It's a historical film. It's factual. New Orleans has changed, but there is no escape of the past. The Saints just won the SuperBowl after 43 years of failure. We can't escape the fact that our first playoff game was in 1990, 23 years after the team manifested. We can't escape the fact that Katrina's devastation could have been slimly less grim because those who were too hard-headed to flee stayed and died. We can't escape the fact that we have been the murder capital of the United States. We can escape the fact that we are the murder capital of the United States, but only for the same reason that so many of you are complaining. Times have changed, but those times are forever in history. Times will change again. Fortunately, we weren't too late for the times to change and this movie to never have existed.",Pretty Baby

I couldn't follow it because I was too young. It came on this morning and after viewing it, I can say the acting is not all that great and the direction of the film reminded of a student film project. Overall I was left with the impression that it was a last ditch effort by the film maker to legitimize the use of nude children in film. It is nothing short of being a really soft-core child porn film. If you must view this film take into deep consideration that your freedom may be in question because you would have to order it online or have it ordered into a store.

I expect better than animated whining from Susan Sarandon - really, one of her less well-thought-out roles. The only person who managed to convey the nature of his character was Keith Carradine. The acting was painfully wooden on the part of the supporting characters, especially the Madam, Frances Faye (oy geveult!). I don't understand how Louis Malle, writer and director of _Au_Revoir_Les_Enfants_ could produce a film with such lackluster portrayals of potentially engrossing characters.So, for all of that, only the painterly direction of Mr. Malle and his willingness to look unflinchingly at something that turns most people's stomachs saves the film. Yes, it is disturbing to see Ms. Shields naked in sexual contexts, and performing and intimating acts that we try to keep the pubescent from even learning about in this country (USA). This is the beauty of the film, and its entire aesthetic reason to be.If you're offended by naked baby buttocks, sexually aware pre-teens, or horrific acting, don't see this movie.

In the US, it is supposedly illegal to show full frontal and posterior nudity of minors (under the age of 18) and yet, at least 4 shots of both are in this movie.

65,tunnels-15236,"Brilliantly made, but sends the wrong message",7,4 June 2020,"After years of hearing about this movie, I finally saw it yesterday. To say that i didn't feel uncomfortable and disturbed by certain scenes in this movie would be an outright lie. The tale of a 12 year old girl named Violet (played by a stunning preteen Brooke Shields) growing up in a New Orleans brothel in the 1920's with little to no parental supervision, and surrounded by adult female prostitutes as her ""role models"", is a truly interesting, well done movie that sure leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.Now, on one hand, the movie is honest in that it shows how children living in America were used and abused in the past (and still happens today). That is the honest part of the movie. What is so terrible about this movie is that the character of Violet doesn't much mind that she is being constantly pimped out by the Madame of the brothel, Nell. In one shocking scene, we see Violet being asked to sit in the lap of an adult man in front of her mother, who is also in the room. He then proceeds to practically feel her up all the while Madame Nell watches. For the first time in the movie we see Madame Nell view Violet as a commidity despite her extremely young age. The following scene shows Nell putting Violet into super skimpy dress, then painting her lips bright red, and finally giving her heels. The Madame then puts Violet in a smoke filled roomed with literally dozens of men leering ar her like a piece of meat. What girl of 12 is not going to not be scared to death of being in a room filled with a bunch of dirty old men, while dressed in just high heels and a transparent nightgown, with clearly no underwear on? Yet the movie shows Violet as being relaxed and cheerful about being auctioned off to a group of amoral pedophiles, and this is what is so ojectionable about the film. This is what makes the film damaging to the culture in a way no movie has ever done before. In other words, it legitimizes the sexual exploitation of a child. Not explicitly but covertly. In a romantic gloss of pretty visuals. Yes, the movie is well done and gorgeous to look at. But it hides something very disturbing (not to mention just plain false) at the heart of it: sexually violate a pre teen girl and maybe, just maybe, it might not be such a serious crime afterall.Even scarier is the potential for this movie to influence a young girls' outlook on sex in a way that opens up for her to be sexually exploited. Think about it, a pre teen girl is watching this movie about a beautiful and glamorous 12 year old girl who is a prostitute, and many if not most of the male clients at said brothel find her extremely desirable. There is a suggestion made to a pre teen girl that if they really wanted to make some money, there are men who would pay her lots of money if they got together in a private place, and then take off her clothes. After watching this movie and seeing how almost all the adult males featured here can't stop being utterly fascinated by Violet, would the experience THEN be viewed by the young girl being exploited in REAL life as something horrible, or a good way to make a lot of money in a short period of time? It's something to seriously think about.",Pretty Baby
66,truth1st,True account of early sexuality in America.,10,3 September 2005,"Having heard stories from my Grandfather of the late 1890's thru early 1900's about the brothels here is Salt Lake,the movie give's a accurate look into the world of the ""Higher Class"" brothels. Girl's as young as 10 some,as in the movie daughters of the prostitutes,or girls who for what ever reason had left their homes. Yes; in this day of greater awareness of child abuse it's shocking to learn that through out history little or no thought was given to the age of children when it came to sex,all of us,if we go back in our family genealogy will find a very young great ###### great female who is responsible for us being here. And to you Christians,don't forget that Mary was 13 or 14 when Christ was born,she also was betrothed to Joseph at age 12, which was the custom then.",Pretty Baby

68,mdo_3,boring movie,6,9 February 2006,"Really this is not good movie. The end is without a doubt very bad In the beginning this very boring. In my opinion this very badly acted. it deals with a house of burlesque that in its salaries has a girl of 12 years and the day arrives to sell it to the best bidder.They sell it. Then it enamors with a photographer, and one flees with.It buys a wrist and him to him it takes a photo with her. (right as it appears in the cover) If they create you who you leave scenes sex they are very mistaken. Single violet she appears naked when the photographer takes a photo him. to really see it he is exasperating. I got this movie because in the cover he says that the director is good and very acclaimed. But I do not create like this. In the Plot it says that you have it to do and that seem deals with child prostitution but not me as good as think. It is not worth the trouble to spend as much money for boring.",Pretty Baby
