0,TheLittleSongbird,A monstrously fun vacation,7,2 August 2018,"The first 'Hotel Transylvania' was surprisingly good, after expecting to dislike it. The second film garnered mixed reviews, though a fair few of them had been negative, some thought it was great fun while others disliked it intensely. Personally am in the former.'Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation' is the second sequel and also got mixed reviews. Some people, like the first two films, enjoyed it a lot, again others disliked and even hated it. Personally belong in the former camp. 'Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation' is less than perfect, could have been much better and like the second film is inferior to the first film, but it was again much better than expected and was quite enjoyable in its own way.Starting with the many good points, the animation is great, vibrantly colourful, vivid, never blocky and meticulously detailed. The character designs are very much improved, though never had a problem with them in the first place. The soundtrack is very catchy and fits very well.Dialogue is witty and hilarious, avoiding going into distaste and immaturity. And the gags hit more than they miss, coming by thick and fast, one highlight being a booby trap-laden dance scene. The fast pace and good natured antics make 'Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation' a very easy watch for the whole family. The message is sincere and easy to relate to, giving the film some heart without being heavy-handed. Voice acting is on the money, Adam Sandler's Dracula in all three films sees him give some of his better work in recent years. Kathryn Hahn is a great addition and Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez improve hugely over the previous film. The standouts for me were Steve Buscemi (as ever), Kevin James and David Spade, the last two giving some of their funniest and best work of late.For all those good things there are faults. Parts did get a bit too hectic and noisy and the story is basic and predictable with a few side-stories not serving much point. Would have liked the secondary characters to have more screen time, character development generally is lacking and a few characters are near-incidental to the plot. Also expected a stronger finale than the anaemic one that goes overboard on the silliness.Overall though, a good fun time. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
1,SnoopyStyle,missed the hotel,5,21 September 2018,"In 1897 Transylvania, the monsters are being hunted by Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) and Dracula (Adam Sandler) manages to defeat him. Today, Dracula feels lonely. His daughter Mavis takes him and the gang on a monster vacation. They fly out to the Bermula Triangle where they board a Monster cruise ship. Dracula gets zinged by the ship's human captain Ericka and little does he know that she's actually Van Helsing's great-granddaughter. Van Helsing has survived as part machine hiding in the ship and planning his revenge by retrieving a monster destroying artifact from the ruins of Atlantis. I miss the hotel in Hotel Transylvania. The hotel is another star character in the franchise. The world is sold as a scary place for monsters and the hotel as an oasis for them. This movie runs counter to that in many ways. It feels artificial. A Love Boat cruise and a Vegas techno party only add to its fakeness. Defeating the monster with Macarena is really cheesy. I like the charms of this franchise but this movie takes that homey family story to a Vegas dance girl show. I don't like it. It's probably fun for little kids with all the flash and noise. It's not for me and I hope the franchise returns to the hotel.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
2,boblipton,Funnier Than I Expected,6,20 December 2020,"Dracula is feeling overwhelmed, so his daughter decides everyone needs a vacation. Everyone packs his, her and its bag, and it's off to a cruise through the Bermuda Triangle. Drac falls for the cruise captain, but what he doesn't know is she's van Helsing's great-grand daughter, helping the old man locate an artifact to destroy all monsters.Director Genndy Tartakovsky fills up this greedy money grab with some funny gags. My favorite is the airline they take to get to the cruise ship, run by gremlins that make Bob Clampett's look lazy. The animation is a sloppy mix of excellent computer-enhanced work and minimal detail, although one of the gags references Harryhausen stop-motion work. I went in expecting to be mildly bored, but the large number of jokes won me over.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
3,Horst_In_Translation,"Lacks charm and quality characters from the previous two, but still worth seeing for the fun aspect",6,18 July 2018,"""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" is the third installment from Genndy Tartakovsky's animated Dracula franchise. And sadly, in my opinion, it is the weakest so far. The film runs for sligthly over 90 minutes and the focus is really only on one single plot point here, namely Dracula falling in love and the struggles on the long road to happiness. Things do not get particularly easier as the woman of his choice is the great-granddaughter of his (seemingly immortal) arch enemy. This connection made me ask one question quickly. Will she stay the antagonist, which would have meant Dracula finding another love interest obviously, or will she be the one? But her changing feelings and doubts as well as the significance of the ""ching"" (is that the English term? I watched the German dub) make it easy to see which path the story is heading here. And it makes sense overall I guess, maybe not so much that Van Helsing eventually also changes allegiance, even if being rescued from death by his nemesis is something unexpected. Oh well. But he was even ready to sacrifice the woman, let's not forget that, he just cannot be seen as some of the good guys so quickly.Yeah well, my dislike here at times has mostly to do with my perception of Ericka, who did very little for me as a key character compared to Mavis in previous films and I am a great fan of her. The latter's man also has very little screen time. Besides, this film here really did not feel as witty in terms of smart and interesting pop culture references compared to the previous two. A bit of a shame and I don't think it's me not getting these references. The supporting characters/monsters each get one or two moments to shine, but there they did come a bit short too like the fish folks or everybody else basically, especially the invisible man who was extremely bland and unfunny unfortunately. The only exception are the wolf parents. Their scenes with or without all their kids were great fun and I'd probably even watch a film focusing on them alone. Nothing wrong with the visual side here at all, some special effects scenes were great even and the attention to detail is rock solid too. But I would have been very surprised for a Sony Pictures movie to mess things up in this department.Another letdown was the final battle scene with the music war between the two. I expected something more memorable there to be honest because they really built it up big style and it wasn't one of the best scenes or highlights of the film. Overall, an okay watch if you enjoyed films one and two. If these did not do too much for you already, then it's maybe best to skip number three. I am not sure if I want to see a fourth film judging from this one here, but if they make one I think I still give it a chance hoping they can step things up a bit. ""Summer Vacation"" gets a cautious thumbs-up from me. Worth checking out for my fellow animation lovers.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
4,claudio_carvalho,Predictable but Very Funny,7,30 September 2018,"When the lonely Count Dracula goes on vacation with Mavis, his family and monster friends on the cruise ship Legacy, he immediately falls in love with the human Captain Ericka. However the mysterious woman has a secret that may jeopardize Dracula, his family and the other monsters. Who is Captain Ericka?""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" is another funny animation of this successful franchise. This time with a predictable romance between Dracula and a woman. In-between, lots of confusions and funny situations with the monsters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Hotel Transilvânia 3: Férias Monstruosas!""

5,nogodnomasters,You only zing once.,6,30 July 2018,"PLOT SPOILER: The monsters take a summer vacation on the cruise ship ""Legacy"" to Atlantis. The ship is a Van Helsing trap. The film series continues with its anti-discrimination message and one of acceptance of diversity. The problem is that the jokes wear thin. The initial people/monster surprises was great in the first film, but not anymore. Just like Adam Sandler films, they all have the same jokes and blend together. The kids did love it.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
6,kosmasp,Love (monster) boat,5,21 November 2018,"If you've seen the previous movies, you know what's up. And you'll know the characters and you'll get the jokes you expect this to make. And you get a bonus love story on top of that. Now you don't have to have seen the other movies to ""enjoy"" this. Actually especially young kids who watch this may not have been born when the others were released.Again, this aims to please the kids and Adam Sandler is doing another fun/children movie. You can hate it on it for multiple reasons or accept it for what it is, if it doesn't float your boat. It's not excellent, it's not a masterpiece (quite far away from it), it does exactly what it says on the cover. Nothing more and nothing less either.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
7,jboothmillard,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,4,26 August 2021,"The first film was rubbish, the second film was slightly better, the fourth movie, Transformania, was coming to cinemas, so I thought I'd get on with the third film, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of Dexter's Laboratory). Basically, back in 1897, Dracula (Adam Sandler, also producing) and his monster friends often had run-ins with Drac's arch-enemy Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan). Van Helsing became obsessed with destroying Dracula but was always outsmarted by the vampire. In the present day, Dracula is running his Transylvania hotel business smoothly with his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and human son-in-law Jonathan ""Johnny"" Loughran (Andy Samberg). Drac has remained single since his wife Martha's death and makes attempts to meet someone. Mavis mistakes her father's recent behaviour for stress from overwork, so books a cruise for them to take a break and spend more time together as a family. Dracula, Johnny, Mavis, their son Dennis (Asher Blinkoff), Dracula's father Vlad (Mel Brooks), and the hotel guests Frankenstein ""Frank"" (Kevin James), Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Murray the mummy (Keegan-Michael Key), and Blobby (Jonny Solomon) board a cruise ship called the Legacy. Dracula sees the ship's human captain, Ericka (Kathryn Hahn), and is immediately smitten with her, something that he thought was impossible as he had already ""zinged"" before. Ericka goes to a private and secret room on the lower decks and is revealed to be the great-granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing, who is still alive becoming almost entirely mechanized. Van Helsing has a plan to eliminate all the monsters when they reach their destination at the lost city of Atlantis. Van Helsing makes Ericka promise to not assassinate Dracula beforehand, but she makes repeated unsuccessful attempts to do so anyway. Encouraged by his friends, Dracula nervously asks Ericka out on a date, and she accepts, wanting another opportunity to kill him. As they dine on a deserted island, Ericka unexpectedly begins to fall in love with Drac, after they learn about each other's pasts. Mavis becomes suspicious of Ericka and her motives. The cruise ship reaches Atlantis, which has been converted into a casino. Shortly after arriving, Dracula follows Ericka to an underground crypt, learning that she is after a ""family heirloom"". With Dracula's help, they evade the booby traps and manage to escape with the object. Mavis arrives and confronts them, and Dracula confesses that he ""zinged"" with Ericka, to his daughter's surprise and confusion. After Ericka is told what a ""zing"" is, she rejects Dracula's romantic feelings, leaving Dracula heartbroken and leaving Mavis feeling guilty. A regretful Ericka gives Van Helsing the object, the Instrument of Destruction, and he sets a trap for the monsters at a dance party. Mavis takes advice from Johnny and tells her depressed father to talk to Ericka, admitting that she was afraid of him leaving her. Van Helsing shows up and pushes away the DJ, and a saddened Ericka is forced to reveal that she is his great-granddaughter. Van Helsing unveils the Instrument of Destruction, a music note sheet and plays a song (an ""audio edited"" version of Astronomia by Vicetone and Tony Igy.) that drives a friendly Kraken (Joe Jonas) living near the island to attack the monsters. Dracula tries to stop the Kraken, Ericka saves him from the giant monster and pleads with her great-grandfather to stop the destruction, confessing her love for Drac. This infuriates Van Helsing, and he attacks them both. Johnny brings out a portable DJ kit and plays positive songs (""Good Vibrations"" and ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"") to calm the beast down, only for Van Helsing's music to beat them. Finally, playing the ""Macarena,"" the Kraken is relaxed and happy for good. Van Helsing im unable to counter the song as the humans and monsters dance to the music, the music sheet is possessed by the tune and rips itself to pieces. Van Helsing's robotic body is also possessed by the music, causing him to slip and fall, but Dracula saves him. Touched by the act of kindness, Van Helsing apologises to the monsters and gives everybody a full refund for the cruise, before sending them back. Back at Hotel Transylvania, Dracula proposes to Ericka, who stammers at the question before accepting. Also starring Fran Drescher as Eunice, Molly Shannon as Wanda, Tara Strong as Frankenlady, Sunny Sandler (Adam's daughter) as Sunny, and Sadie Sandler as (Adam's daughter) as Winnie. The cast are all chosen well for their parts, the characters are all likeable, the slapstick jokes and spoofs of horror movie things are amusing, the highlights are the dance through a series of boobytraps and seeing all the monsters busting the ""Macarena"", kids watching will have fun this slightly more enjoyable sequel, a reasonable computer-animated comedy. Okay!",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

10,oscaralbert,"First, the Montagues and the Capulets . . .",7,23 July 2018,". . . then the Hatfields and the McCoys, and NOW we have a love connection between the Van Helsing and the Dracula Families?! TRANSYLVANIA 3: SUMMER VACATION posits that the former clan can bury their hatchets (or oak stakes), while the latter blood-thirsty crew can simply switch to V-8 Juice consumption. Not everyone will buy this, just as the play ""Summer for Hitler"" (featuring that catchy lyric, ""Oh, the Nazis and the Semites should be FRIENDS!"") flopped at the box office, closing after just 11 not-sold-out performances. However, at a time when an Oval Office Occupant is taking his cues from ""Saturday Night Live"" by jumping into bed with ""Mad Vlad,"" the Russian Czar, perhaps TRANSYLVANIA's Glad Dad (aka, Count D) hitting the sheets with a Van Helsing is just another sign of these, The End Times. So don't be surprised if TRANSYLVANIA's Sony bosses borrow Bambi from Disney for a sequel in which Thumper's godson romances a hunter's daughter. Sure, the groom's granny won't be attending any of the wedding festivities (since Walt served her up as meat balls in the 1900s), but isn't an after-dinner belch somewhat of a happy ending?",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

And I'd be lying if I said I can remember anything about the other movies in this series (not even sure I've seen the second one), but ""Hotel Transylvania 3"" is decent Summer fluff. This is due primarily to the supporting cast, the playful animation and - particularly - an appearance by the kraken. Which is nice, we could use more giant mythical cephalopods in movies these days.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
12,Hellmant,Not quite as clever and funny as the others,6,20 July 2018,"'HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 3: SUMMER VACATION': Three Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the popular computer-animated horror-comedy series. The story has to deal with Dracula and his monster friends taking their summer vacation on a Luxury Monster Cruise Ship, when Dracula falls for the ship's captain, who's also trying to kill him. The film was once again directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (who also helmed the first two), and it was written by Tartakovsky and Michael McCullers. It once again stars the voice talents of Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Keegan-Michael Key, Molly Shannon, Fran Drescher and Mel Brooks (all reprising their roles from the other movies). While Kathryn Hahn and Jim Gaffigan join the cast. It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also another hit at the Box Office as well (just like the others). I enjoyed it, but not quite as much as the first two.Dracula (Sandler) and his monster family decide to take a summer trip, aboard a Luxury Monster Cruise Ship. When Dracula meets the ship's captain, Ericka (Hahn), he immediately falls for her. What Dracula doesn't know is that Ericka is the great-granddaughter of his longtime archenemy, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Gaffigan). Dracula then spends the rest of the trip trying to impress her, while she continuously tries to kill him. The movie is charming, and somewhat witty and funny as well (just like the others). It's not quite as clever and funny as the others though, but it's still likable enough (in my opinion). It also, once again (of course), has a great message about not discriminating against others based on their appearance (which is a really important message to me). This is one of the reasons I really liked the film's predecessors as well. I think if you enjoyed the other ones, you'll probably like this one almost as much too.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Possibly the worst vacation I've ever taken.,4,4 August 2018,"Essentially, 'Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation (2018)' is the same stuff you'd expect from the series except it's stripped of any semblance of theme and, in essence, even narrative, beyond the absolutely basic, bare-bones and paint-by-numbers plot that's predictable pretty much right down to each overused and almost insultingly banal beat. Thus, all that remains is a seemingly lazy attempt to cash-in on a now well-established franchised, some more popular but utterly irrelevant and, despite their occasionally 'classic' status, out-of-date songs and a 'summer craze' of 'summer fun' that dates back to a brief but ill-fated 'beach party' genre - itself created solely to capitalise on a studio's perception of the widest possible market. This 'vacation' premise simply gives the movie an excuse to show off some unconnected set-pieces to extend its run-time, as it heavily leans on these sequences to provide the, frankly, quite sickening sight-gags (fuelled by bone-breaking animation that, at times, actually made me squirm) and petty puns (which seem to have been ad-libbed in the recording booth to the same silence as that of their eventual theatre audience) that make up most of the picture's supposed humour and replace much of its genuine story. On top of this, the flick's finale and, more specifically, its conclusion are so eye-rollingly nonsensical and unfulfilling that they could easily be considered 'cheats'. However, even for how unbelievably lazy one particular moment is, all of this just makes you repeat the same question you've been asking since you slipped into the half-coma the picture induced about fifteen minutes in: ""when will this end so I can just go home?"" 4/10",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
14,ericstevenson,Why the lower rating?,8,22 July 2018,"This website seems to think the movies got worse as they went on, while RottenTomatoes thinks the opposite. I'm going with RottenTomatoes on this one. The advertisements made it look like it took place at the beach, when the beach barely appears at all. The basic plot is that Dracula and the monsters are going on a vacation on a cruise. This film probably only works so well because of Ericka. This has got to be one of the funniest characters I've seen in awhile.Her appearance seems to be based on Popeye. She just steals every scene she's in, especially with how she's constantly in motion, a trait rarely seen in female cartoon characters. It's admittedly a tad predictable, but still quite nice. It helps that the animation is so impressive. It seems like Adam Sandler is just pumping out movie after movie and this is one of his best. It really does feel like a feature length Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry cartoon. ***",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

The next level up, and most difficult, is more naturalized CGI features and non-static backgrounds. 
Second, six stars as far as script as it's standard formula good against evil, but some creative twists on that plot structure. 
Third, personalities speak & act to satisfy most ages - older child through adults. Children will probably not notice the more nuanced adult humor part of the script. Voicing with complementary actions were all eight star good.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
17,paulclaassen,"So much better than HT2, but still not as good as HT1.",5,1 December 2020,"I must be honest, I was never interested in seeing this film. This was due to 'Hotel Transylvania 2' being a slapstick mess I absolutely hated, and feared 'Hotel Transylvania 3' would follow the same recipe.Fortunately, it didn't. It still wasn't nearly as good as the original, but this was a lot of fun, and again really funny. The monsters are going on a cruise sailing from the Bermuda Triangle - yeah, how original! The animation is bright and colorful. The premise itself has a lot more substance, although kids will still enjoy it without being lost in translation.Compared to other animated films, there were moments when the character movements seemed unnatural - almost 2D. Stocky. I'm not sure why they opted for this look, and only certain parts of the movie. Weird. Drac's infatuation with Erica was immature, rushed and not believable. It was just too obvious what was going on.I loved the adventure element, and the film had a feel-good feel to it not present in the previous films. I once again enjoyed the Jonathan character, who always seems to keep everything together when every one else is falling apart. The Battle of the Music during the third act felt wrong for so many reasons. The most obvious is the fact they depict rave music as evil, and the old music as good music. It's a shame the final battle came down to choosing the right music. And Macarena saving the day??!! Seriously??!! It almost ruined the entire film (not because of the song, but because of the reason behind it).Ultimately, though, the film does send out a positive message, and was entertaining.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

It is bad in that their jokes become a bit repetitive and we have already seen them before. For example, the whole joke with the werewolf couple is that they are exhausted by their three hundred and one (and counting) children. It's funny, I loved it, but how much can you milk this one concept? For sure, some of the film has some new material, like the villain, setting and character motivations. I really appreciated these and thought that was a good addition, but this story was kind of thin. Also, since it relies so heavily on the jokes, the repetition let it down.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
19,cruise01,A fun film for the kids but repetitive with its humor.,6,13 July 2018,"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (3 out of 5 stars).Hotel Transylvania 3 is a decent sequel, which is still cute and charming. Adam Sandler and his crew of comedic voice talents like Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Keegan-Michael Key, and Selena Gomez all return. However, the third film does feel like the weakest movie out of the three. The first movie is about Dracula (Adam Sandler) having trouble accepting his grown daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) falling in love with a geeky human boy Johnny (Andy Samberg). The second movie is about Dracula trying to teach his grandson about being a monster way and hoping he is more of a monster than a human (the second film was also forgettable). Now, the third movie starts with a flashback to the 1800's. Were Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) is trying to hunt all the monsters and even Dracula. But when there feud with each other last a long time. And Van Helsing falls. Back in the present day, Mavis wants to plan a family cruise trip. So Dracula can focus on his family besides being too busy with working the monster hotel. And he is also becoming lonely. During a spikey monster wedding, every one had someone and he was left alone. He also wants to seek love again. Until, he falls for the cruise ship's captain Erika Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn). Little does he know, she has an agenda for all the monsters on her ship as well. The animation in the film is colorful and entertaining. Yes, you still have the cheesy geeky humor again. Plus hearing more blah blah blah from Dracula and that tacky dialogue from the character. Kids will find it to be hilarious. But adults may find it boring this time around. Sure, there are a couple fun moments. Even some humor about exposing parts which the adults will find hilarious but kids wont. It is innuendo dialogue that may go over the kids heads. The plot and story about going on a family trip seemed to be a waste of having a good story. It is a lot of fun seeing the characters embark on a vacation but there is not much of a story. Besides Erika having an agenda of trying to eliminate the monsters. By taking them to Atlantis, were it is a city above the ocean that is all lighted up and has a giant sea creature that only attacks to certain music. Yes, you heard that right. There is a climatic DJ battle with Johnny against Van Helsing. As they play music trying to get the sea creature to dance happy or have the creature attack the monsters. Overall, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is a fair film. The characters and animation are colorful and fun. It is lacking a better plot. And the humor is little in between and a bit repetitive from the other movies which may be annoying for adults.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
20,Floated2,Worst of the franchise,3,3 August 2019,"Having watched both Hotel Transylvania films right after one another and noticing the similarities and differences among the two, decided to watch this third film to see how it measures up. Finding nothing too special about the first two but some mild fun (knowing these are children films- so not being disappointed in not completely enjoying them).This third instalment isn't as funny or clever as the second film and with much more of the focus on Dracula. It's more so predictable and with a plot that is somewhat similar to the original- however in this film it's Dracula finding a love interest as apposed to the daughter Mavis in the original.Same nice visuals but more forced jokes, most jokes don't really hit and again with a more predictable and happy ending. Seeing as there is scheduled a fourth film (likely 2021- continuing with the 3 years after each film trend) not sure what we should expect.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

22,filipemanuelneto,"A good addition, which matches with the existing films.",7,26 June 2020,"This is the third ""Hotel Transylvania"" film, an animation franchise that has been doing very well to Sony Pictures Animation. It lived up to expectations and stood out in quality with the previous two films. It is a noisy fast paced film that leaves the audience little time to think about what they are watching.In this film, the monsters leave their isolated hotel and go on a cruise, so that old Count Dracula can finally take a vacation and forget about managing his hotel. At the same time, the vampire seeks a new girlfriend, despite not being able to admit it to Mavis, and is delighted with the ship's commander, Ericka. However, she hides a secret: she is the great-granddaughter of the Count's greatest enemy, the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing.Its not a perfect film but it fits into the franchise and maintains the logical sequence of the previous films. For that, I am sure, it helped a lot the fact of maintaining the same voice actors and director, who also ensures the script writing here. Like the first and second films, love - the ""Zing"" - is the main theme, and that not only seems coherent but its perfectly suited to a family film. Dialogues are good and the jokes are naive but very clever. They won't make you laugh out loud, but they guarantee a good mood.Although the story told is generally good, it is very predictable and obvious, and this can alienate or displease adults. The ending is even worse, as it is excessively sugary, that kind of happy ending where everything goes well, everyone is happy and love is in the air. Another problem is the lack of development of the characters due to the enormous amount of characters in a constantly overpopulated film. We literally go with the crowd. A lot of characters, such as the Invisible Man or the Mummy, was there only for the jokes and comic moments. Others are dismissed, disappear. This is the case of the werewolves, who are literally put to sleep for most of the film.The work of the voice actors remains excellent, and something else could not be expected after two films with the cast core intact. Personally, I would like to highlight the good work of Adam Sandler, an actor who is not easy for me to like but who has an excellent voice and knows perfectly how to use it. After a second film where things did not went well, Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg returned to their good shape, which is due to better use of their characters. Kathryn Hahn was up to the challenge with a cheerful voice that fits her character, Jim Gaffigan was a good choice for the villain and I loved Chris Parnell's voice as Fish. In addition to these highlights, the film has, as usual, the good work of Steve Buscemi (although his character had little relevance), David Spade, Kevin James and Fran Drescher.Technically, it is a high quality computer animated film. The overall design and quality of the animation is more detailed than in the previous film, but good CGI is something we get used to in modern animations and which has become the standard and a feature demanded by the audience. It has good light, good colours and contrast. There is no effort of exaggerated realism. The soundtrack was a strong bet in this film and we finally have a good selection of songs, most of which are already well known.

24,southdavid,Mediogre,5,4 September 2018,"Serviceable, but dull, second sequel to Sandler's all conquering ""Hotel Transylvania"" animated film. This time Dracula (Sandler) and his usual crew of friends that provide the voices for the other monsters in the series decide that a break from their hotelier business is required, so the decide to go on a Cruise. Unbeknownst to Dracula, his old Enemy Van Helsing is in pursuit though and willing to risk everything to take down his old enemy once and for all. I don't want to come across as too harsh with this review, it's not that I actively disliked the film. . it's just that there's barely anything there to form an opinion on. It's a concoction of nicely animated but bland scenes that just about comes together to form a coherent, if predictable plot. I didn't think it was particularly funny, especially for the adults in the audience, and even for most of the kids. Lots of slapstick, people getting covered with slobber from the massive dog and the blob being hammered with consequence free blow after blow. But like I say, it's not irredeemably awful. It looks great, particularly at its conclusion, and its vocal performances are actually pretty good.

But what he doesn't know is that she is the great granddaughter of Van Helsing who was trying to track down Dracula since 1867. But will Erica kill Drac or actually fall in love with him too through the zing?Overall the animation is great and it was great to see the original gang again. There's also songs from Bruno Mars, Joe Jonas ,Heatwave and so much more. This is actually the longest out of the franchise with an extra 10 minutes added to it.

30,GiraffeDoor,I wasn't crazy about the first one either but this is pretty swell for what it is.,7,20 July 2020,"This movie delivers exactly what it promises. What you thought it would be from the trailers: it's that. But it's quote admirable for what it is.I'll be the first to admit the first one could be kind of excruciating but for whatever reason I think this one was subject to a more thorough editing process so that a clear distinction was made between goofy humor and straight up gross/painful. Maybe because Tartakovsky wrote it this time...this guy directed someone else's scripts the last twice and this got made because he actually had a good idea. How often does that happen?Are the gags high brow? Of course not. Some people will always think that an old man's erotic display (gratefully received by story book witches) is just naturally funny but if you can go with the flow this is just a swell old no-brainer for a Friday night that does indeed have some real story and conflict in it but doesn't require the draining emotional investment of say, The Lego Movie or Inside Out.Taking the action away from the titular hotel was actually a good move but keeping on a cruise was also a good idea. There's something just fun about the look and tone of this movie as summer frolics veil something more sinister. I saw an alternative trailer that they didn't show on TV in my territory and I can see why! It gives away something neat that you should only discover when watching.It's really adorable following Dracula's experiencing fining late in life romance. The widower's love story is something we don't see so much of in animated movies so it's very refreshing and our new character (played by the Rabbi from Transparent I was delighted to find out) has tons of charisma and personality.Every second is just a guilty pleasure to watch in how everyone emotes and contorts with cartoonish majesty. The design and textures are really something. This is a movie where heaps of professional sweat and tears went into and it wasn't wasted.So in conclusion: you know what to expect.

Reuniting the Sandler company of actors to voice the various monsters on screen, we fall into a repetitive series of big jokes, big puns & big performances w/diminishing results as each entry tries to out laugh the previous chapter which is a shame since we have returning director Genndy Tartakovsky (he's directed all 3 efforts) who seems to have suppressed his natural instincts to be artistic & subversive (see his brilliant Samurai Jack series or his Clone Wars run) in order to get this tired pony across the finish line.

The animation is quite good, but pops almost too much on the screen, that you will be relieved to give your eyes a break once it finishes. The plot is nothing new, and hardly even much of a plot to begin with, and the ending is something a kindergartener could have made, but the film does have some appeal to it. You would just be better off seeing almost any other animated film this year.

 Genndy Tartakovsky
Writers:
 Michael McCullers, Genndy Tartakovsky 
Stars:
 Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez 
LIKES:Cute: The movie keeps to its cute roots, making sure to keep the friendly environment amped up all the way to a 10. Hotel Transylvania 3 has a cavalcade of characters that are adorable as can be, with big eyed werewolves, curly haired kids with squeaky voices, gigantic puppies, and of course all the goofy stunts that are in between. If you are a fan of this dynamic alone, then this installment will already be worth the wait for you. Funny: The movie has a charming humor to it for adults, presented in the form of a few witty interventions in the form of nostalgic songs and references. Yet, the majority of the comedy is of course geared towards the little ones and those with a childish sense of humor. The movie has loads of slapstick, over the top delivery of simplistic writing to get a laugh. Kids will enjoy this the most, and parents will most likely enjoy watching them giggle their heads off. This will hopefully be further evidence at how appropriate for kids this movie is. Short run time: While the movie may not be for everyone, you can be excited by the fact that the movie will not last long. The run time comes in at closer to 1 hour and 20 minutes, so you can breathe a sigh of relief that this won't leave you drained upon the final credits rolling. Speaking of which?Final Credits: I've always been a fan of the cartoon end credits and their clever play with words. The movie continues this trend and brings with it a fun, adorable spin to make it stand out from the other two.. A fun track adds some atmosphere to the credits and ends the movie on an energetic foot to have your kids dancing to the beat. Music: Hotel Transylvania has always had an appropriate soundtrack to go with the themes of the movie, and number 3 stays on this path again. The difference for this film is that it contains a few nostalgic songs that may confuse younger audience members and bring smiles to the older ones. While these legendary tracks are short lived, they do have the right timing to maximize their inclusion. If only they could have had more. Animation: The animation is not the smoothest at times, most likely to represent the silly atmosphere of this movie. However, this guy appreciated the clever designs of the world, and the cool adaptations on the cruise ship. Colorful worlds await those who will venture into the theater, though the same can be said for most animated movies. 
DISLIKES: Too silly at times: I warned you up top, the move is not geared towards all audience members. Hotel Transylvania 3 is all about maximizing kid humor, and fails to extend much past the superficial jabs that will keep the world giggling. I needed a little more maturity to the mix, something to break out the relentless onslaught of comedy this movie is famous for. Story Suffers: The first movie of the series had a great tale to ground the laughs to, as it pushed character growth and integrated all the characters into the mayhem at hand. However, this installment did not remotely find this balance, dropping most of their characters to the backburner for very cheap laughs and sequences that were less than impressive. Why they dropped so much of their balance, I can't answer that, but it was disappointing to see only one storyline with remotely any sustenance. All the line segment like stories were just not that impressive, but in the grand scheme of things to kids... not really that important. Lack of Interest: I think the big thing of this movie though, is that it seems like the series is losing the steam that kept it going for so long. After failing with the short before the Emoji movie, I think the series is grasping for straws at this point, and needs to return to its roots to stand a chance for future installments. Given the failure of the cartoon series... I'm not sure if there is remotely any major interest remaining in this series. 
The VERDICT:  A third installment can be difficult to maintain the quality, and Hotel Transylvania 3 really struggled with keeping itself on target. The movie is cute, funny, and with an entertaining design, but it didn't have an engaging plot and reduce its characters to mere shambles with the exceptions of a few. The movie is certainly prime bait for luring kids into the theater, but it just doesn't have the same bite that the first two did. In regards to if this film is theater worthy... I would say only if you're looking to take your kids, otherwise hold out for this one for future viewing. My scores: Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.0
Movie overall: 5.5",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

Wonderful voice acting and a distinctive animation style separate this from the majority of animated films.

However, things take a left turn when former nemesis Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) hunts the cruise, threatening the lives of all monsters aboard.Adam Sandler, as Dracula, is my favorite character as his transformation to being his old adventurous self is well-presented. His love for his daughter and kind acceptance of humans also provide for a nice central message. Selena Gomez, as Mavis, continues to shine by providing an equally strong father-daughter bond with Dracula. Kevin James, as Frankenstein, greatly presents a dumbfound friend to Dracula whose deteriorating body assures for some inventive comedy. Steve Buscemi, as Wayne/Wolfman, regales with his signature voice highlighting the character's parenting struggles with his many cubs. David Spade, as Griffin/Invisible Man, equally entertains despite not having a corporeal form. Last but not least, Keegan Michael-Kay, as Murray/ Mummy, completes the pack with his unique, child-like nature. Kathryn Hahn, as Ericka, adeptly portrays her mysterious past and interesting attraction for Dracula. Jim Gaffigan, as Abraham Van Helsing, exhibits a new take on the legend monster hunter.Genddy Tartakovsky brings out his zany and fast-paced direction in new ways. In spite of that, this is nowhere as memorable and groundbreaking as his other works, such as Samurai Jack and Dexter's Laboratory. My favorite scene is the opening one which quickly introduces us to the Dracula-Van Helsing rivalry and sets the stage for a grand adventure. The biggest flaw in the movie is that some of the humor comes across as farcical and this could dissuade adults from watching. Also, the plot is rather one-note and forgettable, especially when compared to the standard of Tartakovsky's other work.The movie's message is to never discriminate against a person based on their looks and instead, appreciate them for who they are.

39,justin-fencsak,A fitting end to a great original trilogy...,10,18 November 2018,"When Hotel Transylvania first came out in 2015, it broke records and became a much needed hit for Adam Sandler, in his first CGI animated appearance as Count Dracula. Directed by Genny Tarkovsky of Samurai Jack and Dexter's Lab fame and who also developed the animated Clone Wars cartoon a year after Attack of the Clones came out, it spawned a sequel that outgrossed the original, and the last movie in the franchise which is the highest grossing of them all, as well as an animated tv series on Disney Channel that is still going strong, not to mention two animated short films that were shown before Sony Pictures Animation films and on TV. The third one is about Count Dracula as he and his family and friends go on a hotel cruise during the summer on the way to Atlantis, culminating in an epic DJ battle between Dracula and a mad scientist, played by Mel Brooks. After it ends with the Macarena, the mad scientist is gone and Count Dracula marries the woman of his dreams and everyone lives happily ever after. The End.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
40,moviexclusive,"Lacking the freshness, eccentricity and poignancy of the first two movies, this third entry is divertingly amusing but ultimately forgettable",6,1 July 2018,"Continuing the misadventures of Count Dracula and his monster entourage, Genndy Tartakovsky returns to the franchise for the third time that he started back in 2012 with Adam Sandler and a whole ensemble of comedians including Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Keegan-Michael Kay, Molly Shannon, Fran Drescher and Mel Brooks. Whereas the earlier two movies saw Sandler's Count Drac fretting over his family, namely his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and his grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff), it is Mavis' turn to fret over her father this time round, fearing that he has been too caught up for too long looking after the titular hotel and its eccentric denizens without having time to look after himself. And so, Mavis books his father and the hotel crew a holiday that consists of a life-endangering flight on board Gremlin Air followed by a cruise to the lost city of Atlantis.But wait, as the prologue primes us, it isn't going to be smooth-sailing for Count Drac, who may very well have to confront an old nemesis by the name of Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan). The nasty professor had been on a witch-hunt for Count Drac in the late 1800s, but had never succeeded in eliminating him, before finally plunging to his apparent death off a vast cliff. Fast-forward to present-day, his grand-daughter Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn) is now the captain of the cruise, and it isn't long before we find out that Ericka has dastardly intention to continue her grandfather's legacy, or that Abraham Van Helsing had bested death over the past century by substituting his human organs for a hodgepodge of machine parts. While her grandfather insists that they wait till Atlantis to unleash an ancient monster upon Count Drac, Ericka has no such patience, deciding to set her own honeypot trap to kill the lord of the vampires once and for all.It isn't difficult to figure out that Tartakovsky and his co-writer Michael McCullers (who also wrote 'The Boss Baby') will have Count Drac and Ericka falling in love with each other, or that Mavis will initially harbour suspicions about her potential stepmother that Count Drac will promptly dismiss. Indeed, there aren't that many surprises in the story, which squeezes in two stopovers at an underwater volcano and a deserted island before the final destination of Atlantis and the unleashing of the legendary beast known as the Kraken. In fact, more so than its predecessors, the narrative this time round is quite evidently meant only as a device to unleash a barrage of slapstick gags aimed at tickling the kids, although Tartakovsky does insert a couple of references (such as one about Egypt and being in denial, get it?) that only the adults with the right cultural background will probably grasp. As for the gags, there are thankfully more hits than misses. Among the hits, some play like a 'greatest hits' compilation from the earlier films - such as the ever-versatile green blob monster known as Blobby and the overwhelming brood of werewolf children born to Wayne (Buscemi) and Wanda (Shannon) - and others like Dennis' giant puppy Tinkles and a porcupine-like bride and groom Mr and Mrs Prickles are new. There are also a couple of amusing sequences, including one where Count Drac, Mavis and Dennis evade Ericka's harpoons while scuba diving by aping the motions of a seahorse and sting ray, another where Ericka discovers that garlic ain't quite so deadly to Count Drac as folklore suggests, and yet another where Count Drac follows and ends up saving Ericka from a myriad of booby traps in a secret chamber which contains the ancient scroll to awaken the Kraken.But at the same time, there are also enough misses for you to realise that the humour this third time round isn't quite as inspired. That talk about 'zinging' with a special someone is mildly amusing at first but gets increasingly stale. A game of volleyball in the ship's swimming pool is awkwardly unfunny. And last but not least, the showdown between Count Drac and the Kraken culminates in a deejay competition that feels dull and tired, especially given that the ultimate tune which manages to put the Kraken in good vibrations is a pop hit from more than two decades ago. It doesn't help that the list of supporting characters has grown even larger from the last outing, leaving little time or space for Count Drac's usual quirky companions like Frankenstein (James), Griffin (Spade) or Murray (Key) to have any more than fleeting moments. Considering the sheer voice talent Tartakovsky has assembled, it's a shame that many aren't given much memorable to do, if at all, in the film.Compared to the first two movies, 'Hotel Transylvania 3' plays exactly like a summer vacation that you'll enjoy for what it's worth while it lasts but will likely forget once it's over. It is arguably the weakest in the series, lacking the eccentricity that made the first so refreshing and even the poignancy that made the second welcome. We're happy that Count Drac got to go on, in his words, a 'hotel on water' and found someone to spend the rest of his life with for however long Ericka manages to last (she's a human, after all); still, we'd be lying if we didn't say that we expected more from this sojourn. It'll keep the kids entertained all right, and so long as that's enough to please you, you'll do fine checking into this perfectly disposable vacation.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

42,blott2319-1,This franchise has officially become unwatchable,2,15 April 2020,"Alright, I'm done with these movies. My wife likes them for some reason, but I am so sick of this nonsense. The first Hotel Transylvania was terrible, the second had some moderately redeeming qualities, but this third chapter is just irritating. I cannot take any more of that stupid voice Adam Sandler uses for Dracula. In small doses it can be kind of funny when he uses it in a live action film or when he'd use it back on SNL, but he pulls that obnoxious stuff for the entire runtime of these movies. The humor of monster things in place of their human versions is so overplayed at this point, and that's really the only jokes they have for this film. I guess there are a few moments of physical comedy that work, simply because I like watching these characters' hurting, but that's about it. The plot is so predictable that I literally called it within less than 10 minutes, and my wife got mad that I was spoiling the movie. It doesn't help that they have a completely irrelevant opening sequence that tips their hand so even a small child could probably guess who's going to be the villain in the story.They attempt to include some subplots in Hotel Transylvania 3, yet they manage to make them so insignificant and pointless that I couldn't understand why they were included. Like the little kids bringing a giant dog. Was there a point to this other than having the dog there to help out a little in the final scene? What about the stupid family of 5000 wolves? Nope, just an occasional aside to remind us that they have some time without their obnoxious furballs. Even the climax is moronic, as it drags on for way too long, and I kept begging for it to stop. Then it ends with a lame pop culture reference that is older than most of the kids who enjoy these awful movies. Writing this kind of bad film-making off as a mindless kids' movie no longer flies with me. There have been too many great movies that appeal to young children, but also are solid enough to keep adults from ripping their hair out. This kind of bargain basement nonsense is barely good enough to qualify for a direct-to-video release.

46,rockman182,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018),6,17 July 2018,"Time to review another summer animated film! I'm not a super big fan of the first two films. The trailer for this film looked funny. I liked the idea of the film; moving away from the hotel to go on to a cruise ship where Count Dracula finds love. I mean it seemed like a fun trip, something that's ideal for a summer animation. While I cannot remember the contents of the previous two films very well I feel like this film pales in comparison to the first.Count Dracula is lonely and wants to find his ""zing"", the love of his life. His daughter Mavis, arranges for her father and his friends to go on a monster cruise to enjoy themselves. While on there he immediately falls head over heels for the captain of the ship. She just so happens to be a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing, a vampire hunter and arch nemesis of Dracula. She attempts to get revenge on the Count despite him being oblivious to her attempts.The animation and music in this film are on point. All three films have always had sharp animation, quick humor and eye catching changes at every moment. Its going to please the younger audiences, as it should. That's the thing with this film, I feel like its more designed for the youth and not smart or witty enough to be enjoyed by adults. Some animated films (usually Pixar films) can manage that balance of audiences. I also feel like the laughs in the film are too sparse and there are passages in the middle that do drag the film.This third installment also has all the best moments of the film in the trailer. There are adorable characters and moments and its funny sporadically but it just doesn't add anything substantial to a trilogy. To be fair though, this is a trilogy that didn't exactly need to be a trilogy but there we have it. It will rivet the younger audience but for me it disappoints more so than entertains.6/10",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
47,RforFilm,"Hotel Transylvania 3 may be a bit unfocused, it still packs laughs and great animation for Drac's Pack",6,18 July 2018,"It's interesting to think that in a time where horror movies are receiving more attention then ever, the Universal classic monsters seem to have a hard time finding their place in a new era. People still remember Bela Lugosi as Dracula and Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster, but can't seem to recall the more modern adaptations. Universal has tried to relaunch them with Dracula: Untold and The Mummy with Tom Cruise, but failed with audiences and critics. So where are these guys going to go? Oddly enough, the one franchise that does seem to give them acclaimed attention is the animated Hotel Transylvania. While not scary, the animated franchise has been able to take a lot of comedic advantage of the characters and their voice actors. Especially with Adam Sandler as Dracula, who in turn, does make for a relatable dad. It helps too that director Genndy Tartakovsky, already experienced in Cartoon Network shows like Dexter's Laboratory and Samurai Jack, gives the movies such a fast-paced style that feels like Looney Tunes. With me, I found the movies likable enough that while good, their nothing great. So let's see if Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation can break that mold.After the previous movie, Dracula (played by Adam Sandler) is running the hotel with daughter Mavis (played by Selina Gomez) and her husband Johnny (played by Andy Samberg). While she and several monsters are happy, Dracula has been feeling lonely and had admitted he wouldn't mind trying to meet someone else. While Mavis is unaware, she simply assumes her father is overworked. She arranges a family vacation for a cruise exclusive for monsters. Coming along is the Frankenstein monster (played by Kevin James), his bride Eunice (played by Fran Drescher), the Invisible Man (played by David Spade), a werewolf Wayne (played by Steve Buscemi), his wife Wanda (played by Molly Shannon), the Mummy Murry (played by Keegan-Michael Key), the other hotel guests, and Dracula's father Vlad (played by Mel Brooks).While reluctant to go on vacation (jokingly referred to as a ""hotel on the water""), Dracula feels a spark for the ship's captain Erica (played by Kathryn Hahn). The other monsters try to encourage him to date, even if he doesn't want to tell his daughter yet. What he doesn't know is that Erica is the great granddaughter of Van Helsing (played by Jim Gaffigan). They are both plotting to eliminate the monsters while Dracula is still in love.As I said, the Hotel Transylvania series has been inoffensive and fine for what it was. Hotel Transylvania 3 is about the same, but perhaps with some points taken off. Not that this is a bad movie. In fact, the audience I saw this with was laughing as I was. I do think that like a lot of series, they start to have story troubles. In this case, along with the monsters, Dracula's extended family, and Mavis' family, there may be one too many characters. There are a lot of storylines going on this cruse. Some of them, like Dracula and his pursuit of the captain, the werewolves and them having free time are really funny. Others, like Mavis' son hiding his dog go nowhere and drags on.As far as character numbers are, the voice acting still proves to be top notch with Sandler finding the right balance for his goofy voice and more sentimental scenes. Though not as much before, each monster do get their turns to lay out a joke. Even if it doesn't land, the movie's tone is so fast, that it'll immediately go to the next. The best element about the Hotel Transylvania series is the animation. It continues to have the dimension the of computer age while keeping the exaggerated stretch of the hand drawn style. Though because this is on a cruise, the colors seem brighter and less gothic, making this more kid friendly. I can understand that decision, even though I think more creativity could have been put into the ship. With Dracula's castle, you have the creepy imagery. With this, while a nice boat, seems like any other Carnival or Royal Caribbean ship. I doubt people will have a problem with this, but when I think monsters on a boat, it would have been interesting to see how much further the designs could have gone.I'll give this six Frankenstein bolts out of ten. Children and their parents will find a lot to like. Will they enjoy it as much as before? Probably. It's hard for me to be enthusiastic or dishearted by this, but then again, I've never taken this in high regard. Give it a watch and see this Drac's Pack is still fun to follow.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
48,Anurag-Shetty,Just as entertaining as its predecessors.,8,23 July 2018,"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation continues with the story of Dracula(Adam Sandler), his daughter Mavis(Selena Gomez), Mavis' husband Johnny(Andy Samberg) & the rest of the monsters. Mavis takes Dracula & everyone else at Hotel Transylvania, on a vacation aboard a cruise ship. Here, Dracula falls in love. Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is an entertaining film. Director Genndy Tartakovsky maintains the same formula, that made Hotel Transylvania(2012) & Hotel Transylvania 2(2015) memorable. If I had to choose though, the 2012 original is my favorite film in this franchise. The animation is amazing. The 3D is brilliant. The climax is the highlight of the film. The voice cast is top notch. Adam Sandler is fantastic as Dracula. Andy Samberg is spectacular as Johnny. Selena Gomez is flawless as Mavis. Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade & Keegan Michael-Key are superb as Frank, Eunice, Wayne, Wanda, Griffin & Murray, respectively. Jim Gaffigan & Kathryn Hahn are hysterical as Van Helsing & Ericka, respectively. The supporting cast is great. Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is a must watch for fans of the Hotel Transylvania movies. Go, have fun with your entire family.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
49,fernandoschiavi,"Summer Vacation"" abuses colors and pop songs on the soundtrack to entertain and convey the message that you are perfect the way you are!",6,24 May 2021,"The theme of tolerance was already obvious in Hotel Transylvania (2012), but at least it maintained the charm of the novelty by placing monsters - historically the villains of history - as protagonists, needing to defend themselves from their enemies - humans, in this case. The sequel Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015) increased the stakes, investing in the interaction between men and vampires, werewolves and mummies through the marriage of Mavis (Selena Gomez), Dracula's daughter, to Johnny (Andy Samberg), a human boy, and the consequent birth of their son, Dennis. Well, with almost $ 1 billion raised at the box office around the world, a third title would be inevitable. And Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is exactly that: much more the result of a mathematical logic, than the answer to any type of creative or minimally artistic desire.The third film in the trilogy begins with flashbacks introducing us to a new character - one known to horror fans - Abraham Van Helsing and shows the monster hunter's long journey chasing Count Dracula and his friends. So let's go to today. With the hotel running smoothly and the family of Mavis established, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation focuses again on Count Dracula, who considers himself a happy family man, but misses a companion, since he has been a widower for more than a century. The hotel being used for weddings only worsens his feelings. Mavis thinks that Dracula's melancholy is due to the stress of being overworked and to cheer up his father, she takes Dracula and all her friends on a cruise that begins in the Bermuda Triangle and ends in the lost city of Atlantis.The most iconic power of good animation lies in the clever use of absurdity to create a concept or discussion that would be impossible for a live-action film to do the same. Nonsense is a privilege as a resource in this sense, but it is easy to get lost and make it a simple joke device. This is, without a doubt, the biggest problem in ""Hotel Transylvania 3"". There is a minimum use of format, characters and situations to go beyond the first layer. The speech is almost childlike and the script, when it decides to risk something different, is uncomfortably expository, retelling and recounting evil plans, feelings and the past. Contrary, however, to a negative view of the film's antagonists, a characteristic that makes Hotel Transylvania 3 the first approach of the franchise with a clear villain, the participation of Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) and, consequently, of his great-granddaughter, is commendable. We have an interesting turn, which puts the hero to become a bandit, desperate to hunt monsters, the real good guys of all this. The conclusion of the tape is, on the whole, quite satisfactory, for realizing, with more clarity than in the previous film, a message about coexistence between the different. By relating Dracula to a descendant of his greatest enemy, animation also allows himself to invent unprecedented dynamics, an excellent outlet for a narrative, yet predictable.It is a pity, however, that Van Helsing does not assume the antagonism of Hotel Transylvania 3. Leaving aside any subtlety - something that, in fact, was never strong in the projects starring Adam Sandler - the director Genndy Tartakovsky (responsible for all the trilogy, also responding for the first time to the script) prefers to transform the old enemy into a legitimate monstrous figure, explicitly placing who in this dynamic is wrong. And between a giant puppy, fish with feet and a revenge that is never justified, there is a film that seemed to promise a lot, but delivers absolutely the same - if not less - than the previous ones. And who likes to hear the same joke told more than once?Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is very different from previous franchise features by investing more in the internal psychological of Count Dracula (Adam Sandler), who lost his beloved, his ""swing"", early, a long time ago. The beginning of the work, by the way, is magnificent. A wedding takes place inside the Hotel Transylvania, home to hundreds of monsters, and, during the celebration, Dracula realizes his loneliness as the couples come together in a dance. Among the vampire's closest friends, the werewolf has his wolf, the invisible man has his invisible wife and Frankenstein's monster, clearly, Frankenstein's fiancee. The humor returns in the great scene in which the protagonist tries to find a web-girlfriend. The journey, therefore, is one of reconciliation between Dracula and love.The most impressive is how the film, also the most impressive in visual, manages to be the most accurate, among the three, in the jokes presented, despite continuing to remain with some unsightly reiterations, in addition to the countless times that Dracula gets in the way in front of Erika (Kathryn Hahn), her love interest, captain of the cruise on which all the monsters at the hotel embark, driven by the interest of Mavis (Selena Gomez) in taking some holidays for her father. However, on the other hand, the feature film invests in smarter comic solutions. The answer to the final problem, based on an interesting God ex-machina, in the fight against the great enemy of the tape, is quite inventive, very entertaining, marrying the playful sphere of the work and pleasing both children and adults. Even so, the work has very little relationship with the adult audience, despite being able to reconcile itself more with it now than before. On several occasions, entire blocks of comic interest emerge, such as the adventures of Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) alongside his pet - which, for some reason, no one recognizes - hindering the fluidity of the story.What is left is a fun adventure, using the monsters allegorically to better enjoy the scenarios that clash with their true environment. However, while the adventure seems to work well, the jokes become tiring as the film progresses. Do not wait for anything very well elaborated, as the feature is much closer to the infamous obvious anecdotes - there is an irritatingly long scene involving a fart joke - than to the well-constructed humor. While some studios focus on animations with fully based comic scenes, capable of entertaining both the youngest and the oldest (and in a different way, which makes them much smarter), what is presented here is the old free physical humor.The characters, in general, are underutilized, like the couple of werewolves - with their hundred destroying children - or Frankenstein and his wife, who end up being reduced to visual presences instead of elements really worthy of attention. There is not a single reference to the Invisible Man's girlfriend - a gag who had yielded enough before - and the feared Vlad (Mel Brooks), Dracula's father, goes from being a respectable figure to becoming a ridiculous and infinitely secondary type. If for children, just a few rehearsed eschatological jokes or simple physical humor are enough to entertain, for adults, the plot represents nothing more than some good references. Moments when the script creates situations with the other classic monsters - unfortunately, badly used, although much cooler than Dracula himself - are fun and the light brushstrokes in the mythology of Bram Stocker or other monsters of the cinema, like Gremlins, render interesting elements, but everything gets lost in the face of the silly jokes of the film.The animation, however, is so beautiful. The scenarios designed for the film are beautiful and the characters' design, as well as the fluidity in the movements, are well made and serve the gags well, especially in the musical battle that rocks the film's climax. Limiting itself to repeating mistakes and successes from previous films, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is one of those cliché amusements, whose jokes fall between a fine line between the embarrassing and the funny. Motivated solely by financial factors, he has little to add creatively to Dracula's journey. With so many characters on screen and cores to develop, the script shows signs of swelling and does a real juggling to try to account for all of them. The result of this is that the feature film becomes a kind of pile of shorts, each containing certain groups and sub-plots, which lack a tone of unity. The fast and accelerated editing makes the audience go from side to side, but luckily, the shallow and uninspired story does not leave the viewer lost in the middle of the trip.Filled with jokes and situations that will amuse the youngest and the oldest (unlike the second film that only focused on children), and that in a way camouflage the flaws in the script, like the overly cliché central novel and the totally predictable ending since the beginning, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" abuses colors and pop songs on the soundtrack to entertain and convey the message that it has been defending since the first film: no matter if you are human, monster or unicorn, you are perfect of the way you are!",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

52,kjproulx,A Franchise that Continues to Play it Safe,6,1 August 2018,"The Hotel Transylvania series has been consistently entertaining since the release of the original film back in 2012. Whether or not you're a fan of the humour throughout these movies or not, it's made for kids, and I believe that it serves its purpose once again with this latest installment in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. While each film isn't without its issues, I have been entertained by the life-lessons for kids and the story arcs that each character goes through. Personally, I wouldn't recommend these movies to anyone who isn't susceptible to children's humour, or even animation in general-because this isn't a series that's going to win you over. If you liked the first two movies, you'll probably get a kick out of this one for the most part. Here's why Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is passable fare.Adam Sandler and company all return to lend their voices to this film and it's honestly the one film franchise where they all fit as a whole in my opinion. This time, the residents of Dracula's hotel attend a summer vacation cruise, but they don't know that it's manned by Dracula's evil nemesis, Van Helsing (well, at least his family's legacy). I would normally consider a plot point like that to be a spoiler, but it's given away in the first 20 minutes, so every viewer's surprise will be ruined regardless. It's a fairly sloppy film in that regard, but the other two are sort of like that as well due to the fact that they're mainly directed at kids. For that reason alone, I can forgive it, but it did make for a bit of a frustrating experience.The storyline involving Mavis and Johnny has always been the heart of the franchise in my opinion and truly the only spark that allowed for sequels. Sure, the sense of adventure has always been there, but their story is what makes the core character of Dracula evolve throughout each film. That being said, they're really given the short end of the stick here, being played off as a bumbling couple for comedic purposes. Yes, Johnny has his time to shine throughout the third act, but I felt like they were left out of the big picture in order to make room for Dracula's story, which they didn't have much to do with.Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation centres its attention on the characters of Dracula and Ericka, who is the great-granddaughter of his arch-nemesis. This plot line is stretched pretty thin throughout the course of the film, due to the fact that there are no surprises or twists to be had with them. You already know she works for the bad guy and you know he will eventually find out. There is no way of spoiling this movie because it's about as by-the-numbers as you can possibly get. Still, this film isn't without its perks and quirks.Every characteristic I enjoyed about each of the characters over the course of this series is cranked up to eleven and many liberties are taken that will either interest fans or completely turn them off, which I found quite risky. For the most part, I enjoyed myself when watching this film, but it truly is as predictable as you can get. Predictability isn't always a bad thing, especially when your execution is really all that matters in the end. I'm not clamoring for another addition in this franchise, but I wouldn't hate to see it continue either. I've always been mildly entertained by these movies and Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation didn't do too much to sway me from that in either direction. It's fine fare for kids at the movies and that's about it, but sometimes that's okay.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
53,AhmedSpielberg99,"Visually Creative, But Unfunny!",6,28 September 2018,"Fast-paced jokes, interruptive comic scenes, slapstick humor, brightly colored animation, and the distinctive direction style that feels that it fits 2D animation more than 3D animation. They are all here to make HT 3 the most ""Genndy Tartakovsky"" movie of all the three Hotel Transylvania movies.Sadly, most of the gags fall flat. Simply, because almost all of them are recycled jokes from the first and the second movie, which also borrowed the original's jokes, and therefore the jokes were less effective, hence the movie was less funnier. Let alone borrowing the same old jokes once more time! But there are also a lot of repetitive jokes from this very movie. I mean how many times should we laugh about Frank's body-part liberation?! And are failed assassination attempts are that funny ?! Seriously, I thought I was watching an unfunny version of Ton & Jerry! Also, there are tons of adult jokes that are just lame!What disappointed me the most is that it's the first time that I found the interjected humorous scenes that distinguish this franchise very annoying, and completely useless. They are also used so much and became so boring. This time they really feel like string of gags that has nothing to do with the story.Dennis elevated the humor a little in the first sequel. This time it was Dennis' cute monster-sized puppy, Tinkles, or should I say Bob, that did this job, kinda! At least it had the only repetitive joke that actually worked very well. Also, some of the visual gags worked for me.Speaking of visuals, this second sequel is just visually dazzling! While the lack of improvement in terms of the animation quality was one of the issues I had with the second installment, this movie suffers from anything but. As I mentioned above, Genndy Tartakovsky is in top form this time. He brought all his unique trademarks which some of them are familiar to the series fans. But he also garnished this threequel with some of his most idiosyncratic visual techniques that fans of his other works like Samurai Jack or Dexter Laboratory will definitely relate to. The quality of the animation itself also improved a great deal. The result is a 3D animated movie that is nothing short of a feast for the eyes!The movie, nevertheless, doesn't look good just for the sake of it. But the visuals are full of imagination and inventiveness. From the look of the setting to the new characters', everything looks fresh. Just not necessarily funny.There is some depth that was given to the characters of Dracula and Mavis, and their father-daughter relationship that also served the plot. There is also a smart improvement in the movie's vampire world that was crucial to the main plot. In fact, there are some subtle nuances here and there that could be enough to make the fans of the franchise eager to see another sequel.Johnny was unbearably stupid for the most part, except for one scene which I consider one of the funniest scenes in the movie. The thing that made this scene, besides some other scenes most of them at the final act, so special is the mix between music and action. I haven't seen anything like these scenes before except in Samurai Jack. They are long scenes that look as epic as silly!The story is so familiar, and the plot itself is so generic. Also, we have seen billions of animated films that deliver the same message. But the creative slick visuals were more than enough to made up for that. Besides, the message, despite being pretty much on the nose, is utilized cleverly by mixing it with the villain's motives. It is a very easy way to construct the villain, but it is also a very smart one that saved some time, and made a run-of-the-mill, yet somewhat convincing villain.While the movie's generic plot wasn't a big problem, the movie spent most of its first two acts offering tired jokes till it really kicked up at its final act. Almost the entire first and second acts are consist of a sketch comedy after another.I don't have much to say about the vocal performances. All the cast reprised their roles as our beloved characters, and they were amazing as always.Colorfully vivid, and madly fast-paced, Summer Vacation is the most visually pleasing and creative installment in the franchise. It's also way less funny than its two predecessors which, for me, means the weakest one.(6.5/10)",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

71,patriciogl10,Not as good as the other Hotel Transylvania movies.,6,25 May 2019,"It's safe to say that the third entry in this string of movies is definitely the weakest, mainly because it lacks the feel and atmosphere provided by the first two, especially the first movie. It's as if this was deliberately made even more family-friendly than it already is. The first flick had a cool spooky yet fun atmosphere that made the viewing experience so special. One of the things that throw that vibe off is the fact that is set on a boat, in the context of a vacation. I get it though, is a proper context to make many fun situations, but the execution of the story is not up to the first Hotel Transylvania movie. The new character doesn't really add anything exciting to the table; there are some funny moments yes, but it's just okay, an acceptable effort.If anything, it makes me wanna revisit the previous releases, I enjoyed those a lot more than this. Still, not a bad film, it's good fun to relax to.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

75,sirwillisiv,Innocent and serviceable...,7,21 August 2018,"Hotel Transylvania is a movie series that has endured constant trash-talking from mainstream critics to deliver an adequate surge of laughs, heart, and snappy visual wonder. These films are more fun, creative, and emotional than they seem. I just adore the art direction and this third installment doesn't hold back. Each character has their own unique and expressive means of standing, speaking, moving, any action you can think of. It really makes them stand out and they're an absolute blast to watch. With a more enormous scope this time around, Tartakovsky really went out all out with the setting design, showcasing his dazzling take on monsters and other folklore. The Bermuda Triangle is a popular vacation spot constructed from many crashed airships, and Atlantis is a bright and roaring casino resembling those in Las Vegas. I love to see these exaggerated interpretations. They may have been done like this before in some light, but they still served as a neat visual treat and gave this Hotel Transylvania installment a more adventurous vibe compared to its predecessors which kept its stories in one location.The film is not without its faults. It certainly has its forced and trendy moments that were kind of painful to watch, such as the main characters dancing to popular licensed music, and a climax that didn't really make much sense and neglected to tie into any previous used elements in the story whatsoever. So, yeah, the narrative isn't anything groundbreaking, and it tries too hard to give every single face of its cast a hint of spotlight even though its evident that they serve no purpose to the story whatsoever. Some characters that had more basis in the previous films only have one or two moments of dialogue, and they're mainly lame one-liners. It's a shame to see a lot of wasted talent, but I think Sony's primary goal here was to captivate its younger viewers with incessant joke-telling and fast-paced movement (the latter which even kept me bewitched throughout) and they absolutely succeeded at that.In closing, Hotel Transylvania 3 is a decent romp. The gags are restless fun and sure to immobilize younger audiences, but as an adult I was more enthralled by the highly-energized and expressive animation, as well as the wildly colorful and inventive takes on mythology. It's not too crazy where it exhausts you, the visuals and story have a fair balance. It's formulaic, somewhat lacking of morals, and maybe a bit overstuffed with pointless characters, but it passes as an innocent and serviceable family adventure with tons of eye candy. As an animation enthusiast and lifetime fan of Tartakovsky's work, I really have a soft spot for these films.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

80,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this Movie.,6,2 July 2018,"""In Sony Pictures Animation's Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, our favourite monster family as they embark on a vacation on a luxury monster cruise ship so Drac can take a summer vacation from providing everyone else's vacation at the hotel. It's smooth sailing for Drac's Pack as the monsters indulge in all of the shipboard fun the cruise has to offer, from monster volleyball to exotic excursions, and catching up on their moon tans. But the dream vacation turns into a nightmare when Mavis realizes Drac has fallen for the mysterious captain of the ship, Ericka, who hides a dangerous secret that could destroy all of monsterkind."" All of Adam Sandler's movies as of late have not been very good, but the Hotel Transylvania series have seemed to be somehow putting him back on the map. The movie starts out extremely dark, with dark music and action packed scenes before going into the real plot. all of our favourite Monsters return, and the rest of the cast that voice them all return as well. The animation is incredible, and the music and action scenes are fantastic. the main problem with this film was the humour wasn't as funny as the first two were, and I guess this is because the charm has worn itself out. There were too many fart jokes, and even if they were meant the kids it gets so repetitive sometimes.This is, in fact a great family film and it is incredibly fun to watch. I don't think there should be a 4th one as I think all the charm and all the jokes have worn themselves out, but doesn't hurt to watch this one. As they say third times the charm, just not a fourth one. 3/5 stars.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
81,rmirchandani,Surprisingly amusing! A good Summer movie for children!,8,25 July 2018,"I admit that I did not have high hopes for the third part of the franchise. I set the bar extremely low and entered the cinema with low expectations. However, the movie proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations. While no where near as good as the first movie, it truly gives every character time to shine. The scene where the family of Dracula and his friends took the plane (Gremlin Airways) was hilarious. Dennis and Jonathan were as usual the funniest characters in my opinion. There is a overload of characters in this movie and not every character grabbed the spotlight. The animation was incredible like the previous films. I loved Dracula and Erika's relationship and found it pleasing how they dealt with her great grandfather. The reveal that she was related to him was quite underwhelming and lackluster. To conclude, this movie definitely surprised me and did not disappoint. It had great humor, great interactions between characters and a surprisingly good storyline. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is pure fun.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

83,Fudge-3,A cartoon with patchy comedy,6,26 August 2018,I've not seen the first two Hotel Transylvania films but I did not feel that I'd missed anything essential for the enjoyment of this third part. This is a primarily a comedy of sketches stitched around an adventure. Sadly the humour in the first fifteen minutes is not sustained and I rarely laughed when the main characters were on screen. The children in the audience seemed to agree with me. The Goblin Airlines short section was brilliant and the werewolf parents dropping off their children in kids club was great.I enjoyed the adventure but again; the setup in the first five minutes was better. Just switch off and eat your popcorn through the boring bits.The animation was good enough and I liked the art style.

The movie wastes the talents of two amazing actresses, Selena Gomez and Chrissy Teigen.With that said, I am interested in Erica's backstory. I feel like Sony really made the wrong film.

90,Amthermandes,"Written by kids, for kids",5,1 August 2018,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous two installments of Hotel Transylvania, and I must say this third one was a bit of a disappointment. It seems like the creators, despite having success with the first two in being able to successfully entertain both children and adults, decided to just focus on the kiddies in this one. Many of the jokes fell flat, causing the whole theater to be silent through a lot of the film, with most laughter coming from the children. Now if their intent was to entertain just the kids, I'd say it was a success. It's a cute, highly energetic film, and I'm sure most children up to the age of 12 would quite enjoy it. But coming from an adult's perspective, it wasn't worth going to the theater. And I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. We watched even as a whole family left in the middle of the film (although could have been for reasons other than the lack of entertainment, but seeming how they were just down the row from us and they never laughed once, we can do the math). The characters were more sporadic than ever before, crossing the line between fun and annoyance, with Dracula being the worst. A LOT of jokes were incredibly bland, and the villains were like nails on a chalkboard. Now it wasn't all bad. There were great and funny moments, even for adults, and it never completely ceases to entertain. The visuals were satisfying, the gremlins were hilarious, and not to mention it had a really cool soundtrack, especially towards the end with the Kraken, who was also a fun addition. In short, when it comes to shutting your kids up for an hour and a half and giving them something to laugh and have fun with, you can't go wrong here. But speaking to just adults, I'd wait until it comes out on demand.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

92,Animated_Antic,A slightly bumpy but still fun sequel.,8,17 July 2018,"Why do critics hate on the ""Hotel Transylvania"" series? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it? That might be it, though I honestly haven't gotten a clue. My reaction to the series is kind of interesting. I thought the first movie was decent but didn't really see rewatch value in it while I thought two was pretty good and actually found it did have rewatch value. Now we have the third movie in the series, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"", a film that I also really enjoyed. I don't think it was as good as the second movie, but I still found it a pretty fun watch.Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) has started to get pretty lonely and bored at being at his famed hotel for monsters. Wanting to see him happy as well as hoping to spend some more time with his family, his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez), son in law Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) decide to go on a cruise ship for monsters that is en route to the lost city of Atlantis. While on board the ship Dracula immediately falls for the ships captain Ericka (Kathryn Hahn) unaware that she's the great great granddaughter of Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) who is planning to destroy all monsters starting with Dracula. What follows next is seeing the monsters enjoy the cruise while dealing with the actions of the Van Helsing's.As you could tell from the plot, the film is more of series of jokes strung together to make a movie which is not a bad thing. Most of the jokes actually really work and did give me a good laugh. I particularly loved the creative scenarios they did with the locations. My favorite had to be the Bermuda Triangle. I won't give away what it looks like, but I'll just say it was very creative what they did with it. Also, the soundtrack was finally great! One of my biggest issues with the last two movies was how modern and dated the pop songs were and in this case, I think there was only time it did irritate me. Every other song was great. I don't even have to say that the animation is great once again. Director Genndy Tartakovsky once again delivers some fantastic fast paced animation and some eye popping colors. This film's creativity was so massive that it was clear that he and really turned around the creativity at Sony Picture Animation after the disastrous ""Emoji Movie"". The characters are mostly pretty good. It was fun to see most of the characters again, Wayne and Wanda had a pretty funny scene together, and also seeing Jonathan and Mavis was also charming. It was also nice seeing more of Dennis and Winnie bonding together. Seeing them work to keep their giant dog hidden was so funny. Even though most of the film was good, there were some problems. Van Helsing as a villain did not work at all. The last two films didn't have a villain to a story and worked well without one and in this film, adding one just slowed down the movie. Not only that, he was also not very funny. Also, I did kind of miss Jonathan's parents. They were pretty funny and I kind of think adding them to this film would've added some pretty funny humor. Though that was kind of a nit pick.""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" was still a pretty good sequel with a weak but still funny story, top notch animation and some mostly pretty good characters. Even though I do think the second movie was the best in the series, I still think this was a pretty good movie and I definitely have plans of watching it in the future.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
93,zombiemockingbird,Not Great.,4,15 September 2019,"Loved the first one, thought the second one was okay, but this one is just not that entertaining.

96,Clank_Zoka,Not the Best in the Franchise but It's Hard to Hate This One,6,28 July 2018,"I like the Hotel Transylvania series, they are fun, colourful, funny, touching and interesting, not the most complex animated franchise but it's better then most franchises that are there just for money (*coughs* Ice Age *coughs*) and i knew a third movie would come out, but in July?...., hmm interesting but another one?, really?, not that's a bad thing but what else can you do with the Drac Pack?, not much, but here it is in summer theme and it was finally released in the UK on the 27th of July and I of course went to go and see it and......... it was fun, not great or better then the other two but is still enjoyable, funny and colourful, but I think they stop with this one.So basically all the monsters need a vacation on a cruise that Mavis (Selena Gomez) takes them to, while they are there Dracula (Adam Sandler) is lonely and finds love but can only zing once, but when the captain of the ship named Ericka (Kathryn Han) is there, he falls for her, but she is secretly the granddaughter of the evil Abraham Van-Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) who both want to take down all the monsters every last one of them....... and that's it, there are some subplots, but there are faaar too many to count, like Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shannon) drop their kids off at daycare and do what they want, Dennis and Winnie try and sneak Tinkles their giant dog on the cruise ship, Mavis and Jonathan (Andy Samberg) talk and apparently Jonathan is a DJ, I couldn't really keep track, the Van-Helsing plot and Dracula in love is interesting mostly, but it is very predicable from start to finish, it mostly feels basic and formulaic, not in a bad way, but it's starting to lose it's charm a little bit, the humour while mostly funny can drag on and get hip and modern, ESPECIALLY the climax, which I won't get into but let's stay it's filler, the plot and it's execution is fine, but there's waaaay too much going on for me to focus on and it becomes an rather average film, but the humour, it's energy, action scenes, jokes are what keeps this from being garbage.The animation I think is the best thing in this movie, I know the animation in the other two movies are amazing, but this is the nicer looking one, colourful, instead of ordinary hotel, we go on a cruise ship, in different locations, the textures on the characters the movement, the expressions, designs, execution and visual wise, the movies looks wonderful and there so much talent behind, I love the animation especially here, but at the end of the day, it can be repeated and quite tiresome, as fun and visually great it looks, it can look normal for a while and just do the same movements again and again, the characters can look a little over the top and act slightly irritating, but it's just nitpicks, while it maybe tiresome and over the top at times, the animation still looks wonderful and even more interesting then the other two.The characters are... just generic tropes, Dracula is the hero, Mavis is the plot convenient one, Jonathan is there for comedy, same with Drac's friends, Frank, Griffin, Murray and Wayne, Ericka is the love interest, Van-Helsing is the villain, Dennis and Winnie are just there in the background, in fact most of the recurring characters are, Blobby, Vlad, Frank's wife and the wolf pups don't really do much and are there for jokes and gags, I'll admit I still like Dracula, Mavis, Dennis and Winnie a lot in these films, the new ones like Ericka and Van-Helsing are quite interesting characters and play a big part in the film with Abraham Van-Helsing being a way better villain then Quismodo and Bela, Dracula is still likeable, Mavis is great, I adore Dennis and Winnie, Jonathan is fine, Drac's friends can get a few chuckles out of me, especially Wayne and Wanda, but the rest like Vlad and Blobby, not so much, they may not be terrible characters but most of them don't offer much expect the main ones and are quite basic and cliched, although the voice acting is great without any doubt, but that doesn't help that the characters are not quite as charming and relatable as before.So yeah the worst one in the franchise, but is it terrible?, no, is it good?, Urgh.... yeah sounds about right, it has fantastic animation, great characters and a interesting plot with mostly great humour and still has heart to it, but it's formulaic, loses it charm and what made the first two great family Halloween films, it can be quite tiresome and a bit too distracting with it's animation and generic cast of characters, it's just not that great, but it's better then Ice Age: Collision Course, Nut Job 2 and waaaay better then Peter Rabbit, it has some clever ideas and feels like a movie then that last Sony movie, but it's not as good as the first two films, if you want an amazing sequel, go see Incredibles 2, way better, but if your interested in this and is a fan of the franchise, I do recommend it and it is better then Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again and Sherlock *coughs* Gnomes, but it's not all that great and I think they should stop with this one before it becomes the next Ice Age, hopefully Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse is better then this and Peter Rabbit.I'll give Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation (Not Summer Vacation, they changed it in the UK, dunno why but umm yeah...) 6.9/10.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

With bad jokes and a terrible story the great cast decides to go on a new adventure (this time on a ironic big passenger boat). But let's not just talk about the bad and go for some other stuff.The Good:
First up I really respect their idea about this movie and I think it could have turned into something good if they removed the monster hunter and he's daughter plus some other lines and jokes. The end scene where they had a ""DJ-Battle actually made me laugh and I think more jokes like that could have made for a great sequel.The Cast:
The Hotel Transylvania movies really put up a great cast that played some unique original characters including the classic Werewolf and Dracula. So this movie now got two points for the cast and end battle.The Story:
Now, it starts up with a opening scene that could make a great continuation of a movie but the results where so bad that I actually wanted to just get out of the cinema. With a great cast and some great abilities this where just a big no.End results: 2/10 - A movie that could have been something but didn't take the chance.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
100,Lost_In_Translation_,Mindless entry in normally entertaining cartoon series.,5,2 November 2019,"The first two movies are extremely fun and well made cartoon movies. They have the feel of a silly Saturday morning cartoon with some of the most quirky animation in modern movies. They also had some heart and a really interesting stories.This one throws all of the heart and story out in favor of full on cartoon silliness and makes it the worst entry in the series.The animation is still some amazingly well done cartoony animation. It's not the technical marvel that Pixar movies are, but it really does the cartoon aspect of it well.There's still some fun gags to watch, but a lot of this movie relies on those over dialogue or an interesting story. There are 3-4 scenes where there are no dialogue and just end up being really kind of dull. I know it's a kids movie, but there's just scenes in it that really feel aimless and are gags that just go on for way too long. It makes 50% of the movie just feel like filler to spread out the simple plot to a 90 mins to entertain kids.Drac and his love interest are the main focus in this and most of the other characters become tertiary and are no more than glorified background characters.It's still got enough of the wacky animation and outlandish humor, but it kind of feels like they didn't have enough to do with the plot. The first two held my interest the whole way through, but this one was just filled with way too many extended bits that go on for way too long and just feel aimless. It's very reminiscent of how Minions has those extended scenes of the minions doing some silly event that derails the movie for 5 mins and has no impact on the story.Here's hoping the 4th in the series has more to it and can keep it intriguing for the adults too.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation
101,audrablum,Creeping away from what made it great,7,1 September 2018,"This week I watched the animated family comedy Hotel Transylvania 3 (2018). This trilogy is special to me as my husband and I saw the first one on our honeymoon. Naturally we have been following the story. The logline reads ""Count Dracula and company participate in a cruise for sea-loving monsters, unaware that their boat is being commandeered by the monster-hating Van Helsing family."" The first and second film gave me some expectations and I was somewhat disappointed that the third one didn't live up to them. I really enjoyed the first and second one as they were kinda dark and gritty for a kids film. The third one just felt bright, whimsical, and fed off of overly-exaggerated antics. It also seemed liked there was a higher budget for visuals of the first and second movie. Then we get to the story, which gets points for its originality and loses points for sacrificing the trilogies famously spook-driven thematic for a monster DJ battle. Aside from some unique plot elements, the story felt strange, lacked direction, and wasn't really very engaging compared to the other two. Much of the dialogue felt pretty lazy and cliche. The voice actors were great. They were probably what gave the movie any life. The things I wish were done differently about this movie are mainly in the story and the visuals. The last two movies gave secondary and tertiary characters more screen time and helped it feel like a little more spooktastic as well. The message of the movie was clear and consistent with the first two and that is that we have to learn to get along and not use differences as grounds for division and hatred, rather we should learn to get along. Hoping if Transylvania 4 comes out that the studios will start over with elements that made the first two interesting and fun.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

104,Zingbot_9000,Disappointed,3,5 August 2018,No where near as good as the first two movies. You've seen the ads you've seen the movie. As Drac would say other than Drac the other characters are blah. On top that saw it in 3D and there were zero 3D effects. Felt they phoned it in on this one. Also upset cuz we saw this over Ant-man.

105,Bulldog1721,Drac Pack at sea... Pretty good but something more than a trip,9,27 July 2018,"Hotel Transylavania has been one of my favorite franchises to come out of Hollywood since Toy Story. The way this third one is done can really be summarized in two words.. LOVE BOATLet me put it this way, This more of a love story than the kids can dissect from this movie. Sure its wacky and just plain fun, but really, its more of less a movie that could be described as the ""Toy Story 3"" of 2018.By that i mean, its got a good story line and the characters really show their colors in this movie. But, it kinda drags a bit with this one and the jokes were kinda uncanny. But, its still a watch for the family to see.

107,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Not what we came to see,5,24 July 2018,"Hotel Transylvania is back, and just like the last, they are out of the hotel. This time taking a summer vacation on a cruise, with the whole gang. Coming off of two other movies, everyone by this point knows what to expect, knows what they like and dislike about the franchise. And if they are in the movie theatre, have decided they wanted to see another installation of the same thing. 
 Hotel Transylvania and Sony Animation took this fact, and decided they needed to switch things up a bit. They needed to be able to transform this third movie to open up the area for 6 more like other animated films like ice age, Madagascar, and the never ending shrek. However, this time they moved too far into a new area. 
 From a franchise built on cheap laughs and family fun, they moved into a new arena of killing and searching for lost artifacts. Not that the killing was ever anything out there, very basic and children friendly tactics, but that isn't why we came to the movie, we came for the fun and joy of fathers and daughters and babies. Anything else was really just icing on the cake, buke instead they went for lemon bars, which some may like, but to the general public really miss the mark.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

The characters are lovely and the script is very well done and heart-warming, and it keeps you laughing all the time.I never thought I would enjoy this movie so much.

I then thought that since I was getting old, I had lost interest in these types of films. First off, the animation was WAY too fast paced and over the top, which was hard for me to like the movie. Second, there are a few toilet jokes which made me facepalm, like when Erica puts garlic sauce in the guacamole, making Drac pass gas.

114,ikizdevran-882-254684,He's going to need a vacation after this vacation.,3,4 August 2018,"When ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" ended I was very curious about one thing; who wrote its screenplay? They proudly present themselves as Michael Mc Cullers and Genndy Tartakovsky. It took two people to write this stupid story, seriously? In the means of plot, there is absolutely nothing catchy. ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" is one the worst animation films I have ever seen. I am so sorry for the money and time spent on this film. Atmosphere is as bad as the conversations. In some scenes two characters were looking at each other and just saying incomprehensible words. These conversations must have been so funny that they repeat a couple of times during the film. This piece of script was written by two people. This is truly amazing. Such a talent. The same guy, Genndy Tartakovsky, is also the director of the film. He is the director of Hotel Transylvania 1 and 2 as well. Those films were relatively better than the final film of the series. This film is using all the credits of the first two films and aims only to make some more money. Once again voice stars are Adam Sandler, as Dracula, Andy Samberg, as Jonathan, Selena Gomez, as Mavis, Kevin James, as Frankenstein and Steve Buscemi, as Wayne. Most probably those voices are the only good point of the film, but I have seen it with my son in Romanian dubbed so I can't comment about the voices either. Based on my experience with these actors in the previous two films, I thought if there is something good in this film, voices must be it. ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,"" was released in July 13, 2018 in the United States and it has 97 minutes of runtime. It was made with a budget of $80 Million and 16 days after it's released, it grossed around $284 Million, which is a huge success for a film like this. The only reason of this financial success is the good memories of the first two films, nothing else.""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" opens with scenes where Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) is after Dracula, trying to kill him. These scenes are important because the progression of the film is based on these fights between Van Helsing and Dracula. When we get back to the present day, the family and their friends are at the famous Hotel Transylvania. Mavis thinks his father is very stressed, so she buys a summer vacation in a cruise ship for her family and friends. After an interesting air travel, they reach the ship where Dracula falls in love with the captain of the ship Ericka (Kathryn Hahn) who turns out to be granddaughter of Van Helsing, who greatly hates Dracula for no real reason. Eventually the power of love wins over hate and Dracula gets married with Ericka. As usual there is a happy ending in ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation."" I think I haven't seen an animation film without a happy ending. This is the purpose of animations. To make people feel good and happy. ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" serves the same purpose as well.Just like in the other films of the series, this one also has a lot of references from Bram Stoker's Dracula. The general story of the series gets funnier if you have read the original book, but those references can't save the third film of the Hotel Transylvania franchise. In 97 minutes of runtime, there are only 5 minutes of two scenes that take place in the hotel, yet again the name of the film is Hotel Transylvania, but an additional Summer Vacation is added to the original name of the film. In some countries it is also known as the A Monster Vacation. I failed to feel the darker atmosphere that was obvious in the first two films. I hope this is the final chapter of the franchise, because the quality starts to drop drastically, and I really don't want to remember this animation series with a bad taste. For the sake of the first two films, I was indeed looking forward to seeing the final film. Last year when it was announced I was very much excited for another film of this beautiful universe and after all this waiting, normally, my expectations were high, and therefore, my disappointment was greater than the usual. It is not a film I would see one more time. In the cinema saloon there were mostly families with kids. I was one of them and my son seemed to laugh at some scenes, but overall picture was bad, very bad.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

Once the film starts, I was seriously waiting for the same charm which the first two films had and until the last few moments, this film had nothing to offer. The jokes weren't that good and the film felt tedious. The only saving grace was the DJ battle at the end, which was funny.

I hate it when cartoons rely on modern pop music and this nonDisney movie is no exception. The reason why is because I don't like modern pop music and using music from the time period really dates the film. Disney movies are timeless because they write their own music. The jokes in this one really aren't funny. I only heard kids laugh at the fart jokes. I'm not sure why every kid movie today has to have fart, poop, vomit, or pee jokes but this one has all of those except pee.

After the film, it left me disappointed. That's what I can describe my feeling for this movie, disappointing. Why? Weak story line, weak acting, weak characters. The movie's story line is really Dracula trying to find a new wife or girlfriend. Why didn't they do this is the second movie? They should've introduced Dennis in this one, not the second.The first half of the movie was decent. Most of the scenes were funny. Now, for the second half of the movie, I was bored out of my mind. One really lame scene is where Dracula follows his crush, Ericka, on a passage. The only scene I enjoyed in the second half of the movie is the Macarena Scene where the Monsters fight against Gabriel (using music) in order to stop a octopus (controlled by Gabriel's music) from killing them all. Of course, the Good Guys won (The Monsters). In the end, Dracula and Ericka get married. If you haven't watched the first two HT, watch those first so you'll understand what characters are what.

122,bobandlulureview,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 3- BLEH BLOOH BLAH,4,1 August 2018,"I have never been a big fan of the Transylvania Franchise and that's mainly because of Adam Sandler. I don't like him much and I find his goofy accents excruciatingly annoying and every time Dracula opens his mouth to speak, I want to punch that pasty face, all because of Adam Sandler. 
Dracula and his family and friends are otherwise quite lovable and funny (to some extent) but then Sandler just goes and ruins it all with that atrocious twang. 
PLOT: Dracula (Adam Sandler!) and his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) are overworked and in desperate need of a vacation. Also, Dracula is lonely and needs to find someone to date (preferably someone without too many eyes or tentacles). Mavis surprises her father by booking a vacation on a cruise ship for their family and friends. The captain of the ship is Ericka (Kathryn Hahn), a human who has this special vacation planned just for monsters. 
Dracula is smitten with Ericka and also literally tongue tied (aaargh, more of the goofy accent). But Ericka has a secret and all is not as it appears. 
NOT A SPOLIER (this is revealed in the trailers too) - Erika is the great grand daughter of Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffidan), who comes from a family of monster hunters and has been on a quest to kill Dracula since a long, long time. Having failed to do so on numerous attempts, his great grand-daughter Erika has now taken it upon herself to vanquish all monsters especially Dracula, by taking them to the lost city of Atlantis where lies hidden a weapon that can finally kill all the monsters. 
Meanwhile, Mavis is not too pleased with the idea of her father dating somebody and she has her own suspicions about Ericka.
Will Mavis succeed in revealing the truth behind Ericka's flamboyant monster vacation? Will Ericka and her grandfather succeed in destroying all monsters? Or will Dracula find true love at last?
Sadly, like its predecessors, this instalment too fails to tug at one's heartstrings. 
The problem (of course, besides Adam Sandler!) is the unremarkable scriptwriting and weak storyline. To cut a long story short, the movie is just plain silly. My 6 year old laughed out loud at some scenes that involved monsters jiggling their bodies and passing wind. I must admit I may have laughed out loud too but it is for the sheer silliness of certain scenes especially the final scene that involves a battle of the DJs- Dracula's son in law and Grandfather Van Helsing. 
The other characters in the film (the werewolves, green Blobby, Mummy, Invisible Man, Frankenstein's monster) are all cute but that's all they are. There's no novelty in their presence. The only new ""monster"" introduced was 'Tinkles', the family pet. 
Sequels very rarely match up to their predecessors but in this case, it's not like they had a tough task at hand. 
I liked the songs played in the film, even the corny ones played at the end.

123,Akshay_Patel1985,"A fairly average movie but, too kiddish for the franchise",6,22 September 2018,"Firstly, let me start by saying i never give bad reviews (Below 7) ...If i feel a movie is not to my liking, i just do not down-grade it. By which i mean if a movie is worth 5 or less i just dont review / rate it coz its my opinion of that movie and i let others get a chance to watch it.
But, here i feel the need to give it a 5.5 stars as i was immensely disappointed by the movie. The 1st movie was incredible - loved it, the second was not as nice, but still a 1-timer. But, this movie took the whole anime franchise to a low as it is filled with kiddish jokes and scenes that do not fulfill expectations. These movies were not initially cartoons made for children. They were animations made for the entire demographic. But this last ones had foolish immature jokes that can only make children laugh. Some parts were good, hence giving it a 6 star (READ:5.5 star) review. If you were to compare this to the 1st movie of the franchise - this one would barely get 3 stars. ""Artistic Liberty"" can take you only to a certain level...but, how can animatiuon over-act is what i dont understand.

Again, it wasn't a bad movie, but it was very very predictable. I figured out the twists of the romantic interest and who the captain really was even before she was on screen.

Which Van Helsing starts playing on his DJ booth. It's a rad techno beat that some how mind controls the Kracken into becoming a destructive blood hungry monster... How do they fight this? Johnny pulls out his DJ stand and using Drac's powers... plays more soothing and happy songs to break the mind control. With the first two not being strong enough until they finally use...

147,mrwickedproductions,The Drac is Back (and for the last time?),4,31 July 2018,"What started out with an interesting premise and a positive message surrounding prejudice and acceptance has now burnt out the end of its wick of creativity and originality. Hotel Transylvania, the over-the-top, goofy family franchise returns with an unusual summer release (as oppose to its previous fall releases) to entertain on merely a surface level, with snappy animation and glittery colors. A message of acceptance is weakly rehashed inbetween irrelevant montages of FUN. It's summer vacation after all, baby! Chillax, the franchise is on its third installment. It tried hard to escape the traps and ease of family entertainment for the most part, and now it just couldn't fight it anymore. At least it's not a Christmas movie, right?I'm surprised the director, Genndy Tartakovsky, still has enough energy to pump out characters with ADHD and Bipolar disorders (seriously, even the giant puppy dog, Tinkles, suffers from both of these conditions). But if you consider Tartakovsky's previous works, it's not all that surprising. Along with cartoon shows Star Wars: Clone Wars and Samurai Jack, Tartakovsky has also worked on Dexter's Laboratory and The Power Puff Girls. You can see the crazy now, can't you?But crazy isn't necessarily a bad thing when it comes to animation. In fact, nowadays it's the norm, what with your Adventure Time and Teen Titans Go!. Unfortunately, there's a reason why animation has a bad rap for being just for kids. It's the imagination and the free rein that comes with it. Through animation, filmmakers can ""easily"" create bright characters against colorful backdrops doing anything they want. Create the same in a live-action movie and well... done properly the movie could look authentic and amazing. Done properly.So really, can you fault Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation for all its overdramatic expressions, quick turning heads, and ridiculous backdrops? No, of course not. But you can fault it for the story. This time, Dracula is in pursuit of a romance himself with a human, Ericka, who turns out to be a descendant of the ""monster-killing"" Van Helsing family. (Unfortunately, no killing actually happens, hence the quotes.) Unlike the first Hotel Transylvania, where Dracula's daughter and a human boy fall in love despite great odds, Dracula and Ericka end up together fairly easily. Sure, the duo overcome a monstrous kraken controlled by sick beats, but the internal struggle just isn't there. Dracula, the protagonist of the series, is already cool with humans and monsters being friendly towards one another. His daughter married a human and had a kid after all. What makes the first two movies bearable, and even appealing to watch (I actually really enjoyed the first one), is the drastic character arc that Drac experiences. In the first movie, Drac as the protagonist hates and fears humans, but over the course of the story, grows fond of them and accepts his daughter relationship with Johnny. In the second movie, Drac as the protagonist cannot accept his grandson not becoming a monster, but over the course of the story, accepts his grandson for who he is. The second movie does have a slightly weaker arc compared to the first, since the grandson, Dennis, does end up becoming a vampire, which makes everyone happy (with relief?). But at least a character arc exist, which influences and changes Drac's perception of society and life. In the third movie, Drac as the protagonist attempts to woo a female human. The only hardwired way of thinking that changes is the villain's, and that happens in a very unfulfilling and cliché way (with Drac saving Van Helsing's life). There is no originality in Summer Vacation amongst the borrowed, unoriginal characters. Even at the climax of the final scene, the movie has all of the animated characters dance to ""Macarena,"" the theme song of many animated family films (including Ferdinand). It's no wonder animated movies are labeled for kids-the stereotype is constantly being reinforced with butt dancing.But hey (macarena), maybe you like to ""Do the Macarena."" While the song is usually my cue to leave the theater or a party, you can't deny it is silly, simple, and FUN! Too bad I can only use two of those descriptors to describe Hotel Transylvania 3.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

Little does Drac know, she is the direct descendant of his arch nemesis, Van Helsing. Or as Dracula thought, ""the owner of the Holiday Inn down the street.""For moving the story out of the hotel and putting it on a cruise ship (which is basically a hotel on a boat), we get to see Dracula in a Hawaiian shirt, booty shorts, long black socks, and yes, leisure shoes! Proving you can take the Count of Dracula and can also take the Dracula out of the Count. Blah, Blah-Blah!Playing Vlad, Dracula's father, was Mel Brooks.

And if you have children (or another person, that like cartoons), then you must see it!A few things about the movie:First. The style of animation. It is traditional for Hotel Transylvania - mix of parody, exaggeration and fantasy. And I like it as much as many people like it around the world. When other companies thinking about more realistic animations or more realistic cartoons, Hotel Transylvania has its own style. Good choice!Second. Story. Emmmm.... Yes, there are some plot. I can't said that the story is bad or good. It is background for animation and jokes. The plot is... simple! Love, hatred and friendship - all this things you can see. 
Besides, when I saw trailer for the first time I was angry. All story was told. But! There are plot twist! For cartoon - not so bad. 
P.S. You can guess it after 30 minutes, but shhhh....Third. Jokes and jokes and jokes. This is the main reason for your attention. There are different jokes and funny situation (especially with Dracula in love). Sometimes with a smell - in all meanings. But it is main plus of the movie. So, going to the summer vacation!

162,DrRicketts,Total cash grab of a movie and totally not believable.,3,23 February 2019,"Completely lame generic monster movie, with Adam Sandlers' voice over of Dracula Switching between Armenian, Pakistani, Greek(?), but NEVER a convincing Transylvanian vampire. For that matter, Sandler has sucked in just about every movie he's been in since the mid 90's, and stopped being funny about the time that Tom Green did. I can't believe he dated Drew Barrymore. Tom Green, not Adam Sandler. I hate Adam Sandler. As far as I'm concerned, Hollywood needs to put him in pig tails and lock him in a room with R. Kelly for a couple of days.
Anyway, back to the movie. Totally not believable, like during the Scuba scene, there were lots of inaccuracies. For instance, they would NEVER let you walk on the deck in full Scuba gear like that. Someone would have gotten hurt. No-one ever did a tank compression check, and they didn't even use the buddy-system when diving. I mean, not to nit-pick, but you know, diving is serious, and kids shouldn't get the wrong idea.
And then Bigfoot steps off the boat. At about 220 feet tall. Seriously? Bigfoot is 10, 12 ft tall, tops.

It had a good story and a bright idea with all the mess going on. The Second part had it good too as we saw how life went on after part 1 but here came part 3, it was like forcing us to laugh for some reason. I don't say it is bad but I don't like it personally. It didn't give anything new and just went with some dull jokes. It tried to offer something fun but I didn't see it... Maybe I'm too old to ""laugh""... get it? That kinda joke.

Instead, it's a PC-safe, kid-safe, ""let Hollywood tell the world that tolerance matters"". So preachy it qualifies as an ""after-school special"". Apparently, EDM is ""bad"" and pop standards are ""good"", too. And did anyone find it ironic and lazy that the ultimate weapon against the monsters was itself a monster?! Makes no sense and will likely be just the latest reason this franchise ends right here. The animation and voicing was top-notch, too bad the screenplay was so lame.

173,josepx,Sort Of A Downhill,4,7 September 2018,"Although I do recommend this movies to families who like movie series like Hotel Transylvania and are looking to have a good time, I'm gonna be real. It wasn't really the best of the series from my point of view. I mean think about it. This movie reminded me more of a YouTube Family Vlog in the day of a beach or a boat only then to lead to an ending that I saw coming all the way. The movie did overall a good job of it being oddly entertaining. But it won't get rid of the fact that the movie jokes were just cliche and somewhat just wacky. I understand it's a family movie but how about we just get to the plot already. And speaking about the plot, It was just a plot that I've seen like a million times already. The antagonist wants to kill the protagonist only then to fail at the end. And with all this romance building up between Drac and Erika made it obvious that they were gonna like each other in the end. That's your typical cliched movie. But hey I will admit it, The movie was oddly entertaining and the DJ scene was pretty cool to watch and was one of the most entertaining scenes of the movie. So I would still recommend this to a family who love movies like these. But overall I really didn't see anything surprising and just making it look like some kind of YouTube Family Vlog with a cliche plot. So I am sorry to say but I sadly give this movie a 4/10",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

I find them funny even if the scripts are veeeery simple, and te reason they are so enjoyable is the fact that Sony animation does one thing extremely well: animation. The cartoony feel of the characters reminds you of 2d animations, with the cartoon physics and overall sillyness. And the designs are between very pretty to look at and extremely original. I only wish they would hire better writers. It would bring SA to the big league of animation studios. But well...

I Don't Like It",3,28 September 2018,"Okay, here's how the story goes: On July 14th (the day after it premiered by the way), I went to Landmark Cinemas (which is just a 10-minute drive from a mall where my brother is shopping at) to see Hotel Transylvania 3, and - sorry to be the elephant in the room but I need to say it - I don't like it. Yes, You heard me, I don't like it.So our movie starts off with a flashback of The Drac Pack (let's just call the group Dracula & the Boys 'cause it sounds more funny) fighting off arch-nemesis Van Helsing, then we randomly cut to a wedding (Wait, didn't we already have one in the 2nd movie?) and Dracula is in need of a girlfriend (a plot that should've worked better for the whole movie), and out of nowhere, Dracula & the Boys and the other monsters go on a cruise ship, Yeah, unfunny and pointless scenes aside, We have many forced subplots that had little-to-no point of the plot, one of which is about some confusing romance with Dracula and Ericka (the daughter of an immortal Robo-Van Helsing, not a spoiler though, It's confusingly revealed in a trailer), And then we end off with Dracula & the boys defeating the Kraken with... The Macarena of all things, Yeah... Let that soak in your mind for a little bit. (oh yeah there's a marriage with Dracula and Ericka too while you're at it)You know, I actually liked the first two movies, but this is just a boring movie to watch, Sure, I wasn't expecting a movie like The Lion King but I am not a big fan of movies that has little-to-no plot, Wait, crazy? Who, me? What kind of person would even be crazy during a movie that has A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE MACARENA PLAYING OVER IT!?!? I'M FINE, THOMAS, I'M FINE!!! It's not only one of those movies that doesn't entertain me, But it's the laziest movie I've ever watched! (Even ""Who Killed Captain Alex?"" has a good kind of lazy that ""Hotel Transylvania 3"" doesn't have.) And I ACTUALLY saw this before seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp! (I recommend watching it, Also, did you know that the ending took place during Avengers: Infinity War?) Well I mean, if Thanos can snap his fingers during Ant-Man and the Wasp, Why not use the snap on animated movies like the godawful Hotel Transylvania 3? (""Grandpa Vlad, I don't feel so good..."")Overall, I give this movie a 3/10, Save your money for something more enjoyable for your children like Incredibles 2 or - surprisingly - The Teen Titans Go!

The women and girl characters kick butt, which is always awesome to see. Not sure why characters in this franchise are so impulsive when it comes to getting engaged?

208,anthonywad,An absolute stinker,2,29 July 2018,"I watch a lot of animation, both with my kids and for myself, and this is the worst garbage I have experienced in years. It has one redeeming feature (which earned it a single extra star) in the only joke of merit (concerning a mythological south American monster). Everything is wrong here... the pacing is terrible. It lurches from one vignette to the next without creating excitement or interest. Each set piece is clearly supposed to be funny but the writers fail to make any headway into humour. The jokes are all repeats of hackneyed scenes from other movies. The voice acting is atrocious (not helped by the strange spasmodic movements of the characters the must make them almost impossible to voice well) In particular Adam Sandler is just horrible as Dracula. The characters are unlikeable, the plot is wafer thin and, importantly for a movie aimed at children, absolutely no consideration has been given to making the film watchable by accompanying adults. By the end i was rooting for thd bad guys to end the franchise.Given the quality of animation out there this is one cruise that should be allowed to sink without trace.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

217,Stopher-Johnson,Just... too grotesque for young kids. And few laughs to balance it out.,3,15 July 2018,"The previews don't reveal just how... grotesque this is. You think you're going to take your kid to watch some basic Halloween characters on the beach and you get a bait and switch for Adam Sandler's obsession with grotesque, gross-out humor in animated form.Listen, I'm not a helicopter parent or easily offended myself. But think of all the weird crap that creeped you out and gave you nightmares as a child. Like Return to Oz type creepy. Now animate them and pack them as tight as you can into kids movie with no solid jokes to back them up. This movie made me cringe and I'm 38. No reason my kid needs to watch extremely old and overweight witches in skimpy bikinis ogling an octogenarian vampire with hairy man-boobs in a speedo. The villain is a half dead looking hundred year old head attached to creepy steam-punk vehicle. The trolls on the airline are a step too far into the violent and insane end of the spectrum. There may be more than that, but my kid turned to me and said he wanted to leave and I didn't argue.And so many other characters are just too explicitly creepy for kids. Loony Tunes would show a guy get hit in the foot with a hammer for comedic effect, this movie will show the bones crack into a gnarled mess and toenails pop off after it gets hit. It's just not funny.Monsters Inc knew how to animate monsters and still make them accessible to kids. The movie gets good grades for animation proficiency, but you almost wish they didn't because they just use it to show you every gross hair, wrinkle, nipple, wart, booger, slime-ball and scab they can instead of actually creating any solid story or wonder with it.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

Personally I thought it was way below the standards set by the first two films.The premise of the story was good but I felt the way it was told was fairly dull & seemed almost awkward. At moments during this film I was actually bored. I absolutely love the first two films but the gags in this one were very obvious & the visual humour was actually quite annoying.. Such a shame, as I was genuinely ready to enjoy the third instalment as I had the previous two, but it just dragged along & a lot of the fun from the first two films was missing.The first two films are instant classic family films that everyone can enjoy, this unfortunately was way below par.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

The final battle was a bit cringe. I mean, the ENTIRE cast doing the Macarena dance, very hard to watch. The character development on Dennis and Winnie was fantastic. I would like to see that in HT 4 if that's EVER gonna happen. Overall the story was fine, Character development needs some improvement, and needs more work on jokes.

Drac and Van Helsing were hilarious, especially in the opening part. And the other characters boosted the emotions like Murray, Frank, and Johnny, Johnny was my top favorite character, he was the cool and exciting one. For me, the movie was awesome, especially in the part where they were fighting the kraken in Atlantis. In that part, the music really brought it up. There were parts where it got corny but still hilarious. The movie has a great summer vibe. All out, the movie experience was good, it has entertaining characters, it has cool music, and has legendary setting. This movie is a must see, especially for the kids.

We had to wait three more years for this DRECK?I couldn't believe it could be so bad after the first two movies-which were very good. (The trailers for HT3 are way better than the actual movie.) Of course, per the title, the location was completely different (I think they would have done better just to have developed another plot line within Hotel Transylvania once more) and many of the main characters from the other HT movies barely got any lines. I thought one of the really good things about Hotel Transylvania 2 was that they really developed the personalities of Drac's friends like Frankenstein, the Mummy, etc. Totally missing here.Script seemed lame without a lot of clever dialogue like particularly in Hotel Transylvania 2. Even Mavis, Johnny and Dennis seemed to be largely missing for large portions of the movie.I don't know if even the stars of the Hotel Transyvania ""franchise"" were getting tired of it. It seemed like even Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, etc. really just kind of mailed it in.Script seemed to be all over the place. Quickly tried to explain the background of the feud between Drac and his archenemy from way back, then suddenly they decide to go on a ""surprise"" cruise without really explaining why they were going in the first place. Script seemed very disorganized and incoherent. Unfortunately, I left very disappointed. Seemed to be the classic case of just patching together a lame sequel to shamelessly try to make a bunch of money off the previous two successful movies.While I wholeheartedly recommend the first two Hotel Transylvania movies, this one I DON'T recommend-unless you can find a lawyer to sue Sony to get the wasted 90 minutes of your life back.",Hotel Transylvania 3 - Summer Vacation

With the same returning cast, their isn't much character development excluding them getting older from the last movie. The movie in my opinion edges out the first two by a small margin, but is definitely my favorite. The universal message of accepting and loving no matter the differences will be accepted for years to come. With that being said, PLEASE no more movies. This is a great ending point to leave at, and any more movies would be milking the series.
