0,TheLittleSongbird,I actually thought it was pretty decent,7,21 July 2010,"Without it being the best movie I have ever seen, I actually liked this film. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, and I didn't get that. Instead I got a fun film, with flaws, but it was enjoyable enough.Starting with the many good things, the cinematography is superb, as is the lavish scenery and costumes. The music is very rousing and moving, and the sword play is energetic. Also I thought the direction was fine, same with the acting. Gabriel Byrne is surprisingly good as D'Artagnan(much more suited to the part than Chris O'Donnell-the worst D'Artagnan, though I actually liked the movie- was). Even better were Jeremy Irons and Gerard Depardieu as Aramis and Porthos. John Malkovich was good too, if perhaps a little too fey to start with. Leonardo DiCaprio was somewhat uneven in his performance but he was good on the whole, personally I felt he was better as Phillippe in alternative to Louis, he never quite convinced me playing an arrogant king whereas he succeeded with Phillippe because of that spontaneous boyish charm he has.However, the film is a little too long and the pacing is also uneven, I felt the film dragged in the middle and then it felt a tad rushed at the end. While the story is solid enough and sticks relatively faithful to the story, which is brilliant on a side note to those not familiar with it, it can get implausible with one or two soap-opera-ish qualities about it. Finally, the script does have one too many weak spots, one or two parts are a little too cheesy for my liking.On the whole though, this is an above average and fun film. Maybe not the best for those who adore the book, but as an introduction to the story it is good enough. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Man in the Iron Mask
1,Leofwine_draca,A vapid Hollywood blockbuster,3,14 May 2017,"THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is less a Hollywood blockbuster version of the Alexandre Dumas novel and more a vehicle for the then-huge star Leonardo DiCaprio, fresh from the titanic success of, well, TITANIC. Thus this is a faintly ridiculous movie, MTV-style in the lingering poster-boy shots of DiCaprio, who singularly fails to make much difference between the twin characters he plays.The rest of the film is an eventful but lifeless exercise, marred by the endlessly dated direction (a surprise given that Randall Wallace would go on to make the excellent and gritty WE WERE SOLDIERS). The frequent sword fights are more like street brawls, the sets look just like that, and the actors are picked for name value rather than role suitability. The likes of Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, and Jeremy Irons have all done fine work elsewhere, but as the musketeers they feel sluggish and half-hearted, and don't get me started on the dumb humour.",The Man in the Iron Mask
2,SnoopyStyle,Too many big actors stepping on each other,5,3 March 2014,"The french people are starving and the country is at war. King Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an uncaring ruler with a secret. He sends Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard) away to the front to steal his fiancée Christine. Raoul's father Athos (John Malkovich) is angered. D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) tries to plead to the king for the starving people and Raoul. When Raoul is reported kill, the King takes Christine to bed. The King orders Aramis (Jeremy Irons) to kill the leader of the Jesuits who oppose his war. Only Aramis is secretly the actual leader of the Jesuits and tries reunite the musketeers to take on the king. Athos and Porthos (Gérard Depardieu) agree, but D'Artagnan refuses. It turns out that the king has imprisoned his twin Philippe in an Iron Mask.The story is complicated. There are too many lead characters. They need to pick one character to lead the story. The great actors just get into each other's way. The action isn't there. This is an overly complicated costume drama where there are too many accents and not enough excitement.",The Man in the Iron Mask
3,jboothmillard,The Man in the Iron Mask,6,18 February 2008,"I do remember seeing some of this in a history lesson or something, so I thought I might as well watch the whole thing. Basically it is 1638, and young King Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio) prepares to rule France, and unfortunately he is a very cruel ruler. He becomes the one responsible for sending the love of Christine Balfour (Judith Godrèche), Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard) purposely to his death so he could be with her. Retired musketeers, I assume the famous ""Three Musketeers"" Father Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Raoul's father Athos (John Malkovich) and Porthos (Gérard Depardieu) get back together to overthrow the king. Captain D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) also has dislikes about the king, but he is loyal to him and refuses to help the musketeers. The musketeers eventually find out about Louis's secret twin brother who he has kept prisoner, named Philippe (DiCaprio again) and hidden by the infamous iron mask. They have a plan to swap him with the real king and make France a much better ruled and controlled place. Obviously Louis discovers the plan, and is not afraid to kill anyone who was part of it, i.e. all of them. In the end, thankfully Louis is defeated and put into the iron mask to go to prison and classed as ""insane"" by Philippe (as Louis), D'Artagnan died, but not before telling Philippe he was his dad, and the musketeers become the king's close friends and defenders. Also starring Anne Parillaud as Queen Mother Anne, Edward Atterton as Lt. Andre and Hugh Laurie as King's Adviser. As the critics say, the performances are good, in fact, I can't understand why DiCaprio won the Razzie for Worst Screen Couple (as twins), a good story. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, Gerard Depardieu number 90 and John Malkovich number 59 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Jeremy Irons was number 30 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Good!",The Man in the Iron Mask
4,ccthemovieman-1,Slick-Looking Dumas Tale,8,14 October 2006,"This is a well-made, polished-looking version of another famous Alexander Dumas 'Three Muskateers"" story and looked great on DVD when it came out in the earlier days of that format. This is an old tale of the Muskateers in latter days and the efforts to get rid of an evil king, Louis XIV and replace him with his twin brother. Both roles are played by Leonardo Di Caprio. The twin had been unjustly imprisoned and put in an iron mask for years.The film has an interesting cast of international actors: DiCaprio and John Malkovich from the United States; Jermey Irons from Britain; Gerald DePardieu, Anne Parillaud and Judith Godreche, all from France and Cabriel Byrne from Ireland.Malkovich, as usual, plays the most interesting character. Parillaud plays Louis' mother and she's too young-looking for that role.This is a fairly long movie and doesn't have an overabundance of action but doesn't need to, to keep one's attention. Randall Wallace, of ""Braveheart"" fame, directed this - another plus for the movie.",The Man in the Iron Mask
5,rmax304823,It's GOOD to be the king.,6,11 September 2015,"The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas! All for one and one for all! Who can forget them? Their names are carved into our collective memories -- D'Artagnon, Athos, Paramus, Dopy, Goofy, Donner, Blitzen, and Rudolph! In this story, helas, the four musketeers are aging, like gunfighters, and have gone their separate ways. Gabriel Byrne, as D'Artagnon, remains in service, devoted to King Louis XIV. (That's Louis the Fourteenth, also known as The Sun King; cf., The Beatles.) Jeremy Irons as Aramis has become a Jesuit priest who doesn't much like the king. John Malkovich is Athos, whose much loved son, Raoul, the king has sent off to war to be killed, in order to have his way with Raoul's fiancée. Athos is pretty bitter. Gerard Depardieu is the comic Porthos, the wine-swilling lover of life who despairs as aging cripples his diverse enthusiasms. ""I'm going to hang myself as soon as I'm sober."" All of the musketeers are well served by the players.But who is this king anyway, the one that everybody dislikes so much except D'Artagnon and the assorted terrified subjects? The population at large is not so obsequious. They're starving and the king sends them rotten fruit that's been rejected by the army now fighting Holland.I'll tell you who the king is. He's Leonardo DiCaprio, that's who. He's not only a cruel and selfish king but the poor guy, no matter which of two opposing roles he plays -- the sneering king or the pathetic waif -- looks and sounds like a recent graduate of some high school in St. George, Utah. A huge hole appears on the screen whenever he speaks. He turns the Musketeers into the Mouseketeers.The plot is too twisted with intrigues and mixed identities and the like. It can't be described in detail. DiCaprio plays twin brothers. One is the evil king and the other is the nice man in the iron mask, who is liberated and substituted for the bad king. It gets pretty tense and enjoyable, watching people sneak around, grieving and plotting. One particularly delightful moment has the bulky Gerard Depardieu in a hay stack. His head emerges from the straw and he moans, ""Ach, it's no good. I can't do it anymore."" And then the head of a pretty young lady arises from the hay and reassures him. Depardeiu shakes his head. Another pretty face appears from under him. Then a third.The action scenes are fun, combining ancient matchlocks with period smallswords. None of the actors have any skill in fencing so the scenes are subject to speedy editing and a lot of brute force is used. No guts or gore, however.It's an old-fashioned adventure yarn with a budget as lavish as the decor of the palace. It's strictly a commercial enterprise with no attempt at naturalism or genuine tragedy. The original music by Nick Glennie-Smith is imitation baroque, so as not to be too alien to modern ears. The lighting and photography are in the bright classic style, and never mind the candelabras. None of it was shot at Versailles but the impression is effective. The editing challenges no one. The camera wobbles not.",The Man in the Iron Mask
6,ma-cortes,Leonard DiCaprio shines playing a double role along with the formidable musketeers,7,27 February 2006,"The picture is a new version of Alexandre Dumas novel and is set in 17th century French court , where two twins , one evil monarch , Louis XIV (DiCaprio) of France , and the other , Phillippe , (DiCaprio in a dual role) is imprisoned in the Bastilla as an incarcerated inmate , number 6943800 , that hides his identity wearing an iron mask . Both of whom are sons of the Queen Mother Anne (Anne Parillaud) . The King falls for a beautiful girl (Judith Godreche) and while Athos (Peter Sarsgaard) leads to the summit of the dreary musketeers , thus : the brave Dartagnan (Gabriel Byrne) ; the responsible father Athos (John Malkovich) ; the joker (though with flatulence) Portos(Gerard Depardieu) and the Priest Aramis (Jeremy Irons). They join forces for the royal vengeance with the shout : ¨One for all and all for one¨ . They are planning a twisted plot , involving substitution of the villain King by his lookalike brother.It's a good adaptation with big budget , a moving rendition of the classic tale with derring-do , intrigue , romance , action and exciting swordplay . An excellent casting and lavish production shot in France make for a fairly amusement swashbuckler . Glimmer and watchable cinematography by Peter Suschizsky who reflects stunningly French palaces (Versalles), gardens and interior-exterior scenarios . Besides , the atmospheric and spectacular music score by Nick Glennie Smith . ¨Three Musketeers¨ remade numerous times for big screen and television . Thus : 1929 silent retelling by Alan Dawn with Douglas Fairbanks , 1939 by James Whale with Louis Hayward , 1977 TV rendition with Richard Chamberlain . The film is well realized by usual screenwriter (Braveheart) and first-time director Randal Wallace . The motion picture will appeal to costume drama enthusiastic and DiCaprio fans.",The Man in the Iron Mask
7,blanche-2,Familiar tale with a new cast,7,28 March 2008,"Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and also King Louis XIV in this re-telling of the famous Dumas story. He is surrounded in a sumptuous production by a stellar cast that includes Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Jeremy Irons. The oft-filmed plot concerns the twin brother of the cruel, selfish Louis IV who is guarded loyally by D'Artagnan. Phillipe, the twin, was taken from his mother at birth and once found by the King, imprisoned and placed in an iron mask to hide his identity. When the poverty and the uprisings become too much, Aramis (Irons), who knows of Phillipe's existence, breaks him out of prison with the help of Porthos (Depardieu) and Athos (Malkovich) with the idea of having him replace Louis at an upcoming masquerade ball. It falls to Athos, who has just lost his son Raoul in war because of Louis' lust for Raoul's fiancée, to teach Philippe how to be king in a short time. Things do not go as planned.This tremendous cast and huge production make for absorbing viewing, different yet as entertaining as the Richard Chamberlain TV version and the Louis Hayward version in the 1930s. Here the emphasis is on the old Musketeers, which works well - Porthos who feels his age and misses the old lusts, the grieving Athos and Aramis, given an impossible job by Louis, which means that Louis must go; and, of course, D'Artagnan, fiercely loyal to his King and insisting that he can be molded into a great ruler, despite evidence to the contrary. The acting is fabulous - there really isn't a standout among the four men as they are all so good.Leonardo DiCaprio creates two completely different characters with Louis and Philippe and does an excellent job. Though he was trending toward matinée idol/chick flick territory, he pulled himself out to take on weightier roles - though there's no doubt this film was meant to bring in the teenagers. And what's wrong with that - a classic story once in a while won't kill them.Entertaining viewing.",The Man in the Iron Mask
8,wes-connors,Two-Faced Man,6,16 November 2009,"In the 1600s, France is being ruled by ladylike in manner, but really very nasty Leonardo DiCaprio (as King Louis XIV); the faux Frenchman beds women less pretty than himself, and makes peasants sick with rotten food. To help lure comely Judith Godrèche (as Christine) into his bed, Mr. DiCaprio orchestrates the death of her boyfriend, Peter Sarsgaard (as Raoul). This irks Mr. Sarsgaard's father, prompting reformation of ""Three Musketeers"" John Malkovich (as Athos), Jeremy Irons (as Aramis), and Gérard Depardieu (as Porthos). DiCaprio's nastiness prompts the retiring trio to abduct the King and replace him with a lovely twin Leonardo (as Philippe).So, what happened? Let's take a stab at it To help prepare for the role, producer/writer/director Randall Wallace ordered several of the older Alexandre Dumas movies screened. Unbeknownst to star and director, someone slipped in a copy of Greta Garbo's ""Queen Christina"" (1933); and, that's how they decided to play the DiCaprio characters. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. (Garbo wouldn't have approved the fart jokes). Fortunately, DiCaprio recovered from this unwise role selection. Moreover, Gabriel Byrne (as D'Artagnan) essays an excellent modern musketeer, Mr. Wallace's plot ""twist"" interests, and the production is beautifully shot.****** The Man in the Iron Mask (3/13/98) Randall Wallace ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Gabriel Byrne, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich",The Man in the Iron Mask
9,sunwarrior13,Poor Remake Of A Dumas Classic,8,8 January 2012,"Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film.Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their ""magnificent valor"" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule.The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.",The Man in the Iron Mask
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Possibly not the best film about The Three Musketeers... but one of the most entertaining and powerful ones,7,7 May 2006,"After watching this a few years ago, I had little recollection of it... the general perception and memory I had was favorable, so I decided to make it a point to watch, when it aired on TV. I must say, I had forgotten how exciting, dramatic and intriguing it was(and is). The plot is very captivating, and it develops nicely with a few twists that hold up rather well. They are neither obvious nor illogical. The pacing is very good, it never seemed to move neither too slow nor too fast. The acting is one of the highest points of the film... DiCaprio, Irons, Malkovich, Depardieu and Byrne... all hand in excellent performances(though, obviously, some of them are more seasoned and/or talented than the others). It was great fun to see Hugh Laurie in a role, albeit a small one, after seeing all of the BlackAdder series(in which he plays a considerably big role; or, should I say, number of big roles), the genius British comedy franchise of the mid-to late 80's with Rowan Atkinson. I was probably most fascinated by the fairly young DiCaprio, who has the job or portraying two rather different characters... everyone who's seen the film knows what I mean, but for the sake of anyone reading this who hasn't, I won't say more. Don't worry....No, wait! I, I meant about the characters, not about the movie!Anyway... the characters are all quite credible and well-written. Dumas knew his stuff when he wrote the novel(s?), and Randall Wallace did a good job(as far as I can tell; anyone who's read the work of Dumas, feel free, in fact, even encouraged to correct me here) of compiling it into a two-hour Hollywood movie. It's very credible and convincing all-round, and for a Hollywood drama, there is, surprisingly enough, little to no actual sap or sentimentality. Mr Wallace doesn't try to manipulate us or con us into feeling sorry for these characters... he instead manages to evoke genuine emotions, something not many of this kind of films manages to do. The dialog is fairly smart and interesting, and always well-delivered. The swordplay is entertaining, if a bit limited in scope and amount, clearly due to the seniority of most of the main cast. All in all, a very entertaining tale of The Three Musketeers, based on an interesting idea, and brought nicely to life by talented actors. A good film, but not a great one. I recommend this to fans of the film-makers and possibly of the legend and Dumas, as well. 7/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
11,view_and_review,Very few downsides to this movie,7,22 November 2020,"In 1993 we got ""The Three Musketeers,"" a story full of levity about three members of the royal French guard who vowed to save the king of France. In 1998 we got ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" which is about three musketeers who are seeking to depose the corrupt young king of France.The story was riveting. Leonardo Di Caprio played King Louis the 14th who very much reminded me of a Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones. That alone made me want to see him taken down, and taken down hard. France was at war, the people were starving, and all the young king could think to do was sleep with another man's fiance.Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich), and Pathos (Gerard Depardieu), three ex-musketeers, desired a revolution--bloodless if possible. They could get the king they wanted on the throne if they could switch King Louis with his wrongfully imprisoned twin brother Phillipe.The plot was a fascinating one because there was a loathsome king and those who would oppose him. It was complicated by the king's chief guard D'artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) having an allegiance to both his king and his fellow former musketeers, Aramis, Athos, and Pathos. The acting by all was delightful and the production itself was top quality. There were very few downsides to this film.",The Man in the Iron Mask
12,AlsExGal,Fun for a reason that could not be known in 1998...,5,24 August 2019,"... that Leo DiCaprio really was a great actor, not just a pretty face. But this movie was made the year after Titanic's success probably to capitalize on just that - that DiCaprio was a pretty face that made teen girls swoon - before the Titanic spell wore off. Because he couldn't possibly act...could he??Seeing that it is basically exploiting DiCaprio's power over teen girls, the script does not ask too much of him. He is asked to portray the two opposite personalities of twin French royal brothers in a take on the ""Man in the Iron Mask"" story. ""Bad twin"" is reigning Louis XIV who does not care about his people and cares only for pleasure and seducing pretty girls. ""Good twin"" is living in a prison cell with an iron mask that covers his entire face, so that nobody will know Louis XIV has a twin and thus plan a possible coup, which is exactly what happens. Complications ensue.There is a twist that you can see coming from a mile away, and everybody overacts, including the esteemed John Malkovich. Why did he take on this project anyways? And why do high taxes mean that the crops fail? And why do the French people expect the government to feed them? Inquiring minds want to know.At any rate, a fun look back at the fork in the road DiCaprio was about to face in his acting career, just now as he is starring in a film about Hollywood and American culture facing a ""fork in the road"" - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.",The Man in the Iron Mask
13,anaconda-40658,One Too Many Leos.,6,22 May 2015,"The Man in the Iron Mask (1998): Dir: Randall Wallace / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne: Fantasy about identity that takes a familiar concept and reworks it with the Musketeers as a factor. Set in 1662 with the separation of twins. One is put in chains and fastened into an iron mask while the other becomes a sadistic ruler. He is defended by a Priest and the Musketeers. One of the Musketeers loses a son in one of the King's battles so he gets together with the others with plans of switching the twins. Randall Wallace does a skilled job directing but humour is often too corny, such as a scene where the Musketeers slice vegetables that are thrown at them. We know where this all ends and only the sets make it worthwhile. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor but unfortunately overplays two roles here. John Malkovich plays a vengeful Musketeer. Jeremy Irons is terrific in his loyalty to the King. He is outsmarted during the switch but will become involved in the action violence climax that these films tend to be reduced too. Gabriel Byrne is also featured although he has played broader roles than this. Gerard Depardieu is hilarious but the other roles seem more or less cardboard. The film contains impressive sets that are the strongest element in the film. That is the one element that allows the film to see the light of day. Score: 6 ½ / 10",The Man in the Iron Mask
14,HotToastyRag,My favorite version,8,11 August 2019,"Of all the movies featuring the Three Musketeers, the 1998 The Man in the Iron Mask is by far my favorite. It's funny, exciting, touching, pretty to look at, and isn't so cheesy that it can't be taken seriously.I've recently read the original novel and expected it to be exactly like this version, but the last laugh was on me. This version took only a few chapters of the book and blew it up into a full-length movie, so if you're really attached to the book, you'll find there's a lot missing. In the book, there are quite a few switches, so much so that I was very confused, but the movie makes it clear. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the twins, and he's so different in both roles, it's almost like he's really two different people. One important factor that some actors aren't able to master is the need to be unlikable as one twin and likable as the other. Leo is very sweet as the sheltered twin, and he wears some wonderful expressions in this movie.The musketeers are played by Gabriel Byrne, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and Gérard Depardieu. With all those pros, even if you don't like Leo, you'll like the side plots. I like Leo in his earlier days, and this is one of my favorites of his performances. I also like this version because it's very 1990s. If you don't know what I mean, then the '90s probably aren't your ""golden decade"". Rent it, though, and see a perfect example of a '90s period piece. You'll get to see beautiful costumes and scenery, too!",The Man in the Iron Mask
15,Wuchakk,The Four Musketeers (and the Man in the Iron Mask),6,1 May 2015,"Loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' classic adventure novel, specifically the third part of the third part of the d'Artagnan trilogy (yes, I worded that correctly), 1998's ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role as both the titular Phillipe and the spoiled, oppressive King Louis XIV of France. Gérard Depardieu plays d'Artagnan, the loyal captain of the guard who's also in love with Louis' mother, played by Anne Parillaud. Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Gérard Depardieu star as the legendary aging three musketeers (d'Artagnan is the fourth) while Judith Godrèche plays the king's love interest. The plot revolves around a scheme by the three musketeers to depose Louis and replace him with his twin brother, the mysterious man in the iron mask imprisoned in the Bastille.For some reason I thought this was going to be a roll-your-eyes take on the story, like a mishmash of The Three Musketeers with Indiana Jones, but I was surprised and pleased to see that it's actually a serious quasi-historical drama/adventure, which isn't to say that there aren't eye-rolling movie moments. Basically, if you liked ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" (which came out four months after ""The Man with the Iron Mask""), but would prefer a slightly more realistic tale, you'll probably like this, as long as you don't mind the blatant deviations from the classic book.Some people complain that DiCaprio is too effeminate as Louis, but the real Louis XIV was effeminate, so what's the problem? As for Phillipe, the man the movie's named after, the story focuses more on the four legendary musketeers, which explains my title blurb, but that's okay on account of the four formidable actors in the roles.I would've thought that having an imprisoned commoner suddenly becoming the king of France would be a good story angle, but that's not the direction the movie takes. In fact, the entire third act piqued my interest because it was so unpredictable. At first, I was turned off by d'Artagnan's sudden and curious change of mind on something, but the ending reveals why.Unfortunately, I can't give the film a higher rating because of a few aforementioned eye-rolling parts. The highly unlikely way Phillipe is rescued from prison is one and another is the way the three musketeers try to drive Louis batty at the dress ball by making him think he sees iron masks everywhere. Lame elements like this needed to be tweaked or worked out of the script altogether.The film runs 132 minutes and was shot entirely in France.GRADE: B- (or 6.5/10 Stars)",The Man in the Iron Mask

Well, unless the crown is made of diamonds, but you get the idea",8,23 November 2003,"The Man in the Iron Mask, fresh off the massive success of Titanic, we got the next movie starring huge heart throb Leonardo DiCaprio along with some of Hollywood's strongest male leads. Including a couple of my favorite actors John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons, so this was a movie I was looking forward to seeing, not to mention I was 13 at the time of this release and was totally in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, oh yes, good times. So of course this movie was love at first site with me, but as I grew up and watched the movie without my crush influence, I still found it to be a good solid movie. Leonardo stays strong as his first duo role as King Louis and Philippe and proves he can stand up with the heavyweights of Hollywood. Jeremy and John together with Leonardo had great chemistry and made The Man in the Iron Mask a really good watchable movie.France is under the reign of King Louis XIV, who is bankrupting the country with his unpopular wars. When starving peasants in Paris start to riot for food, he responds by ordering his chief adviser, to send them rotten food. Meanwhile, the King wallows in hedonistic luxury while seducing a parade of women. The legendary three musketeers have retired from their posts: Aramis is now a priest of the Jesuit Order; Porthos is running a Parisian brothel; Athos has a son named Raoul who is just back from the war and ready to marry the girl he loves, Christine. At a festival, the two lovers are greeted by an older D'Artagnan, just before Raoul can propose, the King's eyes fall on Christine. He arranges for Raoul to be returned to combat and killed in a suicidal charge. In the wake of Raoul's death, Aramis initiates a plot to overthrow the King with the help of his old comrades. Only Athos and Porthos agree to the plan; D'Artangan refuses to betray his oath of allegiance. The three musketeers sneak into an island prison and arrange the escape of a mysterious prisoner: a man in an iron mask. Philippe, the identical twin of King Louis. While he looks indistinguishable from his brother, Philippe is compassionate and gentle and the plan is to replace Louis with Philippe.While I've expressed my love for John and Jeremy, the true talent comes out in Gabriel Byrne's performance as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. Gabriel as D'Artagnan was just beautiful, charming, dashing, and very charismatic. While the movie could have had a little better direction, in some ways this felt more like a made for TV film at times, just with the big names. I'd say that's the movie's main flaw, but they were not given a big budget to make it into a great movie. Also the fact that Leonardo as Philippe, they take the iron mask off his face and he's still pretty! Eh, still I'd highly recommend it, it's the actors that make this movie very delightful to watch, one for all and all for one this movie is just tons of fun! Hey, that almost rhymes, I made a funny! OK, there's my cheesy joke, I'm done, just watch the movie.8/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
18,sddavis63,It Weaves Together Several Legends,5,1 November 2009,"This is no doubt a very successful period piece, featuring wonderful sets and costumes, and creating vivid and realistic portrayals of both the opulence of the French court and the wretchedness of French prisons in the 17th centuries. Based on an Alexandre Dumas novel, it's also an interesting weaving together of several legends loosely based on a true story. There really was a ""man in an iron mask"" - a prisoner in that era who wore a mask, at least in public when being transferred from prison to prison. The movie also includes some pretty good scenes of swordplay and a good dose of humour as well, revolving largely around the figure of Porthos, one of Dumas' famous musketeers, now past his prime and having trouble adjusting to that fact.In this account, which is relatively faithful to Dumas' work, the man in the iron mask is identified as Louis XIV's identical twin brother Philippe, who was put in the mask and in prison in order to protect the throne for Louis. Historically, the problem is that Philippe wasn't a twin of Louis' - he was Louis' younger brother. In the story, a plot is hatched to free Philippe from prison and pass him off as Louis as a way of ridding France of a petty, self-indulgent king with no regard for the French people. The story had its moments, but was somewhat inconsistent , and the plot hatched was full of holes. Perhaps Philippe could have been trained to act like a king - even to act like Louis - but Louis would have had knowledge Philippe couldn't have been given: knowledge of courtiers, knowledge of affairs of state, etc. Surely Philippe's lack of such knowledge would have led to the ruse being found out. The implausibility (impossibility?) of the plot was the major weakness here. There was also a certain soap opera quality. The King's decision to bed Christine by sending her fiancé off to battle to be killed mirrored the biblical story of David and Bathsheba, while the revelation that D'Artagnan was the actual father of both Louis and Philippe was unnecessary to the story, although reflects another legend that Louis XIII couldn't have fathered his children because of an estrangement from his wife.Leonardo DiCaprio played both Louis XIV and Philippe. I thought he was better in the latter role, and for some reason had difficulty taking him seriously as Louis. There are certainly good points here that make this worth watching but I still didn't find this to be a great movie. 5/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
19,851222,Flawed but not bad guilty pleasure movie,7,24 January 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.So as the first post-Titanic movie staring Leonardo DiCaprio ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1998) wasn't his best chose, at the moment Leo doesn't make mistakes like this, but at the moment he did, and this film was born. It is a not a bad movie by any means, it is pretty fun and entertaining to be honest, a true guilty pleasure to see it once (i saw it twice during the first two years after its release). Performances were pretty good in this flick, especially by Jeremy Irons. The set design was also good, and that is pretty much all i can remember about this movie after seeing it twice (!), although it was more then 17 years ago. The story itself was also not bad at all, but the script failed at many moments as well as directing.Overall, ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" does its job (or should i say did it back then) as a guilty pleasure movie for a one evening, but don't expect great movie with Leo if haven't seeing it yet. Nice one time flick, nothing else and nothing more.",The Man in the Iron Mask
20,filipemanuelneto,A good film about the era of the Sun King,7,17 May 2016,"In this film, based on a novel of Alexandre Dumas, king's musketeers seek to replace the ruthless French king for a twin brother of him, that people don't know and that has been kept secret by state reasons. Directed by Randall Wallace, which also provides the script, has the participation of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne.The script is good and makes an interesting adaptation of the novel. Initially, I had few expectations about the film due to Randall Wallace, who was involved in the disaster that was ""Braveheart"". In fact, this film is low in historical accuracy, but Dumas also invented quite in his own novel. The recreation of the court environments, costumes and sets, on the other hand, seemed to me more in line with historical reality and also fill the expectations of the audience, showing the splendor of the Sun King's court. Maybe Wallace has taken some positive lessons from ""Braveheart"" after all. The action scenes were interesting, and the swashbuckler style sword fighting's deserves a positive note. Leo DiCaprio was at the highest level and showed great talent, having to make two characters deeply antagonistic. Depardieu was not bad but not surprised except in humor. His character is the funniest and the actor was perfectly able to play with it and make him funnier. John Malkovich, Gabriel Byrne and Jeremy Irons incarnated the deepest and psychologically demanding roles, having made an inspired performance and showing great ability to collaborate with each other. After all, they are all veterans and established actors, they don't have to prove anything to anyone. The soundtrack accompanied the film faithfully and fulfilled her role with style.Not being, nor by far, one of the best movies I know about this historical period, this film doesn't frustrate the expectations of the public and give him what he wants: fencing, old-fashioned chivalry, dances, the luxury of Ancient Regime and a story that combines, in the right measure, history, romance, drama and action.",The Man in the Iron Mask

I'd like to make my home there when I wasn't snugly ensconced in the royal palace with it's secret passages and hidden chambers. This film rivaled the one made in the 70's, but I don't think it was done any better....if memory serves. Great props and costumes made me feel as though I was really right there in 17th century Paris. Superb acting and a well written script made the flavor of this adventure even tastier. I was all for this one.",The Man in the Iron Mask
22,Vartiainen,Its worst crime is that it's dull,4,3 January 2016,"A film loosely based on the third Musketeers novel by Alexander Dumas, who in turn adapted the story from actual historical events surrounding King Louis XIV and the eponymous masked prisoner of his. The story goes that France is struggling under the rule of its new king, Louis XIV, whose wars have lead to poverty, hunger and rioting. King has faced numerous assassination attempts already despite his young age and thus he entrusts his safety to D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers, all of them aging men already.Sounds exciting, right? Unfortunately, it is not. And I do not blame the actors for this. All of the main characters are played by talented actors, from Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan to Jeremy Irons as Aramis. They're just the right amount of over the top to fit the spirit of adventure, yet serious enough that they can sell the darker moments. Sure, Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louis is still in that younger phase of his career where you cannot take him that seriously, but he does a decent job here as well.No, it's the script that's at fault. Or perhaps the directing. The events themselves are exciting on paper, but most of the film fails to translate that excitement into actual events. Like a scene where Louis is hosting a grand ball while at the same time his opposers are working to kidnap him. Yet it drags. It's just dancing, Louis sitting on his throne, retiring for a moment, then coming back, sitting some more, people dancing. You don't feel the stakes at all. And the whole movie is like that. It should be thrilling, a great big adventure. But the pacing and the storytelling are both so incompetent that it doesn't feel like it.I'm also not a huge fan of the changes made to the novel, but they don't outright ruin the film. They also don't add all that much so I don't see the point of including them, but that's a nitpick.The film has its upsides. Visually it's very pleasing, all the musketeers are fun characters, if depicted a bit shallowly in the case of Porthos and Athos, the score is decent and even the story at least has elements of adventure in it. Personally I've seen much better adaptations, but if you're a fan of the actors, you might get something out of it.",The Man in the Iron Mask

This is also, in my opinion, Leo's best performance to date (March 2007). He really comes through as one of the greatest talents of his years, in this work, which led to many great roles being awarded him, later.Enter the best cast list of Musketeers ever conceived: Jeremy Irons as Aramis, John Malkovich as Athos, Gérard Depardieu as Porthos, and Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan. These guys depicted the epitome of these iconic characters, and delivered performances so believable, they were chilling.This work is not a masterpiece, but is QUITE good, and rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Man in the Iron Mask
24,freemantle_uk,A mediocre swashbustler,4,17 October 2010,"In 1998 Leonardo DiCaprio was career was at an early peak after starring in Romeo + Juliet and Titanic and Randall Wallace was able to have his directional debut after the unjust praise he received for Braveheart. Both ended being involved in a mediocre swashbuckling auctioneer which is a sequel to the Four Musketeers.Set in the early stage of King Louis XIV (DiCaprio) reign, Louis is a brutal king who is engaged in a war with the Dutch, allowing the civilians of Paris to starve and riot whilst his lives in luxury and at has affairs with mistresses. The Four Musketeers have gone their separate ways, Aramis (Jeremy Irons) is a Jesuit priest, Porthos (Gérard Depardieu) is a fat old man who is depressed and visits brothels, Athos (John Malkovich) has raised a son, Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard) who want to be a musketeers and D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) is the captain of the musketeers for the king. But when Aramis is asked to kill the head Jesuit order and Athos' son dies in a suicidal battle because of the king's eye for his partner, three of the musketeers plot to overthrow Louis. They plan is to free Louis' identity twin brother, Philippe was held prison with an iron mask over his head, and replace him to be a good king.There are some good things about The Man in the Iron Mask: there are some nice costumes, nice scenery involving the palace of Versailles with a fitting score and Irons was pretty good in the film. But there are a lot of problems with this film. Most of the acting is wooden, and that despite the casting of DiCaprio and Malkovich who were on autopilot. Malkovich did have one decent moment of making an angry speech but that's it. But DiCaprio's career went into a mini-dip after this and the Beach: luckily he has recovered and works with great directors like Scorsese, Spielberg and Nolan. It was also a weird mix of accents, with characters speaking in either an English, American or French: Wallace should have gotten all his actors to speak in one accent and stick to it. The action in film is pretty standard: there is nothing bad about it but there is nothing new or refreshing about it either; just a few sword fights and flintlock rifles being shot. I am also personally very critical of Wallace as a writer, coming up with the cinematic travesties of Braveheart and Pearl Harbor. The Man in the Iron Mask follows has the same problems, Wallace has a continuing need to introduce poor and crass comedy, with Depardieu playing a drunken slop who gets drunk, farts, lusts over women and walks around naked when he tried to hang himself. For a very French story the one major French actor has the worst role. Most of the jokes fall flat and the dialogue is weak throughout the film. The character is one dimensional, but Wallace does not know how to make them any other way. You could not believe in them and the acting did not help. There was no attempt to characterise Louis and like Edward I in Braveheart there is no political reason for why he commits an act, like the war. It was a hollow experience. There is an attempt of a surrogate father-son relationship between Athos and Philippe but that also felt flat throughout and that well developed.Many ideas are underdeveloped, like the Jesuit campaign against Louis' wars, the grinding poverty the ordinary people had to suffer or show more of the war, whether France was winning, losing or in the middle of a stalemate. A theme that could have been explored was if the musketeers were using Philippe for their own ends to gain power for themselves. Or rivalries in the court whilst some counsellors supporting Louis and other against him.Overall the best swashbuckling film of 1998 was the Mask of Zorro and Wallace best film is We Were Soldiers: watch those two film instead.",The Man in the Iron Mask
25,Nazi_Fighter_David,A film done with pride and conviction...,9,13 March 2002,"Without ever attaining indisputable literary merit, Alexandre Dumas, succeeded in gaining a great reputation first as a dramatist and then as a historical novelist, especially for such works as 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' and 'The Three Musketeers.' He was among the first, along with Honoré de Balzac and Eugène Sue, who fully presented a rich, detailed picture of life in early 19th century - France, creating characters of formidable individuality and willpower...'The Man in the Iron Mask' takes place in 1662, where a spoiled young king rules in decadent luxury while his subjects are starving in the streets... His armies fight unjust wars... His selfish actions result in deep resentment by the people... He is currently under siege by rebellions... His tyrannical disposition prompts the original 'Three Musketeers' to believe that France will never prosper unless a change is made... Our musketeers have all grown into middle age, and their exploits have become legendary...When the son of Athos is sent to the front lines of battle, and killed the aging 'Three Musketeers' (Athos, Porthos and Aramis ) are forced to haul out their old uniforms into active rebellion against the crown... They come up with a plan to expel the tyrant from his throne... A carefully guarded secret works to their advantage...Aramis knows of an enigmatic Bastille prisoner, a helpless victim of the king's justice, whose true identity and existence is unknown to most... This mysterious young man has been thrown into loneliness and pain in a dungeon for six years, forced to wear an affixed iron mask so no-one can notice how much he looks like the king...In a risky maneuver to save France, the 'Three Musketeers' break the title character out of prison, teach him to behave exactly like the king, and then set off to make the 'switch' in a masquerade ball...As their plan unfolds, they must confront their friend, the great D'Artagan, one-time ""fourth Musketeer,"" now head of the king's bodyguards, who has sworn an oath to protect the king with his life...DiCaprio plays two characters so distinctly and effectively that you absolutely hate one and love the other...He is King Louis, a non-caring leader who lets his subjects starve and riot in the streets of Paris... He is a vile ice-hearted seducer mostly interested in bedding attractive young women... He displays, with talent, King Louis' arrogance and cruelty... DiCaprio is also the gentle Philippe, the polar opposite of Louis... Philippe has the heart of a king, with eyes asking too much... Gerard Depardieu is delightful as the old and weak Porthos, the womanizer, more concerned with the pains of growing older... Porthos feels useless unable even to ""straighten his sword"" when in the hay with three women... John Malkovich is the straightforward Athos, now an impulsive widower and an angry father who has his own need for revenge against the King's treachery... Two time Oscar nominee for ""Places in the Heart"" and ""In the Line of Fire,"" Malkovich makes the point that ideally, they should have a king worthy of their service...Jeremy Irons is the contemplative Aramis, the justice leader of a silent rebellion.... As the Jesuits oppose Louis' wars, and the starvation that results, Aramis is ordered to discover the true identity of the general of the Jesuit's order and to execute him... In one moment, Jeremy Irons (an Oscar winner for 1990's ""Reversal of Fortune""), dignifies the true mission of a Musketeer when he states: 'When we were young men, and we saw injustice, we fought it!'Gabriel Byrne is the faithful D'Artagnan who carries a mysterious secret with him... His dark romantic secrets are hidden in his sad look... Byrne has the right combination of gravity and flair for the conflicted D'Artagnan, especially in the scene where he placates an angry mob... He projects his character's romantic frustration and his crisis of conscience, and desperately tries to find a balance between his loyalty to the king and his ability to live up to the code of the Musketeers... Anne Parillaud is the twins' mother, Anne d'Autriche, torn between her passion and her maternal love toward a son completely far from the path of compassion and honor...Judith Godrèche is the damsel in distress, the beautiful Christine torn between being faithful to her dead love and helping out her poor family by basically selling her body to a lusting king...The film's authenticity and visual presentation are as glorious in the decadent luxury surrounding the King of France as grotesque in the terrible place occupied by the man in the iron mask...Randall Wallace (Oscar-nominated for ""Braveheart's"" script) brings the great palace of Versailles to life with elegance and finesse... The beauty of the gardens defies verbal explanation... The music is beautiful and epic, and the motion picture is done with pride and conviction...The masked prisoner actually existed in reality... But his identity was never known and it's of little consequence here... The film, however, is not exactly faithful when it comes to historical facts... It has been created for pleasant entertainment purposes... Louis XIV of France, whose great prestige earned him the title of 'the Sun King', ruled France in one of its most brilliant periods and remains the symbol of absolute monarchy of the classic age...",The Man in the Iron Mask
26,juneebuggy,"Fun, entertaining, great story,",8,30 October 2015,"I liked this one quite a bit, excellent in terms of a period piece, which I was in the mood to watch with beautiful sets and costumes and a swashbuckling adventure. I had seen this years before but couldn't remember any details about the movie itself, for some reason though I had never forgotten the fascinating story about the Man in the Iron Mask.I like how this opens by telling you that while ""Some of this is legend at least this much is fact, when rioting citizens of France destroyed the Bastille they discovered within its records this mysterious entry; prisoner number 64389000-the man in the iron mask."" so that there is an immediate element of mystery.The movie itself is a classic adventure film with romance, intrigue, lots of action, yup there's even sword fighting, and filled with a fantastic cast to portray the aging musketeers (Gabriel Byrne, Gérard Depardieu, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich) as they hatch their plan to overthrow the King. I enjoyed all of them but honestly Gérard Depardieu was hilarious here, and this has to be my all time favourite role of his... ""I'm just a fat old fart with nothing to live for anymore. I'm going to hang myself, as soon as I'm sober."" Leonardo DiCaprio does a decent enough job portraying two very different characters, that of the evil king Louis and also his good natured, tortured twin brother who has been kept chained and masked in a dungeon for years. Leo is young here and struggles a bit with accent etc and I think also gets overshadowed by the experience of the others in the cast. 10/12/15",The Man in the Iron Mask

DiCaprio is good in dual roles but the real magic is watching Irons, Malkovich, Depardieu and Byrne in the roles of the Musketeers and they are simply terrific. This film was release three months after the mega giant Box Office hit ""Titanic"".

DVD also includes an intriguing commentary track by the filmmaker and more. ""The Man in the Iron mask"" might be too corny for some tastes, while others might see this as a loose sequel to Disney's ""The Three Musketeers"". This movie offers simple entertainment and for those... who enjoy adventures. They should not miss this one.

With the declination of loyalty and trust in our society today, this movie boosts the morale even if it's only temporary. Aside from that, the movie features an extraordinary story, remarkable characters and breath-taking entertainment.The best characters of the bunch are the reunited aging Musketeers as they all bring something to their impressive repertoire.

The emotions between the Musketeers are taken from different angles. At one point, we are treated to see the the warmth and caring between the feuding quartet,next thing you know, they're angerily drawing swords to each other. But it's not drawn in vain, but mostly through their competitive spirit. When the quartet light up the screen, they're storytelling stems from looking back at a time when unity, chivalry and the value of teamwork where everyone treated equally came into place.

I know that no expense was spared in production. It's a fine specimen of movie entertainment. Sets, costumes, cinematography, editing. And, of course, big headliners.The one thing that feels skimped on is story management. It feels dilettante-ish; like simple karmic elements tinker-toyed together and intended for delectation by a 5-year-old snuzzled into bed with his teddy bear. Transitively, the actors--especially the headliners--come off like their tongues are weighed down by the knowledge that they're reading fay, simplistic storytelling. Somewhere between the standard script and the interp (the direction, also, mayhaps?), a ball has been dropped.After viewing, I thought, OK: What's a good counter-example? A flick that has all the same technical finery, including roughly the same period, but also possessing a picaresque narrative, with character study, as deep as it is broad, would be... Barry Lyndon.If you're thinking, ""That boring old fossil?!?!"" then I'd just say... OK, maybe ""Iron Mask"" is more your speed, and... godspeed! But I see the technical finery of a flick as merely a substrate. The story is everything. I do expect both (good technique and narrative depth), but actually am more respectful toward flicks that, even if they're technically lacking, at least deliver on the mythic level in a satisfying way.So I give this one a '6' for the technique, but I can't creep that any higher.If you like a simple intrigue fable and lots of swashbuckling, ""Iron Mask"" will do.",The Man in the Iron Mask

Casting Leonardo Di Caprio in the role as the king's twin (and hero of this film) was a bad call, for a start. This really was not the type of role that Di Caprio could work well in, and the acting as a whole was below average. On top of the poor acting and casting, the film lacked an engaging plot because of the characters and the use of cameras, which seemed to work behind the scenes and let the weak characters/actors and actresses become the focus. However, I think this film could have been much better than it was if they had cast someone other than Di Caprio for the main role.

UGH!  Scenes where DiCaprio makes his bland transitions from the bad guy into the good guy are bad enough, but when Depardieu goes to hang himself and mutters, ""Goodbye, cruel world,"" only to fall on his tush, is ghastly. And, Tim Curry's Snidley Whiplash version of the Cardinal only need to say, ""Heh-heh, Heh!"" to fill in the gaps.  Bryne, Irons and Malkovich must have been paid a lot of money to do this dog.  But, they did little service to the film industry or medium in doing so.  This film was made for the teenage set and even adds a teenage king and queen to an already limp storyline that is merely a whisper of the fine original story.  But, for those of us who have seen some very fine productions of the original Dumas story, this is disappointing to the max.

Fifty years later, it'll be hard to appease anybody who'll be interested. Using the ""old school"" styling approach in film making, it feels like a modern-day 90s film with the usual twists. The giant busty sculptures of 17th century broads might be new to you if attention was paid little to endless reruns of HERCULES and XENA. Anyway, Leonardo DiCaprio is the main attraction here. For acting purposes, he's more of a role model this time compared to what he did brilliantly in TITANIC. Don't you think pretty young gals will fall in love with him? His own double as the man in the iron mask is worthy of interest, but overall, he hardly does anything except for having sex and dressing up in costumes. More action sequences would be greatly appreciated along with a greater interest for the much older generation who grew up watching movies based on the its given theme. It's hard to take recent movies too seriously as they try hard to evolve. THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is just adequate enough to rival a Hollywood golden oldie, but it comes up real short on innovation. Too late.",The Man in the Iron Mask

Cast full of great actors, really all great actors I mean: Jeremy Irons, Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Malkovich, DiCaprio... and neither of them can even make this lift above the ground an inch. It's incredibly dull, flat, utterly predictable, tedious... every action scene is like a caricature of an action scene, every dialog a caricature of a dialog, everything is cheap, rushed, from start to finish, the one-liners, the constant stares into the camera/long pauses between lines attempting the dramatic... in many places, if not the whole thing, it looks like a film which screenplay/story was thought out some night by some bored film people who just wanted something to make to merely entertain their then idly bored selves. Really. It's so badly made it's immediately beyond credible and confirms its atrocious global quality throughout. It's a little bit like a joke if you will. Oh, and the plot twists. This is really just one of those films that are so bad they're entertaining.",The Man in the Iron Mask
41,saadanathan,The legacy of the three musketeers continues 7/10,7,23 January 2021,"The Man in the Iron Mask is a really good and enjoyable film with lots of great and funny moments. the idea of the film felt pretty original to me, even though it's based on the novels by Alexandre Dumas, I still felt I was watching a movie that was written for the big screen instead of based on other material. the idea of continuing the story of the three musketeers was brilliant. add the plot of replacing the king louis with his mysterious twin brother and you get a pretty good story. I didn't feel bored at any point and most of the time it went good. without dragging time of the story. the ensemble of cast is another positive thing about the film: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne are all terrific and well acclaimed actors. each and every one of them does his best in this movie. totally worth watching.",The Man in the Iron Mask
42,SKG-2,Inconsistent movie,7,7 February 1999,"I haven't seen any other Three Musketeers movies, and I couldn't get through the Dumas novel.  However, I liked Randall Wallace's script for BRAVEHEART, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Wallace did such a good job combining historical fiction with old-fashioned adventure with a modern twist in that story (to be fair, Mel Gibson did a good job directing it), but here, he's not consistent; there are some scenes and especially dialogue which are real clunkers, which alternate with scenes that are rousing or dramatic.  It's not bad, but it just goes all over the place.The acting reflects this inconsistency.  Of course, a lot of the initial box office was due to DiCaprio, and while I like him, and thought he was surprisingly good as Phillipe, he was all wrong as Louis; not bad, just wrong.  Amazingly, Depardieu, perhaps the best actor in the cast, has almost nothing to do except clown around, and the lovely Anne Parillaud seems forced here.  Irons has some good scenes, but is hampered with some of the bad dialogue.  The ones who rise above are Byrne and Malkovich(it's nice to see him play something other than a bad guy for a change).  It should be said that the swordfight scenes are all excellent.",The Man in the Iron Mask
43,TaylorYee94,The most attractive Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan among all films,9,1 August 2020,"An entertaining film with interesting story. (It is unjustly underrated.) The narrative is fast-paced, the way I like. There is no loose moment because it tells many stories, event, and background : king's secret twin brother, three musketeer's aging and role changing, D'artagnan's romance with Queen Anne. They all combine smoothly to a great ending.The best part is that this film has the best Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan ensemble. In all of the movies with Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan so far, four characters are greatly harmonized together, but I never acknowledge each individual so much. They are reckless, daring, and cocky heroes which is classic but redundant. Also, four in other films don't intrigue me because they overcome hardship so easily and are absent from personal agony.However, four characters in the film have aged, weakened, and passed their heydays. Heroes who overcome personal problems and become mature are way more attractive than young, handsome ones. Additionally, four actors plus Leonardo DiCaprio carry out their roles with such greatness. I also love the fact each musketeer is way more distinctive and unique than the ones in any other movies.",The Man in the Iron Mask
44,Rammstein-2,Oh please! It's not even well made (spoiler included),1,11 February 2000,"(spoiler warning)This film does a real good job of being one of the very worst films of the 90's. Though the acting is about standard (except for Depardieu, I'll get to that), there are details that simply sink this absolute horror of a film.First of all: Louis XIV's imprisoned brother stays six years in the prison wearing an iron mask. Fed intravenously, I suppose. Anyway, they remove the mask and wash him, and TADAA, he's just as well-fed, nice and clean as the king himself! That's really something.And along comes Depardieu. He is French and has an undeniable French accent. The others speak perfect English. Why bother to cast someone with a French accent in a film that is otherwise accent free? Why, because he alleviates the fact that this film about European history is made by a bunch of Americans, and brings ""fun"" to the stew. Well - he sucks.Near the end, the musketeers are trapped and just have to run broad-chested and shouting towards a bunch of soldiers wielding muskets. They fire a barrage of bullets in a confined corridor - and not one bullet seems to have hit its mark. Is that divine intervention à la Pulp Fiction or what!?And then comes the very worst detail: after the burial, the musketeers walk down an alley lined with the king's troops. I would have been happy to dismiss the film with that, but NOOOOOOO - the troops have to shout ""One for all - all for one!"" just to point out that this film is one of the cheesiest and dumbest films ever made.Man oh man, not even the little girls who had filled the theatre to see DiCaprio thought this film was good. Thank God I didn't have to pay to see it.",The Man in the Iron Mask
45,mOVIemAN56,Not the greatest adaptation of the Musketeers story but better than most,6,12 April 2007,"The Man in the Iron Mask is yet another adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic of the Three Musketeers. yet again the story has a different premise revolving around Porthos, Aramis and Athos and their friend D'Artagnan. The story is a lot more enjoyable for me than most of the adaptations of the Three Musketeers. Almost everything is changed and I was surprised this was even considered a musketeer film but I guess you have to if you use their names.The story is set during the reign of King Louis XIV considered one of the greatest rulers of France's old government. However not all is well in France. Constant war with neighboring lands has destroyed the economy and all of Paris is starving and rioting while Louis sits in his estate loving women. The three musketeers (Athos, Aramis, and Porthos) have aged into their late 40's early 50's and are all but useless to the king. Aramis decides it is enough and decides to unleash Louis' dark past. Louis' twin brother was locked in the Bastille and placed in an iron mask so no one would recognize him. Aramis and the other two musketeers plan to break him out and usurp the throne for the kinder Philippe. Meanwhile D'Artagnan questions his allegiance to his King and to his friends and his questionable past.First, what must be recognized is the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on duel roles and completely different personalities brings forth some of his best acting of his career. This role I believe is the one that broke him out of the pretty-boy look he had gained from Romeo+Juliet and Titanic. DiCaprio showed a lot of promise in his duel roles in The Man in the Iron Mask and seems to have paid of with his recent film works (The Departed and Catch Me If You Can). DiCaprio is convincing both as the King and as Philippe. Two of the three musketeers in my opinion were strong. Jeremy Irons is one of the top British actors in the business and proves it again as the Jesuit Musketeer Aramis. French actor Gerard Depardieu brings the comic relief as Porthos but that is when comic relief is needed. He is in no way just their for the laughs, he has in stern moments and his fair share of good acting moments. John Malkovich is not my favorite actor. I believe his performance as Athos is a bit forced and just didn't convince me for the majority of the film. The person that wins me over is the mysterious acting of Gabriel Bryne. Bryne makes me believe he is the true D'Artagnan. His tragic character figure made me watch this film over and over again. Bryne convinces you with his first minute on screen that he is an amazing actor and that he deserves more recognition in Hollywood. I wish Bryne would get more big time roles in movies today. His performance is reason enough to watch this film.The story is not the greatest. The director never gives us the true understanding of how horrible psychologically it must have been for Philippe to be locked in an iron mask for five years. I think this would have added a bit more suspense to the story. The film does also have its dull moments and questionable dialog. Overall I find the story average with solid acting by the majority of the cast. The Man in the Iron Mask is not a great film by any means. More of good acting with mediocre storytelling. The ending sequence is one of my favorite to date. The musical score is exceptional and the performances by DiCaprio and Bryne are among the best I've seen.3/5 stars",The Man in the Iron Mask
46,jldmp1,Iron Maiden,4,29 March 2006,"This is premised on the notion that, if one DiCaprio is good, two must be a whole lot better...The costume drama has always been a good point of departure for movies. The best ones invest in a world. Consider one of the champs of this genre, like ""Barry Lyndon""; in comparison, this is a day pass to Eurodisney.It's a two-ton clunker and Byrne is stuck with all the heavy lifting. Malkovich and Depardieu phone in their contributions. The real star is Irons, who shines in everything he does. He doesn't need this, so he stays above it all, and that alone is fun to watch.If you want a Fab Four with derring-do, stick with Lester's two ""Musketeers"" features from '73 & '74.",The Man in the Iron Mask

All this build up to essentially say 'The 3 Musketeers are cool, the King is a jerk'. Maybe it couldn't have been set up in 15 minutes due to the motivations being laid out, but it is just so dull and you really have to endure it. That and the fact that half the characters have French accents and the other half just spoke in whatever dialect took their fancy.Once you get moving the storyline is great! The characters are well developed and there are background arcs progressing throughout. Some of the fight scenes are a little embarrassing but for the most part they pass, and the setting and costumes give the right atmosphere.

48,fimimix,..huh?..,4,11 June 2008,"I must have missed all these wonderful performances so many users write about. How many versions of this wonderful story do we have to see? Randall Wallace certainly didn't read the original book (which is considered to be a masterpiece) written by Dumas. I'm not certain if I can recognize which period of French history the film was supposed to depict. Only in the end did we hear ""Louis IV""; that would have put it in the period just before ""Marie Antoinette"", who married Louis VI, right ? France had too many Louis; I don't recall ONE ""Philippe"" in French History. One user commented it was a good portrayal of ""18th-century France"", but it was set in 1662. AND, the location was at ""Fontainbleau"", not ""Versailles"", which ""IV"" built.At any rate, I didn't hear one French dialect in the entire film. Malkovich (whichever ""Three Muskateer"" he played, and so many users raved about) sounded like the average man from Kansas. ""Raoul"" (Peter Sarsgaard) was rightfully deleted from the film at the beginning, killed in front of a part of some castle used again in another scene. I found the other cast-members just as wooden in their performances, and wondered why they were in the movie.Earlier black-and-white films told this story much better: wasn't ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" one of the men in the mask? I was totally unimpressed with DiCaprio's acting here: another man from Kansas.Yes, the cinematography was bright and the settings were appropriate. The ""masked ball"" (supposedly shot in the ""Hall of Mirrors"" at ""Versailles) was beautifully choreographed and the costumes were almost as lavish as those worn in ""Marie Antoinette"" (black-and-white from the early '30s). BUT - none of the contrived action in this movie overly entertained me......very risqué action in some scenes. That's good, if it fulfilled its purpose to make one laugh. I didn't.AND - if I heard correctly - the prison-guards where ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was imprisoned were speaking Spanish, so he certainly wasn't in ""The Bastille"". Those who think Dumas would be pleased with this weak presentation of his novel certainly are mistaken: there was nothing authentically French in this film except the Palace of Fontainbleau (which was given ""thanks"" in the credits). If one is familiar with the lay-out of ""Versailles"", the King's rooms were at the center of it with the entire palace built around them, therefore his being called ""The Sun King"".I guess ""Mask"" was intended for a younger audience, who had not seen the many versions of this story. I'm glad they enjoyed it, but - except to fill some idle hours - I saw nothing in it to rave about.Sorry - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.....",The Man in the Iron Mask
49,basrutten,Excellent cast but lots of cliches,6,2 December 2001,"contains spoilersThe most remarkable thing about this movie are the four excellent actors (Malkovich, Irons, Depardieu en Byrne) that have been cast to play the roles of the musketeers: simply great acting! Leonardo diCaprio as the evil king is ok, but nothing special.Unfortunately, this movie has an incredibly corny plot and a slow pace. At one point, I thougt that almost every character in the movie had some kind of tragic or impossible love (worst of all: D'artagnan turns out to have an affair with the queen ?). This sort of Jerry Springer-plot twists just doesn't belong in a historical adventure movie. Also, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, the Evil King, is so incredibly evil that it's hardly believable anymore (he does evil things just because they are evil, not because it's of any use to him). On top of that, the movie takes at least half an hour to long.Overall, it's a fun movie to watch, with an exceptional cast, some jokes, some swashbuckling and way to much relationship troubles and leaps in logic.** out of **** stars",The Man in the Iron Mask

The best elements are the costumes and locations, Byrne as d'Artagnan, Irons as Aramis and Depardieu as Porthos. DiCaprio was unconvincing and his accent intrusive - he even ended one question with a very American ""huh""; I thought he did better as Philippe, both in and out of the mask. Malkovitch was very flat as Athos, whose nobility (both as an aristocrat and man) seems to have been written out of this film; Malkovitch looked and behaved like an ageing bruiser; Van Heflin did a far better job in the 1948 film of ""The Three Musketeers"".The ""battle"" in which Raoul was killed seems to have consisted of five men; a team of re-enactors could have done better.

Gabriel Byrne was truly amazing as D'Artagnan, I believe it was an honor for him to play the hero he all wish to be in our childhood. Aramis, Athos and Portos were amazing as well, their performance was a success as their interprets Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and specially Gérard Depardieu. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was convincing as well, as he really let us to believe there were 2 actors instead of one, something the special effects could never do properly. I think playing a king is a true honor for any actor, but playing a musketeer it should be an honor for any man. A way to show your love for bigger reasons then a king or a country...

Leo shines here with the way he switches characters so convincingly, and the musketeers each bring their own, wonderful personality to brighten the film.

54,Geofbob,Dumas would have been pleased (perhaps),8,30 December 2005,"This 1998 movie provides everything a swashbuckling cape-and-sword flick should - legendary heroes, a cruel villain, noble sentiments, touches of love and sex, some slapstick, picturesque scenery, sumptuous interiors and of course dashing swordplay (the last perhaps a little limited by the maturity of some of the principals).It has also some reasonably intelligent dialogue, provided by writer/producer/director, Randall Wallace, and spoken in part by two of the finest voices in the business - Jeremy Irons (Athos) and John Malkovich (Aramis). Gerard Depardieu (Porthos) and Gabriel Byrne (D'Artangnan) are the other two of the original 3 + 1 Musketeers.The villainy of the young King Louis 14 is provided by Leonardo DiCaprio, who may be too wishy-washy for some tastes, though he certainly has the veneer of elegance needed for the part. One niggle I have is, that it would have been better if he had been instructed to pronounce Athos either with a short a or a long a (preferably the former) and not alternate between the two.The plot, like the Dumas novel on which it is based, has no less, and no more, credibility than is appropriate for this type of film - for anyone interested in the real events and rumours surrounding the Man in the Iron Mask, I recommend this website - http://www.royalty.nu/legends/IronMask.html One aspect of the film I find amusing is that in this version of a quintessentially French story, the only French actor in the quartet of heroes, Gerard Depardieu, plays the part of a uncouth, lecherous buffoon; while an Englishman, an American and an Irishman provide the grace, heartfelt speeches and depth of character.

The four musketeers, played by an international team of top actors, are also a bit dull, lacking both the humour that made Richard Lester's Musketeer films so much fun and the element of charisma and vitality that would convince the viewer that these are indeed the hardest men in the world. There's not much character shown by anyone, so you never really start caring about the heroes or hating the villains, and there's virtually no action until the last ten minutes or so, where a few half-arsed swordfights are thrown in as if in afterthought.

57,wobelix,"""Magnificent Valor""",9,23 August 2001,"The true reason why Alexandre Dumas' epic of the Musqueteers is as unforgettable as the fairy tales of Andersen, Grimm and Aesop, is of course because everyone is a musketeer. As we all know, the three friends are really one person. Aren't we all one of the other, hoping with the passion and vigor of an Athos to combine the love of the flesh and savoir-vivre of Porthos with the wisdom and contemplation of an Aramis.D'Artagnan is the hope in achieving that equilibrium. This tale has been filmed almost 500 times. Coming soon will be a megalomaniac attempt of prototype American Peter Hyams, which will be a film completely opposite of THIS glorious picture-tale. Where Hyams, as always, searches for the (special) effect and too grand but empty gestures, this film is about people. Heros alright, but people with their weaknesses none the less. Those who love the swashbuckling epics, see this film because it is lovely even though the fighting is restrained. People who hate the swashbuckling genre please don't miss this wonderful film, with a superb cast and wonderful art-direction. Maybe one day we will have the ultimate '3 Musketeers', which will mean that the three friends will be played by one truly great actor.

58,Danimal-7,"Nice swashbuckler skewers the heart, misses the head",7,20 August 1999,"If only the dialogue had been better, and if only DiCaprio hadn't been in it, this movie could have been great.  As it is, it's not bad though.The Sun King, Louis XIV, is oppressing his subjects to pay for costly and bloody wars.  The four Musketeers of Dumas fame, now aging, plan a secret meeting, and Aramis proposes that the royal monster be secretly deposed and replaced with his twin brother, who has long rotted in prison with his face concealed behind an iron mask.  D'Artagnan alone refuses, opting to remain to remain true to his oath of loyalty to the king.It's an exciting story, even if Dumas would never have recognized it, and the musketeers are wonderful.  Depardieu is weakest as Porthos, playing the role as a buffoon, but he is funny at times.  Better is Jeremy Irons as the drily witty, conceited Aramis.  John Malkovich is strange as Athos; he seems to deliver every line with an acid-etched intensity.  It works very well for his most dramatic lines, but why doesn't he ever change his tone?  By far the best performance in the movie comes from Gabriel Byrne as the tortured, loyalty-imprisoned d'Artagnan.  The movie's best scene is not any of the sword-fighting sequences, but d'Artagnan on his knees before the king, recounting his brave and devoted service over the years, and urgently requesting as his reward that the king show himself worthy of that devotion. I once composed a list of my all-time favorite movie heroes, using as my criterion those heroes I would most want to be like.  D'Artagnan from this movie is number five on that list.The production is sumptuous with wonderful costumes.  The action scenes are decent and well played once they arrive, and the score reasonably evocative.Now the bad news.  Randall Wallace's dialogue stinks.  Inane one-liners intended to sound ""cool"" are falling flat everywhere; probably the worst is Aramis' line, ""It's judgment day!""  Byrne is forced to recite some unbearably sappy love lines to Anne Parillaud, causing a potentially interesting romance to sink amid a chorus of groans.Leonardo DiCaprio can act, but you'd never know it by watching this picture. His ""good twin,"" Philippe, is flat and boring.  His ""evil twin,"" Louis, is far too tender and considerate in his love scenes to properly represent a man who throws lovers away like used toilet paper.  He cannot get a proper tone for his performance.  Too much screen time that should have gone to the far more interesting musketeers is wasted on DiCaprio-in-bed scenes that have no apparent purpose except to lure teenage girls into the theater.As many others have noted, the idea of the latter half of King Louis XIV's reign being some kind of golden era is absurd; his subjects celebrated in the streets when he died.As director, Wallace took a risky choice by saving almost all of the action scenes for the last half of the movie.  Because of the aforementioned problems, the risk doesn't pay off.  If the movie had slowly built tension for the first hour, which was no doubt what Wallace intended, and then explosively released it toward the end, the idea would have worked. Instead, we spend most of the first part of the movie rolling our eyes at the inane dialogue and at DiCaprio showing us a ruthless tyrant playing kissy-face in bed.THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK could have been a classic.  Instead, it's disappointingly ordinary, but still enjoyable for the charismatic performances of the musketeers alone.Rating: *** out of ****.",The Man in the Iron Mask
59,winopaul,"All for the exit, the exit for all",3,19 January 2016,"Yes run to the exits. The film is not as bad as some make out. The dialog is a bit cheesy. The plot is a bit silly. It certainly is not a good movie. At the beginning I thought it was a kid's movie. What really bothered me was the voices of DeCaprio and Malkovich. Every single line out of Malkovich's mouth was wooden, and was obviously fake-- a community theater actor just mouthing the sounds. His American accent did not help. I don't like much of anything Malkovich has done, so I was not surprised. I don't know if it was because he did not fully learn his lines, or if he can't do the overdubs, or he over-enunciates, or it was something that the audio people could have fixed. I doubt it. He might be tone-deaf.Equally bad was DiCaprio, who reminded me how boy-toy heartthrobs just get by on their looks. He was miscast and the whole plot over-stressed him since they figured it would get the gal demographic. His dialog always sounded fake and forced and phony. There was one scene where he got mad and yelled and he was pretty good, a little boy throwing a tantrum, but much better than fellow boy-toy Ben Affleck, who rolls me on the floor when he tries to act angry. I understand that Leo and Ben have careers because women need to look at something while their vibrators recharge. Fine with me, but the mistake is giving them speaking parts. The gals will like Leo and Ben even more if they don't open their mouths in their films.I wonder if Wallace did re-writes after Titanic hit big and they had DiCaprio already under contract. Other reviewers noticed there were too many leads and I agree. The king should not be a focus, and Malkovich should not have made it past the screen test. With him out, then make Leo a Musketeer (notice they never carried muskets?) Make Depardieu the King and get rid of the clown character. Bring the dang women more into the story. The queen was great-- make the whole story center around her and have her direct the hijinks. Get us to like the other gal so we can kill her later, and get the sympathy vote at the Oscars. Take all suicide out-- this is Catholic France for gosh sake. Have the king kill the fluff babe when he cannot seduce her. Although hard for Hollywood to believe, most gals actually care when their lover is killed in war and won't jump into bed with the King. Now that she is pure, we really will care when she dies.Take the ""sneak the twin out under a toga"" bit out. If Dumas wrote it then was it was stupid in 1850 and even stupider when filmed. Also you can't have a Musketeer stabbed and then just get talked down and walk away.So now you got Leo as one Musketeer, and you can keep the other two but why pay those high-dollar great actors?

Or better yet, have DeCaprio the Musketeer save her from Depardieu the King, and then he gets the girl in the end.Yeah, that's the ticket.

61,ks4,"Ambitious, but often shallow and predictable.",5,24 April 2004,"Ambitious movies that often tries to make itself better than it is, sadly this is achived by constantly trying to make subplots and various random dramatic moments rather than building up the movie slowly it ends up being a jump around.In 1662 france is ruled by a dominant king who is not worthy of being a king, it's ruled by terror and greed, the civilization is working against him, He, Louis, makes no one stand in the way of his dreams. Until one day he makes a big mistake and gets a son of a former Musketeer killed, this makes the former musketeer wish for his death and replacement, together with other former musketeers working against him he forms a plan to have him replaced by his look-a-like twin, kept away in a lonely prison wearing an iron mask.The plot is from the start obvious and sadly very predictable, after watching about 5 mins you know HOW it will end, though there are still some surprises under way, sadly the movie makes a big mistake in my eyes and runs very fast through the explanation period, here i could have wanted some more explanation on why it happened, and maybe how, also the movie does not focus on the struggle of the ""good twin"" at all, Phillipe's total struggle is somehow explained briefly in words, but not very detailed, being a main element of this movie you could wish for more here, would also add more depth to the character in a movie where all the characters are rather hollow, this i feel is caused by the fact that the movie is trying to focus on a million different things at once and never gives itself time to explain what is going on.It's obviously a very ambitious movie, but somewhere along the way it fails, it wants so bad that it tries to get around it all, but somewhere in between it seems as the director have lost control a bit and sometime the story is rather nonsense, and some of the scenes seems uncomfrotably squeezed into places where they could have been left out.All the actors in the movie are pretty average, none of them really shines out, it's once again obvious that Dicaprio do indeed have a lot of talent and i'm forever certain that he will be a very large star one day, he has a lot of talent, and it is visible in some parts of this movie, although his character seems shallow, actually all of the characters are rather uninteresting, and the dialog doesn't make the actors job any easier, trying too hard maybe to be true to its time age, and still it doesn't work convincing that way either.Now i know i have been negative towards the movie, and i do think there are many flaws, but it's not an entirely crap movie without positive sides, there are scenes that are dramatic and moving, however it also feel like some dramatic scenes are added just for the purpose for a dramatic scene, but the recreation of the old Paris is also magnificent and pretty much flawless. Furthermore the movie is kind of entertaining, though just don't put your hopes up for a cinematic masterpiece that will hunt your dreams for weeks to come.In an average movie that has the potential to be great but is full of flaws some things are still shining and does make the movie rather watchable, therefore it deserves the rank of an average movie, nothing more, but neither nothing less.5/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
62,tripwires,Great movie,9,16 November 2001,"The first time I saw this was in 1999. I was so taken to Leonardo DiCaprio as Philippe (sp?), I even developed a slight crush on the character (come on, I was 13!). Just recently I watched it again when it played on TV...and since then, I became a DiCaprio fan.But first, the movie. I think it's great. There's nothing more enjoyable than a well-paced, well-scripted and well-acted period drama. I haven't seen a lot of musketeer films; the only other such movies I remember seeing is ""The 3 Musketeers"", you know, the one with Chris O'Donnell? That one was good, but I think ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" is better. Firstly, we have not one, but two Leonardos. Philippe is a total sweetheart while his brother is a total scumbag (somehow, DiCaprio managed to look ugly, to me at least, as the evil twin). Obviously the audience would want Philippe to win it all, right? The movie not only has beautiful sceneries and beautiful actors, it has a happy ending. And sometimes, happy endings are exactly what a lot of people need to see.Secondly, the cast. I understand that with the exception of DiCaprio, the principal actors are all veterans. So I don't think I need to say that I thoroughly enjoyed their performances. Great chemistry between the musketeers, not much between Evil Twin and the French actress, whom I thought could've done better. She just seemed kind of detached from the entire picture. Next, DiCaprio is a fine actor. I loved Philippe and hated Louis. Philippe is handsome, while Louis is ugly. Although it was strange hearing an American accent in 19th (?) century France, DiCaprio more or less stole the picture. His ability to portray two characters who are exact opposites of one another is just amazing. Louis may be somewhat one-dimensional, but the sharp contrast between the two is so obvious, I don't know how some people can fault his acting.DiCaprio's version of a French accent may have really sucked, but his acting didn't, and the same goes for this film. Some parts of the movie may seem really corny and unbelievable, but for goodness sake, it's fiction. Who really cares?",The Man in the Iron Mask

His adult, monarchical gravitas is precisely zero. This perpetual 15-year-old really ought to be hanging out with Robbie Benson someplace retired from acting exchanging stories about ""the good old days.""

Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++!

Fortunately, those guardsmen shared the chief's admiration and fired at the musketeers' feet and over their heads so that they remained standing when the smoke cleared. It is the climactic and thrilling scene of a film that has so much going for it, it earns at least 8 stars despite its flaws. The swordsmanship, the French chateaux, the villages, the cobblestones -- it is so clearly filmed on location because these things cannot be duplicated or substituted. And yes, an all-star cast if you can accept Di Caprio's flat American accent in not one but two historical characters. But Malkin makes no effort either to speak anything but American, so that only Depardieu sounds French while Byrne and Irons speak that nondescript British that passes for Americans speaking a foreign language.

67,longcooljolie,"Worthwhile, but not quite the masterpiece it wants to be",7,14 March 2014,"Back in the days of Douglas Fairbanks, people took historical drama/adventure movies much more seriously. There was a lot more reading going on and people were more familiar with Dumas' grand epic tales, such as ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" With this in mind, the director and producers of ""Iron Mask"" start their movie out slow in getting late 20th century viewers familiar with all the characters. This was the first role for Leonardo DiCaprio post Titanic, and possibly the greatest collection of actors ever assembled to portray the Three Musketeers (Gabriel Byrne, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and Gerard Depardieu). Of them all, Gabriel Byrne stands out as D'Artagnan and portrays his fierce loyalty to the wicked King Louis 14 and the Queen Mother with quiet passion. He also looks great in the period costumes, long hair style and thin mustache.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a dual role of both the wicked king and the title character. The plot focuses on a scheme by the Three Musketeers to spring the man in the Iron Mask from prison and replace the evil king with him. The implausible way they do it and install Philippe on the throne gunks up the movie a little at the midpoint. Script rewrite, anyone? On the other hand, the scene where Philippe is unmasked is one of the best in the movie.While some moviegoers (even girls and young women still gaga over Leo from ""Titanic"") thought that he looked too ""girly"" in the movie Leo manages to get viewers to hate Louis 14 and love Philippe. And of course the queen mother knows right away and you can see the realization in her eyes (authentic French actress Anne Perillaud plays the role beautifully). Besides that, here's a little-known historical fact: the real King Louis 14 was girly. He used to pluck his facial hair and bloodlet to give his face a more vulnerable, feminine appearance. The Man in the Iron Mask ends satisfyingly and there is even some good swashbuckling action for fans of that sort of thing. Leonardo DiCaprio's image changed radically not long after the movie, when he hooked up with Martin Scorsese for a string of tough guy roles. But he should still be proud of his performance in ""Iron Mask"" and it is a fine movie.",The Man in the Iron Mask

However, this film explores the serious side and to great affect.With a cast that many directors would kill to even get close to, the film turns in a winning performance as the aged Musketeers attempt to re-instate the birth right of the kings imprisoned twin brother.Despite the overall criticism of his performance, DiCaprio, while undoubtedly turning in one of his weakest performances, still manages to hold his own against the much more established cast for whom Jeremy Irons and Gabriel Byrne give excellent performances and Depardieu turns in a brilliantly tragi-comic performance. The poorest performance, I believe is from Malkovich, who at times appears to be simply going through the motions, reciting his lines instead of acting them.The other weakness of this film is when, in its strive for authenticity, it casts French actors along side the British and American stars, and whereas Depardieu's accent is not pronounced enough to stand out against his co-stars, the accents of other's, especially that of Judith Godreche, unfortunately seem almost laughable is comparison, and ultimately turns you away from their good performance.Overall, though, a very good film, with an ending which may leave you looking for the box of Kleenex.",The Man in the Iron Mask

83,jrm23july@aol.com,"After The Success of 'Titanic', DiCaprio Could Never Wear An Iron Mask",6,28 March 2006,"""The Man In The Iron Mask"" is based on the Dumas novel about the Three Musketeers, is a remake of the 1977 classic with Richard Chamberlain in the lead role. Leonardo DiCaprio, who months earlier struck it big with the Oscar winning mega-hit ""Titanic"", plays the duel role of King Louis XIV, and his imprisoned twin brother Philippe in the 1998 version of ""The Man In The Iron Mask"". Set in 18th century France right after the French Revolution, ""Man in the Iron Mask"" is about the search for democracy, hidden deep underneath the bed of tyranny. France is poor, hungry, and fed up with the tyrannical, King Louis XIV who is an egocentric, high-strung, womanizer, that will shed blood (not his own of course) to get what he wants.His high officers, Porthos, Athos, and Arimus, played by John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Gerard Depardieu, have nearly reached their limit with him. When Athos' (Malkovich) son dies fighting one of Louis' foolish wars, the musketeers plot to overthrow King Louis, and establish a democratic government.Porthos, Athos, and Arimus, are looking for some leverage in their attempt a bloodless coup, and find their ticket when they discover that Louis has a twin. They journey beneath the bowels of the earth, to find Louis' twin brother Philippe, who has been locked a dungeon and forced to wear an iron mask. Leonardo DiCaprio is gaunt, pale, dirty, and malnourished as the oppressed Philippe. The musketeers rescue Philippe- Porthos, Athos, and Arimus and then plot to kidnap the obnoxious Louis XIV and switch one Leonardo DiCaprio for the other Leonardo DiCaprio.""The Man In The Iron Mask"" is a decent film, but there are several flaws, the major flaw being the huge difference in accents of the actors who are all supposed to be 18th century Frenchmen. You have Leonardo DiCaprio with an American accent from California. Then there is Jeremy Irons with a British accent and Gabriel Byrne with an Irish one. Gerard Depardieu is the only native Frenchman. Leonardo DiCaprio is at times outstanding, and at other times lost, in his duel role. The intriguing plot leads to an exciting finish but the ending is predictable, and not one that makes a hero out of the heroes. The ending makes you feel sorry for the obnoxious, self-righteous King Louis. The Man in the Iron Mask is basically good swashbuckling fun for viewers of all ages, but this is certainly not DiCaprio's best film, especially not immediately following ""Titanic""",The Man in the Iron Mask
84,wolfie-8,Utterly putrid,4,16 February 1999,"I almost don't know where to start in criticizing this film. Nearly everything about it--I am not exaggerating--is utterly terrible.DiCaprio, for example, offers one of the finest examples of miscasting I have ever seen. Not for one instant does he come across as a monarch, let alone Louis XIV, one of the most adamant believers in the divine right of kings who ever lived. He has literally *no* royal presence. DiCaprio not only looks far too young (he looks like a boy who would still be at the girls are ""icky"" stage of life, not seducing everyone at court), he makes no attempt to speak like anything but a young, modern American male--at one point, his Louis actually finishes a sentence with ""huh?""But perhaps I should not assume that DiCaprio slipped that in on his own. Given the bargain-basement level of the rest of the dialogue, I can easily believe that writer-director Randall Wallace penned that ""huh"" himself. Top-notch actors like Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne and John Malkovich must have been choking on their lines; Malkovich's flat performance does make it seem like he was bored out of his mind. I can only hope that the French members of the cast, including Gerard Depardieu, didn't realize just how bad their dialogue was.My personal favorite was Byrne's statement to Queen Anne (Anne Parillaud): ""I know that to love you is a crime against France, but not to love you is crime against my heart."" I literally rolled off my chair laughing. That isn't even historically accurate: at that point, the Queen was a widow and no one would have cared a whit if she was sleeping with everyone in the court.Such overblown statements and actions are rampant throughout the film. Rioting peasants toss an apple at D'Artagnan; he not only slices it with his sword, he catches it on the blade and deftly takes a bite. The scene is so ludicrously melodramatic, it must be seen to be believed.My list of possible complaints is endless, but to wrap up with just a few: the cast members' accents are all over the place, the music overwrought and the entire film far too long. I sincerely advise all readers to avoid this movie, unless you're teaching a class on how not to make a film.",The Man in the Iron Mask

But having the lead characters all sound like they're from different parts of the world - that's bizarre and jarring.  I could have accepted American accents in old France, and Leo and Malkavich had very pronounced modern American accents, if everybody had an American accent.  But then, you had Jeremy Irons and Gabriel Byrne in there sounding British, and to top it all off, you had good ol' Gerard who not only has a French accent, but sounds as though English does not come naturally to him at all.  This poor conglomeration of accents only served to remind me that I was watching a Hollywood movie.  It is unfortunate, but I could not bring myself to like the movie as a result. Which is too bad.

There is a very good cast with excellent performances from John Malcovich, Jeremy Irons and Leonardo DiCaprio (who looks gorgeous too). Definately worth checking out.6/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
93,love_for_nails,So underrated!,9,12 December 2012,"That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from Gérard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this.It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST!Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is ""Les Miserables"" 1998, the second is ""The painted veil"" 2004).9/10",The Man in the Iron Mask
94,EnvyYouProductions,Laughably awful adaptation with great cast.,3,29 December 2000,"I rarely have laughed this much in such an awful film. Randal Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART) directs this Dumas adaptation and manages the almost impossible: he takes a great book and a great task and makes a deeply flawed film. The dialogues are unintentionally funny. The four musketeers overact badly - which yet again causes many laughs. Leo DiCaprio tries to resist the obvious overacting traps a double role offers - not always successful. And couldn't anyone have insisted on only ONE pronounciation of the name D'Artagnan? Now we hear British, French, and a couple of American versions - by people who are all supposedly French. Well, nevermind. It's a good laugh. Who cares then that it actually is supposed to be a historical action-thriller...",The Man in the Iron Mask
95,loay_76,Not even close to the original story .. ugh!!,1,5 May 2009,"It's really a shame to call this movie (The man in the iron mask), it should be called (The idiots in the paper mask!!) .. really this movie DID destroy the charm and the glory of the original Alexandre Dumas père's novel with fatal mistakes and distortions !! Take for example: The 3 musketeers (D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis) were the original heroes of this novel and not Leonardo DiCaprio (King Louis XIV and his twin) Athos wasn't that grave looking guy - Porthos wasn't a desperate, dumb pimp that in a moment wants to suicide and in the other moment offering a prostitute to the twin of king Louis XIV ...D'Artagnan was the main Character of this novel - In the original storyPorthos died by the soldiers of king Louis XIV trying to escape and defend his comrade Aramis In the original story: Athos died after his son In the original story, D'Artagnan died in the war between France and Netherlands in the day he was promoted to be the grand Marshall to all the French army and this was the end of the story In the original story (Marchialli) the twin of king Louis XIV was captured by D'Artagnan and couldn't escape at all and the whole plan was destroyedIt's a shame to say that the cardinal was the real father of king Louis XIV and his twin and not king Louis XIII Leonardo DiCaprio - by any measure- is not suitable to perform the role of king Louis XIV and his twin Really I was shocked when I saw this movie which is by any measure not even close to the real great novel Sorry Leo *** Lo'ay",The Man in the Iron Mask
96,KurtTallCoolOne,All For One- One For All!,8,5 August 2021,"When this came out I didn't think I was going to like it. After seeing it I was hooked/watched it over & again/my VHS copy/soon I had to buy it in the DVD format. I'm a fan of English Royal history and although this film is of the French descent history, I am interested in all hierarchy of the Renaissance period -even if it is of France. The starring film actors played their roles great YET to this day I'm still not comfortable of Leonardo DiCaprio's position in this movie; they should've used another actor because he was a totally miscast/American accented character for the role of King Louis/Philippe & that shoe just doesn't fit. John Malkovichs' accent is fine here because he's always been a wonderful actor.",The Man in the Iron Mask
97,Lammasuswatch,Still one of my favourite escapist or inspiring films!,9,15 November 2014,"OK, if you're a stickler for accuracy in retelling French history, you're going to have problems with this film. The same goes for anyone who wants a script close to the content of Dumas' book. There are quite significant deviations from both.Having said that, the story that this movie DOES tell is logically consistent, satisfying and inspiring within itself. (And actually possibly an improvement on Dumas' last Musketeers novel, which rather gets lost along its way at times. And isn't exactly history either!)In fact, the first time I saw this movie on its cinema release I rated it as one of my favourite films, and it still is one of my favourite escapist or inspiring movies. It was never going to be an award winner, or a ""most important story"" told in film. But the story does have a significant moral to it, there are 'journeys of discovery' made by various characters, the authentic music and settings are great, the acting (from such a skilled cast) is mostly excellent and the last 15 minutes are especially inspiring and heartstring-tugging.Of the principal actors, Gabriel Byrne and Jeremy Irons shine. They are totally convincing, with Byrne really showing his capabilities. And the pleasure of hearing Irons deliver his lines is almost worth the price of admission to any of his films. Depardieu is mainly the comic relief, but he does it well. Leonardo DiCaprio, who when this film was released was one of my least favourite actors of all time, pleasantly surprised me by showing that he could act after all, managing to convey two very different but related characters pretty convincingly. John Malkovitch I know as a great actor, but often in this film I found him the least convincing of any of the main characters, definitely the odd man out. Much more than DiCaprio, his broad American accent just doesn't seem to fit with all the other surroundings. Or was it because he seemed to be half-asleep when delivering some of his lines?Other reviewers have similarly talked about the weird mix of accents, with supposed French characters voicing British, American and rather pronounced Franglais accents. It was only distracting for me after several viewings - I don't particularly recall this on my first viewing, which left me enthralled. For all except perhaps devoted linguistic pedants the willing suspension of disbelief should suffice, and the accents question certainly doesn't detract from letting good actors tell a good story. The Musketeers are supposed to represent an inspiring ideal of loyalty to one another, and to an ideal France in the form of its King. This film certainly expresses the disappointment of many of the people already with the excesses and abuses of royalty and nobility which would lead to the French Revolution about 125 years later. Athos voices the common dream, ""...that one day we would finally be able to serve a king who was worthy of the throne"". Unfortunately, few of the kings of France up to this point (and beyond) would qualify for this description. Nor, in reality, would Louis XIV despite the feel-good voice-over at the end.But the real history is not the point. Did you worry about the reality of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""? Real truths about the human condition are told in fiction, rather than non-fiction. And by the last ""All for One, One for All"", most viewers will be moved and wanting to cheer along with the Musketeers.",The Man in the Iron Mask
98,LTripp,This should be on the list of the 100 best movies of the 20th Century,10,17 February 2003,"I saw this movie in the Theaters when I was nine. It took a while to understand the whole story, it's very complicated. But I loved it right away. It has not one, but five great performances, six if you call Leonardo DiCaprio's double for playing two roles. Leonardo is great as the spoiled, selfish, and wicked King Louis XIV, who doesn't take care of his people and plays a part in all the deaths in the film, and as Phillippe, the king's tender and sweet natured twin, who spent six years in prison in an Iron Mask and does not now why till he is rescued by Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, (""The Three Musketeers"", brilliantly played by John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, and Jeremy Irons) and then must take his brothers place as king. Gabriel Byrne plays the noble D'Artangan, who was once one of ""The Four Musketeers"", and is a good man but is loyal to the evil king for a reason that we don't know until the end and I won't give away. Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, John Malkovich is passionate all through the movie, Gerard Depardieu is touching, lovable, and funny, Jeremy Irons is noble and wise, Gabriel Byrne is so good. Other good performances by smaller roles are Anne Parillaud as the Queen Mother, Peter Sarsgaard as Athos's romantic son Raoul, who dies a tragic death towards the beginning, Judith Godreche as his fiance, Christine, who is horribly seduced by the king, not knowing he was responsible for Raoul's death, and Edward Atterton as D'Artangan's noble lieutenant. My guess is that the book is very different, same with ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" as a film. ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was probably made to look more of an exciting epic than the book but the Drama is there. This is a must see film. If I could I would switch it's popularity, with DiCaprio's much more popular film ""Titanic""",The Man in the Iron Mask
99,addick-2,fun!,6,5 February 1999,"My advice to anybody watching this film is to just sit back and allow yourself to be carried away. Don't allow yourself to get hooked up worrying about the historical accuracy, the faithfulness to the book, the acting of Mr DiCaprio or the triteness of the dialogue. Life is too short to worry about such matters. This is a good story, well paced, well photographed and well performed. Sure the history is all over the place, the acting is laughable at times and the ending is corny but the same can be said about the Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn and that remains one of the greatest movies ever made. I am sure that there is a place for an historically perfect faithful adaptation of the Dumas original but I bet that it will not be half as much fun as this is.",The Man in the Iron Mask
100,innersmiff,A tad ridiculous but some honest fun,6,13 August 2009,"A short review.This film needs to be looked at again, not as a period epic but as some good, honest entertainment. A ""swashbuckler"" in the true sense of the word, 'The Man In The Iron Mask' is worth a look.If you can believe the premise that the King Louis has a secret twin you're half way to enjoying this film. Obviously the all-star cast is a huge plus. Irons, Depardieu and Malkovich are awesome as usual and Di Caprio is decent. Do not expect a believable story because you will be disappointed.It works best as a fairy tale and is fairly enjoyable if you watch it with that frame of mind.",The Man in the Iron Mask

This movie had no action, no excitement and  no reason to be made...except possibly to cash in on Leonardo DiCaprio's popularity from ""Titanic."" This movie was not only a waste of time, but a waste of some really first-rate actors such as John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons. I haven't read the book but am encouraged to note in other negative reviews that the movie is nothing like the book (so what else is new?) so maybe reading the book will make me forget about this awful film. I'm amazed to read that other people out there (or possibly androids who have not been programmed to recognize the difference between good and bad films) actually liked this snore-filled cure for insomnia. If someone thinks this movie is good (or worse yet, great) I'd hate to see what movies they hate! I hate this movie & so should everyone else! If you want to see a REAL action film, try ""The Three Musketeers"" (1974) or ""The Four Musketeers"" - both based on the novel ""The Three Musketeers"" by Alexandre Dumas, who also wrote ""The Man in the Iron Mask"".",The Man in the Iron Mask

The direction, the pacing, the romance, the sword-play are all dull. We don't get involved enough into the musketeers and their motives, because the director doesn't care enough about them. He doesn't put enough heart in the action and doesn't inspire strong performances from some of the greatest actors working today.Instead of wasting time on this boring remake, rent ""The Three Musketeers"" from 1973.

104,AurumStarFinder,More than expected,7,2 January 2006,"Any weird stalker-like ppl who have been reading some of my comments will know that I'm no fan of Hollywood, or practically anything made in the West. There are a few truly brilliant exceptions, made by some very talented film-makers, and The Man In The Iron Mask is not one of them... but I will admit that this was worth watching.This Christmas TV hasn't been that great: I remembered being glued to my armchair in 2004, there was so much good stuff on. There has been some good stuff this year but not a great deal of it. I missed Babe :-( and I can't stand Shrek (I love the ""really really"" line at the end but that's it, Donkey's so infuriating I hate it). I've seen MITIM before, years ago and would not have minded seeing it again, and I'm glad I taped it.Its nothing special, but it is good fun. The characters are hilarious, moving and most importantly interesting, the plot - though predictable - keeps your attention, the script is well written and often very funny, and considering that the four musketeers aren't exactly young anymore the action is pretty impressive.Most of the time I can't stand Leo DiCaprio, he's too... well, pretty is the only word I can use, but there's something I don't like about his face, so he makes a good Louis as his spoilt arrogance goes well with his beauty. Personally I think he should play more bad guys. Depardieu is brilliantly funny as Porthos, Malkovich is excellent as angry rebellious Athos, Irons is perfect as witty Aramis and Byrne is great as secretive repressed charming D'Artagnan.Worth seeing if you want something light, fun and entertaining. I've never read Dumas' book, I'm sure its an excellent read, though I hear that this movie is far from being called an adaptation, so better to watch it in its own right without a care for literature or history.

I would mention Irons and Depardieu first because they are just great.  I suppose Depardieu has performed in comic roles before but I don't recall them and so was quite pleased and amused with his grace and charm in such a role.  Irons is imposing and has more gravitas that anyone else in the film.  Byrne is strong and a pleasure to watch. These top performers take this material and make it delightful.  DiCaprio is a talented young man, I suppose, but my personal demographics are in the periphery of his fan base (wrong sex, wrong age).

108,moviefan2k4,The Adventure Continues...,8,11 September 2005,"Leonardo DiCaprio, John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, and Gerard Depardieu display the continuation of a legendary tale known as ""The Three Musketeers"".The year is 1662, and Louis XIV, the King of France, has become a cruel and heartless heir to the throne. He seduces young women galore, only to discard them at a moment's notice. He abuses his power, ordering that spoiled food be given to the people, instead of the fresh amounts being reserved for the French Army. The citizens of France riot in the streets, and aging heroes Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan have long since parted ways.Aramis is now a priest, seeking retribution for his sins. Porthos, ever the womanizer, has grown old and fears becoming useless. Athos lives peacefully with his son Raoul, and D'Artagnan has become a pained-but-loyal servant to a King unworthy of the title or the glory.But when Louis commits an unthinkable crime by sending Raoul to the front lines to die so he may court the man's fiancé Christine for himself, Aramis hatches a plan to restore the honor of France...by replacing its king with another. Locked deep in the dungeons lies a prisoner with no name, known only as the Man in the Iron Mask.Six years earlier, this man was condemned to life in prison by King Louis XIII, for one reason alone: his face was that of Louis XIV himself, in fact a twin brother. Made to disappear for the sake of peace for France, but imprisoned by the elder King for fear of discovery, this twin has never known why he was condemned...until now. Trained by the aging Musketeers in an elaborate deception, the man known as ""Phillipe"" replaces his brother, but is soon caught in the crossfire when the plan backfires, pitting friends, comrades, royalty, and devotion against each other in a battle for the honor and integrity of France.",The Man in the Iron Mask

As a three musketeers' fan I was very pleased to see it in theaters back in 98. I was only 10 and I remember the huge hype around this movie back in those days, specially because of Dicaprio.I was stunned by the magic of this movie, it's music, it's inspiring story and by the romantic adventure swashbuckler tone . Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job in dual role and the four musketeers are tremendously very well portrayed by Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne. I think Byrne emulates D'Artagnan as no one has ever done before.Anne Parillaud and Judith Godrèche are also very impressive in their roles.It's a swashbuckler in it's true essence and that is what a musketeers' movie should be. It was shot in France and the gorgeous sets gave the necessary and rigorous feel of the17th century.I know Alexandre Dumas' works very well and I understand when some people say that is not like the book. In fact this movie is based in a small portion of ""Le Vicomte de Bragellone"", the last adventure of the musketeers.In my view it doesn't have to be like the book and I really don't care if it differs if it's stays true to Dumas vision. This movie stays true to Alexandre Dumas. It's about honor, friendship, justice and love.All in all, it's a great classic and I dare to say that this is the ultimate musketeers' movie.

I mean, what happened? He's usually so good! Even in his earlier roles when you could tell his acting was not as good because he didn't have as much experience and maybe hadn't fully found his voice yet, he was still at least fun to watch in movies. But in this movie I feel I could really take him or leave him, to be honest with you.

You can back it up if you need to catch the little history lessons this movie gives you along the way.

But when the chips were down they could still get it up (their swords, I mean).Regardless of your feelings for Leo D., this is a good story and it is well-acted. You will learn something about French history in spite of yourself. And you might possibly become a fan of Alexandre Dumas. I'm heading out to the library now to check out that book. More likely I'll get the audiobook and listen to it in the car.I'm a big fan of Gerard Depardieu, but he couldn't have carried this movie himself.

114,friedfysh,Criminally Underrated Musketeer Film,8,22 October 2005,"This film is one of my all time favourites yet for some reason it has received some very harsh reviews. I first saw the film when it was released in the cinema and loved it so much I went to see it again and have watched it on VHS and DVD countless times since. Firstly many thanks to Writer/Director Randall Wallace (the bloke who wrote Braveheart)for crafting such a compelling tale. In the film Leonardo DiCaprio (a fine actor who frequently suffers criticism for being pretty) plays King Louis XIV of France and his imprisoned twin brother Philipe. King Louis is a cruel tyrant who cares only for himself and not for his people. Retired Musketeers Athos, Aramis and Porthos hatch a plan to replace the King and try to enlist the help of their friend (and Captain of the King's Musketeers) D'Artagnan for their scheme. Unfortunately for them D'Artagnan feels it his duty to remain loyal to the King even though he recognises his failures and so he tries to prevent the Musketeers plan from coming to fruition. There are many interesting twists and turns as well as a clever revelation that I will not spoil here. The acting in the film is great. This being the best bunch of Musketeers ever assembled for a film in my opinion (Yes I've seen the Michael York/ Oliver Reed etc ones). Jeremy Irons has great presence as Aramis here leading the Musketeers. John Malkovich is good in the most sympathetic role I've seen him do as Athos. Gerard Depardieu seems born to play Porthos and lastly Gabriel Byrne fits the bill perfectly as a more mature D'Artagnan. I don't really have anything bad to say about this film, my only minor niggle is that there are some scenes I feel may have benefited from a larger budget. I always enjoy watching a good sword fight on screen and to be honest here you may not find anything in that way as thrilling as say, Gladiator but in my opinion this is the superior film of the two. If you haven't already seen The Man in the Iron Mask I suggest you rent it soon.All for one..",The Man in the Iron Mask

How wrong was I. whether it was the cast itself, or their annoyance with the ridiculous script and dialogue I can't tell, but this film is easily the worst stinker I've ever seen. Oh and an honorable mention goes out to Judith Godreche, whom I'd nominate for worst supporting actress ever.You see I enjoy films. I even enjoy bad films. Most of them. I thought Godzilla was supremely bad, but I enjoyed it. But this is one of those few films that I was just angry at having spent money on. So far there's only 4 other films that has happened with for me (Asterix & Obelix Contre César, The  Avengers, The Runaway Bride and The messenger: The Story Of Joan Of Arc), so for your mental health avoid this (and the others mentioned) AT ALL COST",The Man in the Iron Mask
116,benzene,Very disappointing considering what it could have been.,4,12 September 1999,"I can't say that this was a really bad movie, but I have to say that I was disappointed considering the quality of the cast.  Sad to say, I think the story was not the problem with the movie (obviously, it has been done before and done much better), but rather the actors and acting were.I must take exception with some of the other reviewers; I think John Malkovich's performance was dismal.  He shouldn't have been in this movie at all.  Gerard Depardieu was not given anything to work with; perhaps he should have had Malkovich's role.  Jeremy Irons, obviously a fine actor, chose (if he in fact chose it himself) a completely wrong attitude for the role.  The three of them seemed totally uninvolved in the story, and had virtually no emotion at all.  Even when his son was killed, Malkovich merely goes through the motions, not displaying the least amount of real passion. His vow of vengeance rings completely hollow.The movie is saved from being bad by three performances -- actually four, but by three actors.  DiCaprio, in the dual role, rises above the dismal acting of most of his supporting cast to give two solid performances.  But the movie is completely stolen by Gabriel Bryne, who gives the best performance I've ever seen him give (indeed, I think it might have been award-winning in a better film), and Anne Parillaud, as the mother forced to choose between the son she raised who is a monster and the one she abandoned who is good.

The 1970's Three and Four Musketeers were so true to the spirit of Dumas' work, it is sad to see this awful departure from his excellent novel. The attribution to Dumas in the film should have read:  Using a title of a novel by Dumas and some of the same character names in that novel, but bearing no resemblance to any aspect of his works beyond that.

As I said, I honsetly think it is one of his best roles, up there with Arnie in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Frank in Catch me if You Can and Amsterdam in GONY.As for the film as a whole, well if you just go with it, and don't dwell on the flaws, it's pretty enjoyable really! I can't help but like it in spite of the bad bits.7/10 - Would be less, but I just love Phillippe. Awwwhh!!!",The Man in the Iron Mask
122,sredsha,Good Movie,8,29 September 2012,"I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie.I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast.Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.",The Man in the Iron Mask

The scenes of the King's palace are sumptuous!  My only quibble is with Dicaprio - as Phillipe he was excellent, but his portrayal of Louie was somewhat weak. Leo has a hard time being truly cruel - perhaps he will grow into it.

God forbid he should screw with the plot of a film that's been, in one form or another, done about five times.  *sigh*  Filmgoers of the world, you never cease to amaze me...Anyway, I thought this film was very well-done.  I know very little about the actual history of the setting, but at least it's clear to all involved that this film was based on a work of _fiction_ by Dumas.  The characters are archetypes, but they are, IMO, appropriate.  Once again, I find it amazing that people would complain about the depth (or lack thereof) of the characters in tMitIM.  This is the guy who made ""Braveheart"", people. Greatly exaggerated characters, anyone?  Louis is pretty much unredeemably evil.  D'Artagnan is endlessly loyal and hopeful.  Phillipe is _all_ good.

I've avoided this movie for a long time, but I figured now I was in the perfect mood for it. Thought I'd probably even end up loving it. Hey, with that cast, how could you go wrong? All of the characters lines were delivered flat. Each of these great actors who have given so many great performances, in this movie, failed miserably, and one cannot help but see the mark of a terrible director marring their good talents.

I've never seen more poorly choreographed sword fighting in my life!  Not just that, the screen writer totally cut the original story to pieces!  I have to ask myself whether they even read the book.  Sure, Aramis was the Vicar General of the Jesuits, but they were religious men, not assassins.  And Athos, some poor retired musketeer living in a small apartment? Athos was a wealthy Count who lived in the country and had tons of servants.  Of course, they had to make the Raoul and Louise (her real name in the book)  out to be some happy couple who were torn apart by the king.  Louise herself was the one who went after the king really, and Raoul, devastated, went and got himself killed charging a line of muslim riflemen.  What's with the love affair between D'Artagnan and Anne of Austria.  The haughty creature would hardly ever condescend to speak to D'Artagnan in the books, yet they tried to make D'Artagnan the father of Louis XIV.  I have, in fact, barely touched the surface of all the differences between the movie and the book.  My advice, if you want a far better story, go pick up The Three Musketeers, read all five stories and get a far better idea of what great heroes they were instead of watching this silly story.",The Man in the Iron Mask

The plot is wonderful, the acting perfect, the costumes are beautiful as are the locations and sets, the whole thing is great! The story is well told and intriguing, keeping you interested through the whole film. And I loved some of the unexpected plot twists, especially near the end. WARNING BIG SPOILERS HERE The fact that D'Artagnan loved Queen Anne and that King Louis and Philippe were his sons, the was a great idea! I didn't like D'Artagnan dying at the end, that was really sad but Leonardo Dicaprio gave an amazing performance in that scene so it wasn't all bad. Also that they put Louis in the mask after, I thought that was a little cruel for good guys to do. I mean he was evil and everything but still, almost no one deserves a fate like that. But I guess he got a pardon later so... END OF SPOILERS Anyway as for the leading man, I think this was one of Leonardo Dicaprio's best films. He was perfect in playing both the spoiled brat Louis and the kind, oppressed Philippe. His performance was, I think, the best part of the film. The scenes where the twins are together was an example of some amazing filming. The two Leos fit perfectly, it was like it really was twins instead of the same actor! Jeremy Irons was really good as Aramis and I loved Gabriel Byrne's D'Artagnan too! All in all a great film. Bravo! Encore!",The Man in the Iron Mask

135,FZ-FX,And if only he kept the mask on...,5,1 May 2005,"I've always had a soft spot for a great period piece. A well made historical drama should be able to suck the viewer in, make them feel a part of the era the film depicts. Disney's ""The Three Musketeers"" was not one of my favorite historical pieces. The juvenile plot and idiotic one-liners made Dumas' epic adventure into the standard kid friendly crap that Hollywood seems to pump out in great volume nowadays. That said, I was more than a little intrigued when I heard of ""The Man in the Iron Mask"", another adaptation of a Dumas book that would be given a more serious treatment than its predecessor. With a great story and stellar cast, they couldn't go wrong, could they? Unfortunatally, the actual adaptation is far less compelling than the concept. A feeling of unevenness lingers through the whole film. At times the drama is simply overbearing and bogs down what is supposed to be an epic adventure. Little tension or suspense is ever felt on screen, and the sparse action scenes do little to invigorate the viewer. Instead of being exhilarating and inspirational, the climax comes off like a bad cliché and takes away any emotional effect that the crew intended. The characters themselves provide other problems, in particular DiCaprio's portrayal of the royal brothers. To his credit, he plays both roles quite well: Louis as the spoiled, selfish and obnoxious king, and Philippe as the insecure, innocent and passive prisoner. This is another major flaw of the film: for an adventure picture, the protagonist/antagonist are just boring. We have a villain who doesn't so much need to be defeated as he needs a spanking, and a hero who isn't so much heroic as he is meek. Like DiCaprio, the rest of the cast gives good performances, but none of them really amaze. So what we have is an adventure film that isn't really adventurous and a historical drama that seems over-dramatic and sentimental. At times entertaining and even potent, but overall poorly executed. As crazy as it may sound, I think I'd have to consider the swashbuckling camp of ""The Three Musketeers"" over this film.",The Man in the Iron Mask
136,wizard-7,Old fashioned movie for old fashioned viewers. Great!,10,15 September 1998,"Movie reviewers seem to vie with each other for the most clever comments.  One said DiCaprio was the ""golden haired buoy"" of Titanic. That reviewer didn't like ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" He probably didn't like ""Casablanca"" either. Once I got past the opening scene between Porthos and Athos (with the flatulence and mammaary glands) I couldn't find much wrong with the film. I've seen over 10,000 and own 2500, including this one. Perhaps it's an old man's fancy, but old-fashioned approaches to old-fashioned material sits very well with me.",The Man in the Iron Mask
137,PhilipV,Under-performance of the Decade,1,26 February 1999,"Given the presences of J. Malkovitch, G. Depardieu and J. Irons, I expected an enjoyable Musketeers movie.  Instead this was a film I had to endure to reach the credits.  This has to be the most disappointing movie I have seen in the past few years.  The above actors appeared to be ""sleep acting"" and L. DiCaprio was annoying and all around pathetic.  If you want to see a musketeers movie, it is not possible to find a worse choice than this film.

The most convincing parts of the film are the acting of the supporting characters (notably Byrne, Malkovich and Irons) and the musical score.Certain scenes involving the older stars were some of the most powerful and compelling I have ever seen, particularly the one in the tomb where they discuss their plot to replace the king.The film does not rely too heavily on the swashbuckling appeal of the musketeers, but rather on the development of individual characters and the relationships between them.It is DiCaprio's best performance, though I admit that that is not saying much and his performance is nothing on that of the older men.The plot is slightly unbelievable in places but if this and possible historical inaccuracies are overlooked, this is a very good film.",The Man in the Iron Mask

One thing for sure - if you know the book and want to imagine what the characters look like - this is the right thing to watch. At least D'Artagnan is the best choice along with the one played by Mikhail Boyarski. It's really fancy to watch this film a lot of times and not to get bored.

The end ( although quite obvious ) is a tremendous climax. Come on people, do you not feel just energised watching that? Watch it for the end alone. It makes you feel so good. The music may not suit the film much ( being synthed in a period film ) but it makes it feel so exciting. It is a great achievement.It's not all brilliant obviously.

The reason I think it got such low ratings is because Leo was the star. I personally have nothing against the kid so I was able to see the film with a clear head. The twist was just thrilling. Although for the people who think the movie was a total flop, I would say they have reason to believe so. The uncanny show of bravery from the revitalized musketeers was stunning - in a confusing way. I thought that walking through bullets was to be left to the 'terminators'.

I'd have sent it back to the editors.. the timing is terrible, in the action scenes particularly. Go see this on a rainy day with very low expectations and maybe it'll be ok?

Lee D. on the other hand.... well, what can I say? He downplayed both characters, with Philippe is was immensely effective, with LouisXIV a travesty of performing. The mask was perhaps the most attractive bit of metal put together in any movie version. Besides the initial appearance, it looked the most ""functional.""

146,Lagniappe,"THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK: The GOOD, The BAD and the UGLY.",8,16 August 2000,"Okay, I am not going to claim that this was the best movie of all time - but I think some are not willing to give it a chance because it stars ""flavor of the month"" Leo Dicaprio.  Indeed, I too was reluctant to watch it for that very reason. Fie on me! I missed a great film on the big screen due to my own prejudices.  There is nothing ""cool"" about being closed minded.THE GOOD: Excellent cast. This is definitely a movie about ""characters."" Some have complained that the film was overly long, but in my opinion it was time well spent in fully developing the characters.  What fascinates us here are the people involved, the players upon the stage. The Musketeers in particular are able to convey a depth of temperament and personality that is refreshing. The chemistry between them is ""magnifique,"" and I found their motivations both believable and compelling. Some of the scenes between Irons, Malkovich, Byrne and Depardieu are a study in the nuances of human interaction. Leo does a wonderful job of portraying the vulnerability of young Phillipe, though his Louis is not quite as convincing, in my opinion.Plot. I know some have complained about the lack of historical accuracy in this film, but one must remember, Dumas himself was playing around with history in his novel. Accept it as a work of fiction and enjoy it as such. The plot was filled with political intrigue, most of the major characters burdened with personal secrets that slowly get revealed during the course of the film. This movie does deviate from Dumas' book quite a bit, so if you expect the film to follow his vision you will be disappointed. However, Dumas' rendition has been filmed before - this new adaptation allows for a provocative plot twist which I felt added tension and interest. Accept this version on its own terms and I hope you will find it as engaging as I.The scenery. Beautiful location shoots and lovely costumes, plus a certain realism of having some of the clothing, sweat stained, mussed and torn when appropriate.Music.  Marvelous score which well suited the action and emotions being depicted upon the screen.THE BAD: Accents! There is no consensus here! We have English, Irish, French and American accents all thrown together in an uneasy mix. It is distracting... and though I love Depardieu's portrayal of Porthos - it took me five viewings of this movie to finally be able to understand his every line!Another pet peeve - mispronunciation of names. No one can seem to decide how to pronounce ""D'Artagnan,"" ""Athos"" or ""Porthos."" There should have been agreement on something this basic. Even worse, sometimes the same character pronounces the names a multitude of ways!The unmasking.  After six years in the mask, Phillipe's face should have shown some evidence of his mistreatment... a little acne, perhaps?  Just a small nitpick.Flat delivery of lines.  Various of the main players use little intonation, resulting in a wooden delivery of some lines - However, since they were still able to convey a great deal of emotion through gestures and expression, I didn't find this overly bothersome.THE UGLY: A bull's eye view of Depardieu's naked rear end. :)Finally warning:  Despite being considered an ""action"" film, TMITIM is really more of a drama.  It deals more with people and plot than sword play. There are some good action sequences, but swashbuckling sword fighting does not drive the film, so if this is all you are interested in, this film might not be the one for you.Overall, an entertaining film, and certainly worth viewing.It's on my ""favorites"" list.One for all and all for one!",The Man in the Iron Mask

I know there are critics who say the Di Caprio's acting skills weren't the best but I thought he played the whiny, spoiled, self-centered King to perfection. The on location settings, the comic repartee' of the three aging musketeers, the grandeur of the palace, all make for a sweeping tale of adventure and excitement that's sure to entertain one for an evening.

I thought Leonardo DiCaprio handled his dual role quite well; unlike Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons, who all have and bring a special magic to their performances, Leo still effectively conveyed the differences in his characters, not only in tone and affect, but in the way he was able to transform his eyes from the ""sad puppy"" eyes of Phillipe to the cold, steely eyes of Louis.>I found the story very interesting (not having read the novel first, I wasn't thrown off by the relationship between D'Artagnon and Queen Ann) and the scenerey & costumes were wonderful. I loved the hairstyles on Aramis, Athos and Porthos, but thought D'Artagnon's hairstyle (severely parted way over on one side of his head) was very unflattering.The music was so moving that I actually bought the soundtrack, which I've never been inclined to do as a result of a movie...",The Man in the Iron Mask
157,admarple,Potential for greatness... but no,6,30 March 2013,"A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean ""not explicit"") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point.

I would also say that Jeremy Irons,John Malkovch, and Gerard Depardieu worked really hard too. They are excellent actors and very interesting to watch.

DiCaprio managed to sound like he was from New Jersey.Other than that, it was not a bad flick. Most of the actors worked well together. The character Porthos was especially engaging. I'd recommend seeing the film, though I'd have to say that it is less of a ""film"" than it is a ""movie,"" meaning that it is less art than entertainment, a sort of a 17th Century Western/James Bond blend and not to be taken too seriously.

The biggest mystery (which has been discussed in innumerous other comments) is - how could these great actors end up in this trashy B-Movie ? Did they read the script before signing the contract ? Were they forced to do it ? Maybe the producers kidnapped their children, or they owed the Mafia some money - just my guess... Seldom have I seen a movie where the dialogues are so full of clichés that you can actually figure out before what the actors are going to say. Just take a second to find out what the most pathetic, unbelievably stupid thing is you can think of and - KAZAAM - someone will say it in this movie.

I watched the first five minutes, got bored, and turned it off. I just watched it for the first time and it was better than i expected. The acting was great, and there were times where my heart was pounding. The only reason i watched it was because my friend was throwing a party, and she wanted to see if could bring any movies, so i read off all the movies i had. When i mentioned ""The Man in the Iron Mask"", she asked me if i had ever watched it, and i said no. She told me that i had to watch it, and then her sister got on the line and told me i had to watch it, so i did. It was a great movie. The costume and set are great. And the film really captures all the emotion. I recommend this movie.

People seem to prefer the original because it's more a swashbuckler movie than the remake is. The remake, however, is truly a feast for the eyes. Just look at the sumptuous costumes, the fabulous sets - Queen Anne's mourning dress of elegant black and the various rooms in the palace are prime examples.The Man in the Iron Mask also carries enough emotional weight to touch the emotional core. In the end, this is a tragic story and I can't see how anyone could say that it isn't. The love affair between Queen Anne and D'artagnan, D'artagnan's death at the end, Christine's suicide - build a swashbuckler with that material alongside Dumas' story of how the Musketeers decide to exchange the corrupt King Louis for his twin brother who has languished inside the titular iron mask to prevent his identity from discovery.This is only a brief review, only the tip of the iceberg of what I could say.

172,kealyd,Typical Hollywood fare,4,29 March 2005,"Variously uninspired, overblown and mawkish, and thoroughly predictable. Each actor seems to be in a different film--be it romantic epic, slapstick comedy or overblown family drama. As expected, Leonardo DiCaprio as Louis XIV/Philippe is entirely inappropriate for the part, intended to drag in hordes of young girls to see a film they otherwise wouldn't look twice at, given the general calibre (and age) of the rest of the cast. Only Jeremy Irons as the pious Aramis and Gabriel Byrne (who cannot quite suppress his surly Gaelic growl for love nor money, it seems) as the fiercely loyal D'Artagnan manage to conjure any measure of gravitas. I am as willing to suspend my disbelief as the next person, given a decent yarn and spirited performances, yet the colourful menagerie of modern accents, especially American (DiCaprio and Malkovich in particular), abounding in the 17th century Parisian court never failed to jar me out of what turned out to be rather a waste of two hours.It's already been mentioned by several other reviewers, but the final preposterous scene where the Musketeers valiantly (and suicidally) charge face-first into a battery of musket-fire and emerge none the worse for it just nails the lid on the proverbial coffin--especially when one of the leads, figuratively tossing Dumas' novel out of the window, stamping on it and setting fire to it, promptly expires from what is apparently a flesh wound to the shoulder seconds later. There are a handful of equally ridiculous little incidents scattered throughout the film that are far more likely to elicit a derisive scoff than an awed gasp. When D'Artagnan, lingering beneath the Queen Mother's window, contemplatively fingers a red rose before riding off to probable death, I half expected him to fling it with unerring accuracy and have it land neatly in her hair, or something similarly ludicrous. Another scene is an instructive lesson in crowd control: simply wow the rioting mob with a bit of implausible swordplay and they'll all turn around and meekly shuffle back home.Typical Hollywood schlock: a waste of time, money and reputable actors. Take it as a sign that I've already run out of synonyms for 'ridiculous' in two short paragraphs. Watch if you absolutely must, but turn the sound off all the same.",The Man in the Iron Mask

This film offers a prime example of the man's inborn grasp of gut-wrenching hilarity dolled up as piously dull and historically ignorant entertainment. In other words for those willing to forget the serious intent of the movie it is a guaranteed laugh riot from the start to finish. This absurd remake reveals Mr. Wallace is not only a multi-talent-less director, writer, and producer, but he is also someone with an uncanny knack for transforming mature but nonetheless top talents  Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich in this case  into automaton-like hacks. To be fair, these otherwise fine actors must have been paid handsomely before they agreed to take part in such drivel even as they appear to be thumbing their noses at this inane production by reading their ridiculous lines ice cold as if off of a teleprompter. In truth the actors seem to be desperately holding back either tears of hilarity or tears of abject humiliation. Still, the real question here is this: does this man even know what a ridiculous hoot he has given birth to? The answer is: certainly not. In sum, you should spare yourself if at all possible. However, if you must indulge, then the best thing to do is to watch this defectively fitted costumed comedy with Mr. Wallace's senseless ""commentary"" turned on as background sound effect. I promise instant spasms of watery-eyed laughter as he piously defends the serious intent of his efforts. In all honestly, the clearest assessment of Mr. Wallace's version of the Man in the Iron Mask is best summarized early on in the film by the loud and resounding flatulence hilariously delivered by Mr. Depardieu's character.

I stopped for quite some time after finishing ""Twenty Years After"" and have only now started (forgive the spelling) ""Raul de' Bragellone"", the first of three making up ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". Well I've made it through the first 120pages and the book seems to stay true to the series in character developement and style, so I think I'm qualified to make my Critique. First of all I'd like to simply state that Gabriel Byrne and Jeremy Irons are incredible and perfectly suited for the parts of D'Artagnan and Aramis. As for Deperdiu and Malcovich they don't seem to posses the right charisma for their roles. Athos is the wisest, bravest, and most reveried of the group apart from D'Artagnan, He is a Count with some of the highest decorations obtainable for anyone under the Kind himslef, including the Holy Ghost. He is quite bluntly Nobility. Porthos is strong, proud, and an excellent companion, also of modest nobility. He is not some bumbling, foolish, love-making, old fart. Nor is Athos some old, mentally unstable, unloyal, farmer. Athos would never dream of killing D'Artagnan, their friendship is unbreakable. D'Artagnan does not have an affair with the queen of France, he is in love with a servant of hers who is tragically murdered by poison in a convent. The movie seems to condesend to the general film audience-----Joe Movie-Goer and family will find this movie to be filled with family fun. The true Dumas fan will find the script quite flawed however. Anyway that's my rant, In all my 14 years of existence have I scene such a classic so brutally butchered into this condensed, unaccurate piece of filth. Dumas is most certainly rolling over in his grave. As for any pros, Good costumes, adequate fight scenes, and good acting on the parts of D'Artagnan and Aramis.

The dialogues are not very good (Or should I say bad?) and often very superficial (I hate this dialogue between Raoul and Christine... ""I love you."" ""And I love you, Raoul.""). So the movie is nice to watch but not great. And... It is my favourite movie! So why? Because Leo was great in it. I often heard even from other Leo fans that he was not bad enough as Louis. All I can say to them is read the book. You'll see that Louis isn't described as the typical onedimensional bad guy. In fact he's very similar to the Louis who Leo has played. I admit I was very surprised when I discovered this. I thought the book would present the king as cruel and heartless but it absolutly doesn't do it. So no one can blame Leo for not being bad enough as Louis because the only thing he did was playing the king how he's described in the book. BTW, I hate Aramis in the book.As Philippe Leo did a great job, too. You absolutly believe him that he was in prison for six years wearing an iron mask. Right after he was freed by the musketeers he's so shy and unsecure and then he gets his self-confidence slowly back but he's never a real tough guy. No wonder. Imagine, this man was arrested when he was just a teen. They put him into the mask and nobody told him why and then he suffered six years in prison. So he can't act like a tough hero.

Wouldn't one try to enjoy his freedom or at least get angry at Aramis who helped to put him in prison? After the guy took off his mask, the supporting actors' glances were like, yeah we see u and..... There was even a moment when Malkovich' sight was wondering around - wow, who edited the movie? Anyways, 3 out of 10 - is the max i can give.",The Man in the Iron Mask
197,catwomann2,I give it a perfect 10,10,11 May 2003,"I did not see this movie in the theater. I bought the video several months ago because I love period piece movies, and I like Leonardo DiCaprio.I finally watched it for the first time a few days ago, and I liked it so much I watched it four times in 24 hours. The acting was fabulous (and I don't give a whipstitch about the various accents), the scenery beautiful, the costumes exquisite, and the music divine. There was nothing I dd not like about this movie.I can't wait to get the DVD so I can hit repeat play and go to sleep and wake up to it.It is said that to read fiction, one must sometimes suspend belief. That can also be applied to watching movies. If you are looking for great acting, beautiful scenery, and a classic period piece, this movie is for you.Be willing to suspend belief and just enjoy watching 5 beautiful men. I did, and this is now one of my top 10 favorite movies.",The Man in the Iron Mask
198,d_nax,The Man in the Iron Mask,10,7 November 2010,"I was very happy that i watched this movie... While watching the movie you would see nice costumes, dancing, sword fights and some nicely made surroundings. Everybody has a long hair in this movie. Its a story about power, love and justice. The cast played their roles well. It was in the time of King Louis XIV of France and he is more interested in money and bedding women. You will also see the destruction of a such selfish king when he tries to steal an engaged woman from a soldier and use his power to do it and as he rules the people are starving outside his gates. The movie will bring you to a nice story that will also give a very valuable lesson. If you like musketeers and swords fights this movie is for you... Don't waste your time if you haven't seen this movie, watch it immediately... I was very entertained. It would be very nice to have a DVD of this movie in your collection.",The Man in the Iron Mask
199,awoodenmd,Excellent remake of a wonderful story.,10,8 September 2003,"I first read this story in high school.  I loved it then and love it now. I wasn't certain I even wanted to see this (might tarnish my feelings about the book, right?). I'm really glad I did, though.  Byrne is absolutely wonderful as D'Artagnan, the costumes are sumptuous, and the settings gorgeous.  I wouldn't let my kids (age 7 and 9) watch it just yet, though, as there are some scenes (especially the seduction of Christine and the final battle) which I don't feel are appropriate for them.  A thoroughly enjoyable swashbuckling good time.",The Man in the Iron Mask
200,katemonster9,If Only They Could Re-Cast the Lead Role...,6,11 November 2006,"This movie had a lot to offer. Great score, costumes, dialogue, scenery. And most of the actors were magnificent, especially Gabriel Byrne.There was one very notable exception. Leonardo DiCaprio was appalling in his performance as both Louis and Phillipe. His emotions seemed studied and fake, his manner immature, and every time he opened his mouth or posed for a dramatic facial expression I was pulled right out of the moment.Sadly, I think I could've really liked this movie. If only the casting director hadn't buckled under the studio pressure to cast this flash-in-the-pan actor (who by the way, at the end of the day is neither very attractive or masculine).So close. Yet so far away.",The Man in the Iron Mask
201,lils_fury,It's okay,6,1 June 2006,"I like this movie, but not for what it is. Vicomte Raoul should have been a bit older, considering he was a teenage in the novel 10 years later. That novel was at least 20 years away from The Man in the Iron Mask. The entire cast is way to young. Every Musketeer should be over 60. Athos is a supposed to be a Count, Porthos is a Barron. The two romance novels leading to this one explain everything. Before someone becomes a fan of this movie, they should read Dumas' writings. Not to mention that Raoul's love affair was not named Christine.Anyway, at least either way we look at it Leonardo's character dies a horrible death. Both Louis and the man in the mask. This was based upon a true story, at least the characters. There was a man in a mask at this time, and the Musketeers existed. Alexandre Dumas wrote these stories from the information he got from his uncle Napoleon. He wrote some of his works while sitting on D'Artagnan's actual grave.",The Man in the Iron Mask
202,mjbeasty,ehh,4,24 November 2016,"It was an okay movie that flowed okay. There weren't too many low action points. It was just rather dragged out. Maybe they should have taken out the second captureand freeing of iron mask. Main thing that bothered me for the first sixty minutes was the different accents and dialects. Leo, the captain, and the three musketeers all have very different accents in ""Paris."" One out of the 5 was French. And I don't care if they were all mid-western American, but having one semi-french sounding guy makes it obvious that the other are not.Thanks",The Man in the Iron Mask
203,lupus9,The greatest film I ever watched,10,7 February 2005,"The greatest film I ever watched. The story is not the one Mr. Dumas wrote once - I nearly want to say : it is better. There are great actors (especially Gabriel Byrnes as D'Artagnan), wonderful costumes, an amazing scenery ... Very good plot. When I saw the film for the first time at the age of 15, I have been very struggled about the ending. I watched the film for so many times, I could not count, only to understand why there had to be a tragic ending. Today, I'm only fascinated of the scenery. Is this the life at the court in the days of the french absolutism? At the one hand, it seems to be so realistic. At the other hand, you really cannot believe in what is shown to you ...",The Man in the Iron Mask
204,nkm56,Loved it . . . One of my all time favorites,10,17 February 2005,"I don't know why I did not see the 1998 version of Man in the Iron Mask while it played in theaters. In a way I'm glad I didn't see it then  I surely would have embarrassed myself, because it would not have occurred to me that I would need a half-box of Kleenex at the end! I finally watched the movie in my own living room when it came to HBO several years ago, but while I enjoyed the movie at the time, it did not leave me with the urgent desire to see it again. However, I did watch the movie again recently, and now for some unexplainable reason, I can't seem to get enough of it. I have the DVD, and it is the movie I most often reach for on a quiet evening of lousy television.Those who are expecting a faithful adaptation of the book will come away sorely disappointed, and if that is their measure of the movie, they will do best to avoid this one. However, those who love the characters, who don't mind seeing new adaptations and interesting plot twists, and who love rich costumes and set designs will find this movie wonderfully entertaining. And that is what it is all about, isn't it? Entertainment.I have read many reviews regarding this movie, and am puzzled, even dismayed at times, by some of the criticisms levied at various aspects of it. Some people have complained about the dialogue in the movie, calling it ""flowery"", but truthfully I loved the fact that Randall Wallace did not modernize it. So many new films and TV series are ""dumbing down"" the dialogue of period pieces to make them more compatible with today's manner of speaking. I applaud Mr. Wallace for keeping the dialogue consistent with how it likely would have been spoken in the 17th century.Still others complained of the unlikelihood of all four Musketeers surviving a volley of musket fire during the final charge. If they had been watching properly, they would have noticed that the young Musketeers were turning their faces away, closing their eyes as they pulled the triggers. And after the first few shots, powder smoke begins to fill the corridor, obscuring their vision. So the lack of accuracy in their volley is adequately explained on more than one count. Moreover, if the critics had been watching more closely, they would have noticed that there are woundings - D'Artagnan is hit in the shoulder, Athos in the thigh. The other two are also limping, and the script confirms that all four are wounded in the barrage.As for the complaints that the four leads have four different accents, I did not find them distracting or annoying, as some have claimed. I expected it, since this is an International Cast, and with an International Cast, you get International accents.And speaking of the cast, I must say that in all the Musketeers movies I've seen, this is the strongest cast ever. The primary performers, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich, all turn in exquisite performances, and Leonardo DiCaprio is, in my opinion, convincing as Louis and Philippe, even though he is upstaged by the other four. Anne Parilloud is simply lovely as the Queen Mother, and the moments she shares with Byrne's D'Artagnan are some of the best in the film. The love scene between them, as brief as it was, is as beautiful as any I've ever seen (this coming from someone who is not a true fan of romance! I was left wanting more!). The music is brilliant and sets the mood perfectly for each scene. The wardrobe is exceptional, especially the black uniforms of the old musketeers.Particularly nice touches in this movie are the attention to detail: The roses left for the queen speaks as decisively of D'Artagnan's love for her as words ever could (And yes, I really liked the plot twist involving the twins' paternity); Philippe dragging his masked head back and forth over the grating in frustration while in prison; the unmasking of Philippe in a dark blacksmith's forge, his hair wrapped around his neck where, as it grew, it was unable to escape the confines of the mask; Lieutenant Andre's devotion to D'Artagnan throughout the film and the way he looks away when the king orders the volley, unable to watch his captain cut down; the rich, fancy costumes contrast the torn, sweat-stained clothing where appropriate.The movie is not without its faults, though. The first scene involving Porthos and Aramis, for example, contains some crude language regarding parts of both the male and female anatomy and Porthos's flatulence, both of which seemed out of place, and actually got the film off to a shaky start. The first time I watched it, I almost turned it off at this point. Another reviewer here commented on the bulls-eye glimpses of Porthos' naked rear end, and I am inclined to agree with that reviewer! While I'm sure some of Depardieu's fans loved it, the scene did nothing to advance the plot, in my opinion, and was something I could have lived quite happily without ever having seen. There is hardly an actor or actress out there these days that has not done a nude, but quite frankly, some things are just better left to the imagination. I'm smiling as I write this, but truly, the scene was unnecessary. Thankfully, there is a ""skip"" button on my DVD player! And yes, I do use it.Those few faults are forgivable when surrounded by so many other details that are so elegantly done. For me, it was a very pleasing movie experience, one I enjoy over and over again. Kudos to everyone involved. Now, if I can just convince Randall Wallace to release a director's cut version . . . .",The Man in the Iron Mask
205,Rvn1966,"Actors, not story!",8,30 March 2006,"The plot sounds pretty bad on paper: The Three Musketeers come out of retirement to save France by replacing the King with an impostor. This movie could very well be another dullsville story. However, the performances of Gerard Depardieu, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Bryne and John Malkovich save this potential clunker. These actors shine every time they're on screen. Depardieu is charming, Irons: dramatic, Bryne: tortured and Malkovich: intense. Together, all four save this movie and make it a guilty pleasure to watch over and over again. However not much is said for DiCaprio, unfortunately. He is merely eye candy for this piece and that's sad, considering he has so much potential.",The Man in the Iron Mask
206,damnreccaishot,Disappointment to Dumas,5,28 April 2008,"This movie, although interesting on its own, unfortunately does not do Dumas' novel any justice. First of all, D'Artagnan, who had supposed to have lost all interest in love affairs in his later years (due to a tragedy long ago), was made to be the Queen Mother's lover. I guess that was an interesting twist, but again, it was not very true to the novel. Too many things were changed (for example, the fact that everything was Athos' plan, and not Aramis', which makes no sense to me, since Aramis has always been the conspirator of the four). I think it's because I'm such an avid fan of Dumas that I found this movie quite disappointing since I have high expectations that they would have stayed true to the book.If that were the only problem, I'd have given this a fair 7 votes, but not only was it a bad adaptation, but it also had no technicalities. The pronunciations of their names were too widely differing (DiCaprio's pronunciation of ""Ay-thos, Por-thoes, Dar-tay-nyan"" was just too terrible, especially since the others pronounce it correctly), they had no detailed follow-up of French court etiquette, and had horrendous casting. John Malkovich definitely killed Athos' character. He didn't even bother faking a British accent to match along with his other comrades, making him stand out from the wrong reasons, and his acting wasn't so hot either. He was all over the place: he was either too over reacting, or too under-acting, if that's a word. I think Jeremy Irons, who plays Aramis (a part they made too insignificant), would have done better to be in that role. As for Gabriel Byrne, I would say he was okay, since he had that persona and charisma that I always imagined D'Artagnan would have. The only thing lacking was the humorous and witty air about him, since he portrayed him to be too solemn and grave, in my opinion. DiCaprio, on the other hand, I think did the best performance out of all, being able to capture both the bratty Louis and the goody-goody Philippe. This brings it down to a 4--although I got to say the fighting choreography was awesome swashbuckling, so it ups it to 5. It seemed like they used up all their resources into making sure the fighting scenes sold. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't.",The Man in the Iron Mask
207,leavittryanne,I was totally disappointed in this film,1,16 June 2005,"Now, seeing that I am a fan of the classic books written by Alexander Dumas, and enjoy a good movie, I had high hopes for this one. I must now tell you that those hopes were crushed when I watched this. It didn't even resemble the classic work of Mr. Dumas, in fact, he probably would have rolled over in his grave to see what they had done. The title is nearly the only thing that remains the same. The film makers relied heavily upon the use of nudity to try to make up for the lack of a good screen play. The acting was, to be fair, decent and the scenery was beautiful, so in my mind they wasted good acting and location on a terrible movie. Honestly, Dumas' book is very long, but that is no excuse for dragging his well know work through the proverbial mud.",The Man in the Iron Mask

209,aarong-53170,Avoid This Unless You're Forced to Watch It,2,3 November 2016,"Beautifully costumed and filmed with a great cast, locations, and set. Unfortunately the script was deliberately written to ruin the preceding, or many of the actors jointly decided to give some of the worst, or the worst performances of their careers. John Malkovich, who I""ve liked in virtually every other role I've seen him in, was particularly bad, with DiCaprio not far behind.Part of the problem with the script is it suffers from a frequent Hollywood ill; Theme Schizophrenia. Am I serious, adult, interesting, complicated, painful as one would think given the movies subject matter and events, ooooooorrrrrrr am I fun and funny while I deal with warfare, betrayal, pain, suffering, rage, death, etc? Treating such serious subjects as fun and funny (which they ARE NOT)usually ends in cartoonish buffoonery ala The A Team. This film is a particularly BAD example of Theme Schizophrenia. Treated as a straight up drama for adults ala Valkyrie or Saving Private Ryan......it may well have worked.",The Man in the Iron Mask

Even only a slight french accent would of been something, especially Leonardo DeCaprio. His non attempt to deliver any french accent as well as his acting ruined what could of been a great film. He delivered the cockiness of the king, but his acting was most effortless, like someone had interrupted his life to do this film. The backgrounds, costumes, storyline, and humor as well were wonderful. John Malkovich is a superb actor, but his attempt at a french accent was lacking as well.

I believe it got two thumbs up from all of them.This movie definitely gave me all the aspects of humor and adventure and a bit of romance. The tears that came for me at certain times was surprising for us all. I looked around and my friends, who NEVER cry in movies, all had eyes filling with tears. I swear I was sitting there clutching to the arm of one teammate the whole time. I felt the acting was amazing and definitely recommend it to anyone.",The Man in the Iron Mask
