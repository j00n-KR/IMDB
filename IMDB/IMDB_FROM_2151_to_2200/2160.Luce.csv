0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing motivation,6,16 December 2019,"Amy (Naomi Watts) and Peter Edgar (Tim Roth) are proud adoptive parents of Luce, a child refugee from war-torn Eritrea who has become a perfect teen. Amy is called into the school by Luce's teacher Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer). Luce had written a troubling assignment and she found illegal fireworks in his locker. He tells Amy that the teacher has a disturbing vendetta against him. Amy grows suspicious of Luce as more secrets are uncovered.The director and the actors are able to portray the teen drama. The lead's need for perfection is very compelling. It takes a long while to get a feel for this movie. Mostly, Luce remains an enigma until late in the movie. That's good but also problematic. In the end, the movie is able to give him motivation but it needs to make clearer the logistics of his work. As for the parents, I don't see why they don't talk to Luce plainly at the beginning. Tim Roth goes too hard too fast. Naomi Watts is the moral center for the audience until one surprise turn near the end. I don't know why that happens. I also don't see why a fire would end a career. A better turn and more matching one would be to plant a gun in her desk. The movie works in the space between belief and disbelief. Once that issue is settled, Luce needs to be revealed with more clarity.",Luce
1,nogodnomasters,Gotta have at least one Obama,8,18 August 2019,"Luce (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is from war-torn Eritrea. He was adopted at age 10 by an American couple who spent years in therapy with him and education. He attends Northen Virginia High School and is an exceptional student and also runs track. He has an antagonist in his teacher Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer) who wants the best for him, but places everyone in a ""box"" where they are stereotyped. Luce objects to being the good guy ay the expense of other students who do get the benefit of the doubt that he does. The tension between the two rises over the discovery of some fireworks, pot, and the misuse of a female student. The parents have to choose between the son they know and the one they suspect.The film was acutely interesting in asking questions about norms and expectations.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Naomi Watts, Marsha Stephanie Blake)",Luce

3,CinemaSerf,A bit too clever for it's own good?,7,11 November 2019,"Kevin Johnson treads the line between perfect student and perfect demon with some aplomb in this film. Naomi Watts and Tim Roth also provide a credible set of parents facing problems with both their (adopted) son and with their own relationship. Octavia Spencer stands out too - but I have to say, I don't find there to be much cohesion here. Certainly, the threads address issues of racial and gender stereotyping, but they don't intertwine in any particularly convincing way. I had to make quite a number of assumptions to make any sense of the ending - perhaps that was the plan - but it left me feeling a little dissatisfied, even frustrated. Maybe there is to be a ""Luce (ends) 2""?",Luce
4,evanston_dad,Clunky Screenplay,6,7 January 2020,"""Luce"" is full of ideas, some of them good ones, but all of them hampered by a didactic and clunky screenplay.""Luce"" clearly has plenty to say about race and privilege in America, and it wants to say it all. Whoo boy, does it. In the character of Luce, we have a young black man who feels suffocated by the burden of having to always be an example of what others need him to be. To whites he's the upstanding black man and representative of what blacks can achieve with proper support and grooming. To blacks, he's turned his back on his race. If he messes up, he reinforces stereotypes people have about black men. He can't win no matter what he does.In the characters played by Tim Roth and Naomi Watts, we have privileged white people who see in Luce what they need to see in order to feel better about themselves and their contributions to the black cause.In the character played by Octavia Spencer, we have a black woman who's suspicious of Luce and his intentions from the get go. Is she better able to see the truth because she's not blinded by liberal do-goodism? Or is she jealous of another black person's accomplishments when she feels stifled herself?These are all compelling characters and if nothing else the film certainly smacks of relevance. But the film tries to cover so many issues and so many characters and so many dramatic conflicts and it's all handled so awkwardly that the whole thing feels like a bit of a mess.Grade: B",Luce
5,phd_travel,Involving at first then a let down,6,17 November 2019,At first the movie is involving with the tense play of race and stereotypes. An adopted boy from Africa is a brilliant student. But his African American teacher suspects something isn't right about him. The actresses Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer are so likeable that you feel for each side.It's hard to discuss the movie without referring to the ending. It doesn't feel right that Luce would resort to such a psychopathic scheme because of what happened to his friend. So the big reason for the character's actions is insufficient.,Luce
6,deloudelouvain,There was material to make it a great thriller.,7,19 November 2019,"Luce is categorized in the drama genre and I guess that's correct even though there is an element of mystery and suspense. It's a slow build-up leaving the audience guessing who's telling the truth, trying to figure out what's really going on. Ultimately it could have been a good psychological thriller if that path would have been eplored. The beginning is a bit slow and the end is a bit disappointing as there was every chance to have a great ending scene. The cast is good, all actors did what they were supposed to do. Luce is a good movie but it could have been great.",Luce
7,blanbrn,"A film of stereotypes, appearance, race, gender, and wonder all try to tie into a point of view.",6,10 September 2019,"""Luce"" is one film that's hard to get a word on or can I say you call it as it's a challenge and after watching you ask who's right and who's wrong and really who is the bad guy and the good guy. It involves a well to do married couple Amy Edgar(Naomi Watts) and Peter Edgar(Tim Roth) who have adopted a black son from a war torn country called Eritrea and this boy is a talent both on the field and in the books. However things change when a wicked witch like teacher named Harriet Wilson(Octavia Spencer) makes a judgment on him after reading a school paper that he wrote.Really the film is back and forth as themes of gender, race, and thought all come into play as it proves many people always have stereotypes of others and that life and things are never what they seem or people and surprise often happen as no one can be trusted as truth is often hidden and life and people often surprise. Really this is one gripping drama that challenges thought and expands your mind as a viewer as you have to come up with your own way to call it.",Luce
8,MOscarbradley,One of the best films of the year.,9,24 July 2020,"""Luce"" is one of the best politically slanted thrillers of recent years. It takes potentially explosive material, (it's a movie about race but not in any conventional sense), and treats it with an intelligence rare in movies these days. Luce, (a magnificent Kelvin Harrison Jr.), is a high school student raised by an American couple, (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth, both excellent), after being rescued as a child from war-torn Eritrea. When he writes a controversial essay that advocates the use of political violence both his adoptive parents and his teacher, (Octavia Spencer, also magnificent), begin to wonder if Luce really is the boy they thought they knew.It's a film that sets out its arguments lucidly, (no pun intended), building tension slowly by showing what is said and what is left unsaid can so easily destroy lives when left unchallenged or misinterpreted. Brilliantly written by J.C. Lee, adapting his own play, and the director Julius Onah, superbly directed by Onah and beautifully acted by the six main players this is a film of ideas, again a rarity in mainstream cinema today, that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, the kind of film you take out of the cinema with you and talk about for days.",Luce
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Not for teacher.,6,10 November 2019,"Even if its conclusion, which is one of a possible two, retroactively makes the movie less interesting, it's undeniable that 'Luce (2019)' is an evolving and layered piece of work, one that keeps you guessing as to its (ultimately sort of disappointing) true nature. It's domestically enigmatic, heightened just enough to make its 'thriller' aspects work, and it revels in the kind of pseudo realism that keeps things grounded even when they threaten to get a little silly. It plays with themes of race, stereotyping, immigration, school security, gaslighting and revenge, balancing its disparate elements rather well and forming a cohesive narrative. Its ending is suitably subtle, quietly revealing the film's secrets while maintaining its ambiguous feel. The picture is intriguing in almost every aspect, really. It's well-crafted and confident; I can see how someone would love it. I don't, though. For all its merits, it's almost intangibly dull. This weird effect prevents any true engagement, leaving you teetering on the edge of boredom during most sequences. The scales aren't ever actually tipped but, despite some genuinely inspired work, the flick is never completely compelling. It doesn't really connect on an emotional level, I suppose. It's definitely a good piece, solid in almost every aspect. The one in which it isn't perhaps matters the most, though. I'm not saying it's bad; it's far from it. I just can't quite describe why it doesn't hit me the way it should (although, I've given it a good go). I guess it goes to show that ticking all the right intellectual boxes alone can't make for an entirely engrossing experience. 6/10",Luce
10,ThomasDrufke,The Truth Has Many Faces,9,31 August 2019,"A movie that challenges your mind and creates a discussion within yourself for at least a week? Yeah, I'd say that's a success. With Luce, director Julius Onah brings a fresh story to the big screen and one that doesn't necessarily have the answers for you. Instead, it provides a Gone Baby Gone style premise where you're legitimately not sure what the right move may be for the lead characters. With an all-star cast of Hollywood heavyweights in Drama (Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Tim Roth, and newcomer Kelvin Harrison Jr), I loved watching their performances unfold in front of us in which you're constantly on your toes as to which direction they are leaning to be morally right for Luce's position as an all star student who turned his life around after being saved from a war torn country. Thought provoking and timely, Luce is one of the best films of the year, and will hopefully be strongly considered come Oscar season.9.2/10",Luce

13,eddie_baggins,Some stunning acting turns ensure Luce is a gripping watch,6,30 March 2020,"Adapting his own play of the same name, playwright/screenwriter J.C Lee teams up with director Julius Onah to deliver a talk driven and character lead thriller that will most certainly get you talking afterwards but despite its weighty themes and controversial plot points, Luce may leave many cold come its closing credits as we are left too ponder many unanswered questions, that in some instances remain frustratingly unresolved.Collating a well-rounded cast that includes the always good Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Octavia Spencer and featuring a star-making turn from It Comes at Night actor Kelvin Harrison Jr as the titular Luce Edgar, Onah's film is the very definition of a slow burning affair as we are thrust into a seemingly small-scale school drama that slowly but surely moves towards a much larger issue in the lives of those it's affecting.The less known about Luce's plot developments the better but suffice to know that from Spencer's teacher Harriet Wilson concerned meeting with Luce's adopted mother Amy after she discovers a potentially dangerous item in Luce's locker following an alarm raising report his handed in to her, the film takes us on a ride that tackles issues of race, identity and stereotyping as we begin to understand more about each of the characters within Luce's world and what is motivating them to make life-changing decisions in light of alleged issues.Front and centre to all of this is Luce, a character that is incredibly hard to pin down, drifting from likeable star student to possible deviously motivated trouble maker and Harrison Jr wondrously plays with our emotions and feelings here as he brings this on paper perfect adoptive son to life.Watching Harrison Jr play off against Watts and Roth is a joy to behold, while his interactions with Spencer's nosey but well-meaning teacher is a huge reason why Luce is such a gripping film for a majority of its dialogue heavy runtime and for the most part Onah and his cast keep us on edge throughout as we try and predict just what will come out and who will play their true cards first.Unfortunately for the film, come the endgame you can't help but feel as though a little too much has been left only half-explored, there's a lot of themes, issues and ideas at play here and for a film that borders on a near two hour runtime, Onah and Lee had enough time to explore these to a more satisfactory level and the unsure nature of exactly who comes out of this film as the good and the bad makes us feel short-changed as bystanders, making the journey of Luce far more entertaining that its destination.Final Say -A uniquely constructed family/high school drama that explores more than its fair share of weighty themes, Luceis a tightly wound thriller with some great performances and ideas but not the final execution to make it the killer offering it could've been.3 bags of fireworks out of 5",Luce
14,Red-125,"You can take the boy our of Eritrea, but can you take Eritrea out of the boy?",9,2 September 2019,"Luce (2019) is a U.S. movie directed by Julius Onah. J.C. Lee wrote the original play and co-wrote the screenplay with Onah.Kelvin Harrison Jr. stars in the title role. Luce lived under ghastly conditions in Eritrea, until being rescued at age seven, and adopted by his U.S. parents at age 10. (Luce's parents are portrayed by Naomi Watts and Tim Roth.)Luce is--by any standard--a model student. He gets good grades, he's an athletic star, and he's liked and respected by students, teachers, and administrators .The only problem Luce faces is with his history teacher, Ms. Wilson.
(Brilliantly played by Octavia Spencer.) She appears to be angry at Luce, and possibly is carrying out a vendetta against him.The plot is complicated, with many twists and turns. I won't say more because it would reveal too much. You'll just have to see the movie to learn what happened. (Well, sort of what happened.)Watts, Spencer, and Roth are brilliant actors, and director Onah knows how to bring out the best in them. Kelvin Harrison Jr. is an experienced actor, although I'd never seen him in a film before. It's a bit of a stretch to accept him as a 17 year old, because he was 25 at the time. However, his work was so good that he was reasonably convincing as a high school senior.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It was adapted from a play, so director Onah had to ""open it up"" with outdoor scenes. However, that's just what directors do when the screenplay is based on a stage play. It will work fine on the small screen.Luce has a pretty good IMDb rating of 7.2. I think it's better than that.",Luce
15,paul-allaer,Intense drama and social commentary on race and perceptions,7,25 August 2019,"""Luce"" (2018 release; 109 min.) brings the story of Luce (pronounced ""loose""). a HS senior who was adopted a decade ago from war-torn Eritrea by a white couple. As the movie opens, Luce is giving a speech to the school body (students, teachers, parents). Afterwards he is congratulated by everyone. He seems to be the poster boy for racial advances. Then one day, his (African-America) history teacher calls in his mom, as the teacher is concerned about a paper written by Luce that seems to advocate violence, and moreover she found illegal fireworks in Luce's locker... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from (African-American) writer-director Julius Onah (""The Cloverfield Paradox""). Here he goes in a very different direction, as we get to know this HS senior who seems to be the perfect student, carefully protected and coached by his parents. But of course not everything seems the way it is. Given the plot-heavy nature of this film, I really don't want to say anything more. The film worked like an onion for me, carefully revealing layer upon layer as you yourself search for answers. The movie benefits enormously for a top-notch ensemble cast, none more so that Kelvin Harrison Jr. in the title role. Harrison brings the Luce character with restraint and a quiet confidence. Naomi Watts as Luce's mother is her usual, and I swear she hasn't aged a day it seems in the last 20 years. Tim Roth is the dad, and Octavia Spencer is the history teacher who may or may not be on to something about Luce. Just a heads up that ""Luce"" is a slow-moving film (which doesn't bother me in the least, but it might bother some).""Luce"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to positive acclaim, and is now getting a limited theater release. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house there in Cincinnati, and the Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended better than I had expected (about 15 people). This movie is about as far away as you can get from the latest Marvel franchise movie or Disney ""re-imagining"" or sequel or prequel nonsense. If that sounds like it might appeal to you, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Luce
16,Turfseer,Straight-A student takes down his teacher in engrossing tale of moral ambiguity and the racial divide,8,30 August 2019,"Finally a film examining the racial divide in this country chooses not to fall for easy answers. Director Julius Onah collaborated with JC Lee on the screenplay based on Lee's play. The title character, brilliantly played by Kelvin Harrison Jr., is a high school student initially adopted as a troubled child soldier from Eritrea by white parents, Amy and Peter, played with great intensity by Naomi Watts and Tim Roth.
Luce, an A-student and track star, is seen at the beginning of the film, rehearsing a speech he's about to make before the student body. He reminds one of a young Obama and is even told that by fellow students (pejoratively as it turns out). Luce comes into conflict with his history teacher, Harriet Wilson, played by Octavia Spencer, in the surprisingly welcome role as the heavy (in contrast to many earlier films where she's played overly sympathetic characters).
Harriet, a conservative African-American woman has already gotten DeShaun, the star football player, kicked off the team with no chance of receiving a college scholarship, after she rummages through his locker and finds marijuana there. Harriet, a stickler for the rules, has a reputation as a hard ass and Luce apparently resents her lack of flexibility.
When Luce writes a paper assigned by Harriet in the voice of Frantz Fanon, a French-African nationalist who advocated violence to oppose colonial stewardship, alarm bells go off in Ms. Wilson's head. Her best student may be embracing the radical posture of the more militant African-American students at the school and she doesn't want to see Luce ruin his career. To add insult to injury, she also finds a cache of illegal fireworks in his locker.
Wilson's decision to go through Luce's locker is actually debated in class between the two in a hypothetical discussion involving legal decisions. While it appears Wilson is able to legally justify going through the locker, it's clear Luce will have none of her argument. The rummaging through the locker is probably the weakest plot link in the film. While justification is somehow provided during this classroom debate between the principals, in reality a teacher would never have been allowed to get away with going through a student's locker like that without permission-especially in a school with a liberal, progressive principal like Mr. Towson (played by Norbert Leo Butz).
Wilson brings all this to Luce's mom Amy, who fears the underlying psychopathology of his younger years may be re-emerging. Is he sociopath or merely the victim of a teacher who has a vendetta against him? And could Ms. Wilson's ""vendetta"" actually be based on holding Luce to a higher standard (in Luce's eyes, the black student is expected to be ""perfect""). Wilson, in contrast, acknowledges how racism can easily bring African-Americans down and that's why even a small slip-up can ruin any chances to succeed in a society run by whites.
Luce (the film) morphs into a psychological thriller as we're eager to know whether Luce is honest or not. Soon it becomes apparent, that Luce, as a school leader, cannot allow the slight to DeShaun to go unanswered. The earlier reference to Frantz Fanon becomes completely a propos-Fanon, known for his axiom of ""the oppressed becoming the oppressor,"" now completely applies to the manipulative Luce. Through a series of brilliant schemes (including conscripting his girlfriend to lie to Ms. Wilson that she was gang raped by some students at a drunken party), he manages to get the 15 year teaching veteran fired.
Wilson, however, remains somewhat sympathetic. In a subplot, she cares for a drug-addicted woman with mental health issues whom she has taken in as a ward. The woman ends up appearing at the high school, has a meltdown (ripping off all her clothes to boot) and ends up tasered by cops who arrive there after 911 is called.
The film's scenarists do what good screenwriters should do-introduce moral ambiguity into a story where one strains to figure out who is the correct protagonist and antagonist. What's more I think the protagonist is not as sympathetic as one would like and the antagonist has troubling sympathetic qualities.
May I venture to suggest that Ms. Wilson is the protagonist but deeply flawed? She holds high school students to the standard of adults which has very unfortunate consequences, especially for that one student expecting a college scholarship. On the other hand, Luce is clearly the antagonist, in that he is willing to lie and manipulate others in order to take down a 15 year veteran teacher, who admirably has been caring for a drug-addicted woman off the streets. But still, can't Luce's behavior be excused due to his extremely difficult childhood? What's more, it appears at film's end that he is remorseful regarding his behavior and is on the road to positive change.
The parents here are complicated characters too. Naomi Watts displays a gamut of emotions as she's on a veritable roller-coaster, not knowing whether she should be supportive or critical of her son. But Tim Roth who plays the father, will have none of Luce's manipulation. He never really wanted to raise a troubled child in the first place, and now feels that his negative expectations have been confirmed.
In this era where some filmmakers choose to depict African-Americans as perennial victims, Luce is a refreshing change. Indeed, the axiom of ""the oppressed becoming the oppressor,"" suggests that those who have been victims of racism, would sometimes prefer to embrace the ""sweet taste"" of revenge as opposed to taking the ""high road"" (or as Spike Lee put it: ""Do the right thing""). But on the other hand, in this film (as in life in general), things are not always ""black and white"" nor is right always completely right and wrong always completely wrong.",Luce

Luce (Kevin Harrison jr) is a former Eritrean child soldier, adopted by a white couple he is now a star at the track, has a great academic record and is an accomplished high school debater. Worried at a paper Luce has written voicing the views of Frantz Fanon his teacher (Octavia Spence) searches his locker and finds fireworks. This teacher has previously destroyed the future of another student after finding weed in his locker. Things spiral from that point forward. A story about middle class expectations and a black teacher expecting perfection from her black students, willing to be ruthless against those who do not conform. Spence is literally a woke liberal monster, part of the establishment, who sees the concept of physically resisting oppression as being beyond the pale. The misrepresentation/misunderstanding of what Fanon stood for detracts from the film's worth (imho) but Harrison is outstanding as Luce who uses his decolonised mind to wage psychological guerrilla warfare against Spence, a campaign that psychiatrist Frantz Fanon would have approved of.

20,valleyjohn,All over the place,6,11 March 2020,"I believe good film making is about knowing how to tell a story . How good that story is told , depends on many things including writers , actors and especially the director .
I think there was a good story to be told with Luce but that perfect combination that's needed just didn't come together in my opinion .It's the story of Amy and Peter Edgar who has adopted their son from war-torn Eritrea. He has become a grade A student but a teacher, Miss Wilson, who believes he is a symbol of black excellence and sets a positive example for his peers but she begins to dig deeper and she find things aren't all they seem.It's extremely hard to explain the message this film is portraying . It's difficult because it's a bit of a confused mess . Sure , it's about living up to expectation and conforming and how there are consequences to even very good deeds , in this case a white couple adopting a refugee- but for the most part I really didn't care .Nobody on show is very nice . The parents are extremely highly strung and don't particularly like each other let alone anyone else . The teachers are interfering and expect too much and even Luce is annoyingly smug .This felt like a jigsaw puzzle with all the right pieces but just put together in the wrong places .The one scene that I liked was the very last one and that kind of answered a few questions but on the whole it was a disappointment.",Luce

23,krocheav,Luce - Leaves Too Many Questions,5,18 September 2020,"Stylishly made and very well acted, with the makings of some good writing - yet somehow Luce trips over its own cleverness. There are so many 'statements' on life lessons, history (both modern and past) political correctness, complex relationship issues and just about anything else that could be crammed into its running time. So much so, that it seems writers/producers/director, JC Lee and Julius Onah appeared to have a little difficulty tying it all together, failing to convey a satisfactory understanding of all the issues. The situations in question are all way too serious to gloss over, deserving a far more solid resolution to justify the disturbing end results.Naomi Watts gives her usual sterling performance as Luce's mother and there's excellent support from all those around her. The Music score, while interesting, at times tends to come across as over bearing. Some will say they understood all the convoluted characters and their various activities but if questioned, will probably find they missed an important thread or two. It's also doubtful a teacher would use four letter words when talking to a parent about their son! Some of the content is interesting, but let down by a somewhat open ending - that has obviously left many of its audience unsatisfied.",Luce
24,martimusross,Slow & Totally Incoherent,5,30 October 2019,"LuceThis movie had some good points but overall it was slow, downbeat and unconvincing. We waited forever for the plot to reveal what it was about and when it did it was quite a mixed bags of ideas that didn't quite gel. It amounted to the planned assassination of a teacher in revenge for removing Luce's friend's scholarship, but this was certainly no Prime of Miss Jean Brodie or Notes on a Scandal.The start of Luce's campaign against Mrs Wilson begins with his submission of a contrived essay that advocated terror and violence as a legitimate response for regime overthrow, this started alarm bells ringing, as he had anticipated, the supporting fireworks that Luce knew Mrs Wilson would find in the locker was also preplanned. I note many reviewers here missed this motivation, not understanding that only by discrediting Mrs Wilson motives entirely could DeShaun be reinstated, a point confirmed at the end with DeShaun back in school.What was goodThe acting was largely convincing but Luce played by Kelvin Harrison played the puppy eyes of ""who me!"" throughout, this irritated.The introduction of black on black discrimination and what lays behind racial bias walked the room, but incoherently handled.The inference that Luce used actual weapons as a child soldier but chose different and more effective weapons as an adult was chilling.The refusal of a mother to find fault in a child and how this manifests itself often in deceit.What was more problematicHashed plot, the meeting before the fire, Luce acknowledged there were fireworks in his locker, he apologised for this and stated they belonged to someone else, issue closed, but when the mother was asked where they were, she subsequently lied when she could have said she had them and destroyed them. To have contrived a lie so the fireworks could be used in the subsequent fire was unbelievably contrived. The sister's naked breakdown in school was not stage managed by Luce he was just opportunistic in using the footage, however is was inferred it was preplanned due to its capturing so perfectly on video and it's dissemination subsequently, this unpredictable event was pivotal to the plot. When the mother knew absolutely he had totally burnt down the school and been used as the alibi, she followed him to find out further proof of his guilt, why bother when this had been established.Stilted dialogue, Question ""what happened in school today? Answer "" what do you think happened in school today!"" We had a script that contrived to talk around the subject, followed by an emotional outburst, and yet the cause of the outburst had not been established.In reality Mrs Wilson was a good teacher, DeShaun was quite rightly expelled for either selling or using drugs or both and did not deserve her removal, and yet the movie more than inferred she had betrayed black and Asian Americans, and certainly betrayed her race. When Luce questions Mrs Wilson to uncover her motivations in sacking DeShaun she is clear, to get on as a minority you need to be better and not just equal the competition, she perhaps has a point.The end scene of him running down the street shows a triumphant soldier having achieved his mission and preparing himself for the next operation, nothing subtle here!In conclusion with some minor tweaking this could have been a really great movie but largely due to incoherence ruined itself, such a shame!",Luce

26,muamba_eats_toast,Initial intrigue and development leads to disappointment,5,14 November 2019,I was really enjoying this film bubbling along for a good portion of the film and thought Naomi Watts in particular was spectacular.

27,gizmomogwai,Complex and timely psychological thriller,8,11 November 2019,"Luce looked like a challenging film to take on, a psychological thriller in which a refugee child-soldier from Eritrea is taken in by West Wing liberals. But then a teacher (Octavia Spencer) comes to his mother (played by the great Naomi Watts) with an alarming message - Luce has written an essay defending violence against enemies. Is he still a terrorist, or the model student everyone thinks he is? Going into this, I was prepared to be challenged, but either straightforward answer - it was all a misunderstanding, or he is a terrorist - would have felt like a cheat.In fact, Luce goes deeper than that. The fact that Luce is a refugee from a war zone turns out to be not so much important as the fact that he and his teacher are both black Americans in a racially divided United States ... a society that divides not only races but sometimes members of the same races. The characters struggle to cope with expectations, pressures and reality, and the truth is that Luce is neither saint nor devil but simply a flawed person. The old message that high school is often war generally rings true to me, though I can't claim to know what it feels like to go through that experience as a minority.Naomi Watts does a great job conveying the inner conflict, and the cast is generally strong. The writing is smooth. Little particularly stands out about the visual style, but there's enough talent to carry the film on here.",Luce
28,maurice_yacowar,Is this Americanized African child soldier really the perfect student he seems to have become?,10,4 September 2019,"This is an astonishingly challenging, literate, open-ended drama - quite rare for the American screen. The plot centers on the struggle between a liberal black high school Government teacher, Harriet Wilson, and Luce, a black Eritrean chiid soldier raised into a model student by his white middle-class white foster parents, Amy and Peter Edgar.
But the film's broader arena is the vulnerability of liberal values to self-deception and to amoral guile. The Left can be played as simply as the Right (US election, anyone?). It's also how idealists on the Left turn into Lenin's ""useful idiots."" Their emotional ideals blind them to the contradictory, harsh reality.
Consider the narrative frame. The first shot is of a high school locker, a private space within the public, where even dangerous secrets can be stashed, and where an innocent may - or may not - be framed. In a debating club prep Luce and Wilson debate the degree of privacy and civil rights allowed a high school student.
In the last shot, hero Luce is running full-speed at us, a force of strength and rage, all traces of civility and decorum sunk in his visceral rush. If race is the theme he's winning his race without his teammates and without an opponent. As he's not running against anyone he's running against everything.
That last shot follows his speech in the high school auditorium, where he projects his smiling Model Citizen persona, an Uncle Tom ruling the plantation.
But we've seen the contradictory truth. We've seen him carry on a secret affair with a vulnerable Asian girl Stephanie, set off a fireworks explosion at that teacher's desk and indeed ruin her career by mobilizing his girl-friend and his foster mother to lie against her. He also appears likely to have defaced the teacher's window with a racist slur and brought her troubled daughter to the school for a disastrous meltdown.
Why the family name Edgar? In King Lear he's the blind Gloucester's legitimate, honest son, whom the illegitimate and vile Edmund abuses and betrays to his own advantage. The family changed their adopted son's name to Luce (""light"") but thy couldn't convert him from the closed, dishonest and cunning Edmund into an open - and made vulnerable by their own virtue - Edgar.",Luce

30,mikayakatnt,Strong performances but weak script,5,10 September 2020,"Luce is an example of a great cast but a bad script.Disclaimer: Many people relate this movie to ""We Need to Talk about Kevin"" but with added themes. I have never seen that movie so my review may be somewhat biased.On the surface, Luce seems to be a somewhat groundbreaking film. All characters are morally ambiguous with their own problems. The themes add some commentary on modern issues. And the cast is great.Yet, the delivery of the story seems a bit confused and muddled. The film hints at many underlying subplots but never resolves them. Trying to draw your own conclusions can be frustrating as there are few concrete facts given.I understand Julius Onah & JC Lee may want to add in the layer of ambiguity for the audience to draw their own conclusions. This was intentional. If done right, this technique can leave real impact after viewing. But Onah & Lee take this to an extreme and make a movie that is both boring, forgettable, and frustrating to watch.The script is all over the place and doesn't really give us a message. What is this movie even about? What conclusions are the audience supposed to draw from the film? Is this a sociopathic thriller or a commentary on wider societal issues?The only redeeming qualities of this film are its actors. Kelvin Harrison Jr. does an excellent job portraying the something-is-not-quite-right vibe of Luce. Noami Watts & Tim Roth do a great job as an embattled couple in marriage. And Octavia Spencer delivers on performance, AGAIN.Luce is a film that can be a fun thought experiment or studied by future debate classes. Yet, I cannot recommend anyone to watch this film to anyone for pure enjoyment.2.5/5.",Luce

32,SoumikBanerjee25,One of the most underrated gems out there!,9,27 August 2020,"""Luce"" is outright bold with its near perfect execution, that speaks volume against segregation through its strong screenplay and intense writing!
An eloquent script that challenges your thoughts & Ideologies with every punch it throws. It put forward some vital points concerning Racism, Discrimination and most of all how we all adhere to as human beings. How we perceive one & another! How our perceptions change according to someone's skin color or race! It sheds some harsh light on the diplomatic & pseudo mindset of some people who hold their own agendas before anything else. Scintillating performances from each cast member elevated its efficacy upto the highest tier. Naomi Watts, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Octavia Spencer; all of them have given their all they could.
The confrontational scenes between different characters were simply fascinating and forces us to take sides. But it's not that easy. As the makers have cleverly put no emphasis on either of them! You have that penultimate burden to choose one or another
All mentioned subjects are highly debatable!
Be it Racial discrimination, Parenthood, Pretentious nature of humans; it's all in there.
But the plot succesfully manages to hold them altogether.
It's a drama in its soul but also have distinctive traits of a thriller. In the end it arises many unpleasant questions but it never takes sides. You are the sole judge of that. It's upto you to decide who's wrong & who isn't?
I just love it when a film does that!",Luce
33,Alexander_Blanchett,Fine film with strong performances,7,28 January 2020,"It was a good film with a nice Story and some complex characters.
The film mainly convinces with its great acting. First of all Kelvin Harrison Jr. who also had a great Performance this year in ""Waves"" . Here he Plays a totally different character, actually quite the opposite and once again he is terrific. Definitely an Actor that will have a bright future if he Plays the game correctly. I am absolutely Looking Forward to his next Performances. Another strong Performance came from Octavia Spencer, although she overacted it a Little bit in her final Scene. Still nicely nuanced for the rest of the film. Naomi Watts is solid, most of her Performance works through her expressions. Tim Roth is a bit in the shadow of the three, but his character is also the most poorly written. What he does with it is noteworthy. He breaks it out but still suffers from its weak base. The score is intersting and Fitting the atmosphere. The screenplay was solid and so was the direction. Sometimes it dragged a bit, especially in the mid section.

With ""play movies,"" the goal isn't realism per se. You are going to get elevated language and dialogue...but you are also going to get WAY more exploration of ideas. This movie does just that, brilliantly. The level of complexity and nuance here is way different than what most films could deliver. Not only that, but the movie part works too - the score and editing keep building the suspense/stakes scene by scene. It definitely has a play at its core, but it is a movie, as well. So yes: this film tries a little too hard, the characters' conversations seem a bit contrived at points, and the plot is a little too...play-ish? (Also, what accent is Roth doing exactly?)

36,johannes2000-1,"Not easy, but a fascinating watch.",9,4 December 2020,"This movie is about a #BlackLivesMatter issue, but with an interesting twist: not so much about direct discrimination, but about the moral pressure that black people can (or are made to) feel by the expectations of their surroundings, even by other black people. Main character Luce is an A-student and everyone expects him to excel on every other account, because (as his black teacher played by Octavia Spencer points out) his excellence must arm him against the scrutinizing disdain that black people have to expect from the white outside world.It's also about prejudice, about personal integrity, and about the question if you may hurt someone or do a bad thing if this helps someone else. We watch not only Luce's teacher and Luce himself, but in the end even his mother (Naomi Watts) juggle with their integrity for the sake of what they think is a greater, more important good. The movie takes no sides nor gives moral answers. On the contrary, we stay in the dark if Luce was or was not guilty of the things that his teacher accuses him of. Maybe it leaves you unsatisfied, but I guess the makers wanted us to realize that there are no simple, unequivocal answers.The movie is slow-paced, yet very involving, and the acting of all concerned: Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Octavia Spencer, is great. But especially young Kelvin Harrison as Luce excels, he is totally convincing as the morally self-assured, but also exasperated and troubled black adolescent, who tries to justify his choices. The very last shot of the movie pictures this poignantly.Not an easy film, but one that sets you thinking, which is not a bad thing at all.",Luce

The cast is brilliant and the story is provocative, skillfully addressing some fascinating themes and questions about society and our identities.

Kelvin Harrison Jr. is really great and has a bright future in film.
Fans of Lie to Me: Season 1 will enjoy seeing Tim Roth. I loved the first season of that show and then it started going south.
Luce means ""light"". Luce said that his adoptive American parents named him that because he had some light in him even though he had a dark past in war-torn Eritrea.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:I hated that pounding drum sound effect that went on and on in several scenes.
This is a serious drama with no humor.
We didn't have to see all that flesh. I much prefer scenes that are subtle and imply certain actions rather than showing you everything.

43,bob_meg,"A think piece in the shell of a thriller, but what a think piece",10,25 November 2019,"""Whichever side you take... you're wrong"" - Tagline from the 1994 David Mamet film ""Oleanna""I thought a lot about David Mamet's molotov cocktail of a play while watching Luce unfold. Where Mamet's focus was gender politics, political correctness, and the questionable entitlement of the educated elite, J. C. Lee takes swipes at some of those same institutions as well, adding on racial preconceptions into the bargain.If you like to sort the characters in a film out in terms of black and white hats, Luce is not for you. As many others have said, there are no easy answers in this film.Why? Are Lee and Julius Onah, the director, purposely trying to mess with us and frustrate? Actually, the complete opposite. Most people assume they are 100% correct or justified in their actions most of the time, but the truth is, we seldom are.The ""truth"" *is* there in Luce, if you look for it, or more likely the ""probable truth"". But you may have to re-watch it a few times to catch those nuances. That may not cut it for many, but when the ride is filled with such compelling, compulsively engaging performances, I didn't really care.Kelvin Harrison Jr.'s painful and razor-sharp rendering of the title character is a boy who's been groomed, ever since his adoption by the upper-middle class Edgars (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) at the age of 7, from a war-torn boyhood where he toted a machine gun, to wear many masks: for his parents, his teachers, his friends, his lover. Aside from the revolutionary background, though, is he that different from any savvy ivy-league aspiring teenager? Think about it... being forced to kill for a cause you can barely understand kind of grooms you to be a people-pleaser at an early age, in a very... yes... violent way.What's delightfully subversive in Lee's script and play, similar to Mamet's, is that his oppressor/persecutor (in the form of Octavia Spencer, who's rarely been as visceral and charged as she is here) is just as guilty of preconceived bias, and by turns so are Mom and Dad, as they alternately question if Luce is the violent radical Spencer claims he is.Ultimately, Luce seems to be more about the pressures pounded into the young to be everything to everyone... by not only parents and teachers but the media and society at large.... except maybe themselves. And if Luce makes you think about that for even a few minutes, it's done it's job.",Luce

51,Bertaut,"A slightly repetitive, but nonetheless fascinating societal drama that rewards concentration",7,20 November 2019,"In Trump's America, such as it is, issues such as race, gender, and class have become more incendiary topics than they've been in years. It's a house divided against itself, and it's the setting for Luce, a film which examines a myriad of these issues. Adapted from the play of the same name by J.C. Lee, Luce was written for the screen by Lee and Julius Onah, and directed by Onah. Tackling all manner of hot-button issues, including race, class, gender, power, privilege, #MeToo, academic achievement, stereotypes, liberal elitism, even revolutionary rhetoric and the importance of language in encoding societal/political power structures, it also works as a thriller about a young man who may, or may not, be a dangerous sociopath posing as the embodiment of the American Dream. Without question it asks a lot of the audience, meaning some simply won't want to put in the effort. It's by no means perfect - it's too long, lapses into repetition, and it spreads itself too thin thematically - but, by and large, this is strong work, with plenty to say to those willing to listen.In Arlington, VA, 17-year-old Luce Edgar (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is the adopted son of Peter (Tim Roth) and Amy (Naomi Watts). Born in Eritrea, Luce spent the first seven years of his life as a child soldier. However, with the love of his adopted parents and a lot of therapy, he has grown into an exceptional young man; all-star athlete, captain of the debating team, all-round honour student. However, when his history teacher Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer), who has a reputation for being harder on black students, gives an assignment to write from the perspective of a revolutionary, Luce chooses Frantz Fanon, the Pan-Africanist writer who argued that colonialism could only be defeated by violence. Disturbed by Luce's apparent endorsement of Fanon's theories, Wilson searches his locker without his permission (something she has also done to other students), finding powerful fireworks, and so sets out to convince the Edgars that their son may be dangerous. Luce, however, has no intention of letting her do so.In a film which takes in countless themes, one of the most prevalent is race, especially the notion of differences in black identity - both Wilson and Luce are black, but Luce is also an immigrant with a vastly different frame of socio-political reference. Sure, he has experienced great hardships, but since arriving in the US, he's been relatively sheltered (to quote Onah, ""Luce's proximity to whiteness affords him certain privileges that other black characters don't enjoy""). Wilson, for her part, is a child of the 60s, with direct experience of the Civil Rights Movement. However, perhaps because of this, she subscribes to respectability politics, seeing all black people as sharing a common bond. This is one of the things against which Luce pushes back most strongly - he disagrees that there's such a thing as a monolithic black identity, refusing to conform to Wilson's conception of what a successful black student should be. To conform to preconceived and idealised notions would be to define himself on other peoples' terms, in a manner not entirely dissimilar from the very inequalities against which the Civil Rights Movement was a reaction.And, of course, it's important not to forget that amidst all the ideological differences between Luce and Wilson, their initial conflict is a more tangible one - after writing a paper about violence, he's profiled in a way that a white student would not be. The fact that Wilson herself is black is irrelevant to this - she reads what he says about violence and she assumes he shares Fanon's sentiments, and hence could very well be dangerous. In this way, the film deconstructs the concept of the ""model immigrant"" - the immigrant who must prove their harmlessness and demonstrate their potential to contribute before they can be accepted by society at large. But is such a requirement of assimilation just another form of racial profiling?One of the things the film does especially well is toy with audience expectations. Wilson, like much of society, seems to think of Luce in binary terms - he's either a bastion of what's possible in the land of dreams or he's violent and dangerous. Cinema audiences too are conditioned to think in such binaries - we want ambiguous characters such as Luce to ultimately be revealed as one thing or the other. However, Onah knows that people will scan the text to find clues to confirm this notion or that notion, and he delights in complicating that process at every turn - when a grinning Luce mentions fireworks to Wilson, is he threatening her or is it an innocent reference to the Fourth of July; when an amiable Luce meets Wilson and her drug-addict sister Rosemary (a stunning performance by Marsha Stephanie Blake) in a supermarket, is it a coincidence or did he follow them?I'd be remiss here if I didn't talk a little about the acting, which is universally exceptional. Just when you think you've got Luce figured out, Harrison gives a sly glance, a slight smile, a shift in body language, which completely dismantles your theory. In a part that's very, very wordy, some of Harrison's best acting concerns Luce's subtle non-verbal traits. Spencer is equally good in the role of Wilson, whom she plays as far more on the surface than Harrison's Luce. However, so too does she exhibit a degree of ambivalence - we're often not sure if she's acting out of genuine concern for the school or is instead being vindictive towards a student whose thinking she has been unable to bend to her own.In terms of problems, the audience has to do a lot of the leg work, and it's something which will be immediately distasteful to some, especially those who demand rigid binaries and clear explanations from their narratives. Personally, I loved the inherent ambiguity, but I understand that some won't. The same is true of many of the themes, which tend to be raised in something of a phenomenological vacuum, exiting almost as hypotheticals rather than prescribed answers, and again asking the audience to connect some of the dots. More of a problem for me was that the film ran a good 20 minutes longer than necessary, with much of the dramatic tension slackening in the last act. It's also prone to repetition - seen most clearly in Peter and Amy's constant back and forths and the dialogue scenes between Luce and Wilson. The film also features a few too many issues, several of which are taken virtually nowhere. A subplot involving a possible sexual assault at a party, for example, pays lip-service to many of the tenets of #MeToo but does very little beyond that.Nevertheless, I was impressed with Luce. What it says about the US's (in)ability to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding important socio-political topics isn't flattering, but it is compelling. Essentially a film about pressure, as exerted by parents, by schools, by teachers, by friends, by society, by oneself, it's at least partly an exposé on the bitter divisions inherent in Trump's America. It does spread itself a little thin and the ambiguity won't be to everyone's taste, but this is brave filmmaking with a lot on its mind.",Luce
52,Coralknight,WAY out of their league,5,20 July 2020,"This film was not only very poorly written but also extremely miscast. While the story centers around a supposed refugee from Eritrea, neither the facts nor the reality match up with this story-line, since a) Eritrea is not in any way ""war torn"" (they had a border war with Ethiopia with mostly military casualties) b) Eritrea has never deployed the use of child soldiers. c) the lead neither looks Eritrean (or African for that matter) nor does he sound like an immigrant raised by white parents (sorry...but he definitely needs some diction courses). Even though there is a Nigerian producer involved in this project, it's almost as if they literally picked an African country at random, thinking they all must have SOME civil war going on. Aside from that, without going into details, the dynamics of this ""family"" just don't add up. Now, despite this poorly contrived script, there are some AMAZING performances from Andrea Bang, Marsha Stephanie Blake and Octavia Spencer (seriously...does she ever NOT give an amazing performance?), so this alone is worth the 5 stars.",Luce
53,carlos-pires,Amazing stuff. Must watch.,9,17 November 2019,"This is an amazingly intelligent and deep piece nobody will regret viewing.
It wouldn't surprise me if this got an Oscar for best screenplay.
I guess in the end this is a movie about how we are creatures of our environment. I believe this is much more so when the environment is the USA, but its assumptions are still valid for most western societies.
The tragedy here is that it is almost impossible to find the right balance between what your own self desires and what all the societal clusters around you want and expect from you.
And in the end, those who want to do the right thing but who don't have the support of a societal structure are destroyed.
One quote from the character played by Naomi Watts sums the movie's underlying ethos perfectly, when she turns to her husband and asks: ""Whose side are you on?""
Anyway, just watch it!",Luce

56,babyjaguar,LUCE: MODEL CITIZEN OR A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR?,7,14 August 2019,"This film based on a play by Asian American writer, J.C. Lee explores the notion of what is true? Luce, the main character played cleverly by Kev lin Harrison, it'sworthy of recognition and praise and supported by the established talents of Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts. Washington's superb but uncanny cinematic presence, can get underneath one's skin.Luce, an immigrant high schooler who's an accomplished academic student that serves as a role model not just to an immigrant but to African-American males as implied by the film's narrative. This film has brought forth controversy and stereotypes about the myth of being a perfect immigrant searching the American Dream.This film is directed by Nigeria-born filmmaker, Julius Onah (known for Sci-fi genre). The film really tries to think outside of the box, which probably ""why"" many reviews don't know how to react. It about racism? Between polarization of White and Black America? Or is it the stress of being a teenager in Middle America? Or could this be ""really"" about what mainstream media wants the masses to think in the idea of model citizenship?",Luce
57,Rino_Bortone,POWERFUL,8,2 January 2020,"Powerful, it is the word that immediately comes to mind when we're up describing this film. Story that overwhelms the viewer in mystery, perplexity and in the deepest questions. Story that is explained, but not too much; an intelligent, distressing and anxious thriller, especially if you want certain cards to not be shown. Nothing extremely original, but it is certainly an exceptional film from multiple points of view beyond the plot itself, for example the intelligent direction of Julius Onah and the mature acting ability of the cast: an excellent Octavia Spencer, a brilliant Tim Roth, a perfect Naomi Watts and an intriguing Kevin Harrison Jr. Basically: powerful.",Luce
58,LiveLoveLead,DON'T READ REVIEWS THAT GIVE DETAILS AWAY!!!!!!!!,8,15 February 2020,"This film (adapted from a play) is a cerebral, psychological drama/thriller. Although it has a slow build, you'll want to give it your full attention, so as to catch every nuance. Luce (played magnificently by Kelvin Harrison Jr) is a handsome, intelligent, athletic, black, high school student who was adopted from a war-torn country at age 7 and raised by loving white parents (Watts & Roth). After an incident at school tension between Luce, his parents, and his teacher Ms. Wilson (Octavia Spencer) begins to build. The acting by all the main characters is excellent. I think some people struggle with the ambiguity of this clever film, which will spark many conflicting conversations and opinions, depending on your own personal filter...the same way the characters themselves react and come to conclusions based on their own experiences, feelings, and points of view. We all see things through our own personal lenses...that doesn't always make us right, or wrong. This movie will have you guessing and reassessing throughout, and even after it ends. A definite Must See, In My Humble Opinion!",Luce
59,sinnerofcinema,"In the era of fakenews and politized ideology, you do what you gotta do to win. This film wins!",10,4 August 2019,"Go into this knowing nothing. You will thank me later. Its better that way. I will comment around this film so as to make you see it. I won't give away spoilers but I will tell you that you must think out of the box. This film will not be spoon fed to you like other studio films and that's a good thing. Sometimes in order to get thought life, its best done with a smile, no matter what your situation or specially if your are in constant survival mode. You do what you have to do to win. In this film winning does not necessarily mean coming in first. It means getting what you want the way you want it. Kind of like running presidential campaigns and saying anything and doing anything to attain the desired result - to wrap people around you as a means to create followers and disciples. Because if your story is credible enough, convincing enough, so much so that your opponent is destroyed, you win. life is a like game of chess. You've got your allies working for you in your favor, and working to keep your adversaries at bay. Then you go in for the kill. And when you go in for the kill, always make sure people think it was all done for the greater good. Its all part of the strategy for survival of the fittest. Yes, the film is that good! And as another reviewer said correctly, it's Oscar worthy. This film seems like the first entry into what is sure to be a competitive awards season. The film is a total mental workout. By the time it's done, you're exhausted, yet satisfied.",Luce
60,cappiethadog,Mom knows his son,7,10 November 2019,"The woman in the running car waits for the young black man to emerge from a house. He carries a backpack. There is a cell phone in his hand. He could be a drug dealer. The young black man is on the move. She follows. The car is expensive; it doesn't make a lot of noise. But the young man never has reason to look back. After all, he comes from a better neighborhood than this one. To the woman, the African-American teenager looks both familiar and unfamiliar, as if seeing him for the first time after a lifetime of encounters too many to count. What is he doing in this respectable neighborhood, a suburb where people take pride in their lawns? Up to no good. This thought shames her. She has a son that looks just like him. He makes a call in his cell; he must be working; dealing, most likely. ""****,"" the woman cusses quietly, as he cuts into the public park. She finds a space in the lot; it's a weekday, there are plenty of open spaces. The young black man enters a derelict old house, possibly a drug den. A girl is there. They disrobe. Who is this person, the woman wonders. Amy Edgar(Naomi Watts) wonders. A mom wonders. It's her son. She corrects herself; stepson, a rehabilitated orphan from a war-torn African nation that she and Edgar(Tim Roth) brought back to raise as their own flesh and blood. They both love him; the mother more. At a birthday party, Amy realizes that their parental love is disproportionate. Her husband picks up babies. She decided, long ago, for both of them, that they would save a baby, a child really, and teach him how to walk and talk. She doesn't need to pick up babies, but apparently, her husband does. Alas, her unconditional love is tested. An incident at Luce's fancy prep school put Amy in an indelicate position. She has to ask herself: Does her son have a predilection for violence? Did he see something on the Internet that radicalized him? In this remarkable sequence, we watch Amy, a devoted mother, devolve into a generic everywoman profiling an African-American male, the very same person who sits with her and Peter every night for meals at the dinner table. It sickens her, this doubt. Amy has become the thing she hates. But for now, Luce(Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a person of interest. The high-powered fireworks, confiscated on high school property, that she hid in their home had gone missing. Amy knows that her son placed them in Ms. Wilson's desk. Harriett(Octavia Spencer) wasn't there when the explosives went off. There was a fire. Nobody got injured But would it have mattered to Luce? For what reason does Amy think that her son went to his history teacher's house? In addition, she can't see what the audience sees. Ms. Wilson stops Luce at the front door. She throws down his flower bouquet. The history teacher doesn't want to talk. And then, Luce enters her house without invitation, a subtle threat, that echoes that classroom scene, in which the student explains why Independence Day is his favorite holiday; the fireworks. These provocations would be easier to appraise if both parties differed ethnically.""Luce"" goes halfway, not all the way, in regard to what Julius Onah, the filmmaker, wants to portray, which would have been the moral dilemma of first world parents being put in the position of harboring a potential domestic terrorist, their son, an immigrant success story. Replace fireworks with bomb, and you tip the scales against Luce, who, after all, has a vendetta against his history teacher because she got Deshaun(Brian Bradley), a soft drug user, thrown off the football team. Like his good friend, Harriett Wilson searched Luce's locker, but being what the debate team captain and championship sprinter means to the school, which prides itself in racial diversity; he gets special treatment. Luce is outraged by this. He has no interest in being a show pony; a token. Why him and not Deshaun?Hanging out with Kenny(Noah Gaynor), a white teammate, Luce learns that he's not ""black"" black; he's Luce, a special distinction that echoes the ESPN ""30 for 30"" documentary ""O.J.: Made in America"", directed by Ezra Erdman, when the apolitical college football star flatly states: ""I'm not black, I'm O.J."" Luce was made in Eritrea; he wants to be African-American, not the ""other"" other. Luce, through visual means, is shown to be literally on the fast track to success, easily outdistancing his teammates on the course during practice. Without realizing it, Luce assimilated, whereas DeShaun made no compromises in order to be accepted by a wide breadth of demographic groups. His friend's downfall causes the immigrant success story to undergo an identity crisis; he sees the difference between how he and the school pariah are perceived by the faculty an student body. DeShaun could have shortened his name to a single syllable. Could that have made a difference? A football scholarship was all DeShaun had going for him. Harriett, the woman responsible for taking it all away from him, has a sister, Rosemary Wilson(Marsha Stephanie Blake), a woman with severe mental problems. ""Luce"" hints that the history teacher plays kingmaker with people of color, just like any other person in power who determines winners and losers, as revenge for her older sister's permanent condition. It offends Ms. Wilson that Deshaun, who had a choice in the matter, would throw it all away with undue retribution. But it's not DeShaun who thrashes her house while she showers, it's Rosemary. The older sister can sense that Harriet is ashamed of her. Rosemary becomes the audience's surrogate; the audience can see her flaw. She wants black people to get ahead, but only on her terms. Luce understands this. She destroyed his friend's life for refusing to play the game. Once Luce recognizes the special treatment that has been bestowed upon him, he rages against it. The African emigre does not want to be exempt from the racial inequality that afflicts his adopted brethren. So, in protest, Luce chooses Frantz Fanon, a controversial black separatist, as his topic for a midterm paper; an anti-colonialist who once wrote: ""The black enslaved by his inferiority, the white enslaved by his superiority alike, behave in accordance with a neurotic orientation.""Luce wants his old name back. During the speech he delivers at a school assembly, he tells a personal aside about how Amy couldn't pronounce his birth name; his African name, so Peter shortened it to Luce. Unwittingly, without meaning to harm Luce, they took their son's identity away; his power. The term paper, in all likelihood, that this college-bound student wrote on some pro-violence radical, was simply a metaphor for his political awakening.Fireworks gives Luce some wiggle room in the matter of intent.A bomb, however, changes things.",Luce

The subject is quite complex and the narration is brilliant. Octavia Spencer excels in her role as Mrs. Harriet, a not so friendly teacher.This film won't take the box office by a storm nor will be big at award season but it's one of the best movies of the year.

63,Maelific71,Nothing Is As It Seems,7,22 August 2020,"First of all, the acting was phenomenal. It's worth watching just for the performances alone. Next, the script isn't as bad as some are making it out to be. Unfortunately, in today's climate, there are those who have political views who actually search for or invent reasons to be upset. You'll know the ones who possess that affliction because it will be reflected in their reviews.This movie is written so that the viewer can identify with every character in some way. There's something to feel for, like, and dislike as well.Theres also a lot going on...The sexual assault and manipulation. The Principal with blinders on, who is also potentially prepared to sweep it under the rug and more worried about a male future than that of a female victim.The teacher with her own personal problems dishing out ""tough love."" Sometimes well intentioned and sometimes not. In the end she is clearly outmatched, not only by an unlikely villain, but also by her peers as well.The adopted mother who is so invested in her son that she is willing to ignore the deviance and deception thats happening in real time right in front of her. Eventually, she's willing to become that way herself and not without obvious consequences as the whole situation threatens to slowly ruin her marriage.Luce is a brilliant yet damaged young man. He's hurt, angry, and suffers from a sense of guilt due to his success story and why it appeals to others. Additionally, because of his charm and charisma, everyone sees what they want to see and ignores or covers for him. The combination of all these things proving it will not end well.",Luce

65,mmuggi,Luce stands for...,8,24 October 2020,"First of all, I would like to express my respect to the actors who are in this film. All the big roles (maybe except the inspector) play great. There are so many games, so many doubts and layers to peel off this film that it's almost hard to keep up, but at the same time so easy - almost all the way. For there is a plot point that becomes extremely important in the film, but where reality is never told completely at the bottom. Just as the film language around racism and stereotypes sometimes touches on the melodramatic, possibly due to the fact that the film is based on the screenwriter's own stage play. The ending is also a bit unrelenting unfortunately, and it gets a little too long and lingering.
All in all, a solid psychological thriller, with tension and good performances, which, however, could well have been a little shorter and more pronounced.",Luce
66,TheCasualReviewer,Is Kelvin Harrison Jr. an actor or is he manipulating me into thinking he's one...? *Mind Blown*,7,8 December 2019,"The collective performance of this ensemble is something else.SYNOPSIS:
Luce (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is your ideal son/student/role model. Star of the track team and the student you expect to make the commencement speech for his college graduation. However, with a tension forming between Luce and his teacher Ms. Wilson (Octavia Spencer) things begin to get stranger as you're forced to question whether Luce's intentions are pure or cynical.DIRECTION:
Julius Onah captures an atmosphere that just about suffocates you with suspicion and tension. Onah really makes you feel a few of his scenes due to angles and positions that manipulates your thoughts the same way Harrison Jr. does with his performance. Not the most unique direction, but good enough to elevate the film.WRITING:
What's so hard about reviewing this film is I can't tell what it was that really affected me whether it was the Directing, Writing, Acting or all of the above. This film itself is a manipulation. I think a large part of this is due to the writing. It's so precise and at times maybe too precise where it can be unbelievable at times.ACTING:
Kelvin Harrison Jr.. I could leave this at that, which is crazy because the rest of the ensemble was SO good. What the fluff is going on with these performances not getting any Oscar buzz? Just because you expect damn near perfect performances from a Naomi Watts and Tim Roth means they don't deserve to be talked about? Honestly, I'll chalk this up to poor marketing. This might be the least marketed film of the year with star power like that. I only knew of this film due to one trailer I saw from a film way back. Anyway, if I had my choice of Kelvin ""The Ultimate Manipulator"" Harrison Jr. being nominated for Best Actor, he would be right behind Adam Driver. Some short, but affective performances from Andrea Bang and Holy shift it's Astro from the US edition of The X Factor.CONCLUSION:
This is a really well made film from Julius Onah and incredible performances from the entire ensemble. Wasn't enough to get 4/5 stars just because it didn't reach a level I really saw this film having the potential to reach. If you're looking for strong acting and tense dialogue this is a perfect fit for you.",Luce

It helps that the main actors are absolutely amazing. I'd expect nothing less from Watts, Roth or Spencer, but here we also witness the rise to prominence of Harrison, and for that alone this movie is well worth watching. It definitely bites off a lot: it's a psychological thriller, commentary on race, sex, authority, parenting, mental illness, identity, among other things. Amazingly, it works pretty well, and leaves you a bit torn at the end, which will leave some viewers confused or dissatisfied, but I liked it. No cookie cutter stuff here.",Luce

71,ablack90,Not a Contribution to Discussion About Race,2,31 May 2020,"This film is about a teen boy named Luce from Eritrea adopted by white parents. He's a star student and athlete. His African American teacher, played by Octavia Spencer, engages in a series of odd behaviours that culminate in her eventual firing. She's put on a leave of absence and under investigation and told she will not be backed by the school. And rightly so!!Alarmed at Luce's assignment paper where he writes about a violent revolutionary, instead of talking to him, the teacher breaks into his locker and tells his mother about the fireworks she found and the paper he wrote. Previously she broke into another black boy's locker and found marijuana and got him kicked off the football team, thereby killing his college scholarship. With friends like this who needs enemies? Again she could have talked to the boy and warned him,encouraging him for his future ... not ruin his future.Luce's parents are equally weird. Father barely believes his own kid & is apparently burned out and mother is a hot mess, speaking to his ex girlfriend who tells mom Luce is lovely. After a failed attempt to get back with Luce, girlfriend tells the teacher he forced himself on her. At this point in the film, I'm thinking Luce might have fared better in effing Eritrea!!The only part of the film I liked was when Luce confronted the teacher and she finally lays her cards on the table and says black people are put in a box by America so they have to be perfect. I reject that and so did Luce. It's a completely unfair way of living. It's racism from black to black. Someone defaces the teacher's door and blows up her desk (likely the kid kicked off the team) and the viewer is left to wonder if it was Luce. To be honest I could care less if it was Luce because at that point I might have helped him. Just an awful film that misses any point it's trying to make. Lateral violence within ethnic communities is real. This teacher did things to youth that frustrated not encouraged their path. But the film was never clear on what it wanted to say.",Luce

That's black and white, if you didn't get my reference! After watching Amend (Will Smith), the documentary about the 14th amendment and how America purposefully ignores it, this film just highlights the injustices...for the most part!But, as the film progresses the viewer begins to question whom they think is innocent. Like The Usual Suspect, you think you know who Koze is, until you don't, and then you think you do again. A back and forth of suspicion that never abated throughout the film.Events transpire that put Spenser's teacher into question, but then she becomes a target. The father, played as always creepily by Roth, sits in a position much like the viewer, never truly grasping who is to blame for all their struggles. Then there's the obsessive mum played intriguingly by Watts, always on the defensive, even when presented with overwhelming tales! The titular character, Luce, played by Harrison Jr. (no relation to Indy), adopted at a young age from a war-torn country where he learnt to shoot before driving, adds substantial elements of distrust in his portrayal. But it's all a who-done-it without a clear crime.Touching on sensitive topics of privilege, athletic prowess in schools, and what power that gives the most able, the Black Lives Matter debate turned on its head by an overzealous teacher, and how much of your life do you surrender to raise a child.

Here the kid is from a war torn country in Africa, which is not far from outer space since the setting for this movie is suburban America. As the Oedipus Complex plays out, the tensions rise and all in all, the movie becomes quite watchable.

This would be a good movie for an English Class to dissect the different themes going on. I would say it hits upon the pressure parents and teachers put on teen role models (especially African American role models). Everyone wanted this kid to succeed so badly that it led to many instances of lying and deceit on the part of students, teachers, parents and administration. It also is a commentary on issues around foreign adoption and the difficulties both the parents and kids can go through. It touches on school politics and how things can get swept under the rug when people or their actions don't fit into the image they are trying to project.
I wish the movie would have just touched on one of these issues and stuck with it...I was kind of bouncing around trying to figure out the main point. As I said earlier...this would be a great case study for an English or Theater class.",Luce

It then turns out that this story wasn't even true, it was fabricated by the main characters to get the teacher fired. How stupid. The girl who makes up the story even says something related to the Santa Claus game as not even being the worst thing that these high school boys do. What on earth?!? Maybe or maybe not that's not the worst thing the boys do but it feels completely wrong for this type of movie to spin so far off the rails into sexual-allegation-palooza, not even (or more than, depending on how you want to look at it) halfway through the movie when the movie didn't seem to be about that at all.

This movie is nothing like VICE, but it gave me a lot of similar vibes, as it could perfectly work as the backstory of some politician and his past. This multi-layered character piece perfectly fits in todays debates but at the same time has the potential to be a timeless statement. If you get a chance to see Luce, don't think twice and enjoy a very well acted character study, which originated from a play, but serves so well as a movie with it's surprising ending.",Luce
84,BirdzOfParadise,Could have been perfect,8,30 April 2020,"As the drama this is tagged as, it was a good movie. But for some reason they write this very much like a psychological thriller but didn't give the ending of one. It ends like a basic drama. Had they followed through somehow on the thriller they built up to, this could have been a perfect movie.",Luce

86,doxxman5,Can't sweep out the dark,10,2 November 2019,"Luce is one of the most interesting and timely movies made this decade, which is why even though it just came out I am putting it high on my list. Is it about about a white couple adopting a war-torn African child and the way that child is raised via the impact of his younger upbringings effect? Yes. Is it about the expectations and levels people go to to seek glory and praise in a high school setting? Yes. But these are just minor plot details to get at what Luce is really about: expectations. Shining a light for the world to see while also fitting in is what the lead character struggles with. If that makes him a monster for doing what he thinks is right and how will that effect his ""bright future""- these are the issues at the center of this stage play turned movie.So many great plays are turned into movies and not much is changed at all, but Luce is one of the more cinematic transformations I have seen. There are multiple settings and places involved, phone texting and internet connections play a huge role, and the cinematic qualities matter so much I would believe those that say they didn't even know it was a play I would not be surprised. As soon as I watched Luce, which just came out on streaming last week after a limited theatrical release, I wanted to watch it again, because it boasts a mystery that's constantly changes course AND because it is about so much more than it initially lets on. What does it means to have a family, but also the lack the connection that exists within?Octavia Spencer exhudes a certain domineering presence like she never has before, Tim Roth and Naomi Watts brings a great chemistry as Luce's parents and as one of cinemas best male/female teams, and newcomer Kelvin Harrison shines as Luce, a lead actor so complex that you can like him and dislike him simultaneously but always see where he is coming from. The screenwriters know these characters inside and out, and the questions this film asks are not comfortable in our current society but should always, always be asked, lest we forget where we are headed if we aren't careful.Its easy to think and ponder about the direction Luce goes in. Each conversation is a battle, a moral argument, and much food for thought. It is an endlessly rewatchable movie that would also work as an audio only book. The dialogue, in both senses of the word, is riveting.",Luce

88,kristoffe-brodeur,Plot holes like swiss cheese,8,30 August 2019,"It was interesting to see something so Donnie Darko like in a way. There was plenty of drama, intrigue and suspense. I felt that a lot of what the director or writer wanted to give to us was muddled and needed to be ironed out, not because I like happy endings or loose ends tied up, but when it is meant to be mysterious or fuzzy it should feel purposeful.It was without a doubt an amazing film, but there were a lot of ""wait, what?"" and ""couldn't that be done much better?"" moments. They've really been putting Olivia in these horrible situations as a character lately, and a lot of them ironic to the film, are degrading. Real or not, I find that she needs to be the hero for once, or have a really good ending.The characters feel real, all but the lead himself, which is on purpose. There is a lot of of aiming at Obama in this, the smile, underlying hints stuff I really dislike. But then again, that's politics for you. Dirt everywhere, the way the film calls things out pretend to be three dimensional but they are surely flat.To analyze more would reveal the mysteries in it. Just go, it is certainly worth a watch or two.",Luce

90,RachelMary2,Great acting but flawed film,7,30 October 2021,Octavia Spencer and Kelvin Harris Jnr are brilliant in this. The conflict and tension between the characters is consistent and remains interesting throughout. For most of the film the complexities drew me in and made the film very watchable but towards the end it was like they tangled themselves and gave up.Some things annoyed me. Like shooting scenes in semi darkness. What is up with this trend?! I'm sure it's got great artistic meaning but it's annoying to have to sit through. The soundtrack was grating more than adding anything to the script. And I didn't feel the story made as much sense as it could/ should have.,Luce

A white couple has high hopes for Luce, A young African who they adopted from war torn Eritrea. He's popular in high school, among his friends, peers and the faculty. Intelligent, Athletic and Articulate. Luce seems to have it all except one Problem: His teacher, Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer), who is highly suspicious of him. His parents (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) are very proud of him. Yet, there's a lot that this young man is going through. Is Luce all what he say he is? Well the story by J.C Lee lets the audience of a young man struggling with his identity with an essay written by him that his teacher Mrs. Wilson questions him. Director Julius Onah plants questions about him and his actions.
Superb performances by the whole cast especially Kelvin Harrison Jr as Luce who trying to pull himself together through the accusations his teacher alleges. Lots of Profanity, Sexism, Tokenism. But you feel for Luce but

It has lots of very complex elements that could have probably made a great movie, but in the end it felt very frustrating not to get any clear closure. Did Luce go full-on premeditated gangster on the teacher to avenge the injustice done to his not-that-much-of-a-friend losing the scholarship, out of guilt? That would be some black belt level of Machiavelli. Manipulating the girlfriend, the parents, the graffiti, the fire, potentially the meltdown of the sister?
Maybe i'm not intelligent enough to understand it. Leaving plot holes and answering nothing isn't mastery of an art form, i call it a wet match. Then again, I watch movies, I don't make them.",Luce
102,clf-73998,Literally Stunning,8,6 June 2020,"This movie is a perfect compliment to the chaos that exists in the USA in 2020. Luce will be viewed differently depending on your ideologies.For the white supremacist who would never actually arrive at this movie because of it requiring the use of critical thought and compassion, this film is about a psychopath much like their gameshow host leader. A human being without the ability to feel.For those who understand the racial divide that has always been present in the USA, this is a character study and an incredible expose on the anger that must surely arrive when a black life who achieves near perfect scores on every task in life will still be seen as a 'thug' by the less educated of us as well as the most intelligent of us.The performances are a little broad but I believe it was directed that way to keep us feeling like we knew the truth.It's only too bad the racists of the world won't see this and couldn't possibly understand it.",Luce

106,nielssloos-17186,Interesting watch that will not dissapoint,7,17 August 2021,"The extremely talented Luce is the perfect example of a 'good student' who is loved by his parents, students and teachers. But when his teacher Harriet sees a reason to open his locker, her discovery makes her second guessing Luces true intentions.There is much to love about this dialogue heavy drama/thriller. First of all, Kelvin Harrison Jr. And Octavia Spencer are fantastic in their role. And especially Kelvin is unrecognizable from his debut role 'It comes at night'. The director is providing clues throughout the movie as to whether we have to root for Luce or should be afraid for him. But instead of giving us the answer, the audience make their own verdict. The movie keeps you engaged the entire movie, which is hard to do.Although it is nice to see Roth and Watts back as a couple (this time not tortured by crazy killers as in 'Funny Games'), I think especially Watts is miscast in this movie. Both are giving their best, however the script that they were given seems staged and their reactions are not natural development of their character. This is a shame, as it seems like the dialogue of the teens are so cleverly written, which makes their relationship less interesting. And their actions towards the end are kind of unrealistic.The conclusion of the movie is great, and the story goes full circle. However, the main issue I had is how the scenes play out. It seems like everything is played out chronologically. If this is the case, it doesn't quiet fit in the time line. If there suppose to be flashbacks, they are not clear.If you like dialogue heavy movies or social thrillers you probably like this movie. However if you are expecting a well constructed mystery thriller where every piece falls into its place at the end, you might be dissapointed at the end. (7.5/10)",Luce

This movie was complete trash.A mentally unbalanced teen gets his teacher fired, who was trying to help him. He lied throughout the movie and set up alibi's. It was disgusting.

110,alexfiles,"Intellectual, suspenseful drama more than a thriller",10,13 November 2019,"Luce grapples with racism and somewhat with sexism and all the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and each other. I learned from it. I was uncertain what was happening until the last interaction between teacher and student, when everything fell shatteringly into place and I felt I understood exactly what happened. I think. Maybe.It's not about a psychopath student or an evil teacher. It's about a black teacher fighting to maintain her self value and self image when working for a white principal who calls her ""articulate"" and her sister causes intense, constant stress. It's about a young man who knows exactly how invaluable his chance to define himself and succeed in his new country is, and knows how to wage war to protect that chance.But it was badly described and sold, and that may make it harder for people to get, since they're expecting a thriller. Luce is intense and layered and thought provoking, but it's not a thriller. Emotionally and intellectually thrilling and suspenseful, but not what most would call a thriller.",Luce

However I thought the entire film really just paints Luce out to be a full on sociopath. So the negative aspects of Harriet's actions such as how she dealt with the boy who had weed in his locker due to her expectations etc should excuse or appear to be on the same level as Luce's actions? Luce manipulates Stephanie and everyone around him, sets a fire in a school and gets a teacher who is going through personal turmoil fired from her job?!
I know he is struggling with his identity and who he should be etc, so that excuses all his actions and also enables his adoptive parents to turn a blind eye?

121,rekotomo,Maybe Yes - Maybe Not,5,18 December 2020,"I think this movie is saying that everyone must NOT trust someone else, because no one is able to know the truth of someone else.As in the movie, the parents can never know if the son is evil or not, maybe yes - maybe no.And the son can never know if his parents love him or not, maybe yes - maybe no. It seems the mother love the son so she protect him by lying that the teacher never gave her the fireworks... but who knows if actually the mother just want to protect herself so someone else won't say that she is not a good mother ?The parents, the son, the school headmaster can never know if the teacher is correct or not. Maybe yes, maybe no.The Chinese girl can never know if Luce is just using her as a tool or Luce does really care for her. Luce can never know if the Chinese girl is using him as a tool or she does really like him.The mother and the teacher can never know if the Chinese girl tell them the truth tor she lied to them.When Luce is giving a speech in front of the audience, the audience can never know whether Luce is speaking the truth or not. For example when Luce say ""I like America"", maybe actually he hates America.And finally, we as the movie watchers will never know the truth of all the main characters in the movie.Who lit the fireworks in the classroom and who draw on the window of the teacher's house ?
Maybe the mother, maybe the father, maybe Luce, maybe the Chinese girl, even maybe the teacher herself.The movie makers succeeded in making all the main characters in grey, hence the movie is totally grey and ambiguous.Anyway, I like the movie's dialogue.",Luce

123,narmelan_tharmalingam,Delievers for this era,8,26 August 2020,"The film makes you think about your teachers growing up. For that alone this is worth the butter on your popcorn. Kelvin Harrison Jr does a wonderful job capturing the gravity of his position and all he's signed up for due to circumstance. Tim Roth and Naomi Watts come through with convincing acts that audiences appreciate having felt for Kelvin's character and the headaches he deals with due to Octavia Spencer's role. Watts supporting of Kelvin's character is convincing in showing a mother's pain and strength. The pace not to be compared with general ""thriller"" films, but fast enough to comprehend the intricate issues existing that lead to clashes. One thing about this film is you wish it won't be relevant a decade from now, which would be The End closure but it doesn't necessarily go there. One last mention, the scene shot in one take with Marsha Stephanie Blake at the school will move and disturb you equally. She absolutely killed it.",Luce
124,trailer_trashed89,Big build up for little pay off,7,30 October 2019,"The trailer for this film is what sold it for me. It appeared to me to be a psychological thriller set in an American high school, centred around the relationship between a Black student and his teacher. And I wasn't exactly wrong...but I wasn't exactly right either.So Luce is a young Black student, praised by all his teachers and in line to be class valedictorian. But one of his teachers is worried that he is involved in some illegal activity and gets his parents involved. As the web of lies gets more tangled and the tension rises, we start to find that we don't know who to believe.So lets start by talking about the spectacular performances of all the actors. There are some really seasoned actors and actresses in this film, and they of course give the kind of performances tat you would expect of some of these household names. However, what Is amazing is that the breakout performances by virtually unknown actors are just as good. Kelvin Harrison Jr.'s performance as Luce was truly spectacular and it is his amazing portrayal of the character is what makes the whole thing work. The whole reveal at the end would never work if his performance wasn't as excellent as it was.Now we need to talk about the ending. But to that we need to look at the pacing of the whole film. So it is a very VERY slow build, as all psychological thrillers are. And you can feel the film building towards a huge climax...and was is the most disappointing thing is that I don't feel like that amazing climax ever really arrives. It was quite unclear at the end what the scheme actually was or what the motivations were, and for me, that is the most important thing in a psychological thriller. Instead I felt unsatisfied. Not a good feeling for the end of a thriller.Not the best thriller I have seen so far this year and not one that I will remember in a few weeks from now.

Now I wont be surprised if this film gets ignored by the Academy, but it certainly doesn't need them to validate its brilliance.",Luce

144,itsallgoodkristin,Great start but fizzles out,6,22 September 2020,"The trailer sucks you in and so I was so looking forward to seeing this but it left me wondering to many things. It starts out great but halfway through it takes a download spiral. The acting is great so it was disappointing that it wasn't able to take off. Luce is literally a mini Damien, everyone loves him but he's got a bigger agenda than just being an all star on the track or a great debater, but we never really figure out what it is. His mom knows he's not all he pretends to be but lies to keep up appearances I suppose. At first you think that the dad is going to do the right thing but he's in caves and follows suit with mom. In my opinion they're only preventing the inevitable, that he will do something much worse than setting fire crackers off and his teachers desk. He's a sociopath but nobody wants to acknowledge this, except for poor Ms. Wilson but nobody wants to listen to her. Not that she doesn't have issues, but I believe her heart was genuinely to help Luce. Good psychological thriller, but again your left hanging with no resolve.",Luce

And if yes, how far does a couple go to protect their childs future? Brilliantly acted by Kelvin Harrison Jr. , Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer, Luce slowly burns under your skin. Not often a script is so verbally eloquent and refined as with Luce, it is a sheer pleasure to listen to all the dialogues and monologues. Near the end the story goes a different path than expected. It is painful to watch. Characters turn out to be a big dissapointment but nobody will erver know and they go on with their corrupted and destructive path in life covered up in glamour.

Writing a radical paper (that was assigned....🙄🙄🙄) doesn't explain a teacher having cause to search a student's locker.Further disappointment is that the climax takes place without the audience noticing. Ms. Wilson's firing is supposed to be the climax.Dishonorable mention is the gratuitous nudity by Ms. Wilson's sister/border (I couldn't figure out their relationship).The movie was plain unsatisfying.",Luce

152,reney-96617,the sustained menace will haunt you,8,17 March 2020,"This movie has the potential to ruin friendships, to break up longstanding movie clubs. It could set in motion such thought-provoking and justifiable, yet completely conflicting, interpretations, that one could argue for weeks on end. It is marvellous.Luce tackles a myriad of issues - race relations, privilege, mental health, parenting - but does not give easy answers, or any answers at all. It simply creates a backdrop for you to wander into, pokes you from all sides, but, more importantly, unsettles you all the way through.Poor Luce, seen as either a monster or a saint, gets pressure from all sides - his white parents wanting him to be okay, his black teacher wanting him not to be a black stereotype, and his friend telling him he is their Obama. Luce questions the difference between working towards being the token black boy that does well, and running away from a black stereotype. In the meantime, he maintains an eerie facade in front of everyone, perhaps even himself.Through brilliant performances, characters turning either good or bad at the drop of a hat, a spine-tingling soundtrack and a plot that keeps you guessing, Luce has a sustained menace that will creep out the strongest among us. It is eerie from start to finish. You don't know who to believe, or who to like. Apparently, nobody.There is one particularly poignant scene, where Miss Wilson's mentally ill sister, Rosemary, shows up at the school. She ends up stripping down and hitting her own naked body. Two police officers taser this fragile, female, black body, and Rosemary contorts into an almost beautiful ballet-type pose before collapsing and being dragged out of the school. I was awestruck.Teenage Luce is suffocated by all the expectations, expectations he did not ask for; and how he reacts to it you will have to see for yourself.",Luce
153,frgxcrzx,The darkness in the light! - Must watch,8,18 September 2021,"This movie raises some important questions and throws light on some underlying fears one may have. It justifies its genre- 'social thriller'.What if your child becomes a project to you?I think this is what scares me the most - among everything else that comes with being a mother.I was watching this movie and it terrified me when Naomi watts character believes after all the hard work she put in it is imminent that she covers for her son no matter what he might be involved in as if she does not, all the hard work she put in at giving him a chance at real 'life' and success would be futile. And her husband politely agrees of course.What if you become a judge of who should make it and who shouldn't instead of teaching all your students what you know?The character Luce is brilliantly crafted. So complicated and yet so relatable. We are all fighting this war over the ourselves- the selves that society wants us to be if it were to give us a chance at something substantial. We do not grow, evolve, develop, adapt naturally anymore, we only do so in a measured manner, that will make us suitable, desirable and 'fittable'.This is what luce suffers from and makes him become someone who borders on 'sociopath'. And her mother is paediatrician who probably realises this and yet turns a blind eye as acknowledging this would ruin his chances at having a real life, at success. But then what about 'him'?They thought they were so noble bringing him away from a war zone and saved him, but little did they realise the war they waged on who he was in order to give him a 'real life' and now they can barely save him from the battles he fights with himself every day. It is just a migration from a war outside to a war inside for the kid, not a saving or freedom.",Luce

What I will say is that the performances were en pointe (on point) and the most brilliant performance was the kid who played Luce, and the young lady who played his girlfriend.

However Luce rises above it all and becomes a physician and at the end returns to his village in Africa to treat the child soldiers, completing the circle.

There is little tension in a film occasionally mis-billed as a thriller with any actions supposedly in place to induce suspense telegraphed by the over-qualified cast. High school teacher Harriet sets an assignment and is unaccountably shocked at central character Luce's effort, presumably because it talks about African nationalism. Harriet then, for some reason, feels compelled to search Luce's locker, finds naughty things and reports her findings to the adoptive mother played in increasingly overwrought fashion by Naomi Watts. Things escalate and it is clear that Luce can manipulate anyone from teachers to friends to his parents (who include Tim Roth playing the father as if he needs an adrenaline shot every 20 minutes). So, events come to a head with the parents making what could prove to be some very questionable decisions affecting the future of the core characters.
Then it ends.

192,metaphor1992,multi-layered masterpiece sheds light on what America is,10,9 November 2019,"Apparently reviews are split. People who find it frustrating to watch as a thriller think so because the plot doesn't give concrete proof as to what really happened. As to whom planted the fireworks in the teacher's desk, whether Luce raped his back-then girl friend at the party, whom vandalized the teacher's home, despite some hints and open speculation, there is nothing concrete. But isn't that just how life is?
However, from a political perspective, the movie is such one that I would consider a masterpiece because it outlines precisely the conflicts between different political beliefs in America, and more than that, unavoidable crash between the political and the personal. Liberal parents can adopt a child traumatized by war who later turns out to be more than just a liberal. He can be a liberal when it comes to the idea of justice and be a radical when it comes to social change; parents can hate what their child believes in yet still love him because he is their child, and sometimes even sacrifice what they believe politically to protect the family. So many scenes in the movie are open to such interpretations from my point of view.
If you leave your personal political belief and watch this view without any bias (either political or personal or moral), plus a systematic knowledge of all sorts of political views, you will see why this film is so great in its way compared to other politically out-spoken movies. The subtly and ambiguity, which normally wouldn't make a successful movie, are exactly what, personally, make this movie so good.",Luce
