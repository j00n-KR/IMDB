0,SnoopyStyle,tears and joy,8,27 February 2020,"Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie Wagner (Rose Byrne) are a husband and wife house-flipping team. The childless couple decides to be foster parents. They attend class led by social workers, Karen (Octavia Spencer) and Sharon (Tig Notaro). They are taken by outspoken teenager Lizzy at an awkward adoption fair. They decide to take in Lizzy and her two younger siblings, Juan and Lita. Their mother is in prison from her drug use.I like this version of Marky Mark with a dialed down testosterone. Rose Byrne continues to show her comedic side. The two of them form an appealing middle class couple. The kids are simply amazing. Octavia and Tig are a great comedic side duo. The subject matter is touching. It has real tears and real joy. It's a movie of beautiful emotions. I would cut back a little of Joan Cusack and the final ending. By the four months later, the movie is itching to end and it could do so quicker. This is a really good movie.",Instant Family

It has a few funny moments and plenty of contrived scenarios. It is too slapdash with a tone that is all over the place ranging from crude to sentimentality.The film wants to highlight the issues faced by kids in the American care system. However the focus is too much on Pete and Ellie who really seem to be unprepared as foster parents.",Instant Family

3,paul_haakonsen,This was a very beautiful and enjoyable movie...,7,8 June 2019,"Alright, well granted I hadn't really expected much from a movie such as ""Instant Family"", believing it to be just another quick run-of-the-mill comedy with pseudo-action star Mark Wahlberg. But still, I decided to sit down and watch this 2018 movie.It turns out that this was actually one of the better movies with Mark Wahlberg in the lead for some time, and I honestly can say that I prefer him better in the comedy genre than I do in the action genre. But naturally he wasn't the sole force carrying this movie. He had some great help by the rest of the cast, and also the fact that the storyline was so warm and heartfelt.This is the story of Pete (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (played by Rose Byrne) whom decide to adopt three children, Lizzy (played by Isabela Moner), Juan (played by Gustavo Escobar) and Lita (played by Julianna Gamiz). And it turns out that adopting three children might be a bit more than what the couple thought they were in for and bargained for. Of which there comes some great funny moments and so clashes of heads.While the story is indeed mostly driven by the comedy, there is also a more serious aspect to it, the part of adopting children and the role adopted children have in a foster family. And I think that director and writer Sean Anders really handled that quite well, managing to mix comedy and grave seriousness together in a very nice combination.The movie also had some great support appearances from Tig Notaro and Octavia Spencer, whom each individually brought something wonderful to the story, and they had really great on-screen chemistry.""Instant Family"" might actually have you in tears towards the end. Why? Well, I will not spoil that, although it is quite easy to guess why, given the synopsis of the story and the concept of the storyline. But still, it was a warm and heartfelt story and a very uplifting ending to the movie, although you saw it coming from the moment you started watching the movie.If you haven't already seen ""Instant Family"", then I can warmly recommend that you do so if you are given the chance, because it is a beautiful story, and one that will stick with you for some time.",Instant Family
4,Calicodreamin,Cute!,7,25 November 2019,Instant family is funny and heartwarming. Based on a true story it sheds real light on the foster/adoption system. The acting was great from the whole cast and the storyline had a good pace and flow. There were many touching moments and also a lot of funny moments. An easy watch.,Instant Family
5,neil-476,"Charming, touching, but a bit obvious",9,5 April 2019,"Pete and Ellie are house flippers, doing comfortably, but childless. For reasons they don't fully understand, they foster, with a view to adoption, 3 latin siblings, sweet little Lita who will only eat potato chips, accident-prone Juan who constantly apologises, and 15-year old Lizzy, smart but with attitude.You can feel your emotions being manipulated from frame one in this comedy, which is based on some truth. It is often amusing and gently touching through most of its length. Most of the drama comes from Lizzie, who wants the three siblings to be taken back by their mother, a recovering addict freshly out of jail. She also falls foul of an adult who is harassing her for nude selfies. Otherwise, the problems are as gentle as the rest of the tale and, without wishing to be over critical, possibly a little glib in their resolution.The film is nonetheless entertaining and feelgood. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne are sympathetic as Pete and Ellie, Julie Hagerty, Octavia Spencer and Margo Martindale all have fun in support, and the kids are good.And Isabela Moner as Lizzy delivers a performance which is so good that it belongs in another film (she is also gorgeous). That is now two films, Sicario 2 being the other, in which she has been outstanding. She is definitely a talent to keep an eye out for.",Instant Family
6,bombersflyup,Watchable.,4,22 February 2019,"Instant Family is almost a good film, with terrific lead performances by Wahlberg and Byrne.A bit too soppy, cutesy and silly in my opinion, with stereotypes and pandering. The two leads make it watchable and likable, but when they're not at the fore, it really struggles to stay above water. Trailer purposely avoids showing any of these things.",Instant Family
7,phd_travel,Very funny and enjoyable,10,23 February 2019,Really enjoyable movie about a couple who flip houses and foster 3 kids. Almost every scene in this movie is funny or touching. And the jokes are spontaneous and laugh out loud with witty dialogue.Rose Byrne is a good comedienne. Sweet and funny. Mark Wahlberg delivers his goofball lines well. Isabel Moner is a likeable rebellious teen. The group and foster guides including Octavia Spencer are great too.Highly recommended.,Instant Family
8,deloudelouvain,Entertaining and a good commercial for not having kids.,7,9 August 2021,"For a person that doesn't really like kids I was wondering if this could be a movie for me. To my surprise I was entertained for the entire movie. There are some funny moments that made it worth a watch. There are of course a lot of cheesy moments, I didn't expect anything less to be honest, as the subject is fostering, lonely petulant children and hopeful wannabe parents. You can guess the entire story before it even happens. The cast did a good job playing all those characters, even the kids. In short, Instant Family is entertaining, a feelgood movie for a lot of people, and a perfect commercial for not having kids if you were still hesitating. Best decision of my life, being childless, but a lot of people won't agree with that, something I don't care about to be honest. Nothing beats doing what you want whenever you want and that for your entire lifetime, something that just can't be done when you have kids. If I want to see the stress you get when having kids I'll just watch this movie and it makes me feel instantly much better.",Instant Family
9,MOscarbradley,"A genuinely funny, feelgood movie.",7,27 April 2021,"A comedy about a thirty something couple who foster three siblings is going to be sickeningly sentimental, right? Wrong! ""Instant Family"" is sentimental but also has the courage to poke fun at that very sentimentality and is genuinely funny thanks mainly to two first-rate performances from Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne as the couple and an excellent supporting cast that includes Octavia Spencer, Julie Haggerty and the great Margo Martendale. The kids, too, are just dandy and if the comedy is at times predictably broad it balances very nicely with the inevitable saccarine moment. In fact, this might be the perfect movie about kids for people who don't like movies about kids.",Instant Family
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Just add Wahlberg.,7,18 February 2019,"For me, 'Instant Family (2018)' works much more as a family drama than as a comedy, with its successful humour coming from, but always being second to, the relationship that forms between its focal foster parents and their newfound family. It's a well-conceived and relatively realistic central dynamic that's actually very satisfying when it comes full circle, even if it's somewhat rushed in places, quite sappy in others and generally pretty predictable. Indeed, it's easy to see why this piece shouldn't work. It takes a serious subject matter and, in some ways, waters in down so that it's as commercial as possible. Plus, it's oddly preachy at points - not least of which being when it promotes a movie tie-in 'learn more' website as its third credit - and manages to cram that serious stuff into a formula that's, at this point, incredibly generic. Sill, its intentions are good and its execution is undeniably effective. It may be fluff, and that's unfortunate given what it tries to tackle, but it's fun fluff, nevertheless. It's also emotionally affecting enough that I can easily see it having an impact on someone's decision to at least think about fostering a child. Whether or not the picture shows the process in it's true, unfiltered and, frankly, sometimes ugly light is a different matter, which does lead one to consider whether the possible uptake in maybe misled foster parents is necessarily all that helpful if they all meet a situation they aren't truly prepared for. This is a responsibility that I don't think is entirely on the film itself, though, even if it actively, and somewhat nobly, encourages its viewers to consider the real-life ramifications of its central conceit. Raising awareness is a valid mission-statement, regardless of how effective the final product is. In the end, this is an enjoyable and occasionally affecting family drama that isn't necessarily funny but doesn't necessarily need to be. It's generic and predictable, for sure, but it's an entertaining time and, for me, that's what really counts. 7/10",Instant Family
11,ThomasDrufke,An Absolute Joy,8,1 December 2018,"This was really the perfect movie to go see with your family over the Thanksgiving holiday, and if it holds at the box office, a great one to see around Christmas as well. Bolstered by two earnest performances from Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne, and a lovely script, Instant Family may be an instant family classic. I can't believe I'm saying that considering how bad those trailers were, but there's something about watching a genuinely well done family drama that really hits home with me. It had shades of Gifted and The Intern in all the best ways. Is it melodramatic and cheesy at times? Oh absolutely. Would I watch this again and recommend it to any family? 100%. When a film knows what it is and succeeds at what it sets out to do, it's truly a beautiful thing.8.9/10",Instant Family
12,cricketbat,I was surprised by how funny and poignant this film is,7,11 February 2019,"Having never been a foster parent, I don't know how accurate Instant Family is. However, as someone who didn't expect much from it, I was surprised by how funny and poignant this film is. It shows the ups and downs of foster care in a way that feels realistic.

13,inkblot11,"Don't wait an instant to see it, a funny and touching film!",8,26 November 2018,"Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) are a childless couple who renovate and flip houses. When Ellie's sister announces she and her husband are trying to get pregnant, Pete starts a conversation with Ellie about why they never had children. They don't quite know the answer. Soon after, the couple takes a look at foster children who are on the verge of being adoptable. Sharon (Octavia Spencer) and Karen (Tig Nitaro) are two likeable, truthful social workers who teach foster parent classes and hold adoption events. P and E take the classes, go to spy out a good-fit foster child. As they approach a group of teens, an outspoken foster girl, Lizzie (Isabela Monar) tells them they don't need to look them over, the teens know no one wants them. Oh, but now they do! Amazingly, Lizzie has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita, so Pete and Ellie agree to take all three. What a challenge for the family, including loveable dog Meatball. Lita only wants to eat potato chips, Juan is accident prone, and Lizzie is gradually more and more defiant to rules. Then, just as things get slightly better, the natural mother comes back in the picture and may want the trio returned to her. Can you say heartbreak? This lovely funny tale of trials and joys of adopting older children is wonderful. Wahlberg and Byrne are quite fine as the realistic couple with love in their hearts and fumbles in their parenting skills. Monar is fabulous as the rebellious teen while the rest of the cast, including sensational Margo Martindale, are likewise priceless. The settings, costumes, script and direction contribute to the final result of one grand movie. Don't wait an instant, movie lovers! This one is a timeless tale of love springing from tragic circumstances.",Instant Family
14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,6 March 2019,"Instant FamilyNowadays, no matter the type of child you adopt you can surgically altered them to look like you.However, the couple in this dramedy has decided to allow their kids to keep their appearances.Spurred on by her family's doubt in her, Ellie (Rose Byrne) and her husband Pete (Mark Wahlberg) move forward on adoption. With help from a foster parent group headed by quirky social workers (Octavia Spencer, Tig Notaro), Ellie and Pete welcome three Mexican-American siblings into their home. But they soon learn that raising kids, especially a teenager, isn't as easy as they thought.Although it offers some insight into the arduous adoption process that hopefuls must endure, this modern family folly is also filled with so much potty humour that it's hard to take the darker moments all that serious.Incidentally, adopting another nationality is the best way to show the world you're not a racist.

16,cruise01,"Heartwarming, funny, and a charming story about family.",9,7 March 2019,"Instant Family (4.5 out of 5 stars).Instant Family is a heartwarming, emotionally feel good comedy film that delivered with the laughs, has a heart to the story and characters. Yes, it is predictable with this type of story. But it delivers all heart and makes you appreciate everything about family and love.The plot is a relatable feel good story about a married couple Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) who never have kids and are busy with fixing up homes. They decide to adopt a teenager Lizzy (Isabela Moner) and her two young siblings Juan and Lita. They try to get along with some regular arguments and feeling like they cant take care of each other. All while, they are waiting for the court day to make the adoption final.The plot is predictable. Yes, when some dramatic moments with Lizzy being rebellious and breaking rules that Pete and Ellie set out for her. She is that rebellious teen that will hang out with friends when grounded, secretly dating an older guy, and trying to play sweet to the grandparents. Juan being a sensitive boy who is afraid of making mistakes and injury prone. Lita having anger outbursts when she does not get what she wants.Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne were great playing their characters. They are lovable and funny. They may not be great parents but hey it all takes time and learning to gain the experience of being better. It is difficult to not love them when they are on screen. They try to spoil the kids with everything but the kids are not used to it. It is heartbreaking seeing when the kids visit their real mother and they are torn up with being afraid they may lose the kids.The film does have a lot of laughs and fun humor throughout. It was one joke after another thrown in the script. And the film does take a dramatic emotional turn were it tries to be relatable with real family drama. And slip in some humor to break the serious emotional direction.Overall, Instant Family is a really good comedy film. The plot is predictable and relatable. It has a lot of heartwarming moments that will make you emotional and smile. The cast was great and Isabela Moner performance was also good as well. It has some strong drama and comedy to make this a great feel good film.",Instant Family
17,Floated2,Delivers on its intentions,7,3 September 2019,"Very few family films seem to be coming out nowadays (not including animation films) that are worthwhile. Instant Family is as expected, though somewhat more heartfelt, emotional and drama filled than initially thought of. Some trailers made it seem as a silly comedy, but there is more heart and a strong message than that. This film didn't make too much at the box office but wasn't exactly a complete flop either.The acting from the leads were good, as were the supporting performances. The film definitely had a very real-like atmosphere to it, as is which are lead to its positive reviews and strong praise. Overall, Instant Family is as expected and more. Overlooked movie if anything. Recommend for those wanting an entertaining family film.",Instant Family
18,eddie_baggins,To much cheese not enough goodness,4,7 July 2019,"Instant Family is the very definition of a Hollywood crowd-pleaser.Based on a true story, which pretty much means about 1% of this movie is true, Sean Anders film is glossy and shiny thanks to it being lathered in a liberal dosing of schmaltzy, manufactured and often irksome so called heart and soul, cooked up in the kitchens of the Hollywood machine but while it's in some ways inoffensive and easy to watch, it doesn't help make Family a very good film.Expecting a good film from the man responsible for directing such cinematic delicacies as That's My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2 and not one but two Daddy's Home films would be akin to expecting politicians to tell us the truth or for Uwe Boll to win an Oscar but thankfully Family isn't ""as"" bad as some of Anders other efforts thanks to a hint of a beating heart and a nice message about family at its core.The heart and soul of Family is the only thing saving it from becoming too much to bare, and co-lead Rose Byrne has that ability to always be engaging but for most of the time Family is so generic, predictable and genuinely not that hilarious that it's hard to recommend a viewer spending 2 hours of their life witnessing such a pedestrian and by the numbers affair.Sometimes these type of run of the mill films can be pleasing and tolerable and its never a bad thing to get what you expect but Anders and his stars struggle to make the most of the potential of this story to instead focus on over the top scenarios (school ground beatings) and annoying children (yelling about potato chips or constantly hurting themselves) and often losses sight of the simple things that would've endeared it to a much higher level.Another big issue with the film is the presence of Mark Wahlberg.A frequent collaborator with Anders thanks to the Daddy's Home franchise, Wahlberg has once more with this performance as handyman father and husband Pete, found himself delivering another fast talking, wise cracking caricature that has been plaguing his career over the last 5 or so years.We all know Wahlberg can act, we all know he can make a decent film but of late it feels as though the well-liked performer has resigned himself to easy wins, appearing in far too many films like Family that fail to raise much of a sweat for the well-paid star.Final Say -Sure to please many seeking light-hearted and even potentially heart-warming entertainment, Instant Family has its moments but a majority of its runtime is spent on generic, uninspired and eye-rolling material that's been done countless times before.2 music loving judges out of 5",Instant Family
19,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,7,7 March 2019,"Instant Family wasn't bad. I expected a boring story, but they managed to create a sweet, emotional story after all. It was a nice, not over the top, presentation of a how a family is created. Plus, the performances were good.",Instant Family
20,leonblackwood,Surprisingly Enjoyable! 6/10,6,27 January 2020,"Review:
I was in two minds about watching this movie because I thought that it was going to be another one of those typical corny comedies, with Mark Wahlberg trying to be funny, but I actually enjoyed it, from the fostering point of view. The emotional scenes were quite touching, and it was good to have an insight into the whole fostering process, even though it wasn't as deep as it could have been. The chemistry between Karen (Octavia Spencer) and Sharon (Tig Notaro) was brilliant, and the kids, Lizzy (Isabela Merced), Juan (Gustavo Escobar) and Lita (Julianna Gamiz), all put in a good performance, but Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) acted the same as they have done in other movies. The storyline was based on a true story, so I found it quite interesting throughout, but I doubt that the true parents were so naive. To take on 3 children at once must have been a daunting experience, which is why their whole bonding journey was entertaining. I would like to see this concept from a serious point of view because it's a subject that needs addressing in this day and age. Anyway, the film is about a married couple called Pete & Ellie Wagner, who are taunted by relatives who think they will never have children, so they consider adoption. They enrol in Foster Care, led by social workers Karen and Sharon. At a fair to meet foster children, Ellie voices her reluctance to adopt a teen and is confronted by 15-year-old Lizzy, who impresses Pete and Ellie. Karen and Sharon reveal that Lizzy has two siblings, 10-year-old Juan and 6-year-old Lita, and their mother is a drug addict currently in prison. The Wagners meeting with Lizzy and her siblings does not result in an immediate ""cosmic connection"", leading them to reconsider. At Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, Pete and Ellie explain they have decided not to adopt. The family admits that no one really believed they should adopt, which spurs Ellie to go through with fostering the siblings. Lizzy, Juan and Lita move in with the Wagners, whose lives become hectic. Lita refuses to eat anything but potato chips, Juan is overly emotional, and Lizzy resents Ellie's attempts to parent her. The Wagners turn to a support group of their fellow foster parents. Pete's mother Sandy wins the siblings over by taking them to Six Flags, but Lizzy disappears with friends and returns late, prompting Pete to ground her. When Pete and Ellie confront Lizzy as she leaves the house, Juan accidentally shoots a nail into his foot. Seeing Pete and Ellie rush Juan to the hospital and comfort, Lita, Lizzy begins to warm to them, and Pete invites her to vent her frustrations by demolishing a house he is renovating. Lita calls Pete ""daddy"" after he fixes her doll, and Juan tells Ellie ""Good night, mommy"" when she comforts him after a nightmare. Pete and Ellie meet Carla, the sibling's mother, who has been released from prison and wants to reunite with her children. The Wagners express their feelings to the support group, but the social workers explain the system's main goal is to keep families together, and the children might return to their biological mother. Carla's meetings with her children disrupt the Wagner household. The children become more unruly, leaving Pete and Ellie demotivated and frustrated. They are horrified to discover Lizzy taking naked pictures of herself to send to someone at school named Jacob, who sends her a naked photo of himself. Whilst taking the children to school the next day, Pete and Ellie confront a student named Charlie, mistaking him for Jacob. Discovering Jacob is actually the school's 22-year-old janitor, they beat him up and he is arrested, as are Pete and Ellie, leaving Juan and Lita in the car. Returning home after posting bail, Pete and Ellie are told by Sandy that they need to reassure Lizzy that they love her. At the children's court hearing, the judge reads a statement from Lizzy, detailing Pete and Ellie's actions in a negative light. He refuses to let Ellie read her own statement, and the children are returned to Carla's care. Juan and Lita do not want to leave the Wagners, but Lizzy is ready. Will Carla finally get her kids back, or will the Wagners keep the family that they have always wanted? I'm sure there are different aspects of the storyline that many people can relate to, which is why I think that it needed actors with a wider range, playing the lead. With that aside, it's still worth a watch because I can't remember a movie that touches on this subject matter. Although it didn't smash the box office, it still went down well with critics, and I personally found it a fun watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Sean Anders, who also brought you Never Been Thawed in 2005, Sex Drive, That's My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2 and Daddy's Home 1 & 2. Judging by his previous projects, he's obviously known for his comedic work, but this film was close to his heart, as it is based on his experience, fostering 3 children with his wife. As he has worked with Mark Wahlberg before, and Mark Wahlberg starred alongside Isabela Merced in Transformers: The Last Knight, the cast was a no-brainer, but I think that he should have taken a chance with someone else in the lead. It's definitely worth making a sequel, just to see how the family grow throughout the years, but there isn't one planned as of yet.Budget: $48million
Worldwide Gross: $120.5millionGenre: Comedy, Drama

24,jtindahouse,Not afraid to tell it like it is and it's so much better for it,9,28 November 2019,"I have so much respect for people for that adopt or take in foster children. It's such an incredibly selfless thing to do and something that can unfortunately be punishingly brutal on your life. 'Instant Family' does an excellent job of making sure this isn't a fairy tale story. It isn't afraid to show the very difficult and gritty side of things. For that the film gets a lot of respect from me.The movie obviously has a great cast but the real scene stealers were Octavia Spencer and Tig Notaro. They played off each other perfectly and nailed every opportunity they were given. Also the child actors impressed me. So often child actors are unbearable to watch on screen, but that wasn't the case here. In fact the acting was so good at times I wondered what they did to the kids to get such genuine reactions out of them.The film pulls at your heart-strings, but it never feels forced. It simply does an excellent job of making this situation everyone is in feel very realistic. With a film like this I wouldn't even worry about box office figures (I genuinely have no idea how it did). Instead I would just say that if it motivates one person/family to adopt or take in a foster child then it has been worth every cent poured into it. A great film.",Instant Family

This movie was written and directed by Sean Anders-Daddy's Home 1 & 2, Horrible Bosses 2, That's My Boy-and is based on his own experiences in adopting his own children. Mark and Rose play a financially successful childless couple that decide to adopt a child-their parents & friends are pressuring them about having kids. Octavia plays the adoption go-between that is having a meet & greet of adoptable children and perspective parents. Isabela plays the teen that catches Mark & Rose's attention but Isabela comes with 2 more siblings, so it's a threefer. Have Mark & Rose taken on more than they can handle? This is a comedy but it does have touching moments, too. Isabela's birth mother comes back into the picture to complicate matters and there are issues to deal with as to who should have custody of the children-plus, who the children want to go with.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language, drug references and sexual material-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.

30,jimbo-53-186511,"Charming and pleasant enough, but is Anders really telling us the whole story?",6,24 April 2020,"A couple make the bold decision to adopt some children and enrol on an 8 week Adoption programme. They eventually settle on 3 children whom have come from a broken home (they are charmed by the eldest child who is assertive and outspoken). However, they soon feel that they may have bitten off more than they can chew as the 3 kids are a bit of a handful which means that challenging times lay ahead for the budding 'foster' parents...I think this is the first time I've watched a film that's based on a true story that has both been directed by and written by the person whom the story is based upon. Normally, when watching a true story it would be directed by X who has adapted a novel from Y or directed by X and Y has written the screenplay, but here literally everything has come straight from the horses mouth and as director Anders has clearly presented everything artistically how he wanted to .In a way this is good as he has followed the tried and tested narrative formula to make this a real crowd-pleaser; the doting 'foster' parents that although they are flawed still show undying love for their foster children, the rebellious kids who start out hating their foster parents, but slowly start to warm to them as they begin to 'get to know' them. The 'real' mother arriving back on the scene posing a threat to the 'foster' parents just by way of being the children's mother as opposed to doing anything of worth which makes the 'foster' parents feel undermined for all the hard work they've put in.Part of the problem I had with a lot of what I saw is that it all felt a bit clean, cute and neat and I can't help but feel that Anders may have omitted certain things in order to pander more to his audience. OK so the kids come from a broken home whereby their mother was an alcoholic (I think she may also have been a drug addict) and yet all we really see from these kids is some brattish behaviour that could be exhibited by kids from any social background. I never felt the children's pain from such a turbulent upbringing which meant that I was never really drawn into the film. The same could be said for the kids biological mother whom we learn nothing about - you feel as though there could have been at least 1 or maybe 2 short scenes showing the mother with her children and how she interacts with them - this would at least explain why the eldest child is so drawn to her mother as there's certainly no motivation given within the film. Perhaps Anders omitted such scenes because he didn't know all that much about their mother and any such bond that she may have had, but I'm not convinced and think that he really just wanted to tell 'his' story which is why that angle of the narrative was developed only superficially.On the plus side, Rose Byrne and Mark Wahlberg are both superb here and they had me convinced that they really loved and cared for their foster children (even if they didn't always go about things the correct way). The kids were cute as well without ever being annoying and as I've already said it's difficult to really hate a film with a feel-good factor as high as is seen in Instant Family.Still I can't shake this notion that Instant Family is a little sugar-coated and I do find it hard to believe that the kids that we saw here were the offspring of a woman who had caused them so much emotional damage as kids - like I say they don't come off as being too emotionally scarred. I reckon there may be a darker underbelly to this story that Anders didn't want to tap into, but I guess we'll never know and I may have to leave that as my little conspiracy theory or perhaps I'm over-analysing the film. Who knows?Still I have to admit despite some of what I've said it is cute and charming and is a difficult film not to like.",Instant Family

37,rgkarim,BEEP Your Instant Family review!,8,18 November 2018,"Family, a blessing and curse at many times. It is a source of conversation and entertainment that Hollywood loves to rub in our faces. Hence, when you get movies that are about making fun of families in super ridiculous manners, one can't help but lower expectations on the quality of these films. So yours truly walked in with low expectations of tonight's review, thinking I was in store for more silly slapstick tricks. What lies in store for this film past the trailers? Robbie K here hoping to fill you in on another detailed review as we explore:Movie: Instant Family (2018)Director:
Sean Anders
Writers:
Sean Anders, John Morris
Stars:
Mark Wahlberg, Rose Byrne, Isabela Moner
LIkES:Comedy: The movie is indeed a comedic adventure into foster parenting, and while the likes of Daddy's Home seemed to ring hard in the trailer for me, that wasn't the case in this film. Instant Family manages to achieve the fleeting goal of balancing styles of laughter including slapstick antics, banter, insult humor, and crossing boundaries with cursing. Such a style allows for the gimmicks to remain fresh over the course of the movie and bring with it plenty of guffaws, chortles, and whatever sounds you make with humor.The Story: Heartwarming is certainly the element of this tale, doing a fantastic job of the inspiration from the stories of foster families. Instant Family crosses into the realms of this unique parenting setting, bringing all the issues and emotions that come with it. It's simplistic, linear tale allows for many things to be stuffed into the film, working hard to keep to its roots, but explored the small hairs that help absorb the dynamic material that the writers seeded it with. As such, the story has enough components to make my next few likes further support the film.Fun: To be family friendly for some, means to tread down the ""pure"" path where only G-rated jokes and language can be instilled in the movie. While I can acknowledge this, it limits the audiences who can enjoy this to the fullest. Fortunately, Instant Family saw this and managed to find that balance of styles to keep it relatively PG to PG-13, opening up to more audience members and keeping the film very fun to watch. Yes, there is language, and a few more adult themes not made for sensitive ears.Emotional: Some of my friends have stated they teared up at just the trailer alone. Well, the audience in my showing today was sobbing, sniffling, and tearing up at the feelings thrown into the mix. And while preachy at times, Instant Family sells the lessons in full force, captivating you further into the film and really selling the love this family was trying to portray. It brings so many wonderful feelings out into the light, which will be a wonderful compliment to the film.Relatable: Certainly we aren't all in foster programs, but Instant Family brings with it enough issues about a variety of topics to find something relate to. How to handle anger, how to deal with out of control kids, teenage angst issues, love, confidence, and plenty of other pieces that maybe we could all stand to learn. As such, the story had a greater effect on me, allowing me to sort of place myself in each character's shoes and enjoy seeing how the characters grew during the trials they faced. If you are like me, the relatability of a film can really bring an extra factor to the movie and I feel this film will affect the people in a positive way to further enhance the film.Balance: The key to the success of this movie is balance. Over all the likes mentioned in the previous categories, the underlying foundation is that the director and writers managed to find a way to make all these styles work together. Outside of all the aforementioned categories, Instant Family also found a way to utilize the characters very well. The kids limitations and character's annoying habits are fine tuned to reach that equilibrium between annoying and too underdone. Wahlberg's talents weren't overdone and Byrne managed to rain her normal maneuvers to new levels that again seemed very well tuned. As such, Instant Family managed to surprise me with how they juggled so many plots, morals, and other components in such a short time. That was the key to taking this movie to new levels and something other films need to study for future film making.DISLIKES:The Predictability: A small dislike in the grand scheme of things, Instant Family does not deviate far from the formulaic presentation that Hallmark has made famous. A few twists and turns could have provided some opportunity for even deeper growth, or perhaps a few more montages of the fun times to help dilute the predictability. Sure this may not be the key point they were shooting for, but as a reviewer, throwing some surprises in could have sailed this movie even further.A Few Throw Away Characters: Another small detail, but Instant Family snuck in a few characters that brought some interesting avenues to explore. They were complete to some extent, but a few of these characters could have been left out, erased from sight due to the little contribution they provided.The Kid InEquilibrium: The main kid who got the attention was the teenager Lizzy. I'll recognize and appreciate the context of teenage angst, but why did the other kids, whose flaws were magnified at the early part of the movie. These components seemed to be swept under the rug, with little portrayal of dealing with these problems, often resorting to a comedic device to justify their inclusion. Thus, the a restructuring of their involvement could have been the key to furthering the movie.
Over The Limit sometimes: The worst thing for me in this film, are the few times the comedy became more insulting than funny for me. In this time of political correct statements, there are some dialogue moments and banter that sort of step on the appropriate way to phrase things. These jokes often feel more like insults and as such, not appreciating these moments that went far. Again, nothing like an R rated movie, but still something that took away from the film for me.The VERDICT:I agree with the recent trailers, Instant Family is indeed the big surprise of this week. It's sweet, with a passionate charm that and relevant plot to grab attentions and hold them in their place. These balances of so many plot points is what helped achieve this quality and certainly is worth studying/noting for your future film needs. I'll admit they crossed the line a bit, and didn't quite maximize the potential they held. Still, with all the fun I had and the ability to show empathy to fictional characters I think is enough persuasion to call you into the hallowed halls of the theater.My scores are:Comedy/Drama: 8.5

39,nancyldraper,Hesitant but pleased,7,24 November 2018,"Full disclosure: I only enjoy a small margins of comedies. I avoid over-the-top comedies, slap stick comedies, or low-and-crude comedies, so because Mark Wahlberg was starring in this film, I was hesitant. But, I'm a fan of Rose Byrne, was OK with the trailers and curious about the situation, so I took a chance. And, despite the tone of the comedy being hyperbolic, there were some very touching moments. And... I was so pleased that I liked this movie. The story was humorous, the predicaments were plausible, the situations were heart pulling, the acting was solid (YAY Rose Burne, Octavia Spencer, Tig Notaro, Margo Martindale), the kids were cute, Isabela Moner was a stand out talent (she even kills it with her vocal talents during the credits).

41,martimusross,"Disappointing, Just Not Funny Enough",5,16 February 2019,"This movie promised to be super funny from the trailer but sadly fell short, I laughed a few times out loud but overall it just was disappointing.The humour lay in pitching perfect parent against horrible parent, if it had stuck to this, like Bad Teacher, it would have worked but it strayed into sentimental mush and serious issues.The contrived idea that you try a child before you ""buy"" is just not funny and does not cut it as a basis for any plot. In reality either the state or the parent decides a child is for adoption and that is it, no returns, and fostering is temporary at the beginning middle and end and is a £300 quid a week business for many.I felt so much was forced and contrived and the formula just did not work.

As simple as that.This is a quaint, chirpy little comedy that both me and my girlfriend really enjoyed.
All the performances are great, the humour is light and effective.
Several times my girlfriend commented on how on-the-nose the situational pieces were when it came to raising small children.Now the downers.This is basically an advert for the fostering services, which is fine by me, but the references and statistics that are slid in do break immersion now and then.
But not a problem for me.The film really pushes the American Dream. It is like being pinned to the hood of a Cadillac and having apple pie rammed down your throat whilst it is driven through an endless line of white picket fences.
But, as an envious Brit, this was not a problem for me.As this movie revolves around child care it touches on aspects of gender role, race, class and, sexuality.
This means that from feminists to traditionalist to racists there is more than enough content here for people to get upset about if they choose to.
Because of this I am sure this films rating is going to sink over time.This was witty, emotional, a little bit silly and generally a lovely waste of a two hours.",Instant Family

50,rockman182,Instant Family (2018),7,20 November 2018,"The film did a good job of using George Harrison's ""What Is Life?"" in its trailer because it makes you want to see the trailer multiple times just to hear that sweet song. In effect, you end up wanting to see the film. I didn't have that many qualms about seeing it as is, you don't have to ask me twice to see a Rose Byrne and Marky Mark pairing. Its been a weekend of good films actually and it doesn't really stop here. I did enjoy Instant Family quite a bit, a good film that does well mixing humor and drama.The film is about a couple who are on the fence about having children. After much consideration they decide that they want to foster children. The task becomes tough as they take in a teenager and her two siblings. They soon realize that it is a lot to take in and then start to wonder if they are really equipped for the task. Soon, the children start to grow on them and their unconventional family starts to bond. This is another collaboration between Daddy's Home director Sean Anders and Mark Wahlberg, also the second with Wahlberg and Isabelle Moner.The film you can say follows the formulaic family film style, sure. It still manages to be funny mostly through really good performances by both Wahlberg and Byrne. Moner herself does well as a rebellious teenager who does not trust her new foster parents. It's what you would expect from this type of film, a whirlwind of trouble but one that eventually knows how to hit the right notes. The child actors do fine to supplement the story and play to their types as a little hellraiser and a nervous klutz who apologizes for everything.It's nice to see simple films do what it needs to do to bring an entertaining family film. I think the cast really shines here and the film remains a heartwarming story that has a satisfying resolution. Its also nice that this film is based on a true story and there are many other cases of similar stories of parents adopting fosters and taking them out of an overcrowded system. If you need some time to unwind at the cinema, this certainly is not a bad choice.7/10",Instant Family
51,MuviFan73,A success story about foster parents & adopted kids.,8,25 February 2019,The story is how a family gets the custody of three foster kids despite the ups and downs involved in the process.It also highlights the factors helping one to go ahead with the decision to adopt foster kids weighing the elements like ethics and financial competence.There are movies out there that highlight a group or a community. I thank Mark Wahlberg to give us a movie that belongs to a 'Family'. The community meetings and the pictures portrayed as the movie approaches end highlights this factor.It's a feel good movie you will incline to like (even more if you belong with the one in success stories).,Instant Family
52,Holt344,"Instant Family balances out the drama and comedy in a perfect way, it also got a lot of heart thanks to the wonderful direction and acting from Mark and Rose",9,12 March 2021,"Instant Family is directed by Sean Anders who wrote the screenplay with John Morris, what you might not know is that Sean Anders took inspiration of his own experiences and it really shows. I didn't think the film would have this much depth and heart out into it, I expected more of a comedy, it's a very humorous film and it's thanks to the actors and how well written it is as the writing valances out the drama and comedy elements.Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne plays Peter ""Pete"" Wagner and Elinore ""Ellie"" Wagner, the parents who decide to adopt three young children. Isabela Moner portrays Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Wagner who is the oldest of the three children. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne's performances were perfect and believable, they nailed everything about their performances. Mark is a natural when it comes to comedy in a way that it feels natural.
The cast is amazing but I'll name one other actress and it's Octavia Spencer, she plays one of the social worker who guides the parents through the foster care process. Octavia Spencer nails the comedy aspect of the film, her performance isn't anything mind blowing but I know she got that acting skills but she's great in this and also really funny.Instant Family is an excellent and memorable experience that takes up some very important things, Sean Anders direction and script is a major part of why this movie works so well. I think this is a film that everyone should watch at least once, there's a good chance you'll enjoy it. I certainly did.",Instant Family
53,RforFilm,"It's not for everyone, but Instant Family is a nice look about a new family coming together, even with the complications of foster care",6,19 November 2018,"Thanksgiving is almost upon us. During this time of turkey and parades, I can say that I'm already thankful for the home that my parents have given me and my brother. It wasn't until my friends started to have their own children that I didn't understand how much it changes them. Gone are the late night parties. Gone are the easy vacations. Gone is the freedom to eat whatever you want. It's not that these things need to be followed, but in order to be a great parent, that involves not only raising a little one, but raising yourself.Parents can understand that, but once they become critical about their kids, they then have to take a look at themselves to see if their following their own philosophy. It's a lot like when parents don't want their kids eating sweets, even though they may sneak in a cupcake when their not looking. Everything comes back to what kind of example are they and how can that make everyone's lives better. My parents are not the same people they were in their twenties, but they still seem like genuinely happy people. See how two people rethink their lives in Instant Family.Pete (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Elle (played by Rose Byrne) Wagner are a happily married couple and successful home flippers who seem to be enjoying their situation. The thought of kids haven't crossed their mind, but after hearing about how foster care kids are in need of better environments, they both decide to go to an orientation. They are shown by social workers Karen (played by Octavia Spencer) and Sharon (played by Tig Notaro) about how hard it's going to be. They also show that the kids that often don't get selected are teenagers.They go to a foster open house where they see plenty of other people looking for little kids. Elle notices the teens are being left alone, but does speak a bit with a spunky girl Lizzy (played by Isabella Moner). After considering, they decide to take her. What they don't realize is that she also comes with her two siblings, a boy Juan and a girl Lita. Still, they accept and set up their home the best they can to make it confortable. While dealing with raising children and a teenager, they also deal with the social services, a support group, and the kids original mother being released from prison.Instant Family knows what it wants to be; a family friendly, comedy-drama that wants to portray the complexities of raising other peoples kids and the foster care system. I admire them gratefully for doing so, because this is a movie that'll hit the right spots for it's audience. I'm probably not in that demographic, but I was surprised by not only how much they let Mark Wahlberg be...himself, but it was willing to go into the darker issues...or at least as much as it can with a family-friendly tone.Most parents can agree that raising teenagers is tough and the movies focus is on Lizzie and her relationships with everyone. Not just being a new daughter, but as someone whose had to play a second mother for her siblings. This is why Isabella Monor, who was in Sicario 2, may be my favorite player. She has the angst of an ordinary teenager, but you can feel that extra weight she's had to deal with. I kind of wish more could have been gone into with the younger siblings, as they seem to be more like one note kids; ones a scaredy-cat and the other only wants what she wants. It's fine to take that, but I think both could have benefited from exploring their relationship with their original mother.I'll give this six family dinners out of ten. While this is not for me, it's harmless enough that I can still recommend this for families or anyone in general who care about children. It may be playing it safe in some areas, but there are some smart choices to. If your in that mindset, check it out and be thankful for own parents.",Instant Family

56,bob-the-movie-man,Enjoyable and harmless comedy laced with a degree of sentimentality.,7,26 January 2019,"Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) are focused and business-oriented home designers. They've talked about having kids ""sometime in the future"" but the years - as years are want to do - are motoring away from them. Pete is concerned that if they have their own kids now then he will end up being an ""old dad"" (cue very funny, black-comedy, flashback). This leads them into contact with the State's fostering service - led by Karen (Octavia Spencer) and Sharon (Tig Notaro) - and they progress into foster training. This introduces into their 'perfect adult lives' 15-year old Lizzy (Isabela Moner) and her younger siblings Juan (Gustavo Quiroz) and Lita (Julianna Gamiz). As these guys come from a troubled background Pete and Ellie find they have their work cut out. Who will crack first?Wahlberg and the excellent Rose Byrne make a believable driven-couple, and Byrne has such a range of expressive faces that she can't help but make you laugh.Of the child actors, Nickelodeon star Isabella Moner shines with genuine brilliance, both in terms of her acting as the fiercely loyal Lizzy but also in terms of her musical ability (she sings the impressive end-title song). With Hollywood in 'post-La-La-Showman: Here we go again' mode, this is a talented young lady I predict might be in big demand over the next few years.Top of my list of the most stupid ""where the hell have I seen her before bang-my-head-against-the-cinema-wall"" moments is the actress playing Ellie's mother Jan. She is OF COURSE Julie Hagerty, air-hostess supreme from ""Airplane!"".Also good value, and topping my list of ""I know her from lots of films but don't know her name"" is Margo Martindale* as Pete's exuberant and easily bought mother Sandy.The script by director Sean (""Daddy's Home"") Anders and John Morris zips along at a fine pace, albeit in a wholly predictable direction. It helps that I struggle the think of many films about the adoption process itself. Sure there have been lots of movies about children that have been adopted - Manchester By The Sea and Lion being two recent examples - but the only film I can immediately think of (and not in a good way) with foster care at its heart was the Katherine Heigl comedy from a few years ago ""Life as we know it"". So this is good movie territory to mine.There are some fine running jokes, notably young Juan's penchant for constantly getting injured. However, the script also lapses as did Anders' ""Daddy's Home 2"" from last year - into moments of slushy sentimentality. I would have preferred a harder and blacker edge to the comedy: something that last year's excellent ""Game Night"" pulled off so well.There are also a couple of characters in the film that were poorly scripted and which just didn't work. While Octavia Spencer was fine (channelling an almost identical version of her wisecracking and sardonic character from ""The Shape of Water""), I just had no idea what her colleague Sharon (Tig Notaro) was supposed to be. The tone was all over the place. Similarly, who should pop up on a balcony in an unexpected cameo but the great Joan Cusack. And very funny she is too for the 10 second interruption. But the writers having got her there just couldn't leave alone and we get a plain embarrassing extended interruption that strikes a duff note in the flow of the film.The film is amusing and harmless without taxing many brain cells. Most notably unlike many so-called American 'comedies' it did actually make me laugh at multiple points. I should also point out that my wife absolutely loved it, rating it a strong 8/10 going on 9/10.But the really cute thing is that the film is ""inspired by a true family"": namely Anders' own. He and his wife fostered three kids out of the US foster service, so the script is undoubtedly loosely based on their own experiences, which give it an extra impact for some of Peter and Ellie's lines. It gives you a completely different perspective on the film knowing this. My wife after the film was saying ""I'm not sure how accurately it portrays the fostering process"". But it clearly does.(For the full graphical review please visit One Mann's Movies on the web or on Facebook. Thanks.)",Instant Family
57,kjproulx,A Family Film That's Deeper Than Expected,9,30 November 2018,"Family-friendly fare is hard to come by in terms of quality content, due to the fact that every story has pretty much been told. While Instant Family isn't the most original film out there, it sure works very hard to win over audiences. I wasn't looking forward to this one very much because the ads looked very formulaic and unfunny to me. Surprisingly, I can't recommend this film enough. It's very rare that I find a film that I had no interest in, that I end up nearly falling in love with. Sure, this is a breezy watch for families of all ages, but this is a very sweet story, told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, while also remaining genuine and authentic from start to finish. This may be a studio trying to earn a quick buck with families, but if that's the only negative, there's no reason I can't recommend this one to everyone.Following Pete and Ellie as they decide to adopt a teenager, they quickly realize their lives are about to be flipped upside down, due to the fact that Lizzy (their adoption choice) comes with two younger siblings as well. Willing to take the risk, they adopt three children and their daily routines are forever changed. With great progression in terms of coming to terms with reality, this movie balances the perspectives of the children, as well as the adults, equally, which was a breath of fresh air. This movie never chose sides as to who was right or wrong in this story, but rather let the audience decide for themselves what they thought the right choices should be.Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne lead this film and they actually have surprisingly great on-screen chemistry. Even though I believe they both sold their roles very well and seemed to be completely invested, I believe the standout performance came from the oldest daughter in Isabela Moner. Not having seen much of her in the past, I must admit I wasn't expecting her performance to be as good as it was. She portrayed someone who would be in this position in such a believable and real way. Yes, the movie is slightly tame so that it's accessible to everyone, but that's not a negative towards this film at all. For the material she was given, I was emotionally invested from beginning to end.Being directed by Sean Anders, I had very little faith that I'd like this film, because his work on Daddy's Home, Horrible Bosses 2, and That's My Boy was pretty less than stellar, at least in my opinion. Luckily, even directors who have had a streak of weak pictures can have a good day at the office and I believe he knocked this one out of the park. I had pretty much counted out ever hyping up one of his future films, but I'll now be awaiting his next career choice. I usually find myself saying the opposite about filmmakers, but I honestly can't express how much this film caught me by surprise.Instant Family may not have been a film on your radar, but it should be. Filled with emotion, comedy in the right places, and an overall dramatic tone that I think many viewers will fall in love with, this film comes very highly recommended from me. Yes, it's predictable and yes it doesn't take many risks, but the execution of each storyline is extremely commendable. At its core, this film is an ad for adopting children, but it does such a great job telling this story that the ad feels like a worthy conclusion to the movie. I loved watching this movie. Instant Family deserves your attention.",Instant Family

69,sweidman-28016,Enjoyable Happy Feel-Good Movie,7,16 November 2018,"Instant Family Review:Instant Family is comedy based on the true story of a married couple, Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne), who decide to foster three kids and they must face the challenges that come with it. This was a very enjoyable happy, feel-good movie. The story was very interesting, yet predictable, that made you feel for the people. Both Mark and Rose did a good job. Isabella Moner as Liszt, the oldest child, was probably the best part of the film. She brought so much to the table and gave it all she had. She was also in the recent summer movie sequel Sicario: Day of the Saldado and she did well in that too. The other two kids, Gustavo Quiroz (Juan) and Julianna Gamiz (Lita), we're very good child actors. Octavia Spencer was hilarious and amazing as always. This movie had some great humor. It could also be serious and knew how to switch tones well. It was a little bit long, just about two hours, and I felt that some scenes could've been cut out. Also we didn't know much of a background for Pete and Ellie so I didn't feel as strong as a connection for them as I wanted to. Another thing is the trailer kind of showed the whole movie with some stuff taken out, which I've seen a lot of trailers doing that lately (Welcome to Marwen). This is a very enjoyable film and I think people will like it. It probably won't make as much money with Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald coming out and many more, but I would recommend it.My Grade: B+",Instant Family

Two social workers, Karen and Sharon, guide the hopeful parents on the steps to getting into becoming adoptive parents. The couples are brought to a fair where they have the chance to go up to kids that they are interested in adopting. Pete and Ellie walk by the teenagers, although Ellie shows hesitance over raising a teen, but one of the teens, Lizzie, informs Ellie that they all know no one wants to adopt the teens.Pete and Ellie talk to Karen and Sharon over potentially taking in Lizzie. The social workers inform the couple that Lizzie's mother is a drug addict who is currently in jail, and she set their home on fire because she left the crack pipe lit. It also turns out that Lizzie has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita. Although this seems like more of a challenge for Pete and Ellie, they agree to meet the siblings.Pete and Ellie have Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, where they all make comments about never having confidence in the Wagners adopting kids. Ellie has enough and decides that they will go through with the foster care to prove that they can be good parents.Lizzie, Juan, and Lita begin to live with the Wagners. Although it is initially pleasant, it doesn't take long for things to get hectic. Lita refuses to eat anything but potato chips, and Juan reacts sensitively to every instance of trouble. Lizzie is also frequently bratty toward the Wagners, but especially Ellie. The two parents frequently attend support groups with the other couples for insight on what to do with the kids.Pete's mother Sandy comes to visit to meet the kids, and instantly wins them over by treating the whole family to Six Flags. While there, Lizzie runs off with two friends from school. She doesn't reappear until later, and Ellie grounds her for not informing her or Pete as to her whereabouts.Although Lizzie remains bratty, Juan and Lita start to warm up to the Wagners. Lita calls Pete ""daddy"" when he fixes her doll, and Ellie gets a ""Good night, mommy"" from Juan after she comforts him from a nightmare. Soon, Lizzie starts to go along with the others as they partake in family activities. Pete even invites her to a fixer-upper he is working on so they can wreck things for her to take out her frustrations.Pete and Ellie later find out that the kids' mother Carla has been out of prison for a few months and she wants to see the kids. They express their feelings about this during the group therapy, but the social workers tell them that their main goal is to keep families together.Pete and Ellie seek out the Fernandez family, who had spoken with their adoptive daughter Brenda at the training, for help with Lizzie. They inform the Wagners that Brenda is back in rehab, but Mrs. Fernandez tells them what a process it is to really form a bond and trust with the kids.The couple is horrified when they find Lizzie taking naked selfies to send to a guy at school named Jacob, and he sends her a naked photo of himself. When they take the kids to school the next day, they confront a boy named Charlie since they mistook him for Jacob. They then realize that Jacob is actually the school's 22-year-old janitor, and chase him into the school and assault him. Jacob is arrested, but so are Pete and Ellie, leaving Juan and Lita alone in the car, while Lizzie is humiliated. When Pete and Ellie return home, they are told by Sandy that they need to reassure Lizzie that they love her, because she doesn't feel that she is loved.The Wagners and the kids gather for a court hearing to decide whether or not the kids will go back to Carla or stay with Pete and Ellie. The judge reads a statement written by Lizzie detailing the things that Pete and Ellie have done. Although Ellie tries to read a new statement, the judge won't let her. Carla is then given rights to the kids.Pete and Ellie sadly start to pack things up for the kids. Juan and Lita do not want to go, but Lizzie is ready. However Karen and Sharon arrive to the house to inform Lizzie that Carla is not coming to get them, as she started using again. Heartbroken, Lizzie runs away while Pete and Ellie chase her.

It is about a couple that decide to be Foster parents and bring home 3 kids, yes they are Hispanic. The film deals mostly comedically with situation, but also has some heartfelt drama.

77,movieman6-413-929510,Instant Family shows the positive and negative sides of starting a family.,6,3 February 2019,"Instant Family is a new drama comedy directed and partly written and produced by Sean Anders, director of the Daddy's Home movies and Horrible Bosses 2.
In the film, the couple Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie Wagner (Rose Byrne) are looking for a way to fill the void in their marriage. In this way they come to a foster family center where counselor Karen (Octavia Spencer) takes them to a funfair together with other couples. Here the couples get the chance to observe all foster children to see which they seem to be the most suitable to become foster parents. At the fair the couple meets the rebellious teenager Lizzy (Isabela Moner). The couple learns that she is in the foster family center, because her mother is a drug addict who is currently in prison. Pete and Ellie accept the challenge and take Lizzy into the house, but the two learn that Lizzy can only go along if she also takes her younger brother and sister into the house. The two agree to the deal after consultation and are now at home with three foster children. Pete and Ellie learn that having a family involves many difficult situations, but they later also learn about the positive aspects of having a family.
Director Sean Anders has inspired this film on real events that he himself has experienced. He has, together with his wife, actually adopted children and the experiences he has experienced with these children in his life in this film.This film shows so well what the positive but also the negative aspects of having a family or taking children. The film does this with a good mix of comedy and drama aspects. This film can also come across as instructive for people who themselves think of taking or adopting children.Unfortunately, the comedy aspect is sometimes a bit too big in the film, which sometimes weakens the drama aspect of the film and does not really catch on with the viewers. The comedy aspects are also sometimes predictable and especially if you are familiar with situations from comedy films.The acting is well done by the cast. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne have a good and fun chemistry in the film. They come across as realistic as a couple who try to adopt children. The young actors who play the foster children also perform well acting. This is also one of their first film roles for Gustavo Quiroz and Julianna Gamiz, who play the two young foster children. Isabela Moner had in Transformers: The Last Knight because of the bad script and in Sicario: Day of the Soldado because of the messy script not the ability to show her acting skills. In this film she gets a better chance to show her acting skills. In this film she also plays a real teenager instead of a child. The three foster children also come together realistically as real siblings.
Unfortunately, this film has too big a cast with too many supporting roles, all of which bring out their own comedy aspect in the film. This may cause the film to appear too full or too messy. The nicest supporting roles are played by Octavia Spencer and Margo Martindale, who plays the mother of Mark Wahlberg's character.",Instant Family
78,CountJonnie,Mispromoted as a comedy,6,27 February 2019,"Instant Family follows a couple who adopt 3 children and struggles with the process, the kids and their future. What keeps this movie up, is the incredibly good acting. Especially by Wahlberg and the kids.Other than that, the movie switches from comedy to drama too often. Especially Rose Byrne is hard to take seriously, and by the time you're able to, the movie is already over. As great as the acting is during the drama scenes, the dramatic parts (sexting, anger tantrums etc.) are delt with too swift and sudden.The comedy is brilliant, subtle, well timed, but underused. This shouldn't be a problem, but since it was promoted as a comedy, with many of the funny moments already in the trailer, the movie might feel misleading. This if of course up to the viewer, but we stepped in with the wrong expectations. Same goes for the many extra actors (family, friends, fosters) who felt as 'fillers' and only served comedic purposes, but never got to portray meaningful relationships.This doesn't make it a bad movie. It's pretty decent and it'll eventually leave you behind feeling good.

85,asifahsankhan,A good family movie,8,13 December 2018,"The best thing I can say about Sean Anders' lovely new movie Instant Family is that it made me consider fostering children, something I had never even begun to consider in my entire life. It's not that the movie shies away from how hard fostering can be-if anything, the movie leans into the difficulties of fostering. Rather, Instant Family does a public service about the foster system and then packages it in a charming comedy that prevents the story from ever being preachy or mawkish. There's a surprising amount of bite in Instant Family, but none of it is mean-spirited or at the expense of foster children. It's a movie where the judgment is reserved for those who take the responsibility of fostering too lightly, and while the film has a glossy Hollywood sheen, it's deeply earnest about the importance of foster care.Some will likely find that Instant Family is a little too cloying or that it doesn't go far enough in depicting the hard realities of the foster care system, and those are fair criticisms. When tackling social issues, it's almost always possible to do better. But to levy those complaints against the film would be to miss how much it's doing right, and how compelling it can be for an audience that doesn't mind seeing a light family comedy, but also might be a bit more reluctant to watch a documentary or an indie about the challenges of foster care. By presenting this topic within the comforts of a familiar genre, Anders has found a way to bring light to an important issue that some audience members have never considered.",Instant Family
86,itsbobr,An Uplifting Story,9,8 March 2019,"Inspired by true eventsPete (Mark Walberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) decide to Foster-Care 3-children.If you think this is another comedy or a comedy of errors, think again. There are comedic moments in here - to be sure - and some are quite funny, but this is a serious look at Foster-Care and the pitfalls that can and will most likely occur.The three children are Lizzy (Isabela Moner) who is a street-wise teenager; Juan (Gustavo Quiroz) about 6-yrs and sensitive; and Lita (Julianna Gamiz) about 4-yrs and tantrum prone. Keep in mind these kids were in several foster care homes that did not make them feel safe or like family. What we see are the kids ruling the roost and Pete and Ellie don't lay the law down and provide the structure the kids need and this goes on for a long time. Their birth mom is a drug addict, who is trying to get clean and take her kids back.We see a Foster-Care Support group run by Social Workers Sharon (Tig Notaro) and Karen (Octavia Spenser) and this is like an Alcoholics Anonymous group setting where they all sit in a circle and tell about their experiences. These scenes are quite revealing, and funny at times. Their job is to help potential parents learn the rules that will help them. At times Sharon and Karen act like an Abbot and Costello act and this also give rise to chuckles.For a long time we see the frustrations of Pete and Ellie trying to be good parents and the kids don't help much. Well, actually not at all. Both Wahlberg and Byrne do a very good job as Pete and Ellie trying to do the right thing. Nothing is overdone and we see a serious side to them wondering if they did the wrong thing with this Foster Care.Notable: Margo Martinsdale at Grandma Sandy, Pete's mother and she is a hoot in here.Things finally come to a head when the kids' birth mother goes to court to get her kids back. Here most of the comedy stops.This is a good story, an important story for promoting Foster Care. I am sure many of the instances within a Foster Care family in general weren't shown in here and perhaps were too depressing to relate in this story. But there are pitfalls and real problems as this movie tries to show.There is a notice for those interested in Foster Care just before the credits run and we see many pictures of real Foster Care families and their kids.

My parents had went out and saw it when it first come out and said it was fantastic. As time went on I kept hearing how good this movie was. So finally I decide to watch it. It was really good like people had been telling me. I loved the idea of this movie it talked about adopt which was nice. The movie was very emotional. It was also full with funny and dramatic moments. It showed a lot of the sides of adopting kids and how it can be. I loved the way they told this story. It was great. I loved the storyline, plot, characters, character development and the emotions that this movie made you feel. They were all really well done. There not one thing I disliked about the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone no matter there age. It a great movie that you must watch at least once in your life.",Instant Family
93,isaacochoterena,Very good movie,8,4 October 2021,"This movie is very emotional and at the same time funny.With an unconventional story, this film manages to feel us in the place of the protagonists, with a good direction, good performances and a quite convincing script. The only thing that doesn't convince me is the duration, it feels too long for the story that unfolds.For me the story works very well as well as the balance between the comic and the sentimental, it is a quality film that everyone should see.",Instant Family

95,n-kefala,The family movie that you need,8,31 March 2019,"This movie it is a welcome surprise. ""Instant family"" isn't too cliche as a feel-good family movie, and it has its heart in the right place within a genre that has set the bar low. The emotional scenes - both happy and sad - are genuinely emotional. The strong chemistry among the cast allows this... instant family to feel authentic. It is a charming and realistic portrayal of fostering children led by beautiful performances by Rose Byrne and Mark Wahlberg and the kids are also superb. The film succeed to touch on the difficult, testing and heart-breaking moments of having an instant family. It is moving, fun and entertaining. This is a far more thoughtful and accomplished family comedy than expected. nikisreviews.gr",Instant Family
96,apjc,"Enjoyed it, bringing up kids with added attitude.",8,23 February 2019,"I admit I only watched this due to viewer comments, the vast majority being so spot on. It covered just about everything on this topic with all the emotions that entails. Some might say predictable, but as an avowed cynic I still like a story that ends well, escapism never hurt anyone. Thing that may annoy some is this is your near perfect white middle class couple living the American Dream, who decide to have kids by selecting a few of those available. The film actually deals with that by throwing in disparate couples travelling the same journey. It's well worth watching.",Instant Family

98,beachy-38431,Amazing Movie,10,23 November 2018,"This movie was my wife's choice. I'm so glad she suggested it to me. The acting was some of the best I have seen. I knew of Mark Wahlberg but his movies had never appealed to me. I had never heard of Isabela Moner but she uses the Spanish spelling of Isabela so I thought she must be good. I also had never heard of Rose Byrne but she comes from the same country as Daniel Lissing so though she must be good. I went mainly on the power of Octavia Spencer, whom I had seen in ""Counting Numbers"" and ""The Shack"". She did not disappoint. Also Wahlberg Moner and Byrne did a wonderful job. Moner will be a rising star. She was especially good. But then the surprise with so many great actors with small parts: Charlie McDermott (I loved ""The Middle"", Julie Hagerty (all the Airplane movies plus so much more), Margo Martindale (from ""A Gifted Man""), and Joan Cusack (from so many great movies) all really added to this movie. Did I list enough stars for you?
But these stars were able to give great performances because they had such a wonderful script. It was funny, dramatic and oh so clean. Probably the professional movie critics hate it because it did not depend on sex and violence to tell the story.",Instant Family
99,beachy-38431,I forgot to mention,10,23 November 2018,"Another reason this movie hit home with us was many years ago my wife and I fostered, then adopted a child who grew fully into middle age when he died of natural causes. We are both caucasian and he was half Native American and half Mexican. We added one more complication by having a child from natural child birth with whom he always thought he had to compete. I think he finally realized that was not so. We loved him for him, and had the instant connection they talk about in the movie. From day 1 he was our son. But while he was growing up we all went through the trials described in the movie, he trying to figure out who he was and us trying to figure out how to help. We were lost most of the time, but never stopped loving him. Once he figured out who he was he became a huge success in his life and I hope and think he died happy, loving what he was doing. I don't know if we helped with that or not. But I finally get to my point, the writers and the movie do a good job depicting this.",Instant Family
100,mohit_sinsniwal,full of entertainment and some moral lessons,8,26 May 2019,"I almost never write reviews but after seeing some of the reviews from ppl talking about how fake it is, and how the foster system isn't like this, or they should've had their own kids, or it's all PC BS, I feel like I have to write this review. I'm a foster mom. Been licensed in 2 different counties, been through the classes and all that twice. This movie is very accurate. It is a Hollywood film and they did add some cheesy lines and jokes, but it doesn't diminish the movie. The classes are like that, they do have adoption fairs like that and the 1st few months of any new placement are SO HARD. If anything this movie doesn't make it look hard enough, but it's supposed to be entertaining. If they made the foster stuff any more real it would be a documentary. Coming from a foster parent, I really liked this movie a lot and would recommend it. To any other foster/adoptive parents reading this, you may want to view it first before you show it to your kids. *Spoiler Alert* There is a part of the movie where they talk about giving the kids back, which is totally real, I've had that talk, but it could be very upsetting to a child to hear that.",Instant Family
101,AdrienneGrayceMusic,Different kind of Role for Mark Wahlberg,7,21 November 2018,"First of all, I will start by saying I liked the film. The message was a great one, and gives a clever way of describing the foster world, and how it affects the kids, birth parents, and foster parents. It had a few funny moments but I wasn't falling over my seat for laughter. Having Wahlberg play a different kind of role was great to see. Some of the acting by the younger kids, especially the small girl wasn't that great, but their cuteness made up for the lack of acting. They are young, so I can't really critique that much.
If you are looking for a feel-good movie with a few laughs, this is for you.",Instant Family

They acted like they were a real husband and wife. The kids a also portrayed there charectors really well. The sound effects were really realistic.

They weaved those in really well.Instant Family is a great I would re commend a watching.,Instant Family
103,Bravesfan17,"Funny, Endearing Film",8,28 December 2018,"Would you believe me if I told you that the director who directed the raunchy Adam Sandler movie That's My Boy would later write and direct an endearing and heartfelt film about fostering and adopting? I doubt it. But that is what happened.Instant Family tells the story of Pete and Ellie (Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne), a married couple with no kids who renovate and fix up houses for a living. They feel a void in their marriage, and go to an adoption center where two social workers, guide them and many other couples through the process of fostering and eventually adopting children. While everyone easily wants to match up with younger kids, social workers Sharon and Karen emphasize teenagers. Pete thinks talking to any of the teenagers is worth trying, while Ellie is reluctant. Their loud conversation easily catches attention of Lizzie (Isabela Moner), a teenager who confronts them about their conversation. This proves enough for Pete and Ellie who want to take Lizzie in. The catch is her younger brother and sister.The film focuses on the turmoil of Pete and Ellie being new parents to three kids who have had rough lives, while the kids are in new territory with interesting behaviors. There are times where the story may feel predictable, but only part of what one may guess comes true.What I enjoyed most out of this film were the characters, thanks to the work of director Sean Anders and the cast for fleshing out these characters. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne are strong characters who show that they are doing the best that they can with taking care of the kids, but being respectful of them and only being firm when absolutely necessary. Wahlberg and Byrne deserve major props for pulling every kind of emotion throughout the film. Wahlberg gives one of his funniest performances to date as Pete. Rose Byrne gives a much more emotional performance as the foster mother who does what is best for the kids despite them being bratty, especially Isabela Moner's Lizzie. Moner does a fantastic job as the teenager Pete and Ellie take in. She makes Lizzie a strong character, who pulls off the rebellious teen well. We see Moner play Lizzie as disagreeing with Pete and Ellie but always has the best interests of younger siblings Juan and Lita at heart. I found it interesting in her part with how she also is still attached to her biological mother, who visits frequently. The other actors fit their roles well. Octavia Spencer and Tig Notaro did nice jobs as the social workers. Margo Martindale is funny as the over the top, yet good-hearted grandmother.As I said before, the script and story may feel formulaic and predictable, but it's only part way and throws in an unexpected turn here or there. This is thanks to the work of co-writer/director Sean Anders and co-writer John Morris. They crafted a script that takes many of the funny things that go about with what it's like to be a foster parent and eventual adopter. They do a nice job of throwing in a turn every once in a while. While there are a lot of laughs, there are plenty of dramatic moments that kept my interest. This film comes loosely from a personal experience Anders had with his wife, and you'll see a picture of him with his family in the beginning of the end credits. Thanks to this, Sean Anders has given us his best and most personal film as a director. As a director, Anders does a nice job at keeping a good pace where the jokes aren't excessive and there isn't a dull moment.",Instant Family

111,domtaylor,"A real crowd-pleaser, for better or worse.",7,26 February 2019,"'Instant Family' is definitely predictable and clichéd every step of the way, but that doesn't really matter when it's done this successfully. Its engaging throughout and offers a fun and heartwarming look at adoption and families in general, leading to a very entertaining experience. For better or worse, though, it's certainly a crowd-pleaser, which means that although it's sure to give audiences a good time, it's all surface level and some of the dark, culturally important themes are brushed over in service of keeping things light and friendly. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but, had it scratched below the surface more often, it could have been a far richer, more affecting piece overall. The other thing is that the film certainly works better as a family-drama than a comedy, yet it tries to do both which sometimes isn't too successful. There are several 'funny bits' that generate from the characters and situations which work fine, but it's the forced humour (the improvisational kind of jokes that Anders is used to working with) that don't really fit. Overall though, 'Instant Family' is highly entertaining throughout and offers some heartwarming scenes, despite how generic and surface-level it is. 7/10",Instant Family

I went into this expecting Daddy's Home Mark Wahlberg but was pleasantly surprised to find him slightly, only slightly, more serious in this role and Rose Byrne definitely did a bulk of the heavy lifting for the parents when it comes to versatility with emotions.On the kid's side, Lizzie (Isabela Moner) did a fantastic job of portraying the teenage rebelliousness while also showing the emotional scarring that can come from being left to the system.

I have two adopted siblings and I didn't find a lot of inspiration or humour in this, so why include those bits? This movie seems to be made for the type of viewer who cannot handle a serious subject without hearing snide remarks or poor attempts at being funny.It obviously appeals to the shallow type of viewer who has no depth, based on the reviews and comments. The director could have taken this to a deeper level, but kept the extremely serious subject of fostering and adoption on a fluff level, aimed at fluff viewers.",Instant Family

I have little experience with foster care. But from what I've heard from 2nd hand stories, it seems pretty believable apart perhaps from the woman trying to mimic the blindside story by adopting a foster kid like Michael Oher.On the flip side, because the subject matter is often so sad, the writers wrote the dialogue very unrealistically enjoyably funny or touching depending on the moment. I really thought that was a nice choice. The actors all seem fine and the main family is all improbably gorgeous. But it's the movies and overall I don't mind it. It's the sort of movie where you're rolling with laughter at one moment and then in tears the next. It's a solid family or date movie. And it's also good to see a film address the foster system in a fair and approachable way.

In every scene, you can see and tell that all the actors and actresses were giving it their one hundred and ten percent. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne played compelling characters that seemed like real people. I think any parent will be able to relate to them in one way or another. The kid actors did great, especially Isabela Moner who plays Lizzy. Just like how Mark and Rose played characters parents can relate to Isabela played a character that a majority of teens can relate to. I know I could easily relate to her. The pacing in the film was surprisingly great. I thought for a film like this they would want to rush some scenes but no. All the scenes seemed to have the perfect pacing in them and only a few of them were cut a bit too short but that didn't bother me too much. The humour in this film was placed in the right places and didn't seem forced. This film will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. At some parts, you'll be happy and laughing while in others trying to hold back tears. I also really enjoyed how the film felt like you were a fly on the wall during all the scenes. I think my only big problem with this film is when they tried to throw more conflict into the film. I won't say what they did but it was unnecessary and could have just been cut out of the film altogether. Also, the few scenes that should have been longer but weren't also kind of bugged me but didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film.

In the backdrop of stunning shows like Marvel series, GoT, etc., I had almost forgotten that these kind of movies even existed.Story is about 2 people who have been married for sometime, they are middle class, sort of satisfied with life, maybe feels a little bored with their routine, but they are not too worried that they don't have their own children, and are not trying too hard for it or anything.Then one day the wife sees some kids up for adoption in the net, feels that they are very cute, the husband too feels the same (they actually use a lot of dog cliches, that its like rescuing one). They go for an orientation where an adult orphan girl who was adopted at 14 comes with her parents and tells them how much her life was saved and everyone understands 'why they must adopt'. And the husband who refurbishes homes feels that it is so much like taking a beat up thing, doing a little this and that and its as good as new.And thus starts their journey into adopting, not 1 but 3 kids because the adoption agency strongly encourages people not to break up siblings.Highly recommended. The actors are 'extremely' good. The writing is not too clever and there are many cliched moments but after seeing it I felt that it was worth it, much more than seeing an impressive Marvel flick, thats why I am bothering to even write up this long review. Please do see it. Its for your heart. :-)..........",Instant Family
134,Tina_jeppesen,Great family movie,9,29 November 2018,Without the boring usual plot not super predictable and even funny we saw it at the theatre and normally I feel I wasted my money there because so few movies are worth the high prices and rather wait til they come out to rent but this was a really nice movie to go see at the theatre as adults or with your kids,Instant Family
135,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Instant Family,6,6 April 2019,"Well, this film totally got more hype than anyone could have guessed. I really think it is impressive for a comedy by the director of both Daddy's Home movies to get this much attention during awards season.Whether or not it deserves all the attention I'm still not sure. On one hand this is a sweet and genuinely touching family drama that handles series issues in relatable ways and manages to shed light on a topic that a lot of people don't know much about while appearing to have been a largely positive contribution to the conversation.On the other hand it is still an awkward and poorly directed comedy that fits perfectly with the below-par work Sean Anders and Mark Wahlberg have become associated with.I think that the touching family drama aspect shines through more clearly in this case, this certainly isn't as awkward or annoying as I first presumed it to be.Rose Byrne actually offers a pretty funny performance in places and Margot Martindale absolutely kills her comedic timing but for every good joke or well placed one-liner another lands way too on the noes or just completely flat.At one point the film bites off slightly more than it can chew and takes a leap into the absurd while attempting to address a very series issue but given the overall subject matter and the message of the film being that adoption is not as easy as many people believe it to be (or as many other films have made it out to be) I have to commended the film for attempting to dive in to the gritty details.Overall it's a real mixed bag but I have to give a mild recommendation for this one.",Instant Family
136,jjr-76474,A stupid bias almost made me miss this very endearing movie,8,1 August 2021,"A childless couple talk themselves into entering the foster parenting/adoption system and it has its ups and downs...I had seen this movie listed as a christian movie, this paired to the subject made me cringe, expecting one of these one sided moralist rants about everything we should be in order to be redeemed. Well it's not that, not at all.It's actually a light, good hearted film, with just the right amount of pathos to get your eyes misty now and then and a balanced serving of gags and one liners to go with it. Very well delivered through great acting, including the children; the director is very respectful of, but still empathic to, the material.It is a movie as much about parenting as adopting, and it doesn't pretend to be a documentary, although there's nothing that appears too contrived or unrealistic about it. Of course, it does not underline the failures and heartbreaks that often occur in the foster care system or in adoption attempts, but that's not its purpose and it should not be blamed for that as i've read in some of the negative critics.This movie just reminds us how fulfilling it can be to raise children, whatever reason they come in your care, conception, adoption, re-composed families. If being a parent is in you, it is rewarding to do one's duty towards a child, in the same way you should never ever ever accept bearing or caring for a child if you are not up for it, which is the untold back story of this story. But this movie is here to remind us of that parenting can be beautiful and fun and nerve wracking and dispiriting and ultimately the best chance at selflessness we get in a lifetime.So see it! Smile, a lot, laugh, regularly, cry, now and then, and generally be happy to have seen it.",Instant Family

I want my money back from Google Play.My wife is a social worker and I'm a crisis mental health nurse.This does not happen in real life, or if it does then it's in the minority.I've also never been unfortunate enough to witness such terrible over acting, to the point of making me feel agitated and very annoyed.If this is how Americans are in real life, thank goodness I'm a Brit.Still feel annoyed by this film as it does not give even the slightest depiction of damaged young people and the fostering/adoption process.If you're thinking of adopting or fostering after watching this, at least meet with real social workers and go to real group meetings, I've never, ever attended groups such as those.Truly truly diabolical writing and acting.Avoid unless you're totally and utterly naive and in cloud cookoo land.",Instant Family

With that said, this movie was very well written, and it also had great celebrity Mark Whalburg, who Brough the film great attraction.

At times the characters are grounded and in the next shot they go all nuts.

This film is incredibly funny, it's also very heartfelt, I also love the jokes about the ""white savior"" thing many people will think this is being too PC but it's really not it's actually making jokes about progressive politics.

179,ChrisinDesMoines,Unexpected surprise,8,24 January 2021,"This movie was suggested by a friend as they loaned me the disc. I was a little hesitant because the marketing was obviously intended to encourage getting people to become foster care parents and i rarely like agenda driven movies, but that's friends movie suggestions usually land well so I tried to go in with an open mind.I'll be honest, I enjoyed the movie immensely and even purchased my own copy. The child actors are great with most of the attention focused on the oldest daughter, sure you fall into the typical child/parent movie cliches but it does serve a purpose to inject some much needed humor in what otherwise could be a depressing subject. I was left with the impression that having the oldest daughter carry the majority of the serious scenes and the younger kids serve more of a comedic relief in the background was by design to ensure that it didn't come across as hokey and the producers did well in that decision.You see the obvious milestones reached as they occur (youngest foster daughter calls her foster dad ""dad"" for the first time) which is heartwarming, then they have fun as the jealousy of mom trying to get her to call her ""mom"", but when she does finally get the coveted title from one of the kids for the first time it's completely unexpected and both hilarious and heartwarming at the same time.I really like this movie and frequently suggest it to my friends to be a Friday night family pizza movie, it is rated PG-13 (which was pointed out to me by someone I suggested it too). Personally I think it's deserving of a PG rating but suspect it's because of the ""dick pic"" scene and the resulting fall out of the incident, yet again weaving real life situations of a serious topic with some mildly over the top humor (yes, I think that dad's reaction to finding the individual who sent his daughter the picture of his privates is only mildly over the top. Heavy emphasis on the word ""mildly"").Great movie, very happy to the individual who suggested it to me and one of those movies I highly recommend to everyone",Instant Family

202,criscrossin,Beautiful film of parenting feelings and human relationships,9,21 June 2019,"I usually love Mark Wahlberg and his brand of comedy. He has done a great job here with Byrne to bring his foster parenting film into limelight. Just loved it. The initial part was difficult for me to sail through. But on the bigger picture of the schemes, it was necessary. The different interplay of the children and the parents were so pure and realistic. The upheavals and tension were palpable. The teen wanting to go back to her birth-mom, was on the dot. The ending was a bit abrupt. But the focus was on the foster family, not the teen's character development. So all is well.
Loved it. Especially loved the youngest guy!! What a sweet kid.",Instant Family

The teenage daughter's rebellion, the honeymoon period, the awkward reactions from the other relatives, all of it is the real deal. I cried my eyes out throughout this film because it brought a flood of memories rushing back to me. I finally have a film that I can show someone when I want them to understand what it was like for me as a foster child. I loved it so much.

The writing was a big help of course, it was so honest and refreshing! I was not surprised when I read the director used his own experiences adopting three kids, because this was not the typical feel good superficial Hollywood take on foster parenting.

Credit must go to the script writer for being brave, putting one-liners in there that we all think, but dare not say out loud. The kids in the movie are great, but the two leads are excellent.

228,pthef,Far Better than Expected,8,10 December 2018,"We saw this movie yesterday, mainly on the basis that our son was tickled by the trailers. I went without high expectations, expecting the basic fluff of most comedies, but that was okay. When you have a kid, you take one for the team quite often, right? So this magnificent movie was a delightful surprise, masterfully weaving the comedic and dramatic, the gamut of emotions, as a couple adopts three kids, two girls and a boy, the eldest girl 14 years old and soon to demonstrate all the angst, anger, and rebellion typical of that age set, a true nightmare child as the parents do their best to build bridges to her. The middle child, the boy, was sweet and charming but an accident waiting to happen. The youngest, a girl, by turns adorable and a hell-child of zero self-control. In and among were blended the several stories of other foster parents and the trials and tribulations of the children they'd taken in, woven with a fun send-up of ""The Blind Side,"" a wealthy woman only wanting an athletic black son who would follow in the footsteps of Michael Oher. Many times throughout, I bellowed out laughter. Other times, I wanted to reach into the screen and slap some sense into some of this. And result: I was downright delighted with this magnificent movie.",Instant Family

That being said, if you haven't watched any Sean Anders films (Daddy's Home, We're the Millers, etc.), then you might still enjoy the dialogue in this movie.Regardless, I liked the premise of a pair of inexperienced parents adopting siblings from the foster care system; while kids not getting along with new parents / new family members is a trope, I haven't seen foster children, much less LatinX main characters portrayed in such a way. The movie also actually depicts some of the classes and lessons the parents are equipped with, making Instant Family more realistic than a film that attempted to contain only the ""meaty"" parts of the story.

254,JeromeArlettaz,It's not OK!,5,23 February 2019,"One more a light comedy about a profound subject. If it had been somewhat more realistic, it would not have been a comedy.
I've fostered a teenage boy, who's been in the system for a while, with an absent drug addicted mother. The plot is similar, but I haven't found in this movie any of the problems I've faced. Parent's addiction and the foster system are causing major psychological troubles to growing kids: they grow up without love, build no self estime and have to find their way among other broken kids. Most of them suffer from anger, depression or worse. And like many others, he had two major trauma: when the mother promised him she will quit drugs to take care of him by love, followed by a relapse showing she love drugs more than her son. And when the cops came to brutally take him away from her, from everything he loved, from his room, his toys, his friends, his school. He was eight at that time and was sent to what he considered to be a jail with crazy inmates and prison guards paid to pretend to care about him.
We had good times, but much more dramatic situations. How do you react when a 15 years old tells you he wants to die? When you find heavy drugs in his room? When the cops are looking for him for having set a bus on fire? When he quits every school or job he starts? When he refuses to see a doctor being very sick? When his jealous former ""friends"" are waiting in front of your door to beat him? When he refuses to leave his room for days? Or when he does not come back home for days? When all he cares about is the next joint?
It broke my couple in a coupe of years. Finding myself as an old guy alone with a kid, the only concern of the authorities was to regularly spy on me to check if I wasn't some kind pervert. I got absolutely no support for any the problems listed, not even someone I could talk to for guidance. This happened in Switzerland; maybe it's better in less primitive countries where human values take precedence over financial interests. I don't know...
The movie's right on some points: There's been a lot of love, laughs and bad words. I had to swear to get his attention, although I usually don't. For him, it was as if words had no weight unless they were transgressive. Kids in the system hear so many false promesses and deception with sweet words, that they prefer straight talk with bad words. And the love made everything more dramatic. I couldn't be indifferent and tell myself nothing was my fault.
You end up asking yourself: how will I handle the guilt of failing his education, knowing that I'm his guardian, but that most of the damage was done before I knew him?
These are the questions I had to answer and that the movie eluded, depicting a common family with the issues of spoiled crisply kids.
I'm not rating this movie on its cinematographic quality, as I usually do, I'm rating its ambigus message.
So here's my message to mothers watching this movie, intending to abandon a kid, arguing that a better family will take better care: It's not ok! Your kid will be depraved of the most vital element: a mother's love. If you really have no other choice, remind him as often as you can that you love him and that you had no other choice, even when he's grown up.
Because, as soon as abandoned, even in the best foster family, receiving the best education and the best explanation for what happened (your mother was sick), deep inside of him, these awful words will be forever engraved: ""I'm not loveable enough to deserve even a mother's love!""",Instant Family

Maybe I'm just tired with entertainment in general, constant dumbing down of everything.Every moment where I felt I was supposed to laugh, I found myself getting more and more irritated by this movie. The young girl does nothing but scream the whole way through it and Rose Byrne spends the movie talking loudly over everyone else's lines, granted that's the directors fault and not hers, but it just added to the irritability factor of a movie I was not enjoying.Mark Wahlberg did what he does, kinda cool, kinda funny, kinda forgettable.

The jokes land home not because they are particularly funny, but because they are REAL.Like this one scene where the foster father asks if they won't be stigmatized as a white couple adopting latino kids. Its told in joke,yet it also expresses a real concern....that scene made me sit up and gasp....this movie is SMART, this movie has nuance.The movie is nuanced and balanced in a way that so many movies miss. It covers real people and real concerns of real people in their daily life, without ever becoming overly preachy for any one group.It tackles the stereotype of the bored white parent who wants to adopt coloured children, both from the perspective of the child and of the parent. The cover the awkwardness as well as the insecurities a man may feel raising kids who don't look like him.They cover the issue of infertility, and how to overcome the grief of infertility, accept it and adopt !They touched on gay adoption.They touched on single parenthood.From the male perspective, I was very impressed of how much the movie demonstrated good fatherhood through mark Wahlberg's character. Its refreshing to see an onscreen father actually fathering.

285,thejasvi,An unexpected surprise,8,22 February 2019,"This was completely mis-marketed, most likely due to the commercial success of the enjoyable Daddy's Home films starring Wahlberg also written and directed by Sean Anders. This is one of those unfortunate circumstances where star power overwhelmed a films campaign I felt, yet in a catch 22 scenario the film may not have been made without said star. Thus I fear it will be one of those films that never finds the audience it deserves. Instant Family is an extremely solid film about adoption told through a relatively mainstream format. I personally enjoyed it immensely, I went in knowing very little about the film and was expecting something fairly disposable but fun from the way it was marketed. I did not expect the last 20 minutes to have me tearing up as much as it did and the film in general to have had as much of a hold as it did from the outset. I am not someone that has had direct experience of adoption, but I have learnt about the experiences of it through a loved one, and I feel the film is very faithful as much as any 2 hr film intended for a mass audience could be. There are quite a few excellent stand up comedians in supporting roles, as well as Octavia Spencer, and a great cameo towards the end that I won't spoil. There isn't a single bum note within the cast. Wahlberg to me is our next Tom Cruise, it's easy to mock him or cast him aside, but the fact is he never fails to deliver as a performer despite the material. But this film is a great vehicle to display his dramatic and comedic abilities, but his casting is unfortunately going to be the reason why this film may never reach its intended audience, which is a real shame because this is a very touching, enjoyable and relatable film that I hopes finds its audience post theatrical release. And huge kudos to the young cast members in the film and to those who may have helped them find and present their inner expressions, great work all round!",Instant Family

If you have an experience with adoption, you might have a soft spot for this movie and that I could understand. But if not, it's just very very average. It's mildly funny, work ok on a dramatic level, and is watchable. I have an open mind, but I just can't agree with any review calling this movie 'hilarious' . It's just watchable basically. It tries too hard to teach some sort of life lesson, and it's running time is too long for what it is.Approach it with realistic expectations, and it's probably a good movie to zone out to.

Not only it's not funny but also quite infuriating. The other foster parents are rude and the three kids they're trying to foster/adopt are unbearably annoying. I especially don't like the ideas that the foster kids are entitled to be bratty and ungrateful because of what they've been through and the only way to show your love is to spoil them. Parenting takes a lot more than that. Years ago I watched a gay movie of a similar fostering storyline called ""get your stuff"" and it was much better than this one.

Even worse: the pace of the film and the circumstances in which the funny bits of the trailer happened, are not fun when they happen in the movie.The pace, the focus, and the timing of those jokes is all wrong.But, still, it could be a good movie. It could be a drama, which is to where it points to, but again it fails. Precisely because the framework of the movie is a comedy, its grounds do not hold the weight of true emotions. There is no room for empathy, no attachment to the humans that move and talk in the screen.The movie tries to reach you, or manipulate you; it tells you when to laugh because a bunch of people laugh at something. It tells you when to cry, because a bunch of people cries at something. So that makes it worse because it pulls the emotions out of you instead of letting you work it out.All in all, is a forgettable film, plain, shallow, misplaced fun, misplaced drama, that could be meaningful to foster parents or foster kids that fill the gaps of the movie with their own memory and experiences.

It seemed as if everyone was judged on his character and moral behavior; much like adopting parents should be judged by the adopt agency, but in the film almost everybody by the film makers.
Because most people where caricatures and parodies of real people, their personalities where overdone, so it was easy to give them as an audience an approval or disapproval stamp, as if you could feel the expectation of the film makers abt the judgment you are supposed to give. Then comes the racism in. EVERYBODY who is supposed to be a dork or dumb or prejudiced was white and EVERYBODY cool or understanding or funny where people of color.
That is apart for the leading roles ofcourse.

What I didn't expect was to get hit right in the feels a few different times throughout this film.

Though this is a comedy at its core, they managed to add some very heartfelt, tender moments that really tugged at my heartstrings throughout this film which gave it a level of substance that most movies in the same vein reach for, but never quite grasp.

333,siobhanharper16,Serious Subject Treat Like Comic Book Trash,1,16 March 2019,"My husband and I adopted from the Georgia foster care system in the mid-90s. One 9-year-old boy who came to us with known and unknown issues of neglect and abuse. I recognized all the ""steps"" from meeting with a social worker through fostering to adoption. What I didn't recognize was a foster/adopt support group, or social workers who were sensitive to the child's needs or our needs. The movie family's hard times are fodder for comedy and treated lightly; in reality, those hard times are HELL!. For parents and for kids. You have no background memories of the child(ren) as babies, when bonds are formed, to help you hold on through truly frightening behavior, psych hospital stays, therapy for the child that the child won't accept. Trust issues? Most kids out of toddlerhood have NO ability to bond with other adults as parents. You never know whether the problems the child is having are normal, age-appropriate stuff, related to past abuse, related to adoption; you're just at sea. And the fun doesn't end when they turn 18. You're still killing yourself, hating yourself, blaming yourself because you can't fix all the things that went wrong for your child, and now you get to watch that person make the same terrible choices that their birthparent(s) made. Along the way possessions are destroyed, fires are started, you finally become afraid for your own safety and the safety of the innocent people associated with your child, especially their own children! This movie makes me furious because it laughs at things that destroy lives, sometimes forever. It doesn't address the wrong-headed theory that puts reunification of birth families above everything else and ends up sending kids back to abusive and neglectful parents over and over. In short, the movie makes light of one of this nation's greatest tragedies: the plight of children in the foster system and the equally difficult plight of good people who try to help through fostering and adoption. Far more lives are ruined than saved, I promise you. Maybe this film was intended to be propaganda to get more people to foster. My advice: don't do it until the system changes. My advice about the movie: stay as far away as you can.",Instant Family

The film was truly funny, but it it was inappropriate for children who should have been welcomed by producer Mark Wahlberg. The film is not only inappropriate for children, but it failed to entertain Christians, because of the vulgar language. The story was so meaningful, but the heavy language was a major disappointment.

339,littlebrownclown,High Five!,10,10 March 2019,"I just saw Instant Family tonight and I want one, too! This movie is so satisfying on many levels. If you've ever dreamed about fostering or adopting kids and you wonder how it will change your life, this is a good look behind the scenes. Love like this is messy and frustrating and confusing and hard, but that's just your heart going through growing pains. Kids have the most gigantic hearts in the world and when they've been let down so many times, their love is like a rainbow exploding to life in sparkling glory when they finally start to relax, hope, trust and love again. There are so many treasures like them waiting to be found in this world, and the journey is full of both adventure and aggravation. Did you think finding a fortune of fulfillment would be easy? No, because ""the things that matter are hard.""This movie made me think in a welcome way. I thought it was just going to be a comedy and it turned into an entire experience. Ugly truths are spoken with a gripping clarity, hilarious support group confessions make you laugh so hard you cry, and moments on the edge of boundless hope cause you to root for the family out loud. You are truly able to put yourself in the shoes of each character and feel like you understand WHY. Nothing seems fake or skipped or hurried. Once in a while, Hollywood gets it really, really right and I'm happy to have gone on the ride.",Instant Family

I wish I could give it more than 10 stars because the current score of 7.3 is really not doing this film justice. It's simply a perfect movie. My wife and I cried a lot, laughed a lot, and left the theater happy. Based on a true story...they did a wonderful job of re-telling it for the screen. Reminds me of Wonder, which was also underrated. If I could vote for the Oscar's, it would've been Wonder last year and Instant Family this year. I don't even need to see the other contenders. Wish movies like this would get an Oscar nom... but it's usually the serious dramas that get them. Wahlberg should be very proud. He produced it and co-starred in it. Very happy for him.

358,BelieveThis,Reviews are true: good and worth seeing,7,18 November 2018,"I wondered if the many rave customer reviews of this movie here were fraudulent, cause that happens. It seems they could be real. Based on a true story, this movie is heart-warming in a modern way without being cloying. The story is absorbing. Although it has some difficult parts, this is still an enjoyable movie compared to your other options. The PG-13 rating seems accurate.Instant Family tells the story of a prosperous white couple who impulsively decide to take in a foster child. The child they selected is one of a group of three siblings. Mistakes happen, but so do a lot of other things. If this movie has a message it could be that you don't have to be perfect and that love, care and persistence could eventually matter more than anything else.I like the editing: the movie moves along. There were outstanding performances by Isabela Moner as the oldest foster child and Margo Martindale as the foster grandmother who is a force of nature. Actually all the child and teen actors did great jobs because I forgot they were acting. Julianna Gamiz and Gustavo Quiroz played the younger foster children perfectly. Carson Holmes was compelling as a high school student who has a memorable encounter with some of the main characters. Rose Bryne rang true as the foster mom.Obviously when this many performances go well, director Sean Anders did a good job. The story is supposed to be based on his life.If this movie has a fault, I'd say that it looks like there was too much improv. When the foster parents support group ridicules some parents for laughs, it made me cringe. I hope that did not happen in real life. A cameo by Joan Cusack looked like it got out of hand, like when characters keep trying to top each other, and everything gets out of control.Although about two hours, I didn't find this movie to be overly long.I'm a tough customer, and I'm no shill.",Instant Family

And it's FUNNY! Between the touching moments is real laugh-out-loud humor. The director was able to find the fun without MAKING fun. Excellent performances all around too.

Of course it has a Hollywood touch on the matter, but it stays true to real feelings and emotions of the individuals and couples who have taken that leap of faith just like these two protagonists have done.

The story it tells is one that people of all ages and backgrounds will enjoy. What makes this film special though are the comedic performances from each and every actor. Every single one of them is at the top of their game.Director Sean Anders has delivered his best work with ""Instant Family"" and I eagerly await his next picture. The true winner of this movie though was standup comedian Tom Segura, who delivered maybe the most captivating supporting acting performances in a comedy since Steve Carell in ""Anchorman"". Mr. Segura is a true master of his craft, as his clinically sociopathic personality mixes with comedy to create a perfect cocktail. Perhaps the only flaw of this movie is that Segura was not given more screen time. I look forward to seeing Anders and the acting champ working together again soon, and I predict that the best is yet to come from Mr. Segura, who is sure to have secured a place as a future leading man in Hollywood comedy.Go see ""Instant Family"" while you have the chance. Just try it out. You'll love it.",Instant Family
373,bobgomez-93332,Review from an educator,10,5 January 2021,"This heart warming film was inspired by a true story. It is very realistic and an eye opener for people that haven't been exposed to foster children. I have been an educator for over 40 years and I have taught students from elementary to high school. I've worked in inner city schools as well as rural schools. Regardless of social class, the common thread is the same. Children in foster homes have a very challenging life. Moving from home to home can be very traumatic for children of any age. The sad thing is, as the film points out, that the ""system"" is over loaded and there are not enough foster parents to take care of these kids. Our government needs to step up and pour some serious money into the Department of Children Services so that the system is not so overloaded. I've been in homes where children are living in deplorable conditions and I was told that DCS would not take these children because the case was not severe enough.

This movie showcased some real-to-life situations and opinions regarding the foster care system. The actresses and actors who performed did a good job playing their individual roles. There were many humorous as well as emotional parts throughout. I loved the story concept and the plot was good. What I did not like was all the unnecessary profanity. There were also several inappropriate lines, sexual references in regard to sexting, nudity, and loss of virginity. A minor is caught texting naked selfies to an adult.

Usually these stories are told in an fanatical way with complete disregard to realism also ignoring other affected parties i.e. the adopted extended families, social workers, other foster families etc. This is a well rounded story with the highs and lows. Headed bu the perfect casting and acting particularly by Rose, Mark W. & the child actors.I laughed and I cried and I'm really annoyed I've just now found this movie and it's not more widely known. Good movies like this are rarely made anymore.Only criticism is the way the story was neatly wrapped up at the end. Unless CA's different, typically takes years for adoptions to go through particularly when the bio parent is still at the peripheral. But I understand this is ultimately a movie for the purposes of entertainment and the audience wants the happily ever after.",Instant Family

390,steven-rick-garcia,I don't understand some of these reviews,8,9 March 2019,"To those saying it was hilarious throughout, it had moments but it wasn't ever really ""hilarious"".But on the other hand, how are some of these reviews going to say that the story is so cliché and fake when it's literally based on the writer's life?And as a person who HATES the whole politically correct climate in this country, I really didn't find it PC at all. If anything, the movie JOKES about being politically correct. So I guess it makes sense that if a viewer who can't even grasp that concept, then is their review really worth anything?In my opinion, the 7.4 rating this movie has on here is pretty accurate, though I will give it an 8 because it is one of the more touching movies I've seen lately (movie literally had me in tears). Maybe because I'm getting older and more sensitive, but this is a touching movie about the writer's life. The actress that plays Lizzy did a great job, and Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne perform well.See the movie for yourselves. Don't trust reviews (I mean, you don't even have to believe what I say). Make your minds up for yourselves. But when Rotten Tomatoes shows me that both critics AND audiences enjoyed the film, are you really going to believe the 1 and 2 star ratings you see on here? Clearly some people saw a different movie. If anything, this movie should NOT score anything less than 6 stars.",Instant Family

But yeah, some dramatic moments were very touching, and the story is mostly believable. The humor from the foster agency workers and the other parents was pretty funny too. The movie doesn't throw anything unexpected at you, but the acting is good, especially from Isabela Moner.

Firstly can I say this film is extremely well written and funny. I found myself laughing out loud at times during the course of the film. The film is based on a true story and isn't over dramatic. My best friend who has gone through foster care and adoption process herself says that this film portrays the process very accurately.
The film is also very touching ! Once you have watched it you feel a connection between yourself and the characters since they are that well presented. The main actors Mark Wahlberg, Rose Bryne and Isabela Moner do a brilliant job bringing their characters to life and bringing such a good movie to the big screen!

It's ""touching/moving"" at 2-3 specific points (as even if it's a comedy the themes it develops are serious & contemporary) but it manages to avoid big drama (I cannot stand such films).
Mark Wahlberg is the key in bringing the comedy element, so if you don't like his style in his other comedy movies (e.g. ""The other guys"") then you probably won't like him here either (but here he's less extreme).
All other characters (really all of them) are very good as well.

The plot is great, the mood is light, and the cast was phenomenal. I recommend it to anyone looking for a family movie. The ONLY downfall was the homosexual couple attempting to adopt.

It did make me feel good.It's sensitive and thoughtful, funny in places thanks to a strong script and cast, and it's heart warming too.I am mixed race and have white parents.I found this film nothing but lovely and anyone reading anything negative race wise into the film (the white couple adopt 3 Hispanic kids), then perhaps you need to just take a step back and get off your soap box.White people foster kids of other races with different colour skin. Brown and black people foster kids of other races with different colour skin. Whatever. It's no big deal, it's just the way it is.The film is not implying anything other than fostering is a really amazing thing to do, in fact it encourages watchers not to see skin colour or race as a barrier to adoption.It does a good job of showing the good and bad and it was a lovely afternoon watch that I enjoyed enough, and was surprised enough by to prompt me to write this review which I almost never do as I usually have more important things to do, but hey, lockdown so I don't really have anything more important to do right now...",Instant Family

414,shanitaboswell,The Thoughts of a Foster Sibling,10,11 April 2020,"I give this movie a 10/10. I have to say as a person whose watched their parents take on the role as foster parents that this movie hits a lot of major issues that foster parents and kids deal with. People who are wanting to foster, but thinks it's all sunshine and rainbows needs to definitely give this movie a watch. It does show the struggles and tribulations that families go through when the world they've grown to know changes. The scene with Lizzie not wanting to believe that her mother relapsed and felt abandoned and hurt is all too real. Also, the movie depicts the advantages and disadvantages of taking in sibling groups. One advantage that the movie depicts that's real is the siblings don't take long to get used to a foster home. The disadvantage that the movie shows is the usually the oldest sibling becomes the parent of the younger children and has to miss out on their youthful years. It's very hard for me to find a movie that I can really, truly relate to, but this one gets it right on the money. It talks about the system failing a lot of children and this is a sad reality for a lot of kids. I felt a strong connection with Ellie and Pete when they found out a grown man was sending nudes to their 15 year old foster daughter and they stepped up and protected her. While the daughter resented them and wanted so bad to be placed with her mother, knowing that she wasn't capable of providing for her and her siblings, she was grateful that she had a home to come to. A lot of times the kids doesn't seem to be grateful for everything foster parents do for them and that's because they don't want to feel like they're betraying their biological parents and this movie even shows that when they have their first visit with their mother. I'm sorry my review is so long, but I absolutely love this movie. Like I stated earlier, to the ones who thinks fostering is easy, please watch this movie. Not only does it show the ups and downs the children and foster parents deal with; it also shows the stereotypes foster kids are portrayed to be and the negative feelings that people have without knowing full situations. Please, take the advise of a person who's had to adjust to being a foster sibling and seeing it first hand how the system is and watch this movie",Instant Family

Wow was I wrong.First, I was thrilled by the amazing cast of some of my favorite actors, comedians, and personalities: Mark Wahlberg (who doesn't like marky mark!), Rose Byrne (X-Men!), Tig Notaro (hilarious comedian!), Octavia Spencer (the help!), Tom Segura (comedian/personality!), Margo Martindale (Americans!), Iliza Schlesinger (hilarious hot comedian!), and even a bit by Joan Cusack (don't know from what but everyone knows and likes her).And THEN the movie turns into a ridiculously moving tear jerker. Like absurdly touching and thought provoking and so damn REAL.. and did I mention made me cry?And THEN the movie was funnier than anything I've seen in a while. Had to stop and rewind several times cuz I was laughing so hard I missed things.And THEN I find out it was based on a true story.So anyway, imo definitely worth your time and $4 to stream.

This is one of the best and most realistic depictions that I've seen. Sure there were comic elements to bring in the casual viewer; after all you've got to draw an audience. Sure, there were a couple of scenes that may have been a bit unrealistic, but after all it is a movie. With those things aside, most of the rest of the movie was accurate and showed many themes that families, the foster families and social workers deal with all the time. Among these were foster families getting into this because it makes them feel good, rather than being exclusively about the children, the parentified older child with younger siblings, the acting out behavior of children that has trauma as its root cause, etc. There was only one scene that I didn't care for. That was when Octavia Spencer laughed at the notion that the father may have been involved. That's the stereotype and in some cases it's true, but in many more cases it isn't. Sometimes it means that social workers and other professionals need to do a better job of engaging the dads. Overall, a very good movie.",Instant Family

However, the other details about parenting, support groups, the glory of being accepted by the children and the effort that is made t make them open up is hard to neglect. The frustration that is always there with parenting is super evident. However, the moral is also very evident.

I was pleasantly surprised.It certainly still has its fair share of slapstick (unecessarily, in my opinion, although others found it funny), but interwoven within the absurdities are references to the serious probelms and prejudices that foster kids have to face.

I have to say I had high expectations for this movie as it dealt with a heavier subject matter than any of his previous films. The best part about Instant Family is that it is inspired by Anders' real life family, and they always say ""write what you know"".He definitely knows what he's writing here, and doesn't shy away from making audiences both laugh and cry while watching this family come together through some not so easy circumstances.As always Mark Wahlberg is the macho man father we all know and love, but here we are able to see a different side of him. We are able to see some real emotion come from Wahlberg and it doesn't feel forced. I'm sure having a few children of his own helped with that while prepping his performance.The real surprise in ""Instant Family"" is how funny the film is, and for the families watching it's no where near as rude or raunchy as Anders' previous work. There are a few risqué scenes here and there, but that's to be expected when dealing with teenagers. However these scenes are ultimately believable and aren't that over the top to bring down the feel good nature of the film.Overall Instant Family was a real surprise, a light hearted comedy which shows the struggles some families go through in order to become one. The supporting cast of Tig Notaro, Octavia Spencer, and the always perfect Margo Martendale make Instant Family a true family treat. Hopefully director Sean Anders continues along the line of light hearted comedies as this may be his best film yet",Instant Family

You go from tearing up to laughing out loud, happy to sad, sympathetic to shock.

The social workers are not scary or evil (as they are seen in the most movies) and you can see it takes time for the children to accept their new parents. Much more realistic than many other adoption movies I seen. It's still fun and easy to watch.

478,NTass,Feel good movie...,10,17 November 2018,"It's hard not to contemplate fostering kids after seeing this beautiful movie. I've always looked up to people who were able to leave their comfortable lives behind to put others first. If you're looking for a movie with unpredictable twists and turns, this isn't it. But the film's predictability doesn't take away from the perfect mix of humor and sincerity which left the audience very satisfied (at least speaking for myself and the people I saw the movie with).The acting was wonderful all around. Mark and Rose are great comedians and were endearing as a couple. The children were excellent at playing the role of kids who were mistreated by their biological family, then left to flounder in a foster system that's not nearly equipped to handle the amount of children neglected by the very people who brought them into this world. You could tell each of the three kids experienced different traumas in their lives which shaped them into people with three very individual personalities. Each child needed different care which couldn't have been easy for any foster parents. Even the supporting actors and actresses were funny.If you're in the mood for some humor and tears, but ultimately an uplifting experience, Instant Family is the movie for you. Now on to see Widows, which couldn't be more different!",Instant Family

497,gillgrey,Fabulous family movie!!,10,14 January 2019,"I've never written a review before, but after reading the critics awful mean reviews, I had to clear some things up...
This movie is fantastic. I took my two step sons (11 & 7) to it, thinking it was going to a daddy's home type comedy, and was blown away. I cried and laughed the entire way though. I was a bit concerned when I realised the heavy subject matter, and how my boys would handle it, but they both walked out saying how much they loved it, and they couldn't wait to see it again.
For all the people out there claiming that this is a Hollywood version and it glosses over the reality of the fostering world - calm down. Of course it does. And it does so for an excellent reason. It's a family movie, and no one is going to take their kids to see gritty documentary on the sometimes scary and horrific dramas of this world. By delivering the important message that this movie does in this 'hollywood' way makes this movie and it's themes accessible for the younger generations, and in our instance it immediately started that dialogue about these types of situations in the car ride home. I believe this movie has really opened their eyes to the real world in a great way, and hopefully will help them to realise what they have in front of them.
I think the balance between the reality, and the PG comedy is balanced perfectly. The chemistry between Marky Mark and Rose Byrne is amazing, and both of their natural humour, hilarity and talents as actors shows in the way I'd be brought to uncontrollable sobbing, whilst also not being able to stop laughing. It's a rare movie that can deliver that, and to so be family friendly as - hats off!!
Go see it. With your kids, and I promise you that you'll all walk away from it with zero movie choice regret.",Instant Family

Brilliant story telling from the director (the movie was based on his real life story, he adopted 3 kids) to touch on some of the depressing aspects of foster care and managing to keep the movie lighthearted.Octavia Spencer was great and the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne was off the charts, really had a family feel to it and both of them playing off of each other was great. Isabela Moner also does a good job of showing how some older kids up for adoption might feel guilty about leaving their birth parents and she portrays that conflict well.I'd definitely recommend watching it in the theaters, this movie doesn't seem to be getting as much love as it deserves.",Instant Family

It's such an emotional rollercoaster that I just loved, it grabs the story on a humourous way and it also makes you feel so sad and so happy that I cried a lot of joy.

We were strengthened by the delightful sense of humor, the honest and real situations, and the all to familiar raw emotions that adoption brings to the parents who do this challenging task. Even the happy moments of starting to sense the ""family"" connection all rang true to our hearts. Thank you so much for making this film.

Its depiction of how the kids act is 100% accurate. Its one of the hardest things to see and admit now - Being that I'm older.This movie needs more attention and I hope that my rating helps with that. It needs to be watched by all...

542,isahinrichs,typical hollywood brainless comedy that simplifies serious issues,1,21 April 2019,"The film is a silly, ridiculous simplification of real concerns and important questions regarding questions about the foster system and family organization. In the mode of most brainless Hollywood comedies, the film simplifies and renders ""digestible"" problems that could have been addressed in a way that actually uncovers the issues with the foster care system and American expectations of family, culture, and achievement. Instead it even turns sexual ""exploitation"" at a high school into a joke. How do films like this are even produced in an age of ""Me Too""?",Instant Family
543,erikamanik,Such an inspired movie.,10,15 May 2019,"I really guarantee that the Instant family movie is really good. Instant family is filled with comedy, but for some scenes, we'll be made to cry and weep . From this movie I was able to understand the feelings of children living in orphanages as well as feelings of husband and wife who cannot have offspring.Why can I guarantee this movie is really good?
Because, this movie tells of how a couple who have no children, feel empty in their lives. And when they raise foster children, they become overwhelmed in educating them. But a parent's instinct is undefeatable, yet despite its many challenges, they can overcome all.I highly recommend this movie to watch, because this movie really can inspire us, with all sorts of moral messages on it. In my opinion this movie feels very entertaining and does not give boredom if watched more than once. This movie will be my favorite family movie.Absolutely, Very Cool!!!",Instant Family

Oddly enough, these reviews were the ones that got me. Let's be straight, this is not a 'good' movie. Just about every movie is 'not good'. Especially major studio films with A-list actors. This is a satire. It is not meant to be realistic. It is a story turned into a cheesy movie. THIS IS IMPORTANT - It is a 'not good' movie that was worth watching.

559,tamworthianc,"An enjoyable, light-hearted movie",8,21 January 2021,"I randomly decided to watch this movie after scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch. I'd never heard of it before but I really enjoy watching Rose Byrne and Mark Wahlberg has been surprisingly good in comedy films I've seen him in before (to the point where it's no longer surprising) so I decided to give it a go.It seemed quite clear from the cast and synopsis that this was going to be what I'd call an ""Adam Sandler movie"", albeit without the big guy himself. Light-hearted comedy, enjoyable for both adults and children (there is a bit of swearing) and you'd put money on there being a happy ending. It didn't disappoint.The films about a couple that at the start don't want kids, before an off-hand sarcastic comment about adopting a 5-year-old escalates into them going down the adoption process before eventually finding a 14-year-old with a bit of attitude/sass. This then escalates when they find out she has a younger brother and sister, so the one perfect 5-year-old becomes 3 kids each with their own problems and challenges. As expected, this leads to a lot of humorous situations, lots of screaming, tantrums and arguments. There's a few foot in mouth situations for Mark Wahlberg, from comparing fostering a child to adopting a rescue dog, talk about the kids like a house project and likening him self to the main character in Avatar because he's a white guy planning to adopt Hispanic children.The last third of the film actually gets quite emotional. We see the two parents go from wanting to throw in the towel early on to fighting (literally) to protect their adoptive children. I'm not the most emotional guy but once scene near the end made my eyes quite watery.I definitely recommend this movie, especially if you enjoy the ""Adam Sandler"" genre.",Instant Family

563,agamemnon-54755,Another 49 year old 'foster kid' reviewing,10,16 February 2021,"This is my first, and likely last movie review ever. Because, let's face it, I'm not a professional critic. Merely a consumer.
Like many others with more or less the same background, I was blown away by this movie and just had to scribble a few words, for what it's worth.
Growing up in a foster family is hard, even when - like me - you were lucky enough to end up with the best loving and caring set of substitute parents one could wish for. You grow up with a sense of loss that can't be reasoned away, or explained. It's a deep rooted sadness you carry around the rest of your life.These feelings can hardly be explained, but this movie shows them. The awkward hugs, the anger and grief in the eyes of Lizzie ... holy cow, this Isabella Merced. A 17 year old giving this incredible, Oscar worthy performance. I would not have any doubt if someone told me she has actual experience with this stuff, except I looked it up and she hasn't.Funny thing I noticed when I saw this movie in our local cinema, two years ago. This one scene, towards the end of the movie. Foster mum wanted to hug, but Lizzie and her ended up grabbing each other's elbows. The audience was laughing, but I wasn't. I was looking at this young girl's eyes that showed anybody who cared to look everything there is to say about the relation between foster kids and the ones that lovingly try to raise them.A must see for anyone, especially for those who are thinking of becoming foster parents themselves. This movie, like nothing else, shows what it will be like. It's hard work, but worth your while. Lots of us get lost, and all of us end up needing therapy, but trust me: we're grateful even when we scream at you. ;-)",Instant Family

They touched on a lot of topics that could have been taboo but in reality is what is confronted when considering fostering or adoption. White savior complex, drug addictions as a product of environment ( and not a flaw in character) and unconditional love as a constant choice. I can't say enough good things about this movie!

I'm a foster mom. Been licensed in 2 different counties, been through the classes and all that twice. This movie is very accurate. It is a Hollywood film and they did add some cheesy lines and jokes, but it doesn't diminish the movie. The classes are like that, they do have adoption fairs like that and the 1st few months of any new placement are SO HARD. If anything this movie doesn't make it look hard enough, but it's supposed to be entertaining. If they made the foster stuff any more real it would be a documentary. Coming from a foster parent, I really liked this movie a lot and would recommend it. To any other foster/adoptive parents reading this, you may want to view it first before you show it to your kids. *Spoiler Alert* There is a part of the movie where they talk about giving the kids back, which is totally real, I've had that talk, but it could be very upsetting to a child to hear that.",Instant Family

For starters it had good cinematography, it had some really good shots. You don't usually get good camera work in movies like this.
It's also the rare type of movie that gives you a good laugh while at the same time makes you tear up a bit.
Lots of family movies come out around November and December for the holiday season, and I think so far this one is the best one. Not only is it funny, it teaches a very good lesson about family and gratefulness. It was amazing the lengths this couple went through to protect their children even if they weren't they're biological parents. And the fact that it was based on a true story made the film so much more meaninful.

618,sleepyleesd,Surprisingly Accurate,9,26 September 2021,"This film is what can be classified as a dramedy.. Some very funny moments mixed with surprisingly honest drama of kids acting badly... because that is what is bound to happen when they are a product of bad parenting, a broken home, a parent who was a drug abuser and being bounced around in the foster home system. But it was really refreshing to see how the couple handled the problems of being not only foster parents but trying to be forever adoptive parents. And especially having to deal with the modern challenges of having an instant teen daughter who was full of rebellion and very manipulative.",Instant Family

The hubby and I laughed along at the early part. We watched it with our kids, one of which asked at one point if they ""used"" to be like that! I quickly changed the subject, he is easily diverted!

I honestly dont know what planet people are from rating this film so highly. I wanted to walk out after 20 or so minutes but decided to stay with the wife.This film is a whole load of cliches and mixed messages it really doesnt know what it wants to be. It tries to be funny and fails most of the time badly . Likewise, it tries in vain to come across serious and evoke some kind of emotion from the viewer again failing terribly. It's a shame really because when the film showed any kind of integrity was when it went through the more serious scenes but that would all be wiped out with a ridiculous forced joke or just plain stupidness.
This film could be done so much better if it took itself a bit more serious and dealt with what is a very serious subject with a bit more respect but it was in our opinion way off the mark and consequently one to avoid....DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!",Instant Family
629,williamduke-83030,Manipulative,2,23 February 2019,"This film was a combination of a low brow throw away comedy and a serious subject that rarely gets much attention but instant family wastes any opportunity to address the complicated in's and out's of the adoption system in exange for the most predictive and cliche situations one could imagine a foster family getting themselves into. Granted im not knowledgeable enough to know how much of the story is true but if it is the people depicted managed to love out the most predictable situations imaginable. The two lead actors were obnoxious and unlikable, the cinematography was flat, and the music was over present and manipulative I would wait for Netflix to pick this one up.",Instant Family

This movie presents the fact that everyone is human and makes mistakes but shared a message of grace and love that transcends those mistakes. Even despite the mature themes and the unnecessary use of language that was used throughout this movie, the theme is what redeems this movie.

I can't count the times I laughed out loud and from someone who doesn't do that, it's such a great and unexpected feeling. Rose Byrne it's at her best as usual. You can't beat her comedy timings. She's always on point. As well as hilarious, get the tissues at the ready. Another unexpected emotion I did not expect to happen. I literally sobbed. A couple who in a sort of way didn't want to foster or adopt but fell into it from which you will see. And the kids who probably never thought they would be lucky enough to have a stable home. Who are not the easiest of kids to let into your home. Lots of ups and downs as you can imagine. Do do they get a happy ending ??? You will have to watch and see.",Instant Family
