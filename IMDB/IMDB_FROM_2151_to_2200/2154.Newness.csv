0,kosmasp,Due date,8,17 April 2018,"For a movie that has relationship written all over it in the ""modern era"" (that is with cell phones and apps to find ""love""), this really could be called a modern day love story. So while you could compare it to ""Love"", this is not as explicit as that (though you will have some nudiy in this too), but gets more involved into the characters.One set up shows closeness physically, but characters being as far apart as possible. It could have gone wrong, too cliche, but the symbolism of it really hits home (no pun intended). The movie generally has quite a few themes, with ""newness"" being one of them. The pleasure one has to enjoy that. But even with one character living in the past, the connection to ""new"" is still there. The other character may not want anything newer, but that plays into the theme too. Especially when things get mixed up.The movie tries to analyze a bit and give us a look into the psyche, but it not a psychological study. You can read a couple of things into it, but it does try to stay in the drama department and the general flow of the movie. Good themes, good acting and a good script about a ... new sort of love story",Newness
1,andrewchristianjr,GOOD INDIE.,7,8 August 2020,"Good indie movie that puts you inside of an emotional trench and then on the craziest roller coaster of pain with a inkling of hope for the characters development. For a lot of new age people, the events that occur in this film should inspire many to know the right path to choose when it comes to the facets of love and trust.",Newness
2,jellopuke,Awful people doing selfish things,4,18 February 2020,"There are many montages in this movie to move things along, all with soothing piano music that therefore must be touching and sweet, but in actuality, these characters are so one dimensional, selfish, and unlikeable that you end up not caring if they end up together. I get that it's trying to be a look at millennial dating, but there's literally nothing beyond the ""sex"" level here. No interesting conversations, no intelligent dialogue, nothing beyond just sex. I would say it was a let down, but I had no expectations, so it was ok-ish.",Newness
3,leftbanker-1,"Unremarkable, Forgettable, and Too Long",5,2 December 2017,"Let's begin by saying that this was way too long. Why does anyone need this much time to tell so little story? Answer: they don't and this was a huge bore that wasn't resuscitated by the sex scenes. Sex scenes are mostly boring in movies these days and completely superfluous when we are one mouse click away from explicit sexual fantasies that most of us couldn't even think up on a dare.Almost every shot in the movie was a close up, like a short person trying to film something in a crowd. I felt claustrophobic most of the time. The rest of the time I wanted to push away the characters for invading my personal space. I'd guess that about 70% of the shots didn't even include an entire head. If that is style then count me out.",Newness

5,bshaef,An Excellent LIttle Movie,8,30 June 2021,"And I suppose more than one person who watched it wished they would have had the final conversation at the end of the movie, in their youth. It really struck a chord with me. The story, acting and just about everything held my interest from the very beginning.",Newness
6,FallenEye,Sex App-eal.,8,23 March 2018,"Why an 8/10? Newness may not be perfect, and at points it may lose a little traction, however, at the core of it all, this film does capture and exist fairly well within a realistic spectrum. Newness isn't too far from the everyday, unnecessary and stupid truth of modern ""love"".I also believe that, in its imperfections, lay a truth there too within Newness. It didn't exactly follow a usual narrative, which is where one could argue the dips were most present, however, to try and actually depict a story of this nature, requires a little chaos, and boredom... A little, not too much, and Drake Doremus toed that line quite competently. Nicholas, Laia and Danny all demonstrated some stellar work too.The ability for this film to annoy, frustrate, sadden and rub one the wrong way in the manner in which it did, I also think is part of its quality. It created those emotions not based on a bad script, but rather on a depiction who's truth, reality and sadness is almost impossible to argue against. Barring the ending, which of course isn't impossible, Newness is, realness, shot with some real accuracy.",Newness
7,PaxtonMalloy,Strong message,7,13 September 2019,"I almost made the mistake of switching the movie off 15 minutes in. Thankfully I didn't. Laia Costa in a very emotional scene captivated me as she did for the whole movie and the story finally really began.
Even though we get obvious unsubtle punches against facebook and tinder it is not really about these technologies because they are just that. They don't force us to do anything. It is about generation ""swipe left if you are bored"". It is about running away from conflict thus running away from real relationships. Relationships are messy. They always have been always will be. But what makes them deep the work you put in. The best quote of the movie nails it: ""love is two people not giving up on each other"" as I didn't give up on this movie 15 minutes in being rewarded at the end.",Newness
8,dskywalker0,Terrible film,1,28 February 2021,"The only good thing about this film is Matthew Gray Gubler, and he appears for about 2-3 scenes. The characters are either toxic or people with deeply unresolved issues and the relationships are problematic, I feel like I lost precious time of my life watching this pointless film. It has no depth, no clear message and I don't think it portrays relationships in the digital age well.",Newness
9,impressivesgirl-37857,Reality check for the young drama queen and her almost so promiscuous boyfriend,8,25 March 2021,"A lot of relatable moments and decisions - its emotional and feels real. It shows very well the relationship routine and how far the main characters (especially Gabi) are from maturity and adulthood. She is obnoxious and demanding, acting too kid-like, insecure and immature, making drama from everything. But I liked that because it shows how young people think and act. Nicholas Hoult and Laia Costa have such a strong sexual tension and chemistry, you can absolutely feel it. They represent a new passionate relationship amazingly well. And especially well done role for Danny Houston - his speech at the end to Gabi was awesome, and I (25 yo) totally felt it. The movie is slightly too slow and too sexual at times but I guess that was the idea.
A lot of things a like about this movie, but the acting - OMG! The acting is phenomenal - Nicholas Hoult (Laia Costa too, but mostly Nicholas Hoult) is perfection. His tears, his emotion, his mental issues, his interactions with people in general - everything is presented so real and so beautifully.",Newness
10,francogrex,Not horribly bad,4,1 July 2019,"Someone wrote that this is about a promiscuous girl. It is about a promiscuous girl and a promiscuous guy. It's about relationships and how love, excitement and sexual desire ebb and flow with time. Not horrible but not exceptional either. 4 is good enough.",Newness
11,dr_hgj-48231,"Romance in recent times, very open sex oriented and still trying to be an HONEST",9,8 May 2019,"Dating and going to bed with different people is the known fantasy now a days... but the real question the girl and boy are searching is ""REAL ME"" in other partner... Boy cannot let go the feel of his first wife divorced and though had an abortion he admittedly faked the Care Love shown in those early young period.... soon those dependency and the varsity search started giving boredom as Man always in search of some NEW ? Where ? and How but being an Honest guy luckily finds an equal frequency girl ... they even suggest each other to have a sex with their choices on some partner changes with a CHOICE !!!! is this not NEW ? Old phenomena but very frankly opened up....
the girl feels the same some how attaches her self to a settled +50 guy oldies... for a change and surprisingly finds herself COMING(!) during the sex act !!! The boy now feels the jealousy as well on first hearing her coming with the old guy ... his ego is hurt and goes for immediate ""from behind aggression"" in kind of rush of blood... She does not enjoy this !!! The rich man has to go for longer period in Spain too... He offers her a ride..as she is Spanish.....can see her old pals...... . FREE
.. She will also take care in general about his daughter who is a teenager and would accompany him in a BED !!! The girl was under our medically known OEDIPUS COMPLEX also so was enjoying the extra old age treat and the care in general... she was not a hooker! That the rich man thought was !!! She was in search of real LOVE... Some how in the END very tenderly they re Unite after some spills of tears from both sides. As by that time he was also seeing the old wife's early pregnancy videos and the loss in fatherhood was bothering a little too !!! His old wife meets him as she was pregnant again after her new settled guy ....and the woman hood she enjoyed with him was remarkable..... She thanks him for that... and as they are moving to different city with the another pregnancy ! !! Those trials of different partners double women double guys double couple sex are far more temporary he realized. So this is the NEWNESS the same old routines of getting excitement then family life settled down issues understanding frank partners and all...
Now the girl again comes to the boy and very tenderly says I am ready to be with you .... may ..disappoint you in future.... but shall we ...?? with tears in eyes flowing the true lover has developed a lot of LOVE for her and She too by her frank supporting sex , open sex method achieved the bonding. We in audience feel the same.... they are made for each other ... It is a comfort if they unite ... and though this level of frank committed Adultery is agonizing but this also can revoke the LOVE... This script I really enjoyed a lot... Open sex , Adultery, another man-woman, easily falling for any new charming partners are human weaknesses ... we grow but we never accept those things with calmness here is a couple they practiced the said FREEDOM but still HONORING other Partner , Respecting his weaknesses are making the bond stronger and the love emerges and emerged love grows .. So enjoy the Newness",Newness

13,richard-fieldhouse,How to build a meaningful relationship in an online world,6,12 June 2018,"Martin and Gabi, the couple at the centre of this movie, have become used to the instant gratification of their own promiscuous subculture - perhaps their expectations have been trained by those swipe-right-for-yes dating apps. But can they escape into a real relationship when something newer, though not necessarily better, is always just a swipe away? The film follows their attempts and the people they meet along the way. 
Although the idea is a strong one and in some ways its portrayal is realistic, the movie is flawed. In particular, perhaps, it does not translate well from the cinema to a home TV setting. Many shots are very dark and arty, and plenty of sequences feature over-close, juddering, hand-held camera work. In the end this kind of thing can actually get in the way of the story. The technology that is so fundamental to the plot is also quite hard to display on the screen - apps, text messages and laptop screens can all be difficult to follow at times.
Nicholas Hoult and particularly Laia Costa play the lead roles convincingly, for the most part, but my biggest worry of all is with the character of Larry, played by Danny Huston. For a start, Huston looks about twenty years too old for the part which in itself is quite a big ask. And added to that, his character's actions seem increasingly contrived as the story unfolds.
Overall, then, while the emptiness behind instant dating is a fresh and interesting subject, this particular movie is a little bit pretentious, significantly flawed and over long.",Newness
14,laetitiapayombo,Modern love,6,10 July 2018,"What a Movie! Let's get out of the way, the arty stuff in the editing, it seems a little pretentious and if you're not into indie movie it can be pointless and boring. But I'm into it and the cast is great. Now the movie is really well written and did I say that the cast is great? You feel like you're living this relationship. More than a movie it's a guide in the jungle of modern love.",Newness
15,constanza-nm,I wanted to like it. I really did,5,11 February 2018,"I'm at some level upset with this film and I need to express those feelings.
I'm a huge fan of Like Crazy, it's been years and it remains as one of my favorite films. It really made an impression on me, particularly the ending. It was beautifully shot. The music, the cinematography, the acting. And that is exactly why I can say Newness would not become in one of my favorites. The final scene is unfortunate. It really takes away all the impact of the film. And is sad, and upsetting because it could have been way greater. It's an interesting and appealing story, with great and realistic performances, but the execution somehow is off at that particular moment. The end. Something so important in any movie.This is a story about modern love and passion. The dating app plays a role, of course, but I think is more about the disconnection that we have with one another. They don't know each other, neither really bother to do it. We could say that's a consequence of meeting trough a dating app, but is it really? Datings apps, meeting people online, going on dates with strangers maybe is the response to not wanting to share and invest quality time with others, not the result. They move fast, they don't really think about it. It's a reflection of the fear of being lonely and the incompatibility of commitment. More important I think is a great example of the lack of honesty, not just to each other, but to themselves. The lack of a sincere connection and true intimacy. I was excited by this. It seems so real, so relatable at some level. But it failed to impress me because the ending doesn't make any sense. I like them both, however, there wasn't anything in this story that made me believe that they truly belong together, quite the opposite. It's not that they are wrong for each other, it's that they shouldn't be part of something that they don't even understand. It's just another cliché. It strips away all the unsurfaced meaning of it.",Newness
16,sleepingsunrise,Pro-poly propaganda,4,26 May 2021,"I wanted to like this because I like Nicholas Hoult. But I stopped watching halfway through and that was a stretch for me. It's nothing but glamorizing polyandry AKA not being emotionally mature enough to commit to one person. It had good acting and good cinematography. And it reminded me not to use dating apps. So, thank you for that.",Newness
17,misel982001,"Problematic personalities and lead filthy unethical, meaningless lives",1,14 September 2019,"In this repetitive film we become witnesses of a miserable subculture and its dead ends. The subculture of dating sites ,what kind of people you will get to meet and the problems that one may face if he attempts a relationship. To begin with, the acting is convincing indeed but the characters are so unethical and problematic that tend to be annoying. For a middle aged viewer who is not accustomed with the dating sites and this animal like behavior of such people, this film is a punch under the belt. I have rarely witnessed such miserable lives and disregard for love and emotional bonding. The 20 something characters appear to be something between animals with some level of consciousness who are driven by only a desire for sex with anybody available and who also lead highly problematic lifestyles and lack of personal goals. The story is constantly circulating but it is evident from the first ten minutes of the film that people like that do not deserve any serious attention by others since they are constantly creating or recycling emotional and personal problems. What is completely outraging is that the characters of the film are struggling to find a balance by trying to persuade their partner to accept their miserable lives. It is really sad and I could not watch it. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, maybe the worst and trust me , I have seen great many films. There is no ethical basis, no coherent storyline and the characters are extremely miserable and unethical.",Newness

I was waiting for the 'falling in love' or 'being in love' part, but - SPOILER ALERT - this never happens!

19,jleon25,The life and tribulations of a promiscuous girl.,2,26 January 2019,"For the 1st ten minutes it follows the story line of these millennials with their hooking up apps. Once they become a couple, they or SHE starts to get bored. They both end up cheating on each other. They both face up to what they did and decide to try a few things different.They decide to be totally honest with each other and to spice up their relationship with just flirting with others and then go home to jump on each other. So far, so good. Then after the female lead decides to have a 3-some with adding another female but she excludes any of his or her friends, it all goes to down hill. They decide to go on an open relationship but to me it looks as if only she goes out and bangs other guys while he stays home to wait for all the juicy details to have sex.She starts to break the rules when she starts to see an elderly gift bearing gentleman on a regular basis. She not only breaks the ""no friend rule"" but also accepts a gift and keeps it a secret from her guy.
What do you think happens next? They break up. Since she moved in her boyfriend's apartment, she moves out and moves in with the old guy. After spending a few days, maybe weeks, with the old guy, she realizes she is just there to be a receptacle for him and to be a nanny for his young daughter.She ends up running back to her man and he takes her back with the promise to now, be exclusive",Newness

We see their arguing in awfully forced scenes, f. e. they almost kill each other because he does not want to speak about his sister and she can not accept it. So what to do in cases like this? It's simple: let's watch each other flirting with others then tell about how it was having sex with that third person and finally let's have sex again with each other. Yes, it could have been a fun, perverse and sexy movie, but it isn't: 2 idiots do stupid things and in the end it's always the same story, somebody is having sex with somebody. After a while it is quite boring, especially when the 2 characters become even more stupid as time goes by. And the movie is very badly filmed, the constantly moving camera is dilettante, the whole movie is almost always in the dark, the sex scenes are also conservative, boring and way too few, despite the fact the whole thing is about sex.",Newness

23,mn2000,a Youth and Love Masterpiece,9,11 August 2019,"Put simple, you have to finish watching the movie, up to the end, the very end, then you can judge.The level of acting, just makes you feel in some way that you are watching your own life. One of those movies that makes you some how feel inside the movie and forget about everything surrounding you. That's my opinion about the acting in this movie, Laia Costa, Nicholas Hoult, Danny Huston, and even Pom Klementieff. Great acting! specially Laia (Gabi) at the movie ending.The screenplay in overall is in big part about something that happens truly often in real life, but, the story in depth, is a master piece, Despite that the beginning looks like an ordinary teenager/youth romantic movie, because it starts from two young guys that have hooked up with many people, and then meet each other, and start to get bored, going to alternatives to keep the relationship alive by pushing the boundaries. At that point, you think well, this is probably another kinky movie, BUT at some point in the middle of the story, the drama starts to develop to a level of unpredictability that makes you think ""Ok, wow now where is this going?..."" although you can predict the end when the movie gets close to it, but it's ok! the end has to start to develop at some point in a romantic drama movie.The best part of the movie, and the story, is when the love and the human feelings survive above anything else that is similar to love or fun (which is nothing new, BUT the whole story all-together makes it a very creative screenplay). The end can drop tears and makes you immediately tell your spouse ""I love you!"", and it could be a life-changing end. Or it can just make you saw ""Awww! that's so cute!"".Now, if you are type of ""perfect"" and ""holy"" person that never has done anything wrong or naughty in your life, you may say things like ""Ah this is about selfish love"" ""this is a kinky trash"" and things like that. But c'mon! pay attention to the movie, be sincere with yourself for at least once instance in your entire life, and wait until the end! if you do so, I promise you, you will at least respect this screenplay, and the great acting.In overall, I think this movie is one of the best underrated romantic drama films of the latest five years. And please notice, I said: Underrated. If you don't know what i mean, put simple, I think this movie deserved more appreciation. But it won't have more appreciation, because in 2017-2019 we are still in a world that is full of holy perfect humans that don't put aside the hypocrecy and pay attention to a great sample of art, which I think, the production team on Newness (2017), they made something that deserves admiraction.",Newness

27,cybevz,It's a bit more than ok.,6,9 October 2018,"I just saw it. In fact, I like it a lot, the camera has this frames very close to the character, somethig that we aren't used to in real life, so that makes me think of a solitary and individual person and society. I like this camera language 'cause it goes hand in hand with the movie plot. The looks and the camera movements make me feel like its something natural, like real life.
The sound design has a few parts with an exclusion that I found magical, it goes with the tone of the movie, although I would have love to have a little bit more from the ambient. They used the silence so good I really enjoyed to have those quiet moments, where I felt everything that was happening in scene.
Montage, what could I say, I went nuts with the first sequence. (Maybe nuts its a bit extreme, but you have me). Its something to appreciate in the whole film.
Direction, I could almost listen to the director voice in some parts, I´m not sure if that´s something bad, but I liked it, it helped to feel the moments.
I´ve found the acting good enough to reflect real life in some parts, in another I found them a bit forced and overacted, but I think that´s part of the essence of the script, and they were necesary to the story keep going.
The script was really good, firstable it´s about something real, something that many of us have been trough, or thinking of it like and option (at least we have doubts about it) and in this time is the ""new black"", so its pretty modern.
Secondable, from my view I think the characters are the most natural and related to real life, how an actual person would react in front of some situations. Cause lets be honest here, we all are possessive when it comes to a partner that we care of. I really liked it! Hope you enjoy it!
I might be the worst to trust. (Let mi know if not)

We can count by the fingers the acts that had light (one of them when Gabi is lay down and Martin appears after opening up with Blake), they are very few.

This, in turn, makes the film feel a bit trepidatious in making its ultimate point. All this can be rationalized as ""real life,"" but the longer the film plays and the further each emotionally drift from each other, it feels like we want to see these characters fight to be with each other rather than let personally manufactured insecurities let the story peter out.Yet for these few dips, Newness sees Doremus further developing his directorial storytelling abilities while also showing what he can do better than most of his peers - tell a romantic story that feels so electric, alive, and which captures modern love in all of its beautiful and messy form.

On the other hand you see very young people who are willing to stay together and fight for their love, even if they do not understand what this really means.

And then she turns up in the movie doing a lecture! She has obviously had some influence here. Really nicely made and acted and a fascinating roller-coaster ride through a young, modern relationship.

36,alexepatton,"If you're honest with me, you'll never lose me",10,29 March 2018,"Where do I begin? Newness is about a relationship that blossoms from swiping right on a dating app. I can certainly relate with this aspect of the movie as I feel like online dating is the new norm to meeting and dating people. We are in a digitally connected world. Gabi and Martin both seem to be living vicariously single, hooking up and nothing more until they swipe right on each other. Things begin to change for the two as they fall deeper in love. I felt as if this movie explored a relationship dynamic you don't really see often, an open relationship. Throughout the movie you can sense Martin's disapproval of Gabi's proposition but agreeing regardless. I assume Martin wanted to make Gabi happy and felt like his relationship with her still remained the forefront in her mind. Gabi seemed to not know what she wanted and thus the open relationship allowed her the freedom to explore herself with others and with Martin. Gabi was a very fascinating and complex character that I had the pleasure of watching grow. As the movie continues thru the turmetulous relationship the couple discover core things about themselves and ironically become lonely while together. They have an understanding to tell each other everything they do with another person; no secrets. It's interesting to watch the two become incredibily distant but in the end love conquers all. This movie couldn't have done a better job to outline what love is about. It's sacrifices, compromise, and a constant fight to preserve the magic. Love takes work, and Martin and Gabi are a true testament to that.Not to mention that Nicholas and Laia had believable chemistry, honestly amazing. This is definitely my favorite movie I've watched so far this year. I sure hope to see more of Laia in upcoming films. What a talent!",Newness

38,zer-facebook,"Striking, moving, beautiful",10,21 April 2019,"Really compelling movie. Hard to fault the cast or script or videography. Lead actress is spectacular. It isnt for everyone though, and if your other half is pretty vanilla you may find this raises difficult questions...",Newness
39,ronni_meder,Young love or maybe just Selfish love?,7,4 July 2019,"I enjoyed this film. I must add that I am over 40 years old and can appreciate this type of film for what it is showing us and the simplicity yet complexity of it.
I can relate to this film even though it is based on modern day where we can meet anyone at anytime. The same happened before it was so easy to meet others online. Love could meet us at any time and any place without us knowing it.
That is why I raited this film a 7 / 10. I think that all of us can relate to this story.
The acting was spot on for the most part and the music and the close ups made you feel the passion surrounding each character.I think it is worth a watch if you enjoy the journey of human emotions.",Newness
40,xenarch,some thoughts of an Asian,8,31 December 2019,"I felt the deep urge to write the review.
I watched Newness on Netflix on the last day of 2019. Happy 2020 :))Really really short brief:
Their starting point, for both of them, was DTF. They met on Tinx. They did try to open the relationship to solve the problem, as the movie title, ""newness"". They missed flirting. In the process of opening the relationship, both of them struggle to find the finest point of honesty, since they were fragile, both of them got problems from their past. Experiencing with other external relationships, with full spectrum of emotions, they mutually realized that the other is the only person who really did want to (understand/stay with) them. Finally, they want to make a serious relationship.Even as a person from an Asian country, I'm still pretty open-minded and did some research on open relationship before. Indeed this is the very first time I watch a movie portraited such direct everything in issues of open relationship. Before the movie, I thought that deep honesty would solve things, but actually, honesty is never enough if people are, either over-sensitive, or not really involved in.
The last thing I want to say to you guy, is the sentence of Paul said to Martin in the movie: ""Love is two people who don't give up on each other.""
personally 8/10",Newness
41,ayushvibrant,This hits like an unexpected storm !,10,8 January 2021,"I have never seen something like this, you go on a complete ride of emotions while watching it. It makes you sick in your stomach, it tickels yours heart, it touches your fantasies and it makes you warm and at home.
This movie makes you feel like you are sitting in a train and looking out of it's window and this train is travelling through all the dark places of your heart, going through all the weird fantasies of your mind. It makes you realise how twisted we are as humans, and how simple the solution of any problem is; communicate.Cinematography is absolute gem, acting is superior, colour and frame placement is ingenious.
It holds up a mirror in front of you to realise, how complex we are as homo sapiens.",Newness
42,JP95,Some weaknesses but overall powerful.,8,3 July 2021,"It's at least 30 minutes too long (but then most films are), with slow pacing at times. For the most part it's extremely realistic and believable (especially the dialogue)...*except* when the attractive young woman wants to sleep with the homely heavyset old guy. Given the subject matter, I also find it strange that nudity is so conspicuously avoided.But most disappointing for me was the ending. As it drew closer, I so hoped that for once there could be a (realistic) message that not everyone wants or has to be with one person forever (I simply don't believe humans are wired for lifetime monogamy; instead, they force it because society expects/demands it). But no, film and society cannot allow that message. So the young sexual characters quite literally (inexplicably) decide that ""boring is okay."" That it's fine to settle. While predictable, this was really disappointing, especially as that's the final impression you're left with.All that being said...the acting is truly remarkable, especially the range of emotions communicated *without* words. The cinematography is nuanced and gorgeous, and I was particularly taken with the score, which could not have been more perfect and significantly contributed to the overall power of the story and the visuals.This is not a movie for ""the masses"" (no sci-fi or superheroes or car chases or explosions, sorry). It's a film for intelligent, thinking, feeling, inquisitive, reflective audiences. There is some truly startling realism in this examination of human emotions and relationships. While the aforementioned weaknesses (especially the ending) detracted from what would otherwise have been a 10/10 rating, overall I found this to be an extremely powerful, thought-provoking film experience.",Newness
43,sydneyledonne,Worth it.,10,22 July 2020,"I'm not much for movie about romance due to cliches but this movie gives a modern take to romance in the 21st century and ultimately explores real life issues that are relatable that movies about love don't discuss. Boredom with partners that lead to exploring new avenues together, old emotional baggage being represented in the present, infidelity without guilt, honesty with fear, the real issues are displayed. And for that, I give this movie a perfect score.",Newness
44,danmand-36663,Emotional roller-coaster,10,3 November 2017,"My first review ever. Just finished watching this gem of a movie, and I am blown away. There were so many emotions played out in this movie, it should be impossible not to relate to.The topic is a coming-of-age story. Two young people in the big city, who want to experience everything. And it seems like everything is available today. And your smartphone just amplifies all the choices you have. The tone of the movie is slow and somewhat grey all throughout. Camera action and music is slow and deliberate really supporting the heavy emotions. It is not sad though. Just really intense. The movie explores many emotions and experiences, and gives you plenty of time to feel them yourself. Don't want to spoil it, but they get to go through a lot.The main casting was really good. Actors took their time to get into the roles. Some background stories were told but only when needed. Also plenty of good supporting roles.It all makes for a very interesting story, and as a viewer you really relate to the characters and what they go through.It is rare that a movie has the guts and takes the time to deal with so much, and do it so well.The subjects are bound to cause reflection, so if you watch it with your significant other, be ready to take some time afterwards to reflect and discuss.I was very impressed 10/10",Newness
45,nathaliehrivnak,More a feeling than anything else,8,5 November 2017,"Movies like these don't come along very often. This is my third Doremus film (after Like Crazy and Equals) and while Equals probably remains on the top of my list, Newness comes in at a close second. Newness explores the dangers and thrills of online dating in an urban world, where distractions are easily found and easier to be pursued. In the midst of it all, Martin and Gabriela are trying to find their way as a couple. The movie's appeal comes from its splendid directing and cinematography, which was already outstanding in Equals. The wash of hues, the angles, everything fits like a glove and helps underline the vivid and thrilling nature of the movie's theme. It feels organic, authentic and vigorous, not least due to the unadulterated performances of its main cast - Nicholas Hoult and Laia Costa (who was already brilliant in Vicotria) have chemistry coming up the wazoo, it's almost ridiculous. This movie took me on an emotional roller coaster; it's definitely not for everyone. And it's not a perfect movie by any means. Watching this movie simply felt a bit like falling in love, which - in my book - always seems like a good thing.",Newness
46,sheepish-wolves,emotional but also slow,5,24 November 2018,"I'm torn about this movie. You feel a connection to these characters, you feel their passion, pain and frustration and the film does a great job in the emotion department however, at times it moves frustratingly slowly, the camera angle/frame/whatever is suffocatingly close and personal. The main characters are a real mess and seem to just play with each others emotions. I really don't want to believe humans can be this selfish and self-serving but who knows, maybe I'm sheltered and this is real life.",Newness
47,johanemoller,Beautiful and real,9,7 March 2020,"Although a bit slow, it's truly honest and real. A completely original concept executed brilliantly. The acting is nuanced and the feelings of the characters are brilliantly communicated to the audience. A truly underrated movie!",Newness

49,link-52208,A didactic drama,8,5 August 2020,"To the average person this isn't quite an amazing movie. Many people though can relate with the theme of the movie and even benefit from it. Yes it has some flaws and the acting isn't perfect but the idea is not bad.More specifically the entire idea is based on the free relationships in which each person has the freedom to sleep with other partners without any trouble. Other things happen too but everything flows around of this activity.There are many, many sad moments in the movie which show how life can be when experiencing that type of a relationship. I call it a didactic drama.Around the end of the movie the protagonists understand how toxic that can be to their relationship, each with a different way. In the last minutes they finally agree to accept each other's flaws that might occur in the future and so they commit on a serious relationship. They know that there will still be fights and disappointments and still they accept that.To me this movie can benefit the viewer whether he is in a relationship or he is afraid to commit to a person.A honest rating would be 5-7/10 but it was great to me specifically. I actually cared about the characters and I'm not that easy of a viewer... So it's 8/10 by me. Nice work",Newness
50,carolinalarsencinema,The digital age and monogamy,5,22 February 2018,"In the hands of Drake Doremus; American director of the indie circuit, Newness, is presented as a loose successor of Like Crazy (2011), in an attempt to portray in the most realistic way possible, the complexity of interpersonal relationships in the digital era, where social networks and Dating applications have set up a new way to meet people and establish links.Nicholas Hoult stars as Martin Hallock, a young man who leaves halfway his university career to work as a pharmacist, and who, after the failure of his marriage, decides to seek new relationships without compromise in dating applications. It is there where after a failed meeting, he meets Gabi Silva -interpreted by Laia Costa-, a Spanish therapist, with whom he will establish a connection that will make them consider stable relationships and monogamy again.Soon the couple is stifled by the complexity of the bond; issues such as infidelity and desire for the others are put into play. Although he is not very convinced, Martin decides to accept the proposal of Gabi, and go with her in the exploration of new alternatives. Establishing a communion of ""open relationship"", based on communication and honesty, where sex is presented as an escape route to commitment, to real involvement with the other.
New ways of feeling and perceiving push the couple to develop small breaks internally and in relation to the other, which forces them to reflect on their personal desires, past determinations are reflected in the present, life projects and own decisions, generating a tense and chaotic panorama.The film navigates the anxiety and intensity of the now, the superficiality of contemporary links and the mediation of communication through technological instruments. It raises the classical dilemma between casual relationships and stable bonds, between freedom and the oppression of the individual, love and sex. Forcing the viewer to question their own existence and their links.
However, the tape remains halfway, unable to capture its objective correctly, losing its essence after 40 minutes, its ""newness"", resulting extremely boring and predictable.",Newness
51,calitr-49217,Beat movie of 2019,10,1 October 2019,I'm no movie critic but this movie is pure art. It is so honest and raw. It hits feelings you didn't know you were afraid to feel. It was poetry in film form.,Newness
52,bunnycalligraphy,This movie was made for me,10,27 July 2020,"If you've ever been in an open relationship, this movie touches on some very real things about what actually happens in one. It's all fun and games until someone stops telling the truth. I really loved that they included that scene where the lady at the book meet told them that they should think of this ""lifestyle"" as ""a layover, not the destination"".It can definitely be fun with the right person, but you have to be very careful and honest, especially with yourself.If you're reading this and you want an open relationship bc you're excited about the idea of having both security/stability and independence, you gotta think of what you really want instead of walking around with a blindfold feeling for a sense of direction and going with wherever the waves bring you.
My jaw dropped when it was showed how the older man can switch it up so quick from treating Gabi like a princess and a piece of treasure to talking down to her like a child who's only with him because she needs something from him. I've seen this in real life in ""older successful guy-younger naive girl"" relationships.This writers knew what's up. I think people who have never experienced/heard of the kind of relationships and lifestyles exposed in this film will feel confused and even doubt what was portrayed actually happens in real life.Welcome to the modern world!I hope more people find this film.",Newness
53,accazetta,I created an account here just so I could say 6.4 is not fair to this film,9,1 August 2020,"This film isn't for everybody. If you are a millennial, or maybe older but open minded, or if you are just empathic enough, you will understand the feelings this film aims to pass. It's not about the characters promiscuity or dating apps relationships, it's about doubt and excitement and fear of loosing freedom, and that moment when you meet someone new and you are talking, flirting, it's very exciting, you are having a really good time and THEN if you decide to take one step forward, you have to face the baggage that person carries. Past, exes, fears, traumas.That's something the older generations don't get, because back in time people used to date less and get married sooner. But for millennials, that's very relatable. People have dated other people, some times many other people. People have had sex with other people too. People have met other people's families - I could go on but you all already got it - and we have to deal with it. So that's why not everybody will understand.I'm young and getting married soon. The story made me think a lot. I'm very sure of my decision on spending the rest of my life with my partner. Even knowing it's going to get boring eventually. Then we will figure it out. I'd never do what the characters do because I have different principles, but I totally understand their feelings.Now, going back to the film. The actors were convincing. The way it was filmed was also particular. The camera wasn't steady, maybe purposefully to make it look like the videos we're used to see in social medias. Again, very close to younger generations. And about the end, I saw some people saying they don't like it, but this movie isn't about the end, it's about what they went through to get there. I wouldn't change a thing.In my opinion, 6.4 doesn't do justice to this film, but, again, I can imagine people with different visions about life and relationships watching it and not getting it.",Newness
54,ljohn-30923,First Movie To Be Rated,7,16 August 2020,"This is my first movie that I'm rating.
It start off not too great.
I love the story of this film.
It resonates with my ideology with how I personally view relationships.
I believe the idea of how relationships are of a certain complexity since it deals with human wants and needs.
The idea that monogamy is a challenge holds truth.
I am no conservative by any means, but this film quite frankly depicts the modern dating scene in a way that holds some truth of how our generation have conflicting views on dating, sex, relationship, and intimacy.
And I think people have to start to realize that everything matters, our decision matters.
And it's good to have a moral compass and to learn to put oneself in another's shoes.
A true relationship will technically end up a little dry, predictable, and repetitive, however, because it holds a value, and because it holds value, it's uniquely preserved to those who are mature and responsible to themselves and their partners.
Lust is normal.
Transparency is most aspects is good.
The grass may seem greener on the other side as most people have this perception. The truth is, water and love your grass, for they will grow with passion.
You will reap what you sow.

59,charlotte_v_dijk,"Our emotions, as humans, shown in an exceptional way",9,6 November 2017,"This movie, to me, is not about how they meet, go through life or the open relationship. It is about that moment we always look for, the instant chemistry, which makes us euphoric and therefore happy. That bubble that everything is oke, everything is in line and I love somebody and that person loves me back in that moment. The way this movie is shot, the high level of acting, it is as if you are watching your own life in some way. I think everybody can take moments from it and see what moments happen in their own life and how they react. It is not intended as a movie to learn from, but just to hold a mirror up. It is not good or bad, just how we walk through life. To me, it is a good thing to keep realizing it. If I had to pick one thing that stout out, I would say; that moment the bubble bursts. When you start to talk to each other and learn more about their way of thinking. At that point you are going to hear something you don't like and in an instant, your face changes and you need to deal with that emotion. That's when the euphoria stops and you try to get it back.

Cinematography is intimate allowing the audience to really feel the tension and uncertainty between the characters played by great actors as they embark on a emotional roller coaster, trying to define their relationship and what ""works"".

Many important topics have been touched upon, which I believe should be discussed instead of kept silent.Many people who watch romantic movies and believe in the love of movies certainly did not like this movie. I understand you. No one wants to believe that love can have such ugly faces. But this film shows a reality. Scary and cruel, but real.We live in such times, in whatever we want, it would be very difficult for us to have the perfect relationship. Today we are all involved in the global world, and with it come social networks, tinder, grinder, snapchat, etc. In times when people are just a click away, we can't help but wonder what our nature really is, are we actually monogamous?The characters decided to start a strange journey. Journey to yourself. No lies and no accusations. In my opinion, this journey took the form of psychological therapy. Because the heroes did not run. They were ready to immerse themselves in exploring their inner worlds. And there are many secrets, sadness, cruelty, perversion and what not.Whether you accept it or not, we humans are like that. Everyone hides a whole world within themselves. And as beautiful as it is, so ugly. But these characters showed us their world, explored themselves and their relationships, and revealed themselves to us.
