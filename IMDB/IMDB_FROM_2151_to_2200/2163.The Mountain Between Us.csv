0,TheLittleSongbird,A mountainous climb that left me lukewarm,5,10 October 2017,"Watched 'The Mountain Between Us' because the idea for the story was an intriguing one and Idris Elba and Kate Winslet are very talented actors who have both got great performances under their belts. That its critical reception was mixed, with many leaning towards the negative, made no difference to me.Seeing 'The Mountain Between Us', it could have been much better. The potential was quite vast, there was a good film in 'The Mountain Between Us' somewhere, it was like having lots of snow to begin with then to find later on that it melts to slush. Is 'The Mountain Between Us' an awful film? Not to me it wasn't. Was it great? Again from personal opinion it wasn't, nor was it particularly good. It has good elements sure but the latter stages of the film in particular bring it down.'The Mountain Between Us' does have notable good things. The scenery is beautiful and full of atmosphere, a wintry setting in a fight for survival film has not in a while been more beautiful or chilling. The stunning cinematography with some jaw-dropping camera angles impresses even more and complements the scenery wonderfully, making it even more striking. The music score is not a necessarily memorable one but there is a brooding intensity that works well.Considering what they have to work with, both Idris Elba and Kate Winslet are very good, he bringing charismatic gravitas and dignity and she bringing fiery spirit and pathos. They both deserved better but they really make the most of making things work. The dog is just adorable with very natural and expressive acting, definitely the character that one cares for most. There are some moments of peril that are done with flair and atmosphere.However, most of the perilous scenes lack suspense and a sense of true danger with it being too obvious what the outcomes are and some of it in a contrived way. Slow pacing often is not a problem for me, there are great films to masterpieces that have a slow pace but it works because everything else is executed so well. With 'The Mountain Between Us', the pace did drag, severely hurt by the lack of tension, and it does feel like the film is 15-20 minutes too long.For the slow pace to not matter, the story needed to be absorbing, the emotions and suspense to be there and the characters to be interesting and developed reasonably (even if they weren't complex). Suspense and tension is pretty much zero, the predictability and far-fetched nature of the storytelling dilutes both, and when it comes to the emotions and such the romantic chemistry between Elba and Winslet had more frostbite than it had warmth, although the individual performances were very good the chemistry was too cold and remote.None of the characters, apart from the dog, are interesting or worth investing in regardless of the professionalism of the acting. The characters are very flimsily developed, with their stories lacking any insight or freshness and instead come over as clichéd and melodramatic. 'The Mountain Between Us' particularly loses its way in the final 30 minutes which honestly felt like it belonged in another film, none of it rings true or resonates emotionally and the excessive slush would be more at home in a film of a Nicholas Sparks book at its schmaltziest.Overall, doesn't have enough to generate much warmth but has enough to not leave one completely cold. Lukewarm (somewhere in between) is more like it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Mountain Between Us
1,SnoopyStyle,up to the sex,6,20 April 2018,Ben (Idris Elba) and Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) find themselves stranded at an airport after a cancelled flight and an impending storm. Alex recruits stranger Ben to join her on a small plane ride to Denver to catch an early morning flight. They hire pilot Walter (Beau Bridges). Walter has a stroke and crashes the plane on a mountain top. Walter dies leaving his dog. Alex is injured with neurosurgeon Ben caring for her.This is fine as a survival thriller. The characters are not survivalists and they make several mistakes. All of that is great. I like this movie... until the sex. These are supposed to be people on the verge of starvation. I don't see how they would have the energy to spare. Withholding sex would actually make their relationship all the more compelling. It would make the last section even more poetic and epic.,The Mountain Between Us
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Really messes up the romance component, but the story of survival was fine overall",6,10 December 2017,"""The Mountain Between Us"" is a new American movie from this year (2017) that runs for 110 minutes approximately and is based on a novel by Charles Martin, apparently his first work making it to the (big) screen. The director is successful Israeli filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad in his first film transitioning to Hollywood and one of the writers adapting the novel is Oscar nominee Chris Weitz. As for the cast, it's all about Idris Elba and Kate Winslet and nobody else. The fact that I like them both quite a lot certainly helped me personally in enjoying this one overall. It is the story of a surgeon and a journalist surviving an airplane crash and fighting for survival in the snowy mountains. From the ""alone in the wilderness"" perspective, this was certainly well done and is on par with classics like ""Cast Away"", ""Thr3e""/""Survival Island"" and the recent ""All Is Lost"". Sadly, there were nonetheless scenes and moments that did not work out so well, like the arguments mostly, especially the first when he hear Elba's character accuse Winslet's that it is indeed her fault and that she holds him back. This came out of nowhere really and went very much against all we witnessed before in terms of the characters and their mannerisms and justifying this scene with how much of an extreme situation they were in is not enough for me personally, at least not the way it was elaborated on in here. I don't know how it is handled in the book as I have not read it which you should always consider when checking out this review.Sadly, in terms of the romance, this was so bad at times that you could call it a negative deal-breaker almost and I could not blame you. The only thing that could have made it worse and more unrealistic would have been if they depicted Winslet's man as an unlikable character. But the melodramatic elaboration on Elba's character's wife's terminal illness and Winslet's character listening to the tape repeatedly and of course being caught red-handed were very much on the cringeworthy side. The very last shot is a perfect example of a feel-good ending too that felt very much for the sake of it. I'd have preferred the film ending the very moment she answers the call when he finally calls her. As for the music. It was good how there was basically no soundtrack at all in the critical scenes in the icy mountains and when we heard music later on, it was not too convincing for me. There are so many areas where the film could have needed a lot more subtlety. Another example of that would be the tearjerker reference to the dying girl photo that really destroys the nice idea of him asking her to take a photo of him, the last one, in case he dies. What else? A thumbs-up to Bridges delivering a good supporting performance early on and Mulroney (always liked him, he's older than I remembered) doing the exact same thing later on. Both made the most of their material. And so did the dog, so this one's for canine lovers too. I guess that would be all. I really wish they could have not turned this at times into a film on the level of a stupid romantic comedy, especially the restaurant scene towards the end was painful to watch almost. Of course there is no comedy in here and how seriously the movie takes itself is not helping at all. A touch of Rosamunde Pilcher and Inga Lindström. My fellow German movie buffs will get the reference and parallel. So yeah, if you like Elba and Winslet (she has turned a bit into a younger Meryl Streep recently hasn't she? and I am not sure I like it) as much as I do, then check this one out. There are more than a few scenes that make it a pretty good watch in my opinion, even if the lows may be lower than the highs are high. I give it a thumbs-up. Seeing it once is enough though.",The Mountain Between Us

5,kosmasp,Survinng ...,8,5 November 2020,"To pull this one off, you have to have two strong lead characters and actors. And you do have them. Now hindsight is 20/20 ... although I think after 2020 maybe we should retire that saying! That aside, yes if you'd know what would happen, if you choose to do something, you might rethink and not do that, right? But that is not what you can usually do (at least not at this point in human history).So after the incident that kicks everything into gear, we get to see a lot of our main actors. And a pet ... a pet that seems to not need much. Which you may find as unbelievable as any plane not having contact or sending last coordinates before crashing. Or cell phones that can not do emergency calls ... apparently those are always possible. At least that's what I've been told, never had to rely on that.That aside, there is enough tension and enough things happening to keep you engaged throughout. Certain things may feel a bit too easily achieved and others not so much. Whatever the case, the movie ends on the right note - in my humble opinion",The Mountain Between Us
6,lee_eisenberg,cold heights,5,27 June 2018,"""The Mountain Between Us"" feels like the sort of movie that they made hoping that the stars would get Academy Award nominations. It's not a bad movie, but it did feel like the sort of thing that I've seen before (namely in the 1997 movie ""The Edge""). I haven't read the novel on which it's based - and probably never will - but the movie's strength is in Kate Winslet's and Idris Elba's performances. It's not a total debacle in the sense of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Man on the Moon"" or ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", but I was hoping for something more creative.Nice cinematography, though.",The Mountain Between Us
7,jboothmillard,The Mountain Between Us,6,19 August 2021,"I had recorded this film from television a number of times on my YouView box in the last couple of years, but I kept missing it or having to delete it to make room for other recordings, so I'm thankful when I decided to rent it, directed by Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now). Basically, after their flight is cancelled due to stormy weather, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Bass (Idris Elba) and photojournalist Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) hire a private plane with pilot Walter (Beau Bridges) to fly them from Idaho to Denver. Alex is flying to New York for her wedding and Ben has an emergency surgery appointment in Baltimore. During the flight above the snowy mountains of the High Uintas Wilderness, Walter, who did not file a flight plan, suffers a fatal stroke, causing the plane to crash on a mountaintop. Ben, Alex, and Walter's Labrador Retriever survive the crash, but Alex has suffered a bad leg injury. Alex is unconscious, Ben attends to her cuts and injured knee and buries Walter's body in the snow. Alex becomes conscious, but they are stranded for days with dwindling supplies. Alex is sceptical they will be rescued and suggests Ben should leave her behind to find help, but he insists they should stay in the plane's wreckage. He agrees to climb a ridge to see if there is any sign of a road but sees nothing but mountains and narrowly avoids falling down the side. While alone, Alex goes through Ben's things and listens to a message from his wife saying, ""I'm glad to have had this time with you"". A cougar appears and attacks the dog, but Alex shoots a flare at the big cat before it can attack her, killing it. The dog returns and Ben comes back, he tends to the dog's wounds. They cook the cougar giving them a few more days of food. Alex and Ben argue over waiting for rescue or descending the mountain to find help or a phone signal. Alex decides to leave and descends alone down the mountain with the dog. Ben leaves the wreckage to catch up to them, and in the process finds the tale end and the beacon, but it is smashed. When Ben catches up to Alex, they hike down to the treeline and spend the night in a cave. Using her telephoto lens, Alex thinks she sees a cabin. While Ben leaves her and comes across the empty cabin, Alex breaks through ice into a lake of freezing water. Ben returns and pulls her out, but she remains unconscious and severely dehydrated. They spend several days in the cabin where Alex recovers. She again goes through his things and listens to the message from Ben's wife, he reveals that she died two years ago from a brain tumour. Eventually, the two get closer, kiss, and have sex. As he sleeps, Alex takes his picture. Later, she again tells Ben to leave her behind to find help. Ben initially agrees and leaves the cabin, but he cannot leave her alone and returns. Continuing their hike, the dog alerts them to a nearby timber yard. Ben leaves Alex toward it, but gets his leg caught in a bear trap. Alex cannot free him, but she reaches the yard and collapses in front of an approaching truck. Ben wakes in a hospital bed and goes to find Alex. He finds her with her fiancé Mark (Dermot Mulroney). After a brief conversation, Ben leaves, heartbroken. Ben and Alex go their separate ways after leaving hospital, with Ben keeping the dog. Some time later, Ben receives a package filled with photographs taken by Alex while on the mountain, and a note that only he can understand them. This encourages Ben to call Alex. Meeting at a restaurant in New York, Alex reveals she is now a part-time teacher, and Ben is a consultant at trauma clinics in London because his frostbitten hands will not recover sufficiently for him to perform surgery again. Ben says he did not call Alex because he thought she had married, but Alex reveals it did not work out, as she had fallen in love with Ben. Outside the restaurant, Ben admits to Alex that they survived because they fell in love. Alex dismisses her feelings, telling him she doesn't know how they could be together in the real world. They hug goodbye and begin to walk in opposite directions. While walking away both become distraught, until they finally turn and begin running back to each other. The screen cuts to black just as the two of them embrace. Winslet puts on an American accent while Elba speaks his own English accent, they both give suitably compelling performances, even if there is not much backstory. The survival story is filled with plenty of moments that get your attention, from wild animals, snowdrifts, physical injuries, and endless trekking, and you do want to see how the two leads will come together and be saved, I agree the last half an hour where they return to civilisation feels rather out of place, overall, it's a simplistic but watchable romantic action-adventure.

8,oscaralbert,"""What happens on the Glacier . . . """,8,12 October 2017,""" . . . STAYS on the Glacier,"" is something that apparently EVERYONE knows EXCEPT for Hollywood screenwriters. When your plane smashes into a mountaintop, forcing you to chow down on your friends to build up the strength to walk downhill (as in ALIVE), a normal person would NOT be telling their tale to Tinseltown at the first opportunity. Similarly, when Kate Winslet endures a cozier fate with just one fellow passenger, who inexplicably fishes her out of icy waters instead of recognizing the Karma of sitting back and waving ""Buh-bye"" as SHE did to Leonardo DiCaprio in TITANIC's parallel scene, why rush to blab every sordid detail to the World? But with THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US, Racist film story scribblers try to outdo ALIVE and TITANIC by coming up with a new dictum for Survival in the Cold: ""Once she's tasted cougar, no more White dudes for her!"" Anyone who's thumbed through a Harlequin Romance Novel in the past 20 years will recognize this sort of drift into Titillating Perversion: The Moor the Muckier.",The Mountain Between Us
9,george.schmidt,Surprisingly dull survival story,6,7 October 2017,"THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US (2017) ** Idris Elba, Kate Winslet, Beau Bridges, Dermot Mulroney. Surprisingly dull survival story about two strangers forced to take a shuttle air flight and wind up crashing into the snowy environs of a mountainous no man's land with the insurmountable odds against them. What transpires instead of a courageous and well-developed relationship scenario is instead a disappointing and pedestrian paint-by-numbers pallid retread of an unlikely duo facing a nightmare with barely a hint of chemistry between the two extraordinary actors or the least amount of tension mustered no thanks to a lackluster script by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe - based on a Charles Martin novel - and the hamstrung direction by Hany Abu-Assad seems as out of his element as his characters.",The Mountain Between Us
10,neil-476,"Tolerable, but a bit dumb",7,8 May 2018,"Photojournalist Alex and neurosurgeon Ben charter a light aircraft in order to make a connection. Their pilot has a stroke and the plane crashes high in snow-covered mountains. Alex's leg is injured. Should they stay with the plane wreckage or try to make their way to civilisation?Kate Winslet and Idris Elba star in an adventure with a side order of potential romance. There is some stunning scenery and impressive effects, giving a real sense of jeopardy. And Winslet and Elba are both class acts, so no qualms about the standard of acting.Then there is an absolute host of minor quibbles, most of which could have been dealt with easily in writing or production: the fact that they are not almost constitutes carelessness. In upwards of 3 weeks, for instance, Winslet's facial contusions heal (fair enough), and her hair remains glossy and clean without the benefit of washing. Where did their winter weather gear come from? The dog which accompanies them bounds along cheerfully despite not being fed for 3 weeks. Firestarting is no problem, and fires burn steadily with a minimum of fuel. There is an element of Stupid Behaviour In Films which, in this scenario was unnecessary - they are in enough of a fix without it being added to by stupid behaviour.This is moderately entertaining if you can put aside all the small stuff, and the rather bigger concern which is that, despite their resourcefulness, these two would be dead as doornails in fairly short order due to any one of a multitude of things.",The Mountain Between Us

Realising that help is not on the way, they embark on a perilous journey across hundreds of miles of wilderness, pushing each other to survive and discovering their inner strength, and feelings toward one another......Elba and Winslet are two wonderful actors who could make the most mundane of scripts watchable, and here, this is exactly what they do.The film throws us almost straight into the main plot arc, after a brief appearance from the lesser of the Brothers Bridges, and then for the majority of the film, we are left with the two leads.And here where the problem lies.Their characters are about as cold as the conditions they are subjected to, and for the majority of their journey, the conversation is almost non-eventful, aside from the odd argument about her staying off her leg.The script doesn't allow any chemistry to flow between the two, and for the most part, it appears that Ben really dislikes Alex, and as a surgeon, it's more or less his duty of care to look after his ailing patient.The scenery is predictably gorgeous, and once the characters finally warm to each other, you are more committed as to just how the dog is staying so chipper and energetic throughout, despite being attacked earlier on.It's a shame because this film has so much potential, and despite the characters being less than sympathetic, the two leads make the film averagely watchable.The final act is the meet and greet scene, and you can see what's coming from a mile off, and it handles it poorly.Editing is poor, and there is one scene where it looks as if Elba was dreaming about being inside a washing machine, and it's unintentionally hilarious for all the wrong reasons.It's not a bad film, just uneventful.",The Mountain Between Us

13,deloudelouvain,All you shouldn't do if in a plane crash,5,26 December 2017,"Plane crashes, survival, alone in the freezing mountains, that all seems to be great ingredients to have a good movie. But the truth is that The Mountain Between Us is just an average movie, nothing really special about it. I never had the feeling the two survivors were fighting for their life. On the contrary, they had time to have some good times together. That alone makes this movie everything else than that I expected it to be. The cinematography is good though, it would be difficult though to make it bad with such great views. The cast with Idris Elba and Kate Winslet are obviously not bad actors but the lame story was not in their favour. If only you would have seen some true desperation and fear of dying then this movie might have been better. Now you just have two people doing all the opposite you should do to survive and of course they get away with it. Mediocre at best.",The Mountain Between Us
14,Hellmant,Turns into a pretty decent love story too actually.,7,11 October 2017,"'THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A survival disaster flick about a surgeon and a journalist that survive their plane crashing, only to become stranded in the wilderness. It stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, with Dermot Mulroney and Beau Bridges in supporting roles. The film was directed by Hany Abu- Assad, and it was scripted by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe; it's based on the book (of the same name) by Charles Martin. The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. I found it to be mildly entertaining, and it's highlighted by it's two lead performances. A surgeon, named Dr. Ben Bass (Elba), and a photojournalist, named Alex Martin (Winslet), meet at an airport after their plane is cancelled. They then hire Walter (Bridges), a charter plane pilot, to fly them to their destination. After Walter (Bridges) has a medical emergency midflight, their plane crashes. Ben and Alex then find themselves stranded in the middle of the High Uintas Wilderness, and Alex is wounded. The two try to survive the elements, and find their way home together. The movie is exciting in places, but more than that it's a pretty good character study as well. It also turns into a pretty decent love story too actually (which the commercials definitely don't sell it on). Elba and Winslet are both good in their roles as well, and the adventure scenes are decent enough too. I had a good time watching the movie also (mostly). It's nothing special, but it's entertaining enough.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",The Mountain Between Us
15,ThomasDrufke,What a Waste,3,7 October 2017,"I think we've been pretty spoiled with great survival movies in recent years. 127 Hours, Gravity, The Revenant, Lone Survivor, or even Mad Max have given us a keen sense of a perilous journey with an emotionally satisfying finale. It seems like we get a great one every year, but The Mountain Between Us just the opposite. It uses the setting and climate to produce cheap drama and dialogue that feels like something out of a lifetime movie. With award winning actors in Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, it's hard to believe that there's little chemistry between the two. But I guess that's what happens when the script is poorly constructed.Usually it's beneficial to get to know characters before putting them in a life-threatening position, that way you actually feel for them when put in horrific circumstances. One second we're in the airport following Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in the airport as they separately try and and book a new flight during a heavy snowstorm, and under 5 minutes later, they are on a private plane together fighting through the wintry forces. It all just happens way too fast. After seeing the entire film, I'm glad there isn't any more to the runtime, but perhaps if there was more time spent setting the characters up, I could have enjoyed some of the interplay between them later on.However, as I said before, the dialogue doesn't help the situation at all. When all you have is two actors, a bunch of snow, and a beautiful labrador, there's not a whole lot you can do creatively. Yet, there are movies that have done more with less. And when you don't have a ton of chemistry with your leads, your instinct would be as a director to give the dog some screen time, and the lab certainly gets that. Being a dog person, and with thinly written characters, I cared way more about the dog's whereabouts than I did whether or not Kate Winslet would drown in a pond of ice. That sounds harsh, but it's true, there's just not a lot of meaningful depth given to Winslet or Elba's characters.Can you guess what may unfold when a man and a woman are stranded together for weeks on a mountain top? Yep, eventual romantic feelings are expressed and it's just as forced as you can imagine. As if i wasn't already disliking the movie at that point, that was the final nail in the coffin. Really, the only redeemable aspect to this film is the beautiful labrador making the trek along with the actors, and a pretty impressive crash sequence (technically). Other than that, this will go down as one of the more forgettable films (that had promise) of the last few years. 3.3/10",The Mountain Between Us

17,inkblot11,"Implausible, maybe; TERRIFIC ABSOLUTELY",8,24 October 2017,"Alex (Kate Winslet) is a news photographer who must leave her latest assignment in Idaho and return to Denver. Its her wedding day, after all, day after today. But, a severe snowstorm has cancelled her flight. Also needing to fly to Denver is surgeon Ben (Idris Elba) as he is expected for a serious operation the next day. Alex overhears Ben. Soon, she is hatching a plan of chartering a small plane and making it in time for their pressing concerns. Reluctantly, Ben agrees. The pilot (Beau Bridges) seems an affable guy who is unruffled about the weather. His dog, however, must go with them all. That's all right with Alex and Ben. Up above the clouds, the pilot suddenly goes into distress, most likely a stroke. The plane crashes, killed the stricken man and severely injuring Alex and Ben. Ben, who has cracked ribs and gashes, is awake; Alex is unconscious. So, with quick thinking, the Doc fashions a shelter out of the remaining parts of the plane and prays for Alex to wake up. She does, in pain. With a limited food supply , they are literally at the top of the mountain, with scant hope for rescue. Their cell phones have no signal and none of their relatives know what they have done. Before long, a mountain lion comes calling, which Alex shoots and kills with a flare gun. Poor creature, but his meat sustains them for a few days. At this point, Alex insists they try to climb down the mountain, to the treeline, and look for signs of civilization. But, oh, what a steep mountain it is! Will they truly make it? Also, as each is a handsome person, will they acknowledge the attraction between them that is growing? This terrific film, my view, has a sensational, harrowing plot. Yes, there are ""lucky"" happenstances that aid the couple's trip down the mountain. So what? It could happen just so. Then, Winslet and Elba carry much weight on their acting shoulders as almost every scene is them alone, with a cute canine. They succeed, beautifully, while the direction never flags. Finally, the scenery and cinematography are breathtaking, immersing the viewer in the ordeal. As such, don't let anything come between you and getting to the theater before it vanishes from the big screen.",The Mountain Between Us
18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,5,17 December 2017,"The Mountain Between UsThe real key to surviving the wild is getting an appetite for wolf meat.However, due to the altitude in this romantic-adventure, cougar meat is more likely.When a storm strands an ill-tempered neurosurgeon (Idris Elba) and an engaged photojournalist (Kate Winslet) in Boise, the strangers pool their funds and hire a private contractor (Beau Bridges) to fly them through the tempest.Mid-flight the pilot passes out and careens into a mountain where the polar opposite pair battle the elements to make it to shelter. Along the way, they learn to lean on each other in more ways than one.From its toothless circumstances to its lukewarm romance, this adaptation of the bestselling novel is a lopsided love story shoehorned into a tale of survival that never fully commits to either of its fanciful story lines.Furthermore, be careful when making out with a starving person, as they tend to bite.

The plot was simple but interesting and in some points there were missing some information but nothing important.

The Mountain Between Us lacks in about everything from character developments to even making the characters interesting. The thrills of surviving was very dull in the movie. And the last half of the film spending it with the two leads following in love with each other was just terrible. No offense to Kate Winslet and Idris Elba for being in such a terrible film. They both are great actors and they work with what they got in the script. Kate is a beautiful stunning actress. And Idris Elba is a talented actor. There characters were nonetheless boring and uninteresting. Kate plays photojournalist Alex, who is suppose to get married and is trying to find a flight home (the day before the wedding). And than you have Dr. Ben played by Idris Elba, who needed to find a flight asap for an operation that he needed to be there for. Both desperate people got caught with their flights being cancelled. And they find a pilot that can fly them home without filing a flight plan. Then, an incident causes there plane to go down and crash in the snowy mountains. With limited food supply and no help coming. They both will need each other to survive and to find their way home. The direction was boring. There was no suspense build up. The scene with the plane crashing was dull and did not make it intense at all. The dangers with the characters coming across a cougar was boring. The whole film was just frustrating with Kate and Idris bickering at each other. Idris telling her they need to stay put and take it slow. And Kate running out there and wanting to find help. It's a movie were you see two characters hike in the long snowy mountain telling and reminding each other what they need to do for survival. And discussing about possibly dying. It can get boring when this is going on for the whole movie. Were the entire script is wasted with poor dialogue and no development. Occasionally, seeing Kate getting into trouble and Elba coming to the rescue repetitively. Also, the music score from Ramin Djawadi was slightly disappointing and did not add anything to the movie. Then, the predictableness with the characters falling in love with each comes to play which is hands down frustrating and terrible. These characters are apparently been stranded for three weeks but when watching the movie they felt like they been stuck out there for a day or two. When it comes to the conclusion, the film slows down and takes forever to find an ending. Which some scenes could have been trimmed down that did not do anything to the plot or development. Besides seeing two characters chase each other cause there not sure if there in love or not. Overall, The Mountain Between Us is a terrible film. Kate Winslet and Idris Elba are the saving grace with their acting. But there characters are not. The direction is dull and tedious. The love story is frustrating and cliché. Not even the sappy kind of love story either. I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars. I do not recommend to see on the big screen, there is no excitement and no real suspense. If you want to see, I ll wait until it's a rental.",The Mountain Between Us
22,stevendbeard,Plane Crash/Romance Movie,5,7 October 2017,"I saw ""The Mountain Between Us"", starring Idris Elba-The Dark Tower, Pacific Rim; Kate Winslet-Collateral beauty, Steve Jobs; Beau Bridges- Masters of Sex_tv, Max Payne and Dermot Mulroney-Pure Genius_tv, The Grey. This is a plane crash/survival/romance movie. Idris is a doctor stranded at an airport and Kate is a photo journalist on her way home to get married to Dermot-and she is also stranded at the airport. They join forces and decide to share the costs on a chartered plane flown by Beau but saving a few bucks ends up costing them more problems. Problems such as a plane crash in some snow covered mountains-and Beau's demise-so 2 total strangers have to depend on each other to survive. Oh yeah, Kate breaks her leg in the crash-Wow, it's a good thing Idris is a doctor-so she really has to depend on the kindness of strangers. Of course, all this depending on each other leads to some romantic feelings-Hey, they might just die in all that snow and having to fight off wild cougars and they may never make it back to their loved ones-and some heavy thinking to do on both their parts. I guess it's alright for what it is, but it's not my cup of tea-I don't think my wife even liked it that much. It's rated ""PG-13"" for peril, injury images, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guess it would be alright as a rental.",The Mountain Between Us

24,kluseba,A walk in the park,5,12 February 2019,"Have you ever heard about Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571? This plane crashed in the remote Andes. Out of forty-five people on board, only sixteen survived the ordeal that lasted for seventy-two days. Numerous survivors had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive. Others decided to commit suicide because they couldn't deal with those difficult circumstances.It's almost insulting to the victims and survivors of this disaster and similar events to write a novel like The Mountain Between Us. It tells the story of a neurosurgeon and photojournalist who crash on a mountaintop in the High Uintas Wilderness. They aren't appropriately dressed to survive. They have no equipment whatsoever to climb or descend a mountain. They are lacking food that could give them enough energy to survive.And yet, the two individuals descend the mountain as if it were a walk in the park. They are cold and one of the characters even falls into an icy lake but instead of having a severe pneumonia or worse which would be a realistic consequence, the character simply takes a long nap and wakes up feeling good. The characters don't have snowshoes, ropes or any other equipment and one of them even has a serious leg injury. And yet, they manage to descend that mountain without any noteworthy accidents which is unbelievable. Walking through snow and surviving freezing storms takes a lot of energy as you need to hydrate yourself and eat a lot of proteins. These characters roast a cougar and eat some cookies which seems to be sufficient to walk through the wilderness for weeks. Anyone in such a situation would have killed and eaten the dog that was with them. You might now think that this is cruel and that the dog is so cute. When it's a matter of life and death, you won't think that way and the only thing that matters is to eat.The movie is filled with such inaccuracies and the character development also has its flaws. Both characters walk and talk extremely slowly and not just due to the cold. A teacher has seventy-five minutes to give a class. If a teacher spoke and acted as quickly as the two main characters, he or she would need twice the time and never get anything done, hence lose his or her job. Acting in slow-motion doesn't make a movie more profound. It's actually quite the opposite. It's obvious that the movie includes a love story which is credible to a certain degree because if a heterosexual man and a heterosexual woman end up isolated on a mountain and rely on each other to survive, such a thing is bound to happen. You can tell me otherwise, but you would be lying to yourself. The way the two characters deal with the situation makes me think of two inexperienced teenagers rather than two adults however. She is extremely nosey and he never opens up about anything. She has a serious leg injury and has fallen into an icy lake but somehow finds the energy to seduce her partner and have sexual intercourse with him. That isn't realistic at all. The final thirty minutes of the movie are overlong and show us how the two characters continue their lives after the tragic events and even though they are obviously in love with each other, they are unable to tell each other the truth, wasting months being unhappy before finally making a move. They would have needed some serious relationship counseling.At least, the movie has enough redeeming qualities to make it an average experience. The movie has a fresh start and doesn't waste too much time before getting to the point. Despite having to deal with a weak script, Idris Elba's and Kate Winslet's performances are emotional without getting exaggerated. The camera work is always calm and precise. The locations obviously look great if you like winter landscapes. The mixture of a love story and a survival drama is something that hasn't been overdone in cinema yet.If you are ready to ignore numerous discrepancies in the script and sit through an overlong epilogue, you will be ready to enjoy a survival drama intertwined with a love story which makes for a fresh mixture. The movie could have been better with the actors involved but the original novel simply didn't offer enough for a fully convincing experience. This is a movie for Valentine's Day. Switch your brain off and watch it with your heart. But make sure to switch your brain on again once the film has ended or your own relationship might find a rude awakening. If you are looking for a more realistic survival drama with superb acting, watch Jungle based upon Yossi Ghinsberg's incredible survival story who is portrayed by an excellent Daniel Radcliffe.",The Mountain Between Us
25,davispittman,"It is cheesy, but entertaining most of the time",7,12 July 2018,"The Mountain Between Us (2017) is pretty damn cheesy, you know what's going to happen, you really do. By the numbers is a good way to describe this film, and I don't necessarily hate that, a predictable film can still be fun and entertaining. I don't dislike this film, it has good things that keep it afloat. Those things are Kate Winslet and Idris Elba. These two actors are just very talented and have enough chemistry to mostly pull this off. You have to know what this film is to be able to enjoy it, it's a cheesy romance. But the film knows how cheesy it is and I think it has fun with it. There are scenes where I felt the corny nature of it all went a bit too far and I was just like ok let's get on with it, but that wasn't too prevalent. The visuals are all very beautiful and it's directed well, and it features good actors with enough working chemistry. If all that is enough for you, then you'll most likely like this film. I will say that I didn't expect the third act to be as ling as it was, but that was actually my favorite part of the film. I had a good enough time with this, and didn't take it too seriously. 7/10.",The Mountain Between Us
26,aharmas,A Thrilling Romance,9,17 October 2017,"First of all, this is not a bad movie at all. It demands that you sit, that you enjoy it while it gives enough time to digest what is happening and the beauty of the intimidating setting. Gorgeously photographed and very well acted by its two leads, we're treated to an old fashioned ""survival adventure"". Instead of giving us fast and ""unbelievable"" set pieces, we keep on growing to learn who these people are, and that there's a possibility things might go either way. Time goes on, and things do happen here.Two people meet in an airport, charter a plane, and have some bad luck when their pilot is unable to take them to their destination and crashes high on the mountain, killing one and injuring the other two. Now, it's a matter of survival, and it's very convenient that one of the survivors is a doctor. It becomes apparent from the beginning that these two strong people will have some friction as they figure out how to stay alive. The electricity they generate keeps them alive as they discover ways to overcome some of their obstacles, and soon we start to notice the chemistry between them.There are thrills in the movie, involving some wild life, the inclement weather, some bad decisions, and some interesting twists along the way. Elba is a quiet and strong type who thinks before he acts and who is dealing with a personal crisis. Winslet is a impulsive type who is not afraid to take chances, but she might facing some impossible odds now.Romance blooms amid all the tragic developments, and it might be hopeless because they might not make it after all. Also, there are people waiting for these two, and eventually they have to face reality again.The last third of the film is as old fashioned as a movie has been in the last decade, and this is where one can see how powerful a good couple of actors can be. Elba is definitely a leading man, and we know Kate is one of the most reliable actresses out there. Take a chance and spend a couple of hours appreciating a good film that might not be completely original but easily outpaces many of the unsatisfying fare out there.",The Mountain Between Us

28,robertemerald,Visual splendour for a very unusual romantic tale,8,16 March 2019,"This is a romance movie with survival as a backdrop. There are more exciting survival movies, but the highly poetic and crystal clear cinematography ensure that this piece has a lot going for it. As a romance it's much better, and one can't fault the script which brings us charismatic characters and many deep and soul-penetrating conversations. There are moments of high tension, life or death decisions, a brilliant plane crash, and at least one very interesting collision with a dangerous animal. For a lot of the movie Kate Winslet is knocked out cold. The hero battles on, classic stuff. The soundtrack is subdued, and not really needed, as the breathtaking scenery (see it on a large screen) speaks volumes, a great realisation by the Director. This is a terrific movie to snuggle up with your girlfriend or boyfriend and be crying by the end.",The Mountain Between Us

30,rgkarim,The Mixture Between Us,6,6 October 2017,"The mighty majestic mountains that line the world. These monolithic displays of nature are icons for so many forms of expression such as poetry, video game stages, and yes even movies. Such symbolism is perfect to craft such an obstruction for heroes to face, all while teaching valuable lessons. And thus leads me to my next review, on a movie that centers on the immobile giants that watch over the world. The Mountain Between Us is the name of the film and its trailers have certainly stirred up a storm in the world of reviews. Robbie K here hoping to guide you through the mess to help guide your viewing pleasures. LIKES:The acting: Like the mountains they are stuck in, the lead actors in this movie are giants themselves, displaying their talents to high levels. Idris Elba once more blows my mind out how well he executes his roles. He sells the suffering surgeon well, playing the internalization well and the survivalist even more. Kate Winslet as ever brings her character to life, taking the fiery spirit she has within, and unleashing it in a manner that is wild, yet honed as the movie progresses. The two certainly have the portrayal of suffering down pat (they can really shiver) but on many levels they play well off each other, especially in the beginning. The Dog: While not the main human actor, the dog is by far the character I cared about the most. This animal, while of course like many of his canine brethren, was cute to me and impressive in the work it had to do. Trekking through the show, climbing mountains, and a variety of other things the dog certainly caught my eye for much of the screen. In addition, because I'm a big animal fan, the dog was the character that kept me engaged in the film. Every scene transition, or new challenge I couldn't help, but think ""What happened to the dog."" That component is perhaps the biggest hooking element in the movie to keep you into the film. What is its fate? Can't tell you, you'll have to watch. The Scenery: While it is no substitute for the real thing, The Mountain Between Us is a great example of stunning camera work. My breath was taken away by all the panoramic shots of the wilderness from the ever expanding sky in the peaks, to the silent wonder of the forest littering the valleys below. It brings out the deadly force that mother nature holds and stunned me by the majesty of the visual prowess cameras can pick up. So while it is again not the same thing as hiking these majestic peaks, it is the next best thing. DISLIKES:Diluted Suspense: If you are like me, the trailers might have you believe this was going to be the most suspenseful movie of the year. Unfortunately, I was fooled again. This film has some moments that got my anxiety building, but a majority of it is an almost peaceful trek through the snow. While they are certainly cold, our character's journey through the frozen wastelands lacked many elements to build up the intensity. Perhaps the lack of a cinematic score, or the fact that obstacles seemed cleared too easily thanks to convenience, this movies frozen fury was almost a little too fragile for me. Or maybe it was the other focus of the movie that downgraded the suspense for meThe Love Theme: Yes, just like the symbolic title suggests, the main wedge is the character's backstories preventing them from moving to the obvious sign of starting a romance. Much of the film tries to get the two to address their rather quick development of passion for one another in some rather lackluster ways. I wasn't sold on the romance for the most part, and the actors themselves didn't seem quite charmed by each other outside of one rather pointless scene. The friendship factor at the beginning was much stronger, and would have been the route I had taken in developing the story. Again, I don't necessarily hate love, but I would like it better portrayed for my investment. Disproportion: Timing the movie, as good geeks do, it took only 8 minutes to get up on the mountain. While I appreciate the fast pace, it gave little time to get to know the characters or at least give them a decent introduction to the madness about to be had. This opening was rather shallow and quite disappointing in the grand scheme of the movie. Yet it's not quite as bad as the dragged out ending of this film. While not as long as Return of The King, and all its false exits, The Mountain Between Us sort fizzles out in the end. This tangent was not necessary, a quick closure to try and tidy up some loose ends of a weaker component of the film. Worst off, the chemistry started to falter, making this an awkward mess with a rather cheesy, albeit poetic, ending. Not sure why these last 25 minutes needed to exist, but it could have been better spent in the beginning and end of the movie. The VERDICT:The Mountain Between Us is a beautiful spectacle of what the world can provide in terms of a stage, certainly blowing my mind on the visuals. Alongside this majestic scenery comes some quality acting and a hooking factor in the form of the dog. Yet these tools alone couldn't save this movie from being semi-dull. With the tension dropped to a PG level for symbolism and awkward love, alongside disproportioned parts, I can't say this movie delivered all I wanted. The visuals might be the main theater worthy component, but this reviewer suggests holding out for RedBox to catch it. My Scores:Action/Adventure/Drama: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5",The Mountain Between Us
31,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Mountain Between Us,4,28 December 2017,"Two strangers named Dr. Ben Bass and Alex Martin (Kate Winslet and Idris Elba), find themselves alone on a mountain after their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere (the pilot had a stroke, ugh). They must try to pull through with limited food, blistering weather, and no sight of rescue. Oh yeah and a dog joins their plight but barely suffers one iota. That's the gist of 2017's erred, The Mountain Between Us (my latest review).So OK, sometimes a movie doesn't quite succeed with only two troupers commanding most of the scenes. ""Mountain"", which feels like a cinematic antiquity from the late 80's or early 90's, is sadly that movie.Between a lovemaking sequence, a woman falling through frigid ice, a sappy ending, and a terrifying plane crash, The Mountain Between Us is a rinse, repeat cycle of ho hum Survivalism. The two main characters banter, walk aimlessly, and then build many a fire. Idris Elba's Ben must have one heck of a lighter because he blazes enough logs to equal the lethal destruction of Southern California.""Mountain"", with its scenic views of snowy, mountainous Vancouver (which substitutes for Idaho), is like a quasi-love story version of Alive and 2011's The Grey. The problem is that The Mountain Between Us isn't as clinching as the two films just mentioned. The screenplay by two writers (Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe) is filled with banalities. It recycles itself while sledgehammering the themes of death, dying, perseverance, and obliged romanticism. As for Hany Abu-Assad's direction (he shot The Idol and 2013's Omar), well he keeps things tedious and repetitive. His ""Mountain"" includes almost no persona build-up, relentless snowflakes, and implausible death escapes. Winslet and Elba give decent performances but they have wandered into an unchanging, thriller miscalculation. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",The Mountain Between Us
32,eric262003,Elba and Winslet's Chemistry Make This Film All The More Special,9,6 August 2019,"""The Mountain Between Us"" is a survival adventure romantic tale based off of the novel of the same title by Charles Martin. It tells the story of two complete strangers who have serious commitments they need to attend to but the situation they are facing makes it virtually impossible as they're trapped in the mountains and must depend on each other in order survive injury and frigid conditions. The leading performers are veteran stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet and are supported by Beau Bridges and Dermot Mulroney. It is under the competent direction from Hany Abu-Assad and the script was handled with care by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe. In many ways, this movie has a similar approach to David Mamet's ""The Edge"" which also focuses on the theme of survival in harsh conditions. I like stories of people striving to survive as they spark unpredictable scenes that help facilitate both character/s and the atmosphere that carries nicely to the plot. What makes this movie stands out is that the chemistry within the performers carries the film in its entirety.Elba stars as Dr. Ben Bass a surgeon who needs to go back to Baltimore to operate on very sick little boy. Winslet plays the role as photojournalist Alex Martin who needs to be in New York in time for her wedding to Mark Robertson (Mulroney). When they're airlines have been canceled due to stormy weather, Alex and Ben decide to hire a private plane to get them back to their respected destinations. They hire an elderly pilot named Walter who's accompanied by a rescue dog (Raleigh and Austin) and once aboard the plane, they start to connect with each other. Suddenly, Walter suffers a stroke and the plane crashes in the frozen mountains, but Ben, Alex and the dog survive. With no one to turn to due to the lack of a flight plan, Ben, Alex and the dog must survive in the without any kind of communication. Alex is badly injured and she also has guilt manifested in her as she never told Mark what she did before the wedding. Meanwhile Ben is laden with grief as he's never gotten over the death of wife who died two years ago from a brain tumor. As these two lamented who find themselves believing that they'll never be rescued, the weather starts getting worse and tensions start getting high and with limited resources left, the fear of dying is drawing near.With the success of the game show ""Survivor"", Hollywood has always had a place in their hearts for characters lost from civilization, but this movie is about two people who live in separate walks of life. Sure the plot may be simplistic, but there's many traits that will keep the viewers compelled. With the pairing from mega stars like Elba and Winslet we can guarantee great things from them. sure they're chemistry is solid, their divide scenes are equally compelling as Ben tries to find help. For a film running an hour and forty-five minutes, there's a lot being covered here. Elba is strong and as the optimistic and dependable doctor who has never overcame his grief. His performance shows us that he is one of the most under-rated performers in Hollywood who deserves more recognition that he already has. Winslet is also excellent as Alex who feels to blame for this mess due to her insecurities. Their chemistry showing here feels organic as we can relate if two strangers were lost from civilization who need comfort for each other if they have a chance to survive.Filmed on location in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, the natural scenery is like a character of its own. With the beauty from the eye's perspective but a feeling if isolation and claustrophobia from a physical standpoint. Sure it looks like a great vacation to stay for a day or two. But this duo isn't here on vacation, they're trying to get back to their commitments. Though Abu-Hassad succeeds to keep things intriguing, but the main setback are the lack of plot twists. The scenarios are played out to one's expectancy. Sure it's strong in entertainment value, but no real revelations come between this pair which is why ""The Edge"" can be the better film because it is more daring. But it's still very tense and works well on several areas, this movie is strongly recommended for all to see.",The Mountain Between Us

With a theme about discovering inner strength, this was a survival adventure that transformed into romantic melodrama with two engaging performances.

For instance, a tiny flat bit of the Uinta Mountains of Utah proved very fortuitous, but this was far from being the only instance of implausibility.

36,omendata,Elba and Winslett - Truly The Worst Pairing In Movie History...Ever...,3,14 December 2017,"Utterly awful movie full of tired old cliches and quite the worst chemistry between
the two main characters; the casting director needs to think about a new job.
Quite apart from these bad starters was the atrocious acting.
The other reviewer who says its the worst movie he has seen in 30 years needs
to watch ""THE BAD BATCH"" with Keanu Reeves = he might just change his mind but I can see where he is coming from; I would have been mighty annoyed if i had paid to see this travesty!What is it with people who review movies on here and think Elba is Mr Wonderful?
He is a terrible actor with his sometimes incomprehensible cockney accent adjunct to his mumbling. He is certainly no British equivalent to the excellent Denzel Washington - to compare the two is a joke and some of the BLM brigade actually wanted to cast him as James Bond - Nothing could be further from reality and he was certainly as laughable in this.As for a sex symbol I think the hype merchants are in overdrive.
He is about as sexy as a plank of wood and his acting is on a par!Winslet was terrible as well - it seems like she has had her day and
should just have stayed in the wilderness as the final scenes in this
film made the whole theatre guffaw in laughter they really were that bad.
I doubt if even going back to acting school would help - She is another
has-been who has had more facelifts than John Cusack to remain in the
industry but that has not helped her woeful acting.The story itself whilst it started off reasonably well just went nowhere and
treated us to scenes from other movies like the recent Josh Hartnett
film ""6 Below: Miracle on the Mountain"" - Its as if the Writer of this 
movie had just seen 6 Below and thought of mixing a love story into the pot.
Even the beginning crash of the plane looked like it had taken the idea from
the old swiss air disaster epic movie ""Alive"".Cmon - scenes like the bonking scene in minus 20 degrees in a hut with the
roof open to the elements was implausible and excrutiating and added absolutely nothing to the film but slowing the pace down even more and it looked so unconvincing and I dont think I have ever seen a more unsexy scene in a movie...ever I dont know what it is withhollywood movies these days, they all seem to have a formula which always includes a sex scene but which I have always found in nearly every instance to slow the movie down and is uneccessary - old black and white films had the balanace right where you would see the characters kiss then left it to your imagination whereas now it seems everyone wants to see nudity and simulated sex on screen - Is this really the truth and who is it that wants it - Women? or men? Certainly from all the people I know none of them want it and if they do they would rather go and watch some porn.This film is truly awful and deserves the bad reviews - I cannot believe the
costs of some of these movies. They would have been better off getting the 
casting and story right before spending money on filming but apparently this
is too old fashioned and as long as you have two or three well known names
that will sell a movie these days - How sad for the movie industry, its no
wonder Cinemas are empty and Netflix, Youtube are taking the lead now!",The Mountain Between Us

41,dglink,Two Fine Performances in Overly Familiar Survival Tale,7,8 January 2018,"Survivors of a plane crash in the mountains struggle for survival against the odds in ""The Mountain Between Us."" Photo-journalist Kate Winslet and brain surgeon Idris Elba are stranded at an airport by a fierce storm; their flights have been cancelled, and, with similar urgencies, the two strangers pair up to charter a small plane from Beau Bridges. Bridges and his dog, named Dog, agree to fly them to their connection with flights to the East Coast. Winslet as Alex Martin must attend her wedding the next day, and Elba as Ben Bass has a 10-year old awaiting surgery in Baltimore the following morning. Despite the characters' type A behavior with regard to making appointments, the film's moral is ""don't be stupid, flights are cancelled for a reason.""The tale is familiar; a crash in the snowy wilderness, lack of food, painful injuries, insurmountable obstacles, quarrels, bickering, bonding. Nothing really new here. However, the film is elevated by two fine star performances, and Winslet and Elba shine as the two haltingly get to know one another, while they struggle to survive. Winslet is inquisitive and nosey as befitting her journalistic background, while the reflective Elba is more withdrawn and harbors inner pain. Alex is impulsive and reckless, while Ben is cautious and careful. Austin and Raleigh, who together play the scene-stealing Dog, romps through the snow, chases rabbits, and seems totally oblivious to the situation. Director Hany Abu-Assad generally paces the action well, although there are a few unnecessarily artsy sequences and some barely credible coincidences. The screenplay by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe, which was adapted from a novel by Charles Martin, treads no new territory and offers no surprises. However, Mandy Walker's fine cinematography of rugged snowy British Columbia is a particular asset, and the music by Ramin Djawadi, who composed ""Game of Thrones,"" is quite good.

42,bettycjung,Winslet returns as a woman of questionable virtue,6,29 October 2017,"10/29/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was good on the big screen. The cinematography was well-done and you are treated to the pristine beauty of nature in the harsh mountainous regions of who- knows-where. I suppose that doesn't matter since it could be anywhere and survival would still be the same. Winslet is in a rush to get to her wedding and Elba is in a rush to perform surgery, but the flight is delayed and they just couldn't wait. So, they hire Bridges to pilot them to their destination only to have the small plane crash in the high mountains. Winslet once again plays a woman of questionable virtue and Elba as a man still grieving the loss of his wife. In their fight for survival (not too over the top situations, but probable scenarios) they fall in love. They eventually do get rescued, but can that connection they made on the mountain survive reality? The ending was not too schmaltzy, just enough to tug a heart string, or two.",The Mountain Between Us
43,rockman182,The Mountain Between Us (2017),6,9 October 2017,"I think the best thing this film has going for it is casting Idris Elba and Kate Winslet. Its a pairing you didn't really expect, yet most of the intrigue comes from seeing how they are together in a film. I don't mind a survival film, if done right it can be hearth-wrenching and wildly fun. I can't really say this film delivers on that front and kind of gets lost in the sap that the film chooses to focus on. Because of that the interest in the film wanes as it goes by.The film is about two people who desperately need to get back to Denver but find out their flight is cancelled. They decide to hire a private jet, which eventually crashed into a mountain. The two leads are left stranded in the cold with a dog, limited food, injuries, and the harsh cold weather. They must attempt to survive, while learning about each other along the way and forming a connection.If this film was more oriented on the thrills that a tale of survival bring, then I feel like this film would have been way worth the watch. Its mostly about two people falling in love when they are stranded together. I'd say the last twenty minutes or so of the film really take stride in a full on romance tale and becomes something you would see in a Nicholas Sparks story. This really undermines how strong the film could have been.What we see is a story that didn't maximize its potential and falls into a really generic love story. This isn't really the fault of the leads who I thought both did quite well with the material they were given. I know people have complained about a lack of chemistry between the stars but I didn't have a problem with this as much as a hamfisted love story in a film that failed to create a strong sense of urgency. Its a forgettable effort, but some may enjoy what they see.6/10",The Mountain Between Us
44,bankofmarquis,Good Acting can't overcome mediocre script and a Directing misstep,5,12 October 2017,"The common wisdom is that a film is a Director's medium.  The Director has the final say in shot selection, tone, style and emotion to manipulate the viewer to see - and feel - what the Director wants the audience to see and feel.  When done well, it can be powerful indeed.  In THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US, Israeli Director Hany Abu-Assad, in his first major US credit, gives us a fair-to-middling survival/relationship story about 2 people trapped in the wilderness after a plane crash.  In the first hour and 35 minutes of this film, Abu-Assad brings us a fairly well done, but not particularly inventive (in terms of style, pace and substance) character study of two people coming together to survive a horrific incident in spite of overwhelming odds.  And then...he blows it.The style, mood and (most curiously) the shot selections of this film change dramatically in the last 10 minutes, so jarringly so that I totally lost track of the story and emotions of these characters and started looking - and wondering - about why he chose those camera angles and this completely different style to end things with, complete with a ""trick"" at the end that just, plainly, didn't work.  It was as if Director Abu-Assad was looking to put himself up front in the end, rather than the film.Based on the novel by same name by Charles Martin (Chasing Fireflies), TMBU tells the story of two strangers - quiet, thoughtful and careful Neurosurgeon Ben (Idris Elba) and fiery, impulsive and action-oriented PhotoJournalist Alex (Kate Winslet) -  who must come together to survive when the small plane they are flying in crashlands in a remote, snow covered mountain.  They must overcome their differences and rely on each other to survive.As I stated earlier, the first 95% of this film is ""fine"", mainly on the strong acting of the two leads.  Winslet has the flashier role and it fits her like a glove.  She clearly knows and understands this character and the audience is comfortable - and understands her - from the beginning.  Elba has the tougher role, since it is underwritten and he must convey emotion and thought in a character that shows little emotion.  I have never really been a big fan of Elba's work - he's always been ""good"" but not ""great"" - but he was BY FAR the best thing in this film.  He must carry most of this film and if it wasn't for his interesting presence, this movie would have seemed intermidable, since not much - action wise - happens.So...as the movie was winding down, I was thinking ""Okay, this isn't great, but it's good enough and could entertain those who enjoy emotional, relationship dramas just fine.""And then came the final 10 minutes.Based on what was going on in the story, I get why Director Abu-Assad decided to change tone and style.  My issue is that this change wasn't earned.  There wasn't any hint that this was there (and there was plenty of opportunity to plant the seeds of this change throughout the film), so the switch is jarring and the ""trick"" ending had my emit an audible ""boo"" to the screen at the end.Do you want a good, emotional relationship film starring Winslet?  Check out ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND or even THE READER.  You can skip this trip to the mountain.  Letter Grade C+ (based on the acting that tries to get this film to rise up above mediocre writing and poor directing)5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Mountain Between Us
45,dave-mcclain,entertaining but unspectacular,6,7 October 2017,"2017's adventure drama ""The Mountain Between Us"" (PG-13, 1:43) takes place mostly in the High Uintas Wilderness (and, yes, I spelled that correctly), where most visitors have very different experiences than those in this movie. This officially-designated wilderness area can be found in northeastern Utah – but unlike the movie's protagonists, most people who go there do so voluntarily. There are hiking trails throughout the region, but they're hard to find in a snow storm and not very pleasant to navigate without proper equipment. The High Uintas includes parts of the Ashley National Forest and the Uintas- Wasatch-Cache National Forest, which include deep woods, beautiful lakes and tall mountains, sights which people marvel at that is, unless they think they're going to die up there.Ben Bass and Alex Martin have a problem and they're about to have a whole bunch of problems. Ben (Golden Globe winner Idris Elba) is a world-class neurosurgeon from London on his way to Baltimore for an emergency brain operation. Alex (Oscar winner Kate Winslet) is a photojournalist who is on her way to Denver for her wedding to a guy named Mark (Dermot Mulroney). Their immediate shared problem is that an incoming storm has led to cancelled flights, leaving Ben and Alex stranded and desperate in the Salt Lake City airport. Alex overhears Ben talking to an airline ticket agent, introduces herself to Ben and offers to share a possible solution to her problem with him. She has contacted a private pilot named Walter (Golden Globe winner Beau Bridges) who operates a small plane out of the airport and she has arranged to pay him to fly her to Denver. She lets Ben tag along and soon enough the four of them (counting Walter's trusty dog) are up, up and away. If only Walter hadn't neglected to file a flight plan, and hadn't flown right towards the fast-moving storm and hadn't had a medical episode mid-flight.The small plane crashes high in the High Uintas Wilderness. Walter is killed. His dog survives, however, as do Ben and Alex. Ben has only minor injuries, but Alex's leg is badly hurt and she doesn't regain consciousness for 36 hours. Ben does everything he can to put them in a position to be rescued and he and Alex put their heads together to figure out how to survive until then. As the hours turn into days and hope of rescue dims, the two begin to argue about the best course of action. Ben believes their best chance is to stay put and wait until they are found. Alex believes that their only chance is to try to make it down the mountain and hike out of the wilderness. She wants to trust her gut. Ben wants to play it safe. Alex has very little chance to make it on her own, but Ben can't bring herself to leave her and he knows that traversing this wilderness with her in tow would slow him down. As they work through their disagreements, brave the dangers of being without proper shelter in the winter and alternate between hope and hopelessness, Alex tries to get to know Ben as a person, Ben tries to control a situation that is out of his control and they both struggle with how to handle their growing feelings towards each other.""The Mountain Between Us"" is an improbable but engaging story. Adapting the 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin, screenwriters J. Mills Goodloe (""Everything, Everything"", ""The Age of Adaline"", ""The Best of Me"") and (Oscar nominee) Chris Weitz (""Rogue One"", ""Cinderella"", ""About a Boy"") indulge in some far-fetched situations, but give us plenty of action, peril, twists and two characters who develop a very strong emotional bond. Israeli director and Independent Spirit Award winner Hany Abu-Assad (2005's ""Paradise Now"") gives us beautiful sights, interesting visuals and paces the film well, but allows the third act to get unnecessarily awkward. Elba and Winslet give us predictably excellent performances, but they've both been better in other projects. This one works well as a survival story and fairly well as a character study and a romance. It all comes together in an entertaining, but unspectacular film. ""B""",The Mountain Between Us
46,jrarichards,"Competent, scenic, well-enough-acted, but not looking too original",8,8 August 2018,"Hany Abu-Assad's ""The Mountain Between Us"" reminds us that (thankfully) the Rocky Mountains remain a wild place, all the more so the Canadian bits which here stand in for their US counterparts. And there is many a breathtaking view to be had here - something that even our stranded heroes notice, notwithstanding the fact that that very widlerness is threatening their lives. For me that observation was perhaps the cleverest touch or peak achievement in the film, though we are entitled to ask if anywhere (in the USA) is really that desolate and untouched. Otherwise this movie depends a lot on the age-old sweet/sexy ""Blue Lagoon"" type idea that two people thrown together by adverse circumstances might grow to love each other. In this case, this is Kate Winslet (Brit playing American) and Idris Elba (Brit playing Brit), and it's fair to say they do the best they can with script and story as presented to them. However, there is not a great deal of scope for more complex interaction or dialogue, just quite a lot of groaning with shared suffering, with occasional arguments as to what they should do next, and what matters in life. More of the latter we might have had...A further question begged here is whether a relationship forged in such circumstances requires at least some recreation of those circumstances if it is to survive. To be honest, I see neither London nor New York as a place in which the pairing between Ben and Alex is going to work. But I could see them buzzing off to a cabin maybe not quite as isolated as the one that saved their lives, but somewhere way out there.Beau Bridges appears briefly and injects a hint of comedy, and there's a dog, but basically this is close to being a two-star vehicle, and they do OK...",The Mountain Between Us
47,bob-the-movie-man,A film not quite sure what it's trying to be.,5,28 July 2018,"Idris Elba after scoring a mammoth hit with UK TV's ""Luther"" has really struggled to make a breakthrough as a leading man into A-grade movies. Although he's had some strong supporting roles (""Molly's Game"" and ""Star Trek Beyond"" for example) and small bit parts in the Marvel universe, when he has landed a lead role they are in films best forgotton (e.g. ""Bastille Day""; ""The Dark Tower""). This is seldom down to his performance. Here he is given more of a chance to shine, in what is almost a two-hander with Kate Winslet (""Triple 9"", ""Steve Jobs"") for most of the film. And he is the best thing in the film: lots of the brooding look that he is so famous for.Elba plays Ben Bass, a neuro-surgeon stranded at Boise airport who has to get back to Baltimore for an important operation. Winslett playing Alex Martin, a famous photo-journalist, is stranded with him and equally desperate to travel as she is due to get married in New York the following day. The two club together to hire a plane from charter pilot Walter (Beau Bridges, ""Homeland"", ""The Descendents""). But in terrible conditions, and with a medical emergency, the plane crash lands in the snow of the Rockies, and Ben and Alex (together with Walter's Labrador) need to struggle to survive in the wilderness. The problem is that they are an odd couple, and constantly wind each other up the wrong way.It's a well-worn tale that has been portrayed many times before in films like ""Alive"" and ""The Grey"", so what makes the film live or die is the quality of the screenplay and the chemistry between the characters. Unfortunately the former by Chris Weitz (co-writer on ""Rogue One"") is rather clunky, and in the latter case I just didn't feel it. Winslett's character is just so incredibly whiney and annoying that the thought of Ben doing anything with her other than hitting her with the shovel and feeding her to the dog seems unlikely! Winslett seems to sense that too, since I never felt she was completely invested in her character. Aside from one (impressive) monologue, I found it to be a so-so performance from her.Aside from Elba the other star of the show is the landscape of the High Uintascape in North East Utah of the which is beautifully filmed, on location by Mandy Walker (""Hidden Figures"").The story leaps from improbability to improbability and raises more questions than it answers: in a survival situation should you walk or stay put? If you have a dog, should you eat it* and what condiments are appropriate? Does an iced-over river have any current flowing under the ice? If they both died, would the audience care?No spoilers with answers to any of these (*apart from the dog... just joking, they don't!) , but the ending is as corny as you can get... but it still gave me a lump in my throat. #suckered!Directed by Hany Abu-Assad, overall if you have a rainy afternoon you need to fill then this a perfectly pleasant movie to veg in front of, but it neither completely satisfies as a romance nor as an adventure flick but falls rather uncomfortably between the two stools.",The Mountain Between Us

50,JohnRayPeterson,"The raw instincts of hope and love, the struggle for life",8,8 January 2018,"I was told and read this movie was one to watch and I trusted the two co-stars certainly could deliver a good performance and that they were not the kind of actors to sign on an unworthy project. Well that's absolutely true.First, the premise as simple as it is, a plane crash in the snowy mountains of Colorado and surviving both it and the journey back to civilization is nothing new, there are several similar stories told, real life and fiction, and they can be found in movies of course. I watched 'The Mountain Between Us' anyway because my girlfriend recommended it and I trust her movie savvy.What struck me, once I reflected on the experience, was the superb script by J. Mills Goodloe from a Charles Martin's novel (he worked on the script as well) and excellent directing by Hany Abu-Assad. Now I was not familiar with this director, something I'll be remedying now by watching his Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning film of the past. Too often we forget what a good script can provide accomplished actors and it's why actors thank their directors and writers when they win their awards and even simply a nomination. In this case, watching the movie, I was focussed on the emotions and thinking process of the characters more than the superb special effects of the plane crash or the beautiful scenery the Colorado mountains one naturally would expect. Don't get me wrong the plane crash scene was flawless and absolutely believable, as well as thrilling, and the Colorado Mountains are breathtaking, but at all times we are drawn into the characters mind and that is a tribute to good writing, good directing and good acting all coming together.The emotional journey the survival of such an event and of such circumstances is one filled with intense moments and adrenalin pumping peeks. It was during the more quiet moments that my own mind was running on overdrive because they were moments when the characters contemplated death, almost wish it and other times are simply resigned to it. Two such moments come to mind, when Kate Winslet stares down at a river at the bottom of a precipice and is thinking of jumping, the other when Idris Elba pauses, thinks and says to Winslet with the most honest of tone ""I don't want to die"". Those scenes triggered personal memories of like moments and like thoughts and brought me to tears, but not everyone has had those experiences.Elba and Winslet's characters, Ben and Alex, form a bond no other life equivalent could foster and so their special love overwhelms them at that moment and as we learn in the later scenes, forever. I certainly recommend the movie because of its believable factor and the excellence of all involved in the project. I loved it and thank my girlfriend for recommending it.",The Mountain Between Us

It's something plaguing most of society these days and it was the driving force behind how Elba and Winslet's entitled characters got themselves in this predicament. A lack of patience also perfectly sums up how I felt towards this overlong movie.So a plane crashes in the mountains. I've never experienced plane crash survivors so seemingly casual and blase towards their circumstances. It's like they'd either been in plane crashes previously or undergone a vigorous training course from Bear Grylls in preparation.There's a dog too. Even the dog seemed to be enjoying himself, clearly having given 'Homeward Bound' a spin prior to flying too.Fires seemingly materialize out of nowhere and they just go about their ho-hum daily tasks. Throw a stick for the dog to catch, flirt a bit here, listen to some music by the campfire, take a few keepsake photos as souvenirs of their mountain tragedy.It all seemed a bit weird, and I found myself laughing all too frequently - especially at the beginning. I initially thought it was a parody of survival films.I'm usually a sucker for Kate Winslet films, but sadly 'The Mountain Between Us' falls short in many areas. Boring, cumbersome and at times making me feel like I was suffering a lot more than the characters stranded in the wilderness.

Para mi ese acto es eterno y todo para decir lo que ya sabemos y contarlo tan mal.Tiene unas imágenes espectaculares de las montañas, a veces la verdad es que dejaba de ver a los actores y me centraba en ver los paisajes.¿Los actores están bien? Pues la verdad es que tampoco es que les llegues a coger cariño. Ves como lo están pasando de mal y no consiguen hacerte empatizar con ellos. Es más, es que no les veo feeling entre ellos. Han conseguido que sea tan fría como se muestra en la pantalla.La fotografía, es bonita, es que hay que hacerlo muy mal con esos decorados para estropearlo.

Well, the truth is that it is not that you get to love them. You see how they are having a bad time and they can not make you empathize with them. What's more, I do not see any feeling between them. They have managed to make it as cold as shown on the screen.Photography, it's beautiful, is that you have to do very badly with those sets to spoil it.

Yes it was not great, mostly due to the fact that it suffered from a rather weak direction and many plot holes and unconvincing situations. I didn't like the fact that they really rushed it at the beginning, it was like Hany Abu-Assad could not wait to finally let the plane crash. I get it, the audience should meet the two leads as complete strangers so I guess that explains the lack of character introduction but it still felt rush due to weak editing. If you switch off your brain you also can believe that they survived this horrible mountain crash, survive weeks by just eating nuts and chocolate bars, can light fire whenever they need to, although the wood is wet, but it was hard for me that they had some kind of a super dog who did not need to eat anything. oh well I guess an adventure drama like that just needs a dog. 
BUT now why I really liked the film. The acting was great. I really loved both Kate Winslet and Idris Elba who turned into wonderful performances. They also shared an excellent on screen chemistry which made you really care for them. It also has an interesting psychology and many moving and thrilling moments. I also loved that it did not end the way a film like that usually ends but had some of the most important scenes in the aftermath. Asking important questions and developing the situation further. It had excellent cinematography and a great score.

55,CineMuseFilms,an Alpine soap opera ruined by a dog,5,15 October 2017,"Casting a dog in a movie is risky; it can steal or wreck the show and sometimes do both. The survival-romance film The Mountain Between Us (2017) is a two-hander supported by a lovable golden Labrador named 'Dog'. Audiences are immune to human tragedy, but life and death is taken more seriously when a pooch is cast in a disaster film to the extent that the movie's publicity had to assure viewers that the dog is neither killed nor eaten.It's a simple tale without real surprises. Neurosurgeon Ben Bass (Idris Elba) and photojournalist Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) meet when their flights are cancelled due to bad weather. She is getting married the next day and he has an urgent operation to perform, so they decide to risk the storm and take a charter flight. When the pilot has a stroke, the inevitable happens and they are stranded on a snowy mountain without communications or hope of being found. With no food, there is only one option left: Ben, Alex, and Dog set off to find civilisation.So how does the dog wreck the show? The film faces several plausibility and acting challenges that are adversely aided and abetted by Dog. The script and its delivery has an Alpine soap opera quality to it, with neither Elba or Winslet able to step out of their 'all-wise strong doctor' and the 'injured helpless female' stereotypes. Elba does a lot of intensive furrowing of those deep dark eyebrows which signals a neurosurgeon processing god-like knowledge and Winslet does a passable job of determined dependency. The simmering bond between them barely rises in temperature so all we are left to emotionally connect with is Dog. To make matters worse, whenever danger approaches we think of the most vulnerable first, and that's Dog.However, the real flaw is the glaringly obvious contrast between the couple, who are surviving on a few almonds a day after weeks of snowbound trekking, and the dog's playful prancing through snow as if let out of the house after a big meal. The cold truth is that Dog is hopeless at pretending to be exhausted and the co-stars are not much better. Winslet's makeup and good looks improve the more she treks and the less she eats, and Elba's handsome beard stubble stays trim over weeks of hard slog with the only signs of exhaustion their breathless panting and slow-motion movement. As it becomes increasingly difficult to take this film seriously, a cabin appears with all home comforts plus two cans of soup. That's when the film falls into a hole that not even Dog can save.To be fair, the cinematography is outstanding, the mountain scenery is post-card beautiful, and even the digital effects are believable if you squint your eyes at the right time. The melodrama finds new heights in the final quarter when the simmering romance finally bubbles over into a glorious cliché that is mercifully brought to an end by the closing credits.",The Mountain Between Us

Reviews on here sometimes are so wrong that you really just have to watch the film for yourself and come to your own conclusion about what you saw. But I will say that this time around, the reviews were in the ball park of accuracy. Love Winslet, love Elba, two of my favorite actors and they do great work. The story would have been so much better if it were just a love story as compared to a survival/love story. The film started off one way and ended up another way. But the ending was the best part hands down. There was no need for McDermott to have a part in this film. His role added nothing to the film. Its not a bad film, but its no where near great...its just ok.

While the plot is intriguing at the outset (two strangers crash land in the Rockies and must learn to work together to survive the elements), things become very predictable in short order and the film devolves into every stereotypical romantic drama that has ever been created.Sure, Kate Winslet and Idris Elba are two actors with proven acting ability and a long filmography that back up the rationale for having them star in 'Mountain.' But just because a horse wins the Kentucky Derby, it doesn't mean it will get the triple crown. The two leads deliver cringeworthy lines like they are mean tweets directed at them by Twitter trolls. Again - if movies had middle names, ""predictable"" would be this one's. Not only is it clear what information will be dragged out as the two learn more about each other, but the third act is on another level in terms of disappointment.Even the moments that are intended to pass as heart-stopping action sequences feel like they were lifted from a passed over Lifetime movie script. The only real strengths in 'Mountain' are the roles played by the dog and the mountainside - at least they know their place in the film.Again, if you're thinking this is a modern-day 'The Revenant' or 'Castaway,' you've been warned.",The Mountain Between Us
58,kermitkid,No Character Development,7,31 March 2020,"This movie started strong, but unfortunately, it had a terrible second half and payoff. The only likeable performance in this was Idris Elba. Unfortunately, Kate Winslet's character is so whiny and unlikable that it's hard to root for her, let alone want her to end up with Elba's character. I'm fine when characters start out unlikable as long as they improve by the end. This does not happen here. Her character learns no lesson, and remains just as unlikable by the end. Going in, I did not know that this was a romance movie. And I can say, that if you've seen any romance movie ever you've already seen this. It has every cliche in the book. Awkaward, forced arguments, corny dialogue, 2 characters who swear not to fall in love, but then do.....I figured out how this was going to end 20 minutes in. This also had terrible CGI. There's a part with a cougar, and it looks so cheap and fake, and took me out of the film. It also ran about 30 minutes too long. The last half hour was filler, with no payoff and a predictable ending. If the first half weren't so strong, my judgement would be harsher, so it has that going for it, but I cannot recommend this movie. It was just OK.

What could go wrong?",6,3 February 2018,"A classic boy (Idris Elba) meets girl (Kate Winslet) story, only this time it begins with the plane crashing into mountains, and they have to make their way down without, you know, freezing or starving to death.I haven't read the original novel by Charles Martin, but the movie starts as simple but inventive mix of classic story types such as boy meets girl and survival, with even some light but good verbal humor thrown in.The makers don't want to expose the general direction early on, so for most of the time we concentrate on survivors overcoming the harsh conditions.Sadly, there's not much variety to sloshing in the snow and shivering near the campfires, so it gives one time to begin to notice how the storytelling tends to stay on the lazy / shallow side.For example, some of the basic points of survival stories are not adequately explained - how the duo always have strength to find and carry food, or how they manage to keep the dog alive and healthy who survived the crash too.The dog just disappears and is re-insertedwhere convenient. There's even scene which hints they had to climb down a steep cliff but never have equipment to take the animal with them. Or even take care of themselves, for the matter.Anyway, all these niggles don't quite break the suspense but don't exactly help to uphold it either.And it wouldn't be a problem at all if the story would not be so mainstream (the two's backgrounds and relationships would benefit from some depth)The makers even go as far as adding some true Hollywood style flashbacks which don't fit at all. Not to mention that these lay bare the general direction that they story has tried to hide the whole time.Luckily, it's mostly about Elba and Winslet who don't disappoint, giving solid if workmanlike performances to bring the material alive.They quietly and confidently carry the experience, so if you are OK paying to see two top thespians doing their thang, then ""The Mountain Between Us"" is good enough watch.There's almost no other human characters - the only notable supporting roles are by Beau Bridges and Dermot Mulroney.All in all, ""Mountain"" is watchable but too professional rather than passionate project from all involved, thus not eliciting true commitment from the viewer either.There are moments of authenticity, and moments that might make you care for a moment... but there's not enough to make it stick in memory.I'd like to finally see a movie that's entirely worth Elba's talent and charisma, as HBO's unforgettable ""The Wired"" managed in TV world more than 10 years ago already.",The Mountain Between Us
60,jb_campo,Simple story saved by excellent casting and acting,7,2 May 2019,"Mountain Between Us is a simple enough story. Idris Elba (Dr Ben) and Kate Winslet (photographer Alex) are at an airport attempting to fly to Denver for various reasons. Most flights are being cancelled due to weather. Alex approaches Ben with an alternate plan. Then their plan falls to pieces and they are left stranded high in the snow-filled Rockies. After that, the story focuses on whether they will survive. Simple.I was expecting something like The Grey or the book Touching the Void or even the movie Frozen about 3 people stuck on a chair lift. But the Director took a different tact. He focused on how these two strangers would work together, two people with really different ways of doing things, with different life experiences and characteristics.Kudos - that saved the film from being completely boring. The casting director hit the jackpot by pairing Elba with Winslet. They are both accomplished actors, but they also had strong on-screen chemistry. You really felt their being pulled in different ways. You really believed how each was compromising a part of themselves to work together.There really wasn't a heck of a lot of suspense. There was a cool dog who added something to the story on the humor side, but really, the focus was mostly on these two people working together.The beautiful mountain scenery presents great cinematography photo ops, but even then, the most important shots are the close ups of these people in close quarters fighting for their lives.The ending is straight out of Hollywood, but will probably leave you with a tear in your eyes. Mountain Between Us is a good movie with a simple story. Enjoy.",The Mountain Between Us
61,SamJamie,"Brisk action, blossoming romance, and a dog.",8,8 July 2020,"The Mountain Between Us is a 2017 American drama film directed by Hany Abu-Assad and written by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe, based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin. It stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as a surgeon and a journalist, respectively. The film premiered on September 9, 2017, at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 6, 2017, by 20th Century Fox.Ben and Alex are stranded in the Utah mountains after a plane crash. Together they must overcome the challenges of living in snow-covered mountains.The Mountain Between Us has a lot of flaws, but there is something to be said for a love story where the parties involved treat each other with decency and respect -- and keep track of the dog. I was surprised by the film's shift from adventure story to romantic melodrama, and yet the turn feels natural. Everyday life more often resembles a melodrama than an adventure story. If you like romantic stories and are tired of the usual treatment, this film takes a different approach to the subject. It's a good old fashioned Hollywood romantic adventure, that had the good grace to cast Kate Winslet and Idris Elba, makes for an entertaining adult-appeal movie in the best sense of the word.",The Mountain Between Us

It certainly could've been a better offering, and it was easy to tell that its intention was to be a highly gripping, dramatic and intense story of survival and romance, but unfortunately, it didn't manage to generate enough heat to melt the heart. 6/10.",The Mountain Between Us

Movies like Alive, The Grey, All is Lost, Gravity or Open Water, for me, have these qualities. Guess what neither of them has? A freaking love story crammed into it!! Why? Because it's against human nature to fall in love while you're just trying to survive. There's always a strong bond between crisis survivors, for sure, and strong feelings might come after the event, but during, really? I don't even know how the Idris Elba character had the ""stamina"" to pull it off! And it's kind of a pity, because the cinematography is gorgeous and the crash scene is really well made.

If you are thinking about watching this movie go to Homebase buy a tin of white paint, paint a square and watch it for two hours, even my Sky box thought it was longer 120 minutes rather than the run time of 112 minutes. The story two people crash land on a mountain with lassie the wonder dog who can see of mountain cats, sense when you are slipping into hypothermia, locate cabins in the wilderness. The dog out acts both Idris Elba and Kate Winslet who appear in a coma throughout the film. I have rarely seen so little screen chemistry, in fact the appear to dislike each other, in the inevitable love scene in the cabin she turns away like she would rather be anywhere rather than having this bloke humping above her.
 They are suppose to be on a mountain in freezing conditions yet they stroll of the mountain and at one point he is throwing sticks for the dog to play fetch, having been stuck in a snow drift when the beast of the East arrived, you go cold quickly, not these two.

Kate Winslet and Idris Elba were the best part of the film. Acting wise the money was solid, but nothing groundbreaking. Unfortunately the plot and it's progression were let downs. The movie wanted to be a intense survival film, but the characters never really felt in danger. There were far too many unbelievable moments in the film.

I feared with both, hoped with both and suffered with them on their challange in the deathly cold mountains. So why not the full 10/10. I was really well entertained, just a few happenings were a bit too unrealistic to give the full 10. I don't want to explain this closer, because I don't want to spoil.

Imagine a movie that maintains a serious tone throughout. Now watch this film to see if it lives up to your imagination.I wish they would make more movies like this to get a break from bullet spraying, drug dealers. Finally a man gets to be masculine in this current masculinity-hating environment without being a criminal or a cop. What a rare treat these days.Don't get me wrong.

81,jmvscotland,IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL THAT'S NEW IN CINEMA?,6,4 April 2018,"Jesus, is there anything at all that's new in cinema.I came to this movie in the knowledge that it only rates 6.4 here on IMDb.
Which is worse with this movie? The fact that we have two British actors, one of which had to play the Yank and the other play the Brit? Or was it the predictable script and inevitable romance? Perhaps it was the tension in trying to work out which, if either, of the characters, would survive the ordeal in the frozen wastes of whatever State it was - Idaho, Colorado?Or was it the fact that all this ground has been covered before. ""Alive"" which of course has a similar scenario and a similar plot was an infinitely better movie. Similarly, ""The Edge"" had many similar components and I say components advisedly because this is one of those movies that appears to be nothing more than the sum of its rather weak and poor parts. Both ""Alive"" and ""The Edge"" were better made movies and there were moral questions in both of those that were absent here.I must say that I wonder what might have induced Kate Winslett to participate in this movie despite the obvious flaws in what must have been the script that she saw before she signed on. I guess it must have been the money she was offered as a ""cheap"" British Hollywood stand-in actor as well as the fact that she got to play the Yank, presumably decided after a coin toss with Idris.Honestly, this movie was just so utterly predictable. The only thing that was absent was the glizzly bear that would try to kill them - we had a mountain lion instead. We all knew from the time of the plane crash that our two main characters (hey, they were the only characters apart from that bloody dog in the whole movie) were going to survive. The only real question remaining was whether they'd fall in love or kill each other. I think the Director should have chosen the latter. A missed opportunity there.This is the worst of lazy film-making. Pandering to the whims of movie goers who are too lazy to see the utter implausibility of most of what appeared on screen. Not least on the implausibility scale was the idea of Ben's taking said bloody dog back to the UK with him. THE ONLY saving grace of this whole mash of a movie in my view was the spectacular mountain scenery. That was the REAL star of this one and the only thing that could possibly induce me to watch it again.",The Mountain Between Us
82,mbazhome,Because Idris and Kate are great,8,1 January 2019,"I saw some trailers for this movie and thought it was trying to be like Alive. No it actually wasn't about surviving on top of the mountain, but more about making it back down the mountain and then back to real life. I thought it was good, even when the romantic part started I liked how they interspersed the love scene with the brief flashbacks to all they had been through together. How could they not fall in love. Poor dermot mulroney always the schmuck boyfriend who gets dumped. I was afraid they might have to eat the dog, but thankfully they didn't.

We knew Alex wasn't going to marry Mark, and we knew Alex and Ben were going to end up together. The final scene especially was so stereotypical it was telegraphed a mile away. After Ben and Alex leave the cafe, and are walking in different directions, I kept saying, ""Please don't turn and run back to each other, please, please don't do that.""

What I didn't like about this movie was the fact that it basically began with the plane crash. The protagonists weren't properly introduced which meant that we only ever got to see them in ""extreme situations"" (post-crash scenario). It's really difficult to review this movie because it's technically only exploring a single theme. So in order to avoid spoiling it I'll just refrain from divulging it. But I will say this much; the movie is suffering from a lot of cliche's. You'll see what I mean.I personally thought that the movie was a little bit too boring.

The story is that of a struggle for survival, but never deviates from keeping the focus on both actors. It is told in a relaxed way, has some exciting moments, but actually you ask yourself all the time whether the two get each other or not.

While Kate Winslet and Idris Elba are phenomenal actors, and I love both of them in other films, they struggle throughout this movie to communicate what maybe came through better in the book. They have zero chemistry. It's really awful. From the beginning you assume that they're going to fall in love, but they get there in a really weird way. It feels completely forced, and I think it's partly the script and partly Kate Winslet. Idris Elba could have chemistry with a brick wall...My last complaint about this movie is the pacing. It really feels disjointed. Once they're rescued, it's like it's just another romcom or something. And the last scene is shot SO poorly.

After five minutes old Jeff has a stroke but for some reason the plane hits a mountain without killing the two passengers! Talk about luck! Now it really gets stupid.

They cook some cougar flesh which seems to sustain them for about a week walking through bitterly freezing terrain, somehow managing to sleep in snowdrifts or something.

This movie is bereft of anything which movies must have. Thinnest of plots, very little suspense (they are crashed high on a mtn in the WINTER!!!!), complete lack of reality in a (post, well, except for its remaining audience)-Survivor age, and NO motivation, for anything, not even staying alive. Not to mention a failed romantic plot component (love/hate; the writers and director have obviously never seen African Queen). In fact, it is if both actors dislike (hate?) each other intensely. They must not have gotten along, and/or realized early on that this was a real stinker, and it shows. This movie is so unreal that I could easily imagine their crew a few feet away, starting fires, making sure they never sink into the snow (the DOG does!), and providing lots of hot coffee. They don't ever get very cold, for sure not what the environment demands. In real life, they'd be dead dead dead. But this movie isn't even worth suspending belief. If it had good suspense, action, relationship, and tension, then I could have, esp with the gorgeous vistas, but there was nothing.

It is amazing to me that audiences have been dumbed down to the extent that this movie is even rated over 5.0.

I'm thinking that some people felt obliged to like this film because of the PC implications.,1,11 December 2017,"There is no way a normal person would have enjoyed watching this. Sure there was a cute dog, but the movie wasn't about the dog, or the pretty mountain. It was about two hopelessly unrealistic characters that could only be dreamed up by some author that probably used to be in the academia, and never actually met any real humans before. You have Idris as your perfect knight in shining armor, and you have your prefect feminist love affair. And you have a dog. Its not actually a good thing when the best actor is a canine. The idea of those two leads actually being romantic with each other is about as enticing as watching your grandparents kiss.

Yes, I said this movie is primarily a drama/romance story that just happens to be set within a survival story context; it's not really a purely intense thrills-&-chills-per-minute survival thriller suspense movie as you might assume, so don't watch it thinking it'll be that kind of movie.It's a story that's quite content with taking its time. It's a movie that moves along at a steady pace. It's a pace that allows the two characters to have long conversations during long scenes of them trudging through the endless snow. Don't expect nonstop action scenes of them getting chased by cougars or running from avalanches or anything like that.It's a story that's more about these two people and the struggles arising from their relationship with each other developed from their survival experience, more so than about their struggle for survival itself.

107,aquascape,High altitudes for a cozy night's view,6,28 March 2018,"There have been less and less survival movies over the past years and whenever one get released, it will spark interest.""The Mountain Between Us"" is a romantic survival drama about a surgeon, played by Idris Elba, and a journalist, played by Kate Winslet, who survive a small airplane crash. Although both characters were conflicted in their personal life they were also polar opposites to one an other, thus leading to what Paul Abdul famously said in song ""opposites attract"". 
The chemistry between Elba and Winslet was good, but not great. I sensed that by the time the film starts to conclude, the viewers would have already known how it will end.The cinematography was splendid, the on-location filming in the Canadian mountains was beautiful and breathtaking, in this age of green screen and CGI technology. I firmly suggest viewing this survival drama on a perfect cozy Sunday night together with your special someone.",The Mountain Between Us
108,archiecm,"Liked it a lot, starting with the dog.",9,8 October 2017,"Here's my reaction to ""What the Flick"" wherein Christie and Alonso and Matt gave this film Luke warm reviews dissing the dog, doubting the veracity of the cabin, and totally dissing the ending as being too hoaky?I couldn't disagree more with about half of the comments, especially from Alonso. First of all I had no trouble with all the dog shots. I could have used more since I love dogs. I happen to like Hallmark Christmas movies and I love being witness to people finding love. Something tells me that people who are ashamed to admit such things or incapable of feeling them become movie critics. What a shame. I can think of no exceptions except maybe Roger Ebert. The cabin being there was totally believable. Cabins are SUPPOSED to be in the wilderness. And the ending was perfect. It's hard to take a risk. Each was prepared to do it but at different times so their pride blocked them from cementing their willingness to be together but in walking away their hearts won out. I loved that ending and thanked the world that I wasn't a cold-hearted movie critic and thereby frozen from the joy of that moment. I only regret that they cut away from the hug too quickly. It could have lasted a good minute or two.Another word about the cabin. There was no road to or from it but people have been building cabins long before we had vehicles. If you had a mule you could carry up tools and find your own rocks and lumber. In that case there would probably have been at least a trail. But that would be difficult to locate under the snow . . . maybe.",The Mountain Between Us
109,Behnam-A,Such a waste of talent !,3,16 December 2017,"The scenario was written as awfully as it could be! 
There were some logical problems with the movie which are not the main problem here but I first mention some of them, then bring up the major one.
I think this problems maybe basically are related to directing not the scenario. The survival of the dog after being attacked by a mountain lion, the lion's slow motion act in attempting to attack in the broken cabin, a broken leg woman who insists to go down from a heavily snowy, cold and dangerous mountain, are among such logical wholes. Why I say directing? because all of them are possible but they are highly unluckily except there are certain specific clues that make the situation unlike what we can expect from a plain fall on a high cold mountain. Showing tat specific conditions takes detailed but not necessarily long shots. So with some smart directing skills you can easily clear those problems.But the writing part,the scenario and the screenplay specifically, is a total disaster. there were no solid and more importantly real game change point as it is expected to be where two people are changing in the matter of emotions and finding interest in each-other. you cannot find or see the process of change in that matter. and you see suddenly the sleep together and after they survive the mountain the woman says she has fallen in love on the mountain. where? how? we don't know! we haven't seen that part. Ok, she was trying to hide that as she said at the end, but we didn't even see that. we didn't see how she tried to hid that, and how she failed to resist it, how she became interested in the first place and even how much she is serious after the whole thing is done and they got to the safety again. All of that process was completely hidden to our eyes until the final scene when Kate Winslet suddenly started to cry and turned back. But I don't blame the cast. why? The answer is obvious, because they didn't have the chance to show us those things, there was no a single plot which indicates a game change. there were too many opportunities but non of them have been used correctly in the matter of story telling. for example, at the beginning, after being attacked by the mountain lion, a flashback memory, an emotional dialogue around the concepts of safety and love even an emotional reaction could be a good start to prepare our mind for the next events as a small but powerful starter. There were more opportunities both to start and then for development of the emotional connection but non of them have been used properly. I Strongly refuse to accept that a brilliant talent like Kate Winslet is not capable of performing an emotional scene. That is ignoring the main problem I think. The main problem was directing and the scenario and for that I can say this movie was such a waste of great talents and story.",The Mountain Between Us

111,thirtyfivestories,Proximity is Lord,5,13 October 2017,"Storms have zero sympathy, and those left stranded by them revert to rash measures. Alex has an aisle to walk down tomorrow, a bride traveling abroad to capture images for magazines. Ben has an operating room to step into tomorrow. Both, a full country away from their destinations. The stakes of love and live are tussled by rough weather that ground their commercial aircraft taxi.Alex's connections in the photojournalism world lead her to a shady private hanger off of the tarmac. Her eavesdropping on Ben's flight desk pleading has roped him into this under-the-table fare. Some phony brand of fate has linked them in this cramped fuselage.The rogue pilot, Walter, has an arrogant charm that makes more promises than any one person can keep. A musky air of foreboding fills the cabin and his dog serves as impromptu flight attendant. The homey feel of the twin turbine bird frees Alex's spirit, but Ben is preoccupied with the 10-year-old life that will be in his hands sooner than expected.Disaster cradles the plane and brings it to a premature landing. Casualties are quickly calculated, and now the events of the passenger maybe postponed indefinitely. A surgeon begins to work overtime, and a photographer starts collecting obituary shots. As diverse of a pairing as possible, Alex and Ben become representatives of anatomical powers. Ben speaks for the brain and the logical capacities that studies survival with cold calculation. Alex champions the heart and the gut instincts that account for intangible breaks of fortune. Their perspectives grow more inline as their stomach deplete and their temperature plummets. Soon they find peaceful coffins in themselves, and turn to affection to warm their blistered souls. Strangers transform into confidants, and final amendments spew out over strategic cuddling.Death binds us much more effectively than love. Love only works when all is well. When existence teeters on a cliff ledge, the nearest soul becomes your strongest passion. This compassion is cooked with anger and resentment, cooled with finality and surrender. A sensual secret is buried in the mountains and you have to taste death to discover it.",The Mountain Between Us

114,jaapeelman,Beautiful nature with utter nonsense,6,26 December 2017,"I was curoius about this movie due to the plane-crash in it. As I have been a professional F/E and pilot for almost 30 years now I expected the crash to be typical Hollywood-nonsense and by God, they did not let me down!
This pilot flies off without checking any weather-chart and at the time of departure the weather is great but en-route it changes. Hey, what a surprise! Then the pilot gets a stroke and without someone flying the a/c in goes in a spiral-dive and seemingly hit a mountain-top which tears of the tail of the a/c but it keeps on flying. Well, if you really hit a mountain it is end of story and there is no airplane that keeps on flying without its tail-section. When that happens you go down like a pile of stones but in this movie the a/c keeps on gliding with both engines off but luckily the propellers have placed themselves miracously in the feathering position. This whole plane-crash is one big pile of nonsense. But okay, nothing which is produced in Hollywood is realistic but it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The leading characters are both survival-champions and Kate keeps on going despite her sour leg, the cold, the lack of food etc. Totally unrealistic and the only nice things of this movie are the nature-scenery and the dog. Also the interaction between Kate and Iris are in my opinion not so bad and the ending is nice but predictable.

Winslet and Elba are compelling and poignant leads with charm and chemistry to spare, the romance is teased out in leisurely fashion but convincing when the film finally commits to it, and it's easy and satisfying to root for our hero and heroine to get together by the end.Best of all: if in real life you know how unstable a relationship with these foundations would likely be, in the world of the film you don't have to worry about it.

I believe he's truly one of the most gifted actors working right now. Never been a huge Winslet fan. I was too young to care when Titanic came out and even when I got older..the super sappy never appealed to me. However I really enjoyed her in this.Now I've scene at least two butt hurt baby d**k white boys on here complaining about how they don't want to see an Interracial relationship. My guess is they're Russian hackers who have never seen this film and are only trying to stoke some racial arguments. A true racist wouldn't have seen this film in the first place and moreover wouldn't come on here to comment.Now back to the review: I loved Idris and Kate together and their chemistry was clear as day. BUT--the script did them a true disservice. It was weak and generic. This is now the second time i feel Elba has been shortchanged by the material. The Dark Tower was worse than awful and I can;t believe his reps read this and convinced him to do it. Seriously man, fire your team!

117,krice23,Idris & Kate Rock this Film; Make It Theirs!!,8,17 June 2018,"I rated this an 8 despite not being a fan of plane wreck in the wilderness survival movies. 
All I can say is thank god all those other actors dropped out because Idris Alba and Kate Winslet Made this movie work and separated it from other survival films! Okay, I know that's an obvious statement since they basically play the entire movie alone. What I really mean to say is they each bring something uniquely ""them"" to these roles that, I'm sorry, even though I like the work of some of the other actors originally cast, they just don't possess and would never share the chemistry that Idris & Kate exude! 
Really, Is there Anything Winslett can't play? And I don't care what anybody says, I believe, as does anyone I've queried, Idris would make the Perfect next 007. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm in no hurry to get rid of Craig, he's breathed new life back into the role, and claimed his rightful place amongst the Best Bonds ever! But he also brought a common man, no holds barred, not afraid to get his hands dirty, approach to the role that perfectly paves the way for someone with Elba's special talents. And people, let us not forget this man's charm, beauty, & downright seething sex appeal! 
Enough said; I believe I've made my point. 
So, it is with a smile on my face that I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie to you.

Will you survive? Chances are if ""The Mountain Between Us"" was your in-flight movie, you're already off to a rocky start. Idris Elba is a surgeon and Kate Winslet is a woman desperate to make her wedding. When their flight is canceled they both charter a private plane only to be marooned in the Utah Wilderness after admittedly what is a heart-stopping plane crash. With very little food and Winslet's leg injured, there's numerous things that could plague both these people and without question the first thirty minutes are the strongest, especially when considering wildlife hunting for food.Winslet going all Liam Neeson in ""The Grey"" is interesting on its own. The breathtaking view of the snowy mountain wilderness surrounding them on all sides is something to behold as well and the cinematography couldn't be any better. Just at one point these two will have to start moving if they want to survive and while both are great actors, watching them walk in the snow for more than an hour feels like we're the ones trapped and in need of rescue. He's dubbed as the logical one, she is the one wiling to put it all on the line for survival. Funny how the one dimensional characterizations their given are just enough to tell us that one probably won't survive without the other. Otherwise their basically in a movie based solely on the worst of romance novel clichés. You can see her mentally undressing him with her eyes even as she appears to be freezing to death. Later there's a cheeseball sex scene in front of a roaring fire. And if that's not enough, the last act seems to be more interested in whether these two will fall in love than whether or not they survive, which I guess would placate the romance novel fans if by this point the movie had bothered to forge any kind of connection between the two characters other than sob stories and minor sob backstory. Plus the last time a survival story involving ice, cheesy romance, and Kate Winslet came into play, it did not turn out well for her signicant other so I started to worry for Elba's safety just a bit.

When the characters were struggling for survival, they didn't seem to be suffering, more like their woollen scarf was a bit itchy. When they should have been ecstatic they were sullen. It's not that the characters races didn't match it's just that were not compatible people regardless - poor casting.What's worse is it all seemed fairly believable until about 30 minutes in, then something totally impossibly unlikely happens which then makes you totally lose it with this movie, everything becomes undermined somewhat from that point on.I feel like the director and writer were trying to sell the idea that nature is evil and wants to kill you, but the cinematographer felt the opposite.

134,travishouze,"Like Any ""Mountain"", It Just Feels Unmovable",5,6 October 2017,"Some films have left me speechless. Not simply because their execution was unlike anything I've seen in the past, or opened my eyes to a story so insane thinking someone came up with this idea, but speechless cause there's so little to say about it as the film doesn't ask any new or interesting questions. The Mountain Between Us is that kind of film despite having 2 very talented actors I respect in this romantic drama.The story begins with Idris Elba as a doctor rushing to Baltimore for surgery and Kate Winslet off to get married to her fiancé and they agree to work together to get to their destinations. However, their plane crashes into the middle of the mountains and leaves them stranded with only a golden retriever and their wits to find shelter and keep one another from falling apart.Kate and Idris both give committed performances even through the harsh weather conditions displayed. The cinematographer sets up some pretty beautiful shots of the mountains and the scale and distance the actors are from any form of civilization so that was something I appreciated in a post ""every month a CGI fest blockbuster"" world. Sadly the compliments end here.What kills the film is it's SO UTTERLY PREDICTABLE. If you have seen any romantic film ever, you know what will happen. The dialogue is void of any psychological questions of dealing with a stranger alone for weeks despite the film feels like it's only 6 days tops. Not as viewer did I feel they went through harsh conditions as Kate's hair the entire time looked freshly curled.The Mountain Between Us on the trailer felt what could have been a solid survival film, but instead got a corny and sometimes boring romantic drama. Outside of one genuine jump scare that truly surprised me, the film just feels lost in trying to be a romantic movie and survival movie at the same time with very little chemistry to weave them together.",The Mountain Between Us
135,sadie-mck,Much better than expected,8,2 September 2018,"I wasn't expected much but I was pleasantly surprised.
 Two disparate strong willed characters stranded on a mountainside in winter sounds like the plot of a cheesey romantic vehicle. With lesser actors it would've been just awful. But winslet and Elba were really well matched in terms of not over acting or trying to do each other. 
The pacing of the plot is slow and steady with moments of real tension. The conflict between them is believable for too headstrong characters in life threatening situations. It's an intelligent grown up film.",The Mountain Between Us

137,Lalpera,I just finished watching world's eighth and ninth wonders!,3,17 October 2017,"The worst damage to the movie is done by the totally unbelievable events and things appear in the storyline. It should be the eighth wonder in the world for a person whose leg is so damaged to walk hundreds of miles in freezing snow and finally reach a human settlement. Funnily, they find all the necessary medicine, moonboots, surgical equipment and all that in the plane or wasted snow land! And food never seemed to be a problem to survive weeks while they start fires in a flicker in that freezing icy land ! Haha How Kate kills a snow tiger with a flare gun like an Olympian best shot is next to the ninth wonder! How childish if the director thought we were gonna believe all that crap? Only silver lining- the music of Ramin Djawadi that was so soothing and beautiful. The cadence between the piano and cellos so amazingly captures the fluttering melancholy of lonely and isolated souls struggling to survive. And the cinematography is equally beautiful catching few of the best snow landscape shots I've ever seen in a movie. Editing is smart and credible too.Unfortunately totally wasted talents from Kate and Idris, both excellent actors who struggle to give the best but fail miserably due to a weak storyline and a screenplay.",The Mountain Between Us

It's not groundbreaking cinema, but it isn't a heap of trash either. I think the movie was definitely drawn out at parts and it seemed as if the cold atmosphere of the snowy mountains laid the foundation for the at-times cold relationship between our two only characters.I gave the movie an 8 because I feel that it did the best it could with what it had. Backstories could have been developed more strongly which would have made the audience feel the connection between the two more efficiently. I felt that Idris Elba has yet again solidified himself as one of the most underrated gentlemen actors of our age. Someone needs to give this man a career defining role. Other than that, you have two acting juggernauts who are prancing around a snowy mountainside just as delicately as they prance around an otherwise cold and unengaging script. In movies like this, dialogue is everything, and sadly, it felt lacking at times. There was an opportunity to give off Richard Linklater emotions with the movie and it just feel a bit flat.Nothing to rush to your theater for, but not a waste of time.8/10",The Mountain Between Us
140,taranpannu01,The Mountain Between Us (2017),6,14 October 2017,"I didn't go into this film expecting much, the reviews have trashed it and I really just went to see Idris Elba. Was I pleasantly surprised. No. Was it as bad as everyone said. No. It was decent with some flaws that kind of just add up which takes away from the whole story.Idris Elba really holds the film, even if the whole story is a bit formulaic. Elba gets mad at Winslet, Winslet gets hurt, Elba helps Winslet and he falls a little more for her did get a bit old and it was obvious that by the end after Winslet got hurt a lot, it would be her turn to help Elba.Cinematically this is a very good looking film, the sound, cinematography and music all elevate the film.Kate Winslet is a little bit iffy, at times her in pain moans were a bit to extreme and sounded comically sexual.The plane crash and the first 40 minutes are actually very good and entertaining, the story then goes back to that formula that I had previously mentioned.This is very minor but Dermot Mulroney just looked bored.The ending needing a lot of trimming in the editing room. Too many possible endings.Look this isn't a film that's going to change your life and to be honest I'm surprised I'm being this fair and not harsh. This is a film about Idris Elba and Kate Winslet getting trapped in the snow and eventually falling in love. It's enjoyable for some mindless viewing. What more do you want?",The Mountain Between Us

I bought into the story & left the cinema with a smile on my face. A girl could drown in Idris Elba's eyes!I don't understand the terrible reviews on IMDb. The acting was not terrible, nor was the story-line. Critics seem to expect a romantic survival film to be somehow cerebral. Most movies are just regurgitated ideas, so the hate here is undeserved in my opinion. Maybe these are the same reviewers that thought La La Land deserved all those Oscars?

That is all down to their amazing talent.Unfortunately I never really believed they were in imminent danger of dying. I believed the actors fear of dying but the dangers faced just seem so..... zzzzz. The storytelling could definitely have been improved.Likewise I wasn't a particular fan of the last 20 mins or so. Got the ending I wanted but just not impressed with how we got there.

145,ssaftler,"Good premise, terrible execution",4,16 October 2017,"The premise of the movie, two ordinary people managing to survive in the Rockies in the middle of winter, seemed to be an engaging, potentially intriguing movie. Right from the start, however, the ""what the heck"" moments began to come at you faster than you could deal with them.To begin with, you are at a large airport that is shutdown for weather, when the sky is still blue and the sun is out. Yes, a storm is approaching, but still. I've flown out of airports in much worse weather conditions before. Nevertheless, a twin engine private plane is allowed to take off with no flight plan, explained away by Beau Bridges since they were flying ""VFR"", meaning the skies were clear enough to navigate with no help. Huh??? Luckily for him, Beau Bridges' character dies in the crash so he's mercifully out of this hot mess at this point.Once they crash on the mountain, the lead characters trudge through snow, ice and whatever in winter gear that magically appeared in the downed plane. They did this, apparently over a number of weeks, yet when they took off their coats, his hair and beard always appeared as well groomed as the day they left, and her hair always looked like it had been freshly washed and coiffed.At this point, I kinda just went along for the ride, just to see who survived. That, and the dog, who was the real star of the show!Can't recommend this movie. I don't know if the director of this had much (or any) previous experience, but the attention to detail is so bad I almost found myself laughing at the incongruities.",The Mountain Between Us
146,Lone_Mh,hilarious!,2,30 September 2019,"Everything is bad about this movie!! The storyline goes really fast and is not worked on, even to attract the audiences a bit! It just follows some sorts of unlikely cliches and as a survival drama(if it can be considered in this genre) it has absolutely no any real challenges which the characters may face them at all and all kinds of sudden events get into an easy way to solve! The characters have no any issues for firing or warming and such, everything is accessible...!
And about the romance parts; Gosh! They're Hilarious!!!! They've only arranged in an artificial approaching line to get to a pleasant; but hilarious result...

There was always an A-grade shelter around the corner, and always a strong fire on. As a viewer it felt like watching a pointless holiday spent by two people who pretend to like each other.Kate Winslet's acting is especially terrible and I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Idris Elba is delivering an OK performance but simply can not save the movie from a poor co-lead and a terrible execution of the plot.",The Mountain Between Us

I really liked this movie of two disparate strangers suddenly cast into a crisis where they are entirely dependent on one another for survival and to get to safety. Elba and Winslet performed magnificently in this movie about the rigors of surviving in the mountainous winter wilds when their pilot has the poor manners to die of a heart attack and crash their plane. It was really tacky of him. The dog, unnamed throughout, really deserves an Academy Award too. I don't want to give away spoilers, so I won't, but it's not only a movie about them surviving, but a movie about what these two find inside themselves to hold onto. Wonderfully done, but (I know the movie ran a bit long by today's standards) they really should've fleshed out more than they did in the last half-hour of this one. It's well worth the time to see it!PTH",The Mountain Between Us
153,garyprosser1,Promises much but left me cold.,5,20 July 2019,"I gave it a go, I can say that. I held up my part of the bargain but sadly, this film didn't. Is it a survival film? Sort of. Is it a love story? It thinks it is. Is it any good? Not really.Spoilers Ahead!With two heavyweight talents like Winslet and Elba, you'd think you'd be in for a cracker but from the very outset, both stars are let down by a script that offers little in the way of depth, action or heart. Maybe films like The Revenant spoiled us but during the survival part (after the ludicrous plane crash when the pilot has a stroke), one never FEELS the hardship and the suffering Alex and Ben are enduring as they face life on a frozen mountain, hopelessly lost. It's never tense and it's never dramatic because at no point are you in any doubt at all that they'll make it out. It's not that kind of film and it doesn't pretend to be.Don't forget, these two have just crashed into a mountain in an out of control plane and yet despite a few cuts and abrasions and one bad leg, they're fine. Okay, Alex is in worse shape but people have suffered more injuries on a drunken night out and besides, Ben is a surgeon (that's handy) and he can fix her without any equipment at all. He even stitches the dog up (cos it's sugary Hollywood and dogs can't die) with a needle and thread that came from nowhere (apparently, surgeons travel with all the kit). He's the manly hero, she's the fragile woman who keeps snooping on his phone when his back is turned to find out about his personal life. Cinema can do better than this.All the while, Alex and Ben are chalk and cheese; two characters who clash at every turn. And then they fall in love. Of course they do. It's blatant from the bloody outset and the film makes no attempt to even try to pretend otherwise. There is no reason why they should fall in love; she is on her way to her own wedding when the plane crashes and he is mourning his wife.They've only just met and yes, people can meet and fall in love at first sight but here, it's inexplicable. Would they have fallen in love if they were stuck in a lift or trapped on a Ferris wheel? Is it the situation that brings them not just closer but all the way to true love? If so, surely that would pass when they made it to safety but no, they stay in love despite the fact that neither has any redeeming qualities to speak of (again, blame the script).If you want a great survival film, watch The Revenant, Alive, Jungle, Castaway, etc. If you want a love story, watch any other love story. If you want a film without drama, comedy, heart, suspense or anything else, watch this. I watched it because a) it's only on Now for 5 more days and b) Winslet and Elba are a formidable cast.

155,gimmeDV,A light disaster flick - that dosen't push too many buttons,7,27 May 2018,"I'm a fan of diasaster flicks, no matter how filled with cliches and cheese - so that was the first draw of the film for me. However, the poor reviews kept me from seeing the film in theatres. When I finally picked up a blu-ray copy of it, I went in skeptical - and was actually surprised that I wasn't rolling my eyes all that much. The movie gets into the main conflict, the plane crash, really quickly (6-7 minutes in), and then sort of unravels what we need to know about the two main characters from there. Admittedly, I think it would have played a little better if these two main characters hadn't fallen in love. That whole storyline seemed like a manifestation of the two of them possibly relying on each other to survive, rather than there being some real connection. If these were two real people, I probably would say that they may have decided to date after the ordeal they went through, but wouldn't make it to the altar. I believe that many of the bad reviews for the movie come out of there being such high stakes for a movie like this one because of the weight of the two stars - and my own theory that filmmaking these days, especially dramas, are lauded because of how far they push the limits of our viewing. Because our world has become sour, we seek characters who are in extremely worse situations then we are to actually be affected by them. Personally, I find them hit-or-miss, and more times than not, exhausting to watch. That's not what I'm looking for when I sit down to enjoy a film. That said, that's what made me like The Mountain Between Us. Even with the survival story line, the movie as a whole is pretty light. There aren't a lot of overly gory wounds to deal with, or people who are dramatically sick, or some sort of epic blow up between two characters. It's an original adult film that is a rarity these days. Actually enjoyable to watch without needing to put viewers through the wringer in order to make its point.",The Mountain Between Us

157,dermobreen,"""Alive Actually""",4,15 October 2017,"""Alive Actually"" would have been a better title for this film as it is both a survival thriller in the vein of Alive and a love story à la Love Actually. It's a thriller/chick-flick – a strange mish-mash of genres that actually works.Director Hany Abu-Assad brings us the story of two strangers (Ben, played by Idris Elba and Alex, played by Kate Winslet) who, after surviving a plane crash in the snow- covered Colorado Rockies must forge a connection to survive the extreme elements. When they realise help is not coming, they are forced to embark on a perilous journey across the wilderness while learning about themselves and each other along the way.Based on a book by Charles Martin, this film fails to bring the realities of either aspect: survival and romance, to a satisfying conclusion. The romantic element is predictable and leaves no surprises. The survivalist aspects bring some suspense and wince-out- loud moments, there is never a feeling of dread or that they might not make it. What I found interesting, from a psychological aspect is how such an experience might draw to people together, akin to Stockholm Syndrome. Because the characters are very two-dimensional, I found myself trying to understand their motivation and what might draw them together other than a basic need to support each other. Both Kate and Idris give it everything they've got but the chemistry is not there.The other thing that concerned me with the film was the sense of time. We are told that three weeks have gone by but it only feels like three days. Plus Kate's hair is perfectly curled every morning.The only positive note in this tired trope-filled movie is that they did not eat the dog.Wait for it to come on TV.2 out of 5",The Mountain Between Us

Idris Elba displayed the full range of all of the wonderful and honorable things inherent in any man of morale fiber and quality. When the script clearly showed that Kate Winslet's character was engaged to be married the line was drawn as to her expected behavior to her betrothed. Mr. Elba's heroic and honorable behavior had anyone in the audience so to speak definitely rooting for them both to make it. When she betrayed her fiancé and started going after him at that juncture in the movie, it ruined the whole film and made her character weak and less honorable. Who could blame him for acting upon her advances, plus he was a lonely and wounded man but as to the script it would have been so much more heroic if they had maintained the boundaries her engagement mandated. It diluted the whole survival thing and was predicable and detracted from the most honorable performance as a gentleman he had achieved in the audiences mind. Ruined the whole movie as she became weak, and he became less of the gentleman he had achieved. Still had great empathy for his character and his loss but the script made her so called ""Love"" for her fiancé a joke and made her less of a character to root for.",The Mountain Between Us

175,JoelPeterBrown,'THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US' Character within the Characters Movie Trailer Review,8,3 March 2020,"It's better to weather the storms of life together, then to roll solo; for two can stand back-to-back and conquer.A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration through a story that follows two travelers in their quest to survive the wilderness, while braving harsh weather conditions, and fierce mountains; to teach with a metaphor about overcoming the challenges of life with an accountability.With this, it make you think if the plane you're boarding will make you take a risk on the journey that'll bring you out of your comfort-zone; to a place of trusting the people and plan with getting you on track to your destination.This trailer has a captivating musical score with a striking scenic design.The performance seems strong and well-rounded. Kate Winslet and Idris Elba puts real emotions into their characters.The characters are interesting and believable with a ton of character strengths on display. Like perseverance, bravery, prudence, leadership, teamwork, wisdom, knowledge, creativity, zest, humanity, kindness, social intelligence, self-regulation, and hope.The trailer looks like it will take you to see a thrilling movie, with a twist that hits with a question - that'll get you to think twice about facing a tragedy alone - 'what if your life depended on a stranger?'The production quality is vibrant throughout; both cinematography, instrumentally and performance-wise.Overall, the trailer tells an uncommon and relatable, and I think it's strong survival story that one would love to go see in a theater for the full movie experience.",The Mountain Between Us

Acting is good, scenery is beautiful, great story, the biggest problem I had was the chemistry. Both Kate Winslet and Idris Elba do a great job acting, they just don't seem to click when it comes to romance. The two previous couples who were supposed to act together would likely have not been much better, (Michael Fassbender and Margot Robbie) yuck. This movie would have done much better with two leads that had some romantic chemistry. The story slowly develops and so does the characters need for each other that when it finally comes to a climax it feels forced. Sadly it was filmed in Canada and not in Utah where the story takes place in the book. I still enjoy the film but every time I watch it I keep thinking, imagine if they used these two actors, or these other two actors, (i.e. Insert your favorite Hollywood couple). Proof that when you do a romance film you truly need actors that click, bring that chemistry, and makes us root for them to be together. I think that's why I remembered the movie differently.

1. Everything about this movie is very predictable. If you guess the movie after seeing the first 10 minutes, you will probably have most of the things right. It gets boring very fast cause of this.
2. The ending is so cliche that you want to vomit. This only happens in movies (often also), not in real life.
3. Kate Winslet character is SOO unlikeable. Why does he even fall in love with her? All she does is nagging, being negative, saying its no point cause they will die anyways, snooping around in his things. She doesnt have any strong likeable traits.

203,Cynical_Moi,Doesn't quite reach classic heights,7,24 October 2021,"A survival come romance movie, this does not quite reach epic proportions on either level, but nevertheless is solid and engaging.For such a genre we need spectacular landscapes and we get them: the mountain terrain is beautifully shot whilst the sense of isolation is properly disturbing. Anybody with experience in winter mountaineering will recognize the seriousness of being stranded in such a region, and the obstacles and challenges the two characters face are convincing, such as sheer gorges barring the route you need, uncrossable watercourses and the danger of skidding clean off the mountain (in the absence of possessing crampons or an ice axe!). As one with such experience, however, I was not quite convinced by the sheer bitter cold and exhaustion they would be feeling. Perhaps, they just looked too damned good - hell, hasn't WInslet aged sexily! - when they ought to be half-starved and dehydrated. You can't feed off snow by the way; your mouth would ulcerate and you get next to no water from a mouth-full of snowball.Any shortcomings in the convincingness of either survival or romance elements was certainly not the actors' fault. They are class acts, as we well know, and did an earnest job with the material they were given here. I felt Idris was slightly bland, but then that fitted the role of stressed-out surgeon carrying personal heartbreak. His anxiety over falling in love was credible.Their trek to reach safety was engaging if not somehow 'grim' enough - perhaps it was lack of musical atmosphere - and the chemistry/conflict between them just a little too gentile for such intense circumstances. So, not high drama and high emotion, but we can't be sure how it will turn out for either of them (or the 3 of them rather) and there's plenty of entertainment and charm - and what a cute dog!",The Mountain Between Us

The word 'alive' comes up quite a bit, in a none too natural way, to offer a big signpost to the metaphor of the story, in case it hadn't occurred to you that the couple's fight for survival was a parallel of their struggle to feel alive in their emotional lives.

Rarely do you find a suitable adaptation. Sometimes you'll find a not-so-great adaptation but a great film anyway. This one was neither. When I watched the trailer I knew right away that it was going to be different from the book (which by the way is one of the best books I've ever read). But how dramatically different I was not prepared for. They changed the personality of the characters, they changed the names, they changed their back stories... basically it was just a stand-alone movie. It had one similar plot- getting stranded in the mountains. Otherwise, not the same at all. As far as the movie itself, as a lover of both Winslet and Elba, I was pretty disappointed. I didn't like them, I didn't like their portrayal of the characters, I just honestly overall disliked the whole movie.

Pure disappointment. The doc in the book was so charming and romantic, but the doc in the movie is like a totally different guy.

I couldn't begin to count the number of movies ever made about this in all those permutations but to me this particular film was more of a TV drama than a cinematic blockbuster.

From the beginning of the movie, everything about the book was changed and definitely not for the better.
Kate Winslet must have demanded some serious script changes to be the lead actress as her character in the movie is the smart, strong, take charge person who saves them both while Idris Elba's character is the weak, stupid character. To make matters worse, there is NO chemistry between these two actors and it even comes across like they actually hate each other off camera. Kate even manages to stay fat while being stranded in the wilderness with no food.
As I said, every thing about the book was changed...the main characters, the pilot, even the dogs character was changed.

Real love lifes are like her, messy, mismatchs and not at all like Hollywood. They have hurt, power and imperfect beauty too. Its just not always the overt, obvious type. It has bad timing. The best I can say about Idris is he can match her, he is full on strong enough. If you can't stay with it, set your netflix to kids only and keep clicking romance - I don't have the heart to disabuse you of that fairytale.

222,redpaperweight,"Complementary sexes, humanity & adaptation (sort of)",6,22 November 2017,"Let me start by saying that the movie was a joy to watch, mainly also because the scenery was beautiful (and yes I also mean the leading actors, Kate Winslet is still quite something). Right from the very beginning when they were sitting in the plane, me and my friend looked at each other and were like ""they are so gonna do it"". During the rest of the movie we were like..now?..no..NOW?...still no. Anyhow..it was great when the sex-scene finally happened!While I have not read the book this movie is based on I must say that well...I missed the whole ""survival"" thing. If you compare the movie to even controlled survival shows like Bear Grylls does, they really got a break on the hardships and setbacks they had to face. They still looked rather well groomed. The weather was way too calm in my opinion, up so high in the mountains you would expect at least one day of storm. Of course they had to adapt to the weather, create a splint, a sled, make fires, cook puma, pee in a dog food bowl and most of all adapt their brain as to initiate immense will power. Yet it still didn't feel as if they really had suffered enough, it should have been worse (this feels weird to ask for). Two ""survival"" things really bothered me were: 1. them eating snow...that is something you do NOT wanna do because it decreases your core temperature really fast. I mean I understand they did it as they were just thrown in the situation with no experience but there were no noticeable negative effects, no ""punishment"" as to say. 2. Ben always seems to be cold yet manages to stay alive with barely any insulation layers, compared to Alex, and when Alex falls in the lake she later on shows no signs of hypothermia, more so with Ben even leaves her wet clothes on..Enough of this complaining, onto some more positive aspects! I really loved and enjoyed watching how both Ben and Alex complement each other nearly perfectly, they contradict each other yes but they find compromises and as such shape their positive outcome together. It shows how both sexes have a role to play (I won't dare to touch upon what these roles might be): when Ben wants to stay in the plane forever he is pushed by Alex to get moving, which saved them. When Alex wants to jump down a cliff to save time and daylight, Ben convinces her to stop and think first, which saves her. These little things are always inspiring to see. It goes to show that even though the male might be the one suffering more to protect and support the female, he simply could not have survived on his own. Alex needed a man to take care of her and Ben needed a female to take care of him (mentally). The dog is quite a nice aspect to the story, it may be classic in the sense that it is overused but it still added a nice touch. A touch of humanity so to say, that even is the worst of situations you still have to care for those who can't really help themselves.Summed up: Beautiful people and landscapes (dog was pretty awesome too).

224,neil-hargreaves,Unbearable unconvincing and indefensible,3,22 October 2017,"When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediately turned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on this site.I imagined that (like myself) there would be floods of complaints about the wooden acting, the ease at which the main characters just sauntered through their 'ordeal' as though they were just nipping to the shops for a pint and a dozen eggs, and thought that it would be universally hated.I read one review today that said this was the worst movie they'd seen in the last thirty years.Well I sat through Dads Army, I just about managed to stay awake during the Absolutely Fabulous movie but even those two flops were more convincing than this film.What is supposed to be a high drama survival movie is a bland, dull, uninspiring walk through the snow for an hour and half. Even the moments of peril are dealt with in as short a time as possible with no fear or risk involved whatsoever. The romance is unconvincing to me. Before anything happened between our two lead characters I was thinking to myself that these guys clearly didn't like each other at all during the filming of this movie. There was little to no chemistry, the acting was woeful (from two of movies finest actors supposedly) and it all just seemed tired and as if nobody on the set wanted to be there.The story's climax isn't a climax at all. It's just a sudden give-up on what had come before.I have to agree with the chap who said they'd not seen worse in a long long time. This was most definitely the weakest of all the movies I've seen in years. My advice to anyone considering it is as always go and make your own mind up. But don't say I didn't warn you.",The Mountain Between Us

228,jon-67-958809,The viewer needs to share the director's vision,7,16 December 2019,"Over and over again I come across films where the viewing public seem to fail to grasp the vision of the director. This is one such film.I've seen criticisms in reviews such as ""only 8 minutes to get to the mountain"". The point is, the two characters are strangers to each other, and likewise they are strangers to us. If their characters were better developed, we'd know too much about them. Instead their characters are unfolded through the story, in a way which lets us discover who they are at roughly the same rate as they're discovering each other as people, and as survival companions.And as for ""the last 25 minutes were unnecessary"", I disagree. The story needs to slow down, once they're back in civilisation trying to get on with the everyday lives they lived before. But after that shared experience, things seem empty. You can't rush this part of the story, or you simply won't tell the story. Thankfully the director allowed the characters to tell their stories, to show us that life couldn't simply continue as before, that something was missing for both of them.As for an unrealistic descent from the mountain... not really. It generally is a matter of finding a navigable path and getting to lower altitudes, then finding shelter, fresh water and food. Perhaps the least realistic part was eating snow to get water - it's really not advisable as your main source, though it was only shown the once.Great characterisation and acting from both Winslet and Elba.

231,daphnexulu,A story of Love and Survival.,7,24 December 2017,"Although lacking the ""oompth"" to succeed my expectations, The Mountain Between Us is a well-rounded entertaining Drama.
The chemistry between Winslet and Elba is undeniable; they look good together as they struggle to survive the elements, whist bouncing off each other to craft compelling scenes for the audience.
However, the romantic element of the film is ultimately its downfall. The plot is steady and the film is well paced as the characters slowly grow more fond of one another. Yet, The Mountain Between us suddenly moves up a gear when the characters plummet into love, just as they plummeted from the sky.
The romantic element of this movie would have complimented the survival nature if it had been more balanced throughout the film.

Despite these things the movie is really well done and show us breathtaking landscapes, the tie that is created between the characters is completly predictable as well.

I can't say much more than has already been said, but there were some errors the size of a Mack truck in this movie that have not been pointed out.1. There is a storm severe enough to cause commercial airplanes to be grounded, yet a small private plane can fly.2. Alex is getting married the next day, Ben is doing surgery the next day, yet they are both across the country.3. Conveniently for the plot, the pilot doesn't file a flight plan.4. The plane crashes in the mountains, yet the passengers survive with minor injuries. I'll forgive this one, only because without it, the movie would be ten minutes long.5. The damsel in distress injures her leg, and conveniently, Ben is a surgeon.6. They crash in the Rocky Mountains at an altitude that's above timberline, at the end of December, without proper clothing and food, and don't die of hypothermia.7. Alex tells Ben to use her camera with a telephoto lens to get a close up view around them. It is a rangefinder camera, and thus the viewfinder doesn't enlarge the view.8. Ben slides several hundred feet down a snow slope, and is stopped by hitting a conveniently placed low rock ridge which stops him from going over a cliff, yet doesn't break both his legs.9. Alex falls through ice into a stream, yet is not carried downstream so that Ben can fish her out.10. They finally find a cabin, which was built and furnished (including a piano) with no road near it.11. Ben steps in a bear trap. It's possible that a trapper neglected to pick up the trap, but not likely. Bears are hibernating that time of the year.On the plus side, there is adventure, romance, and some fantastic scenery.

There wasn't anything convincing about the character and the situation they are in. Everything was conveniently thrown into the scene. Two good looking people, a character who can do almost everything, a lovable dog, unlimited food apparently, unlimited fire, an abandoned cabin with great loot (a syringe of all things...). The survival aspect is basically non-existent according to how the movie was marketed. They never had to build shelter in the snow, never had to try to hunt for anything (the dog did 1 time. 1 time...).

Warm winter clothes (jackets anyway) and thick blankets magically appear and somehow get carried with an apparently almost endless supply of butchered cougar meat,in small packs that themselves disappear at times.

252,thesuspenseisterrible,SUPERB acting in above average survival drama,7,27 November 2017,"The Mountain Between Us is a very rare kind of film in where it succeeds - versus where it is a bit of a letdown. Also quite rare these days is a film shot in any kind of mountainous wilderness (very little FX here) where the star is not Liam Neeson saving his daughter from ravenous wolves or something stupid. I liked this movie and recommend it for viewers who don't care so much about the current fashion trends of cinema and still care for a slightly old-fashioned kind of storytelling.What works:1. The cinematography in this film is excellent. Props to Mandy Walker for executing countless challenging shots that greatly added to the strength of this movie in terms of transporting us to this extreme location. I think that if the film itself were directed by Mandy Walker, it probably would have been a better film overall.2. Kate Winslet is outstanding and very gripping and committed to the role. She really is the star of her time and a marvelous actress. Idris Elba is also very good in his role, but truthfully it is Kate Winslet who shines, quite surprisingly, in a role that most actors would have failed to elevate the way she elevates it. She is always wonderful and engaging to watch on screen, but I really loved seeing her in the kind of role we have never seen her in before - it's not a very complex character - but she makes Alex interesting to watch, and as the film progresses you truly care about her more and more, and you see that strong as she is, she is very afraid of dying on this mountain. There is one particularly well written and acted scene where Ben asks Alex (a photographer) to take his picture before he dies. She tells a story about a similar situation she experienced professionally, and it's a very good scene and Winslet makes it surprisingly compelling.3. Idris Elba. He demonstrates in this film that he has what it takes to be a reliable, interesting leading man. I hope he gets more leading roles because he is very naturally masculine (lacking in many leading men these days) and has great talent to boot. 4. Chemistry. Winslet and Elba have very good chemistry. I would love to see them together again a film with an entirely different plot just to see try something new together.5. The music in this movie is very good, and it helps fight the slow pacing and repetitive moments that hurt the film.6. The ICE sequence is exciting, VERY REALISTIC, and the scenes leading up to it and following it are the best parts of the movie, where the film really finds its' flow and groove.What DOES NOT work:1. The PACING - at times it is good, but the momentum seems to stem entirely from the force of the actors great performances, despite the low energy direction.2. Hany Abu Assad is a very good director with a great vision as an artist. Here, however, he would have benefited from watching a few American films (no one does movies like this better than Americans) to get an idea for how to combine his vision of a survival story with some techniques that help pick up the pacing.3. Energy - the movie lacks energy once it starts getting overwhelmed near the end (which is the worst place to lack energy in a film like this) - although again I think the actors singlehandedly save these moments and keep the viewers engaged.4. The Ending - it's not BAD, but it should have been less cliché and more emotional than it was. The romance between Winslet and Elba, cheesy at times, was still quite believable because of their natural chemistry. They deserved a more satisfying ending because of it...instead we got staging that we've seen many times before.ALL IN ALL, I think this is a better than average film with some obvious flaws, but which is very worth seeing for 2 wonderful actors delivering performances above and beyond what the script called for. This is a film that demonstrates what star power really is - and in particular Kate Winslet shows audiences that entering her 40's she has every bit as much energy as she did in TITANIC - in fact more-so here because what she and Idris Elba do together is clearly an extremely difficult environment! KUDOS to 20th CENTURY FOX for shooting almost entirely on location, for casting actors NOT in their 20's, and for making the kind of bare bones survival drama that rarely gets made these days when every film is either a MARVEL adaptation or a cynical satire on American life.",The Mountain Between Us

264,LeftyLiebowitz,Great potential squandered with a bad script,3,11 January 2018,"There's something just uncomfortable about watching two romantic leads with no chemistry force a romance that doesn't fit. And there's something sad about great actors being wasted on a bad script. I believe that given the right words to say, Idris and Kate could get the job done. Instead, they're given an awkward, clumsy script that has them going from being irritated by each other one minute to suddenly inseparable the next. Occasionally the dialogue approaches Phantom Menace territory, like the script was a rough draft. The narrative flows from one contrived plot point to the next. They exchange romantic cliches from time to time, and just because they're struggling to survive and some time has passed, we're supposed to accept they just fell in love at some point. The world of this movie is bizarre in a way I can't quite put my finger on. After we're told 3 weeks have passed it seems like only a few days. The characters do not change or grow in any way. Later in the film they should be starving but they just don't seem phased at all; in fact they've got energy to rip each other's clothes off and make passionate love. They have been starving and hiking for weeks, at this point their muscles are being broken down in order to keep their vital organs alive. I suppose frostbite would be a problem too, but the script doesn't mention it. In fact the cold doesn't really seem to bother them much either. Honestly, it seemed like they'd be just fine the entire winter with the two cans of soup.I know people giving this movie high scores are miffed by criticisms like this - I saw one saying we shouldn't expect a romantic movie to be so cerebral. Well no, of course not. But I expect it to make sense. These are smart people; I expect them to not behave like sulky tweens during a conflict, and to be more resourceful in saving their own lives. Instead we get a brain surgeon explaining the amygdala to Alex like she's a fourth grader. Are we supposed to be impressed that she took human biology in middle school? ""The brain is in the SKULL. It's where we do our thinkies, Alex. The amygdala is where the brain makes feelings. Not in the heart, silly.""I just don't know anymore. Was the script written by an algorithm? HUMAN LOVE MOVIE.exe?

Totally wooden performances. It seemed all of Winslet's energy was focused on her comic american accent and Elba was too busy with his bravely worn smirk hiding his pain. Bridges absoutely stole the show and he was in it about 10 mins !!!

First, how did it ever get made with such an appalling script, and second, how did two big moviestars agree to appear in it? The script, with cliche after cliche, is laughable.

273,sjoye-42391,WOW! What an Amazing Movie,10,14 October 2017,"Rarely do I find myself so moved by a movie. So I was pleasantly surprised. This movie offered a lot for adults that enjoy great acting, amazing cinematography, and scripts that make us think about what it means to live, love, fear, and overcome the seemingly impossible. I found myself mesmerized by the chemistry between the two main characters and how they experienced different feelings while being present in the exact same circumstance. It's an incredibly compelling story. I don't think a love story of this kind has ever been made. As far as the bad reviews go, I'm convinced that most of the people writing bad reviews and giving low ratings, NEVER saw the movie and have an agenda. Do you remember how people reacted to the infamous interracial Cheerios commercial? Well the same thing is happening here. The truth is that the movie is excellent and should be nominated for Best Picture. I'd even see it again. The ending is one of the best I have seen.",The Mountain Between Us

275,Mystictunnel,Missed the mark,1,15 January 2018,"This movie has all the hallmarks of being great, but is a let-down. It is unconvincing in many ways. None more so than the concept of the love story between our two main leads in the conditions they find themselves in. It is not only unconvincing but completely improbable. It's plain to see what they were trying to do with this movie, but it really doesn't get there. From the writer's attempt at political relevancy with Kate Winslet's line about photographing Skin Heads/Neo Nazis to Idris Elba's character using leaking fuel to light a fire to keep warm inside the remaining part of the fuselage of the aircraft. That would have been one great smoke signal to alert rescuers right there....The End! And, the actual ending? Well, I'm sure the writer's thought this would be the great 'pay off' for the audience ,sorry to disappoint, it was just too staged, However it 'was' relevant as it was as unconvincing as the rest of the movie. On the plus side it gets 10 out of 10 for the scenery.",The Mountain Between Us

278,miguelfpinto,A movie with 1h of good scenes and 45min of boring scenes,6,8 January 2018,"A good movie until the puma appears (min 30), despite the fact that both should be dead or seriously injured after the plane crash.After that, the plot is insanely boring and nothing new happens until 1h and 20min of film. There is no character development for any of them until they hang out in the cabin. Also the dog serves no purpose in the plot other than to appeal to dog lovers.The movie fails in my opinion as well in showing the difficulty of the journey they had made. Sure, we can see that they are tired and everything but they are not looking crazily for food or water. Looking at the viewer point of view, the movie does not portrait that their lives are really in danger. I was not worried about their lives because the movie was somewhat not thrilling.After their rescue (1h and 25min), the movie is good again. The other people do not understand what they have been trough and both start to show their real personalities. A very good ending ;) Both gave their lives to save each other out there and you do not cross a person like that every day. So if you find someone like that, do not let her go.",The Mountain Between Us
279,hend_marah,Well...My favorite character was the dog,6,5 May 2018,"A very cliche..predictable unrealistic and boring movie. 
The story itself isn't very original, the approach to the story is not either. I usually like Kate Winsley's performances but this was absolutely horrible. I cant recall a single scene in the movie where I developed any genuine feelings or interactions with the characters- apart from the dog perhaps. All the characters are awkward, weird, ""straw-men"" of how we think we'd act if we were in such a situation. The script is so predictable and recycled that I found myself completing any line that whatever character started. The ending ""no comment"".

282,reby-08058,What could of been a good movie.....fall so short,1,1 September 2018,"I was disappointed. I enjoy survival movies and thought this would be a great watch with two great actors Kate Winslet and Idris Elba, but was I wrong. The first 15 minutes the actors look connected and ready to act, but after the crash they obviously realized the horrible mistake they made in accepting the badly written dialogue and clique script, and gave up, you can actually see them deflate on screen. Spoilers ahead! Despite being stranded on top of snowy mountains with falling snow and blizzards, no one is cold, you get the occasional shiver and artistically placed snow flakes on their faces but nothing real. Ben injures his side badly but manages to climb a mountain with a few huffs and puffs, Alex has a severe break of her leg but manages to hike down a mountain with little trouble or pain. They kill a mountain lion, cook it, but end up hungry a few days later, what happened to cooking and rationing the mountain lion meat? The dog is injured in the lion attack, receiving stitches but bounds in the snow the following day. They eat snow for hydration, the worse thing you can ever do, snow has to be heated to blood temperature first. The film offer no sense of danger in any form, no personal depth just dozens more of the 'wth.' moments and lots of whining. As soon as they found an abandoned cabin they have unnecessary sex, unnecessary as these two have no chemistry whatsoever. Shortly after that I walked out of the cinema. Did I miss anything.....

Yes, maybe I do live under a rock. But anyway the rock that I lived under meant I had no preconceived ideas or expectations of this movie.So my verdict... it's good, it's an easy watch whereby you can feel emotionally invested without finishing the movie feeling emotionally drained. It's intelligent enough but not demanding, however if you want to go all film club and look at the metaphors of mountains, hardened lives, broken relationships, racial and geographical differences and human relationships in the midst of hopelessness it'll keep the mind ticking over nicely. Baring in mind it's a commercial movie and yes some bits are a little Hollywood. But despite a raised brow or two and the passing thought ""as if you would..."" It is just that as you want to journey with the characters and that is where my attention lay. Which is the point, right.It's slow and sparse to capture the destitute mood and wilderness landscape and to also give the characters room to exist in real time. You learn as much about the characters as they learn about each other and probably even as much as they know about themselves.I enjoyed it and recommend giving it a watch.",The Mountain Between Us

This is not even about romance to me, but more how in a bad situation two people find out who they really are and overcome their fears. These fears are not about the snow, FYI.

318,Tiarnetaylor,"With mediocre expectations, I was still let down.",4,31 October 2017,"The Mountain Between Us is a film that expects its audience to view a dynamic story of human endurance. However, this film fails to capture any sense of attachment, or connection. Instead, it portrays a sappy cliché experience of two mismatched individuals placed in dire straits who end up finding ""love"" among dangers and personal distinctions of their circumstance.The film starts by introducing Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as desperate individuals who seek to get to their destination; no matter the cost. The irrationality of Winslet's character, and the easily obliged Idris Elba, leaves the viewers rather annoyed. This is the beginning of where the difficultly to empathize with these characters and their perilous situation.After boarding a small private plane during a severe storm with only the pilot, a dog, Alex (Kate Winslet) and Ben (Idris Elba), naturally things start to go wrong. After crashing into a mountain top in the middle of the Rockies, the pilot is no longer alive and the plane is destroyed, luckily the dog survived. The two characters face isolation, hunger, dehydration, exhaustion and even a cougar. However, Winslet and Elba work well to manage their roles and turn this banal script into something bearable.The Mountain Between Us, uses the capturing scenery to its benefit. While the script and plot can be hard to bear, the cinematography creates a spectacular setting. Accompanying the beautiful shots, the score attempts to go in hand to soar through the characters various emotions, however, this is where the success stops. The non-diegetic sound failed to grip the audience, it lacked purpose and failed to play any role of importance in the film.Winslet is an academy award winning actress, and Elba is very successful in putting on a fantastic performance, however it is not the actors who fail this film, it is the barren script that betrays them. The script does not allow any chemistry to flow between the two, and no amounts of forced intimacy can shade that fact. The repetitiveness of the plot was draining, Alex always playing the damsel, and the Dr Ben always the rescuer- this quickly became old and uninteresting.The direction was poor and unsatisfying. The trailer depicted that throughout the film the audience would be sweating on the edge of their seat, however, the film itself contained at most 3 moments of suspense, followed by a peaceful trek through the snow. As a result, the supposed time line of 3 weeks, felt more like 2 days, the only indicator otherwise was the sudden disappearance of Winslet's bruising, there was barely any character development, and to accompany this, barely any chemistry growth. This is where it was obvious the director was trying to force romance.In the last act of the film, the director seemed to focus on whether Ben and Alex would fall in love rather than whether they would survive. Which I guess would placate the romance novel fans, if by this point the film had bothered to forge any kind of connection between the two, other than sob stories, and difficult pasts. This sudden change in genre leaves the audience rather confused. If there had been signs of chemistry earlier on, then this may have worked, however, the intimate scene felt it was only used to force chemistry and was otherwise it was unnecessary. Unfortunately, because of this, their survival of the 3 weeks in the mountains became extremely dissatisfying.When the film comes to its conclusion, the plot suddenly slows down and takes more than 25 minutes to try and weave in an ending. This last act is significantly dragged on, cliché and frankly unnecessary. The dog managed to survive, and through the whole journey the 3 experienced, Ben fails to give the dog a name, leaving that specific character as such, to feel unimportant to the story.Overall, this film is very poor. Kate Winslet and Idris Elba are the saving grace with what they try and achieve with poor scripting. The cinematography leaves the audience in awe, and of course the role of the dog was primarily for an enjoyable hook to drag the viewers away from the lacking story line and boring script. Otherwise the action/drama which suddenly transformed into a sappy romance, was dull and tedious. The love story in the last 2 acts of the film was frustrating and cliché, and barely enjoyable or satisfying. The film for me is a 4/10. Purely for the gripping dog, the mediocre acting with a poor script, and the beautiful cinematography.",The Mountain Between Us

330,nick-89593,No sleigh-ride here,3,9 October 2017,"I suppose one goes to the cinema with the anticipation that ones disbelief will need to be switched off, at least for some aspects of the story. But here we asked to believe that two people and a dog survive a major air crash in the Rocky Mountains in January. The crash is graphic in its detail that, somehow, first the tail is knocked off, then a wing, before the remains slide to a halt on a convenient plateau, with petrol dripping from somewhere. I'm afraid that lazy direction pervades the film throughout, with countless more examples at every feeble plot twist. Nothing is too difficult, everything easily achieved, we are left wondering why we should bother watching to the end as, clearly, the three will make it home, overcoming the slight and predictable odds against them on the way. There was one dismally artificial twist just before redemption, involving a bear-trap, that highlighted the desperation of the writers and director to inject a little tension. The only actor that was not sleepwalking through the film was the dog(s), Beau Bridges cameo at the start was just bad, and it went downhill from there. There was no tension or chemistry between Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, the script and direction gave them no leads as to how to ramp up their dynamic. They might just as well have been cardboard cut-outs set up in front of the truly magnificent scenery. I went hoping to have an evening's entertainment in the company of two great actors, sadly they were on part throttle and the director had his foot firmly on the brake.",The Mountain Between Us

I would summarize with a few words: beautiful mountains, cold, survival, hate, love, reality.I would love to have such a dog :)",The Mountain Between Us
333,mody-98063,Really Enjoyed it,10,19 January 2018,The film is amazing and actors really did great job which blend me inside the movie maybe the final scene would go better but actors and story couldn't go any better. i didn't like the flash memory cut which was a bit cheap from the montage process but maybe due low budget or something. :-),The Mountain Between Us

It was a nice way to spend a couple of hours with loved ones.",The Mountain Between Us

346,anitavahter,Amazing movie,10,4 December 2017,"The Mountain Between Us is a romance survival adventure film. I like romantic films and I have watched a lot of them before so I guessed I would like that one too, and I was right. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot is very gripping and serious but it had some humor also. It stars Idris Elba as a surgeon and Kate Winslet as a journalist, who survive a plane crash with a dog, and are stranded in High Uintas Wilderness with injuries and harsh weather conditions. The acting was really good and I enjoyed the chemistry, that the two main characters had in the movie. I never felt bored when watching the movie because it was well paced and the locations were beautiful. Overrall The Mountain Between Us is an excellent movie. It is quite deep and moving film and I can totally recommend it, and if you're a fan of romantic dramas, you won't be disappointed.",The Mountain Between Us

348,sulemanbacha,Worst Movie I've Ever Watched,1,27 December 2017,"Total waste of time. I think how the actors agrees these kind of plots and stories. Perhaps they dont there movies after they shoot, otherwise they would have known. The only good thing about the whole movies is the landscape. 
In all the movie, despite all the hardships, the dog seems to be quite indifferent to the whole scenario. He doesnt seem to be affected by the snow and cold while the others were on the verge of collapse. 
I dont recommend the movie. Only wastage of time. Two fancy actors in a movie doesn't always mean that it will be worth watching.",The Mountain Between Us

Two top notch actors with amazing faces in agonizing conditions, gorgeous-but-deadly scenery, intelligent dialogue & sensitive handling of issues on many profound levels -- this movie packs it all in. Winslet & Elba are fantastic together & as their solo life stories unfold, their new chapters slowly develop. Unlike many other ""survival"" films, this one has heart, romance & destiny. My husband & I loved it on a cold January night & we recommend that you light the fire, snuggle under a warm blanket & let it captivate you as well. Plus, a wonderful dog!",The Mountain Between Us

I thought the acting,despite what some may argue, was pretty darn good. There were times in the movie that had gripped the viewer into wondering what was going to happen. The movie goes from action to more of a romantic twist, and there is a sex scene that i think could have been without, but then again i can understand how maybe that scene was meant to bring the characters closer together, no pun intended. I was glad the main characters did not die nor the dog. I also was glad how they re-united the main characters at the end. Overall i was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this.",The Mountain Between Us

The chemistry between them, the way the script didn't feel like a script, and the nuances of this particular movie is what I consider a Blockbuster! Cinematography was perfect for this film. There are definitely people out there that are being harsh with their criticism and I think it's because we have become callus and insensitive to love and humane acts towards one another. This film will bring out the very essence of a person whether good or bad. It will allow you to fix your heart and your thinking. The nuances are key in this movie. I feel like most of the movie was expressed through body language and their eyes. I absolutely loved it. A must see!",The Mountain Between Us
360,vuyelwanongauza,I LOVED this movie!!!,9,10 September 2018,"Have you ever craved a love story so much that when you find it you cling on to the scenes that deliver that love on a silver platter in its most simplest form!?
In a space of two months I've watched the movie 6 times. I am most attached to the eye contact scenes; the bedside 'I almost lost you' scenes; the 'I think I'm falling for you' eyes scenes; the 'your hands are so cold let me keep them warm in my bosom' scenes. This movie makes me fall in love with love all over and over again. My favorite shot is when Ben lifts Alex (shot of his boots and her feet lifting off effortlessly). 
As you might have noticed I am not a movie critic, my critique of movies is not technical nor is it artistic. I watch movies for the inspiration, hope, laughter, fear and all kinds of emotions they tend to invoke. I have it a nine but it's a ten.",The Mountain Between Us
